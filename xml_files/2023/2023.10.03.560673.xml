The aggravating situation is despite the clinical use of over 20 antibiotics and a century-old vaccine, BCG. The gradual rise in the emergence of increasingly drug-resistant strains and HIV-TB co-infection further highlights the urgency to identify newer attractive drug targets. Throughout the course of infection, <italic>Mtb</italic> is exposed to a continuum of dynamic host-induced stresses such as severe nutrient deprivation, acidified compartments, and toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced by its resident phagosomes. In turn, <italic>Mtb</italic> produces copious amounts of actinomycetes-specific mycothiol, the major antioxidant in actinomycetes that act as the functional equivalent of glutathione, to combat ROS and RNS. In addition to mycothiol, <italic>Mtb</italic> also produces ergothioneine, a low molecular weight thiol, and several enzymes that act concertedly to subvert host-induced redox stress. The redox-active group of both mycothiol and ergothioneine is derived from L-cysteine. Hence, genes involved in the biosynthesis of L-cysteine are upregulated in the host and <italic>in vitro</italic> upon oxidative and nutritional stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Notably, an increased expression of these genes is functionally crucial, as suggested by the attenuated survival of transposon mutants of many sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis genes within the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. In mycobacteria, sulfur assimilation begins with the import of sulfate through a sulfate transporter composed of SufI.CysT.W.A. Intracellular sulfate is a substrate for APS synthase CysD.N.C, which adenylates and phosphorylates sulfate to form adenosine 5’-phosphosulfate (APS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. APS sits at a metabolic branch point; it can either be converted into sulfolipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] by consequent actions of multiple Stfs enzymes or reduced via SirA and SirH to sulfide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S1</xref>). This pathway encompasses sulfide formation from sulfate, called the sulfur assimilation pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] <italic>Mtb</italic> genome encodes three L-cysteine synthases – the canonical CysK1 and non-canonical CysM and CysK2 enzymes. Interestingly, humans do not possess L-cysteine synthases, raising the possibility of developing antibiotics without a homologous target in the host. CysK1 utilizes sulfide produced via the sulfur assimilation pathway and O-acetyl-L-serine produced from glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate to produce L-cysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] CysM, on the other hand, uses O-phospho-L-serine and a small sulfur carrier protein CysO as substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Like CysK1, CysK2 utilizes O-phospho-L-serine and sulfide as substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S1</xref>). In addition, <italic>Mtb</italic> can also synthesize L-cysteine through a reverse transsulfuration pathway from L-methionine. This example of convergent metabolic redundancy raises several interesting questions: (1) Why would <italic>Mtb</italic> rely on multiple enzymes and pathways to produce the same biomolecule? (2) Are these “functionally redundant” enzymes dispensable, or are they required at a distinct cellular space, time, and condition? (3) Is the L-cysteine pool produced through a particular pathway functionally compartmentalized? That is, is it metabolized into a specific kind of downstream thiol?</p><p id="P3">To define these unsolved aspects of <italic>Mtb</italic> L-cysteine metabolism, we sought to investigate the interplay of non-canonical L-cysteine synthases of <italic>Mtb</italic> and elucidate their roles in abetting virulence. We aimed to decipher the relative contribution of CysM and CysK2 enzymes in alleviating host-induced stresses and promoting the survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> within the host. We also investigated their role in secondary metabolism, synthesizing low molecular weight thiols, such as mycothiol and ergothioneine, and understanding the consequential effects of their deletion on the global transcriptome of <italic>Mtb.</italic> Lastly, with the help of specific inhibitors, we evaluated their potential to serve as attractive drug targets for adjunct antibiotic therapy.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Non-canonical L-cysteine synthases facilitate Mtb in combating host-induced stresses</title><p id="P4"><italic>Mtb</italic> is a generalist, a prototroph organism that can produce all 20 proteinogenic amino acids. In agreement with this notion, numerous microarray studies depict the upregulation of multiple amino acid pathways within the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], indicating a higher dependency of <italic>Mtb</italic> survival and virulence on amino acid biosynthesis and regulation. In response to infection, host immune responses often try to contain the bacillary growth by depriving the amino acid levels in intracellular environment. As a counter mechanism, <italic>Mtb</italic> has been shown to upregulate biosynthesis of amino acids such as tryptophan, lysine, and histidine to facilitate mycobacterial survival within the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. We sought to identify distinct host stresses that result in the transcriptional modulation of specific amino acid biosynthetic pathways with the help of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We compared the transcriptional profile of <italic>H37Rv</italic> (<italic>Rv</italic>) grown in 7H9-ADC with the profiles obtained when bacilli were subjected to oxidative, nitrosative, starvation, and acidic stresses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The volcano plot illustrates differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were significantly upregulated (blue) and downregulated (red) under indicated stress conditions (absolute log<sub>2</sub> Fold change&gt;1 and Padj&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S2a-e</xref>). Exposure to starvation conditions resulted in drastic transcription modulation compared with other stresses, suggesting that nutrient deficiency is the primary driver of transcriptome remodelling. In contrast, we observed the lowest number of DEGs when the bacteria were subjected to mildly acidic conditions (pH 5.5). Heat maps of normalized DEGs depict that DEG changes were comparable across biological replicates within each sample set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S2f-j</xref>). To better understand the RNA-seq results, we plotted the fold change of differentially expressed genes due to different stress conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). This allowed us to understand the expression profile of genes in all the stress conditions simultaneously, regardless of whether they were identified as differentially expressed. The data revealed that specific clusters of genes are up- and downregulated in oxidative, SDS, and starvation conditions. In comparison, the differences observed in the pH 5.5 and nitrosative conditions were limited (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P5">To further refine our understanding of the DEGs, we grouped them into various functional categories and found that genes belonging to intermediary metabolism &amp; respiration remained the most affected in all conditions highlighting their role of metabolic rewiring (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S4a</xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis of the most enriched Gene Ontology (GO) further revealed that, while, expectedly, metabolic pathways were found to be downregulated during starvation, we observed enrichment of nitrogen metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S4b</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>). SDS stress resulted in the upregulation of branched-chain amino acids/keto acids degradation pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S4c</xref>), and nitrosative stress ensued up-regulation of fatty acid and lipid biosynthetic processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S4d</xref>). There were no changes observed in mildly acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S4e</xref>). Importantly, oxidative stress resulted in significant up-regulation of genes involved in sulfur metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S4f</xref>). We further analyzed the DEGs involved in sulfur and L-cysteine metabolism across sample sets and discerned an overlap of the genes affected under two or more conditions. Interestingly, we observed upregulation of sulfate transporters genes (<italic>subI, cysT, cysW, cysA1</italic>) across multiple stresses and sulfur assimilation (<italic>cysH, cysA2, cysD, cysNC</italic>) during starvation, oxidative and SDS stress. <italic>CysK2,</italic> a non-canonical L-cysteine synthase, was found to be up-regulated during all stresses except SDS stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Thus RNA-Seq data suggest that genes involved in sulfur assimilation and L-cysteine biosynthetic pathway are upregulated during various host-like stresses in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S4</xref>). Given the importance of sulphur metabolism genes in <italic>in vivo</italic> survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] it is not surprising that diverse environment cues dynamically regulate these genes. Microarray studies have shown upregulation of genes encoding sulphate transporter upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide and nutrient starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Similarly, ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase are induced during macrophage infection and by nutrient depletion. Induction of these genes that coordinate the first few steps of the sulphur assimilation pathway indicates a probable increase in biosynthesis of sulphate-containing metabolites that may be crucial against host-inflicted stresses. Furthermore, genes involved in synthesis of reduced sulphur moieties (<italic>cysH, sirA</italic> and <italic>cysM</italic>) are also induced by hydrogen peroxide and nutrient starvation. Sulfur metabolism has been postulated to be important in transition to latency. This hypothesis is based on transcriptional upregulation of <italic>cysD, cysNC, cysK2,</italic> and <italic>cysM</italic> upon exposure to hypoxia. Multiple transcriptional profiling studies have reported upregulation of <italic>moeZ, mec, cysO</italic> and <italic>cysM</italic> genes when cells were subjected to oxidative and hypoxic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] further suggesting an increase in the biosynthesis of reduced metabolites such as cysteine and methionine and sulfur containing cell wall glycolipids upon exposure to oxidative stress. To address the functional relevance of this observation, we deleted two non-canonical L-cysteine synthases-CysM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] and CysK2, from the <italic>Mtb</italic> chromosome. CysK2 mutant, <italic>RvΔcysK2,</italic> was generated using the recombineering method, and the recombination at the native loci was confirmed with the help of multiple PCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). While deletion of <italic>cysM</italic> or <italic>cysK2</italic> did not affect mycobacterial growth under <italic>in vitro</italic> nutrient-rich 7H9-ADC or 7H9-ADS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S5a and S5b</xref>), it significantly compromised <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in defined Sauton’s media (~2 log<sub>10</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>), suggesting the importance of <italic>cysM-</italic> and <italic>cysK2</italic>-derived L-cysteine. Restoring <italic>cysM</italic> or <italic>cysK2</italic> expression in the complementation strains, <italic>RvΔcysM::M</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2::K2,</italic> rescued the growth defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S5</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> is a metabolically versatile organism capable of utilizing a large variety of carbon and nitrogen sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Unlike 7H9, wherein glucose, glycerol, glutamate, and ammonia act as carbon and nitrogen sources, Sauton’s media contains glycerol and asparagine as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources, suggesting metabolic reprogramming aided by CysM and CysK2 enable <italic>Mtb</italic> to grow optimally in a limited nutritional environment. This observation was further recapitulated under nutrient starvation (PBS), wherein the survival of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> was lower than parental <italic>Rv</italic> or <italic>RvΔcysM::M</italic> or <italic>RvΔcysK2::K2</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). Interestingly, when exposed to acidic conditions (pH 4.5), <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> survival were observed to be ~0.85 and ~0.24 log<sub>10</sub> lower, respectively, compared with <italic>Rv,</italic> suggesting CysM is relatively more important for bacillary survival under acidic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). The highest attenuation of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> was observed upon the addition of cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), an organic hydroperoxide that, upon decomposition, generates free radicals. The relative survival of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> was ~2.04 and ~1.31 log<sub>10</sub> lower, respectively, compared to <italic>Rv</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). The addition of diamide, which results in thiol oxidation, also attenuated the survival of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> by ~1.33 and ~1.26 log<sub>10</sub> compared with <italic>Rv</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S5c</xref>). When the mutant strains were subjected to nitrosative stress, the survival of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> was ~0.93 and ~0.86 log<sub>10</sub> lower than <italic>Rv</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>). However, no significant attenuation was found during reductive and SDS stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h-i</xref>). Collectively, <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> displayed increased susceptibility towards oxidative, nitrosative, mild acidification, and PBS starvation to varying degrees compared with <italic>Rv, RvΔcysM::M</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2::K2</italic>. The data suggests that L-cysteine, produced via CysM and CysK2, and its downstream products help mycobacteria thwart specific stresses that <italic>Mtb</italic> encounters within the host.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Distinct roles of CysM and CysK2</title><p id="P7">To decipher the mechanism through which CysM and CysK2 combat oxidative stress, we performed a global transcriptomic analysis of <italic>Rv, RvΔcysM</italic>, and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> in the presence and absence of oxidative stress (CHP) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S4</xref>). Principal Component Analysis demonstrated clear separation of strains under different conditions. Intriguingly, while <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> were closely located on a PCA plot in the absence of any stress, oxidative stress resulted in a significant divergence between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Deletion of <italic>cysM</italic> resulted in differential expression of 322 genes (159 downregulated and 163 upregulated) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S6a-b</xref>), while deletion of <italic>cysK2</italic> impacted 278 genes (155 downregulated and 123 upregulated) under regular growth conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S6c-d</xref>) (absolute log<sub>2</sub> Fold change&gt;1 and Padj&lt;0.05). In contrast, upon treatment with CHP, nearly ~33% and ~53% of <italic>Mtb</italic> genes were differentially expressed in <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic>, respectively, compared with <italic>Rv</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b-c</xref>). To understand the individual contribution of CysM and CysK2 in combating oxidative stress, we compared the DEGs of <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> to <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> under regular growth and oxidative stress conditions. While DEGs between <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> were limited to 13 in untreated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>), CHP treatment resulted in differential expression of 1372 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S6e</xref>), highlighting unique transcriptional signatures associated with each L-cysteine synthase under oxidative stress. Subsequently, we compared the DEGs of <italic>Rv</italic>, <italic>RvΔcysM</italic>, and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> obtained under oxidative stress with the help of a Venn diagram. This analysis revealed that CysM and CysK2 influence a shared repertoire of 1023 genes (529 upregulated and 494 downregulated) compared to <italic>Rv</italic> upon CHP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>). Importantly, CysM and CysK2 distinctively modulate 324 and 1104 genes, respectively, during oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f-g</xref>). In addition to being directly regulated by the synthases, it is highly that the changes in the expression of these genes is because of distinct downstream consequences. Assortment of DEGs into functional classes revealed intermediary metabolism &amp; respiration and cell wall pathways among the most impacted categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2h</xref>). These results corroborate the recent finding that CysK2 alters the phospholipid profile of the <italic>Mtb</italic> cell envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Pathway enrichment analysis of the most enriched Gene ontology biological process indicated that while most pathways are commonly affected by CysM and CysK2, these L-cysteine synthases also have a unique transcriptional footprint (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S5</xref>). Pathways such as DNA binding, homologous recombination, translation, ribosome, etc., were commonly affected in <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> compared to <italic>Rv</italic> during oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S6f, g</xref>). Genes belonging to oxidative phosphorylation and quinone binding were upregulated, while DNA binding and cholesterol catabolism gene categories were found to be downregulated in <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> compared to <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> during oxidative conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2i</xref>). Together, our data point to the unique roles of CysM and CysK2, as their deletion differentially affects various cellular pathways under oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Key metabolites are differentially affected upon CysM and CysK2 deletion</title><p id="P8">L-Cysteine concentration in <italic>Mtb</italic> is notoriously low, usually 10-fold lower than most other amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. As expected, L-cysteine levels were below the limit of detection/quantification (not shown). Therefore, we used key downstream metabolites to monitor L-cysteine biosynthesis and utilization. We followed pool size and labelling (Na<sup>34</sup>SO<sub>4</sub>) of L-methionine, mycothiol/mycothione, and ergothioneine, made from L-cysteine, via three distinct and dedicated metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S7</xref>). First, L-methionine, mycothiol, and ergothioneine concentrations vary from zero to 24 h, indicating that their pool sizes are not as stable as those of other core metabolites. This is consistent with their function, susceptibility to redox homeostasis, and L-methionine’s role in protein synthesis. Second, upon challenge with CHP for 24 h, L-methionine levels decrease in <italic>Rv,</italic> remain constant in <italic>RvDcysK2,</italic> and increase in <italic>RvDcysM</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). Ergothioneine levels are identical in the three strains, and upon treatment with CHP, they are decreased in the parent strain but remain unchanged in the <italic>RvDcysK2</italic> and <italic>RvDcysM</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>).

We selected three compounds - Compound 1 (C1) (named compound 2 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]), which inhibits all three synthases; Compound 2 (C2) (compound 6 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]), which inhibits both non-canonical L-cysteine synthases and Compound 3 (C3) (compound 31 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]), which selectively inhibits CysK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a &amp; b</xref>).
