Paradoxically, mutagenic DSB repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is favoured in developing and antigen-stimulated lymphocytes, where it mediates deletional recombination events that diversify the antigenic specificity and function of B and T cell receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. To cope with this intrinsic discrepancy in desired DNA repair outcome between different cellular contexts, cells have evolved complex regulatory systems that maintain an appropriate equilibrium between competing DNA repair pathways, and that ensure DNA breaks are appropriately resolved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The generation of functional B and T cell receptors by the mammalian adaptive immune system relies on two programmed gene rearrangement mechanisms: V(D)J recombination and Class-Switch Recombination (CSR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Both mechanisms rely on intragenic deletional recombination events, which are mediated through the ligation of interspaced DNA ends using non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways. Due to the distinct biochemical mechanisms involved in generating DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during V(D)J recombination and CSR, the resulting DNA ends have different structural properties, necessitating distinct DNA-end processing and ligation mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">DSB induction during V(D)J recombination occurs during the development of B and T cells in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively. The process is orchestrated by Recombination Activating Gene enzymes 1 and 2 (RAG1/RAG2), which cleave V, D and J segment-flanking recombination signal sequences (RSSs) resulting in pairs of blunt signal and covalently sealed hair-pinned coding ends. Hairpin opening is essential before coding-joins can occur; a step facilitated by the Artemis endonuclease upon its activation by the DNA-dependent Protein Kinase (DNA-PK) complex. This generates DNA ends that are strictly joined by classical NHEJ (c-NHEJ) proteins including Ku (Ku70/Ku80), XRCC4 and DNA Ligase 4 (LIG4), with a more modest reliance on XLF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In contrast, class-switch recombination in mature peripheral lymphocytes involves DSB generation between antibody isotype-encoding constant (C) gene segments of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (<italic>igh).</italic> This process is initiated by Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID), which introduces clusters of U:G mismatches in actively transcribed switch <italic>(S)</italic> introns. These mismatches are then processed by base excision repair (BER) and mismatch repair (MMR) machineries, ultimately leading to the conversion of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps into DSBs with single-stranded tailed termini. Unlike RAG1/2-induced DSBs, AID-dependent DSBs during CSR can be repaired through both c-NHEJ and alternative end-joining (a-EJ) pathways, with a critical role also played by the 53BP1 pathway proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">The 53BP1 pathway is composed of nucleosomal and DNA-binding protein components. Most upstream is 53BP1, a chromatin reader protein scaffold that interacts with the DSB-responsive ubiquitinated Lysine 15 on nucleosomal H2A type histones (H2AK15ub) and ubiquitous histone H4 methylation at Lysine 20 (H4K20me1/2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. This interaction leads to the formation of extensive 53BP1 chromatin-bound domains at DSB sites. Downstream of 53BP1, the 53BP1-binding protein RIF1 bridges interactions between ATM-phosphorylated motifs in 53BP1 and the SHLD3 subunit of shieldin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, a complex bound to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that is thought to protect DNA ends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Studies using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) deleted of <italic>53bp1</italic>, or shieldin proteins <italic>Rev7</italic> or <italic>Shld1/2</italic> present with near-complete deficiencies in CSR. By contrast, only <italic>53bp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit V(D)J recombination defects, which lead to mild B and T cell lymphopenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">The significance of the 53BP1 pathway extends to <italic>BRCA1</italic>-mutated cancers. In normal cells, the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer binds to a related combinatorial chromatin signature comprising H2AK15ub and unmethylated Lysine 20 on histone H4 (a post-replicative modification state), excluding 53BP1 from DNA damage sites and directing HR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. However, in <italic>BRCA1</italic>-deficient cells, uninhibited 53BP1-chromatin complexes prevent HR and promote NHEJ-mediated genome rearrangements, leading to genomic instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Consequently, <italic>BRCA1</italic>-deficient cells and tumours are hypersensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), which exploit the HR defect caused by 53BP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Conversely, 53BP1-deletion is able to restore PARPi resistance to <italic>BRCA1</italic>-mutant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and can even rescue viability in <italic>Brca1</italic>-null mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Genetic screens aimed at elucidating PARPi resistance mechanisms in <italic>BRCA1</italic>-deficient cells were instrumental in revealing 53BP1 pathway biology: shieldin genes were discovered through screens investigating PARPi-induced toxicity in BRCA1-deficient cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>; the PolÎ±-Primase accessory complex proteins Ctc1-Stn1-Ten1 (CST) similarly emerged as putative 53BP1 pathway effectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Concurrent hypothesis-guided studies also linked the activities of shieldin and CST to pathological 53BP1 pathway function in <italic>BRCA1</italic>-mutant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, and highlighted CST-directed PolÎ±-Primase-dependent DNA fill-in synthesis as key intermediary step<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">This research has ignited debates regarding the precise role of shieldin, particularly whether its primary function involves blocking nucleolytic resection or facilitating fill-in synthesis at DNA ends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. The importance of effector interactions in the 53BP1 pathway during physiological antigen receptor recombination mechanisms, as well as their impact on HR defects and DNA joining events in BRCA1-deficient cells, remains to be fully understood. To address these questions, we conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis using GEMMs. Our findings demonstrate that the 53BP1 pathway contributes substantially to DNA end-joining during antigen receptor recombination and in cancer cells in the absence of shieldin/CST. We also demonstrate a strict interdependence between shieldin and CST during CSR, and an epistatic relationship with DNA polymerase Î¶, solidifying fill-in synthesis as a primary shieldin-dependent DNA repair function. Importantly, using <italic>BRCA1</italic>-deficient mice and cellular models we establish that HR suppression relies on 53BP1 but not shieldin. Altogether, our results showcase remarkable resilience in the 53BP1 pathway, achieved through a division of labour between chromatin-bound 53BP1 complexes and its downstream DNA-bound effectors.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Shieldin and CST equivalency during lymphocyte development</title><p id="P11">To understand the extent to which shieldin-CST cooperation supports physiological 53BP1 pathway function, we generated new mouse strains deleted for genes encoding core proteins in each complex in an inbred C57BL/6 background.

From a structural perspective, it is noteworthy that neither CSR, nor the ATM-dependent shieldin-CST interaction discovered here, relies on a recently described N-terminal CTC1-binding motif in SHLD1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.

Our comparative investigations of 53BP1 and shieldin functions in <italic>BRCA1</italic>-deficient cells provide additional evidence in support of this proposition: shieldin-inactivation confers a degree of PARPi resistance to <italic>BARD1</italic>-depleted cells, yet resistance was further increased by deletion of 53BP1.

Randomization of samples was only undertaken during the scoring of chromosomal aberrations during metaphase analyses. Mice of a certain genotype were selected based on a unique mouse ID number that does not indicate mouse genotype, thus phenotypeâgenotype relationships were determined only at the data analysis stage.

Chromatin associated 53BP1 complexes suppress HR and promote V(D)J recombination. DNA damage dependent signalling via RIF1 is conferred to shieldin via interactions with SHLD3. DSB signalling via ATM stimulates the assembly of shieldin-CST complexes on ssDNA, promoting the recruitment of PolÎ±-Primase to initiate fill-in synthesis. PolÎ¶ polymerase REV3L increases the processivity of PolÎ±-Primase catalysed fill-in synthesis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS193097-f005"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"
