In addition, however, there may also be mechanisms for balancing effectively between threat- and reward-related behaviors and these may also vary between individuals. We investigated neural activity associated with spontaneous switching between foraging for rewards and vigilance for threats with 7T fMRI. In a virtual naturalistic environment, participants freely switched between the two modes of behavior. Switching was driven by estimates of likelihood of threat and reward. Both tracking of threat and switching to vigilance were associated with specific but distributed patterns of activity spanning habenula, dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), anterior cingulate cortex, and anterior insula cortex. Distinct distributed patterns heralded returns to reward-oriented behavior. Individual variation in DRN activity reflected individual variation in vigilance. All activity patterns were replicated in an initially held-out portion of data.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Anxiety and fear are prominent when mental health is poor. They are central features of psychological illnesses including generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, panic, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Until recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, the understanding of cognitive and neural mechanisms related to fear and anxiety has depended on experimental paradigms in which the impact of fear-inducing stimuli on behavior and neural activity can be investigated in the laboratory. Despite their elegance and continuing and critical importance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, such paradigms do not capture an important feature of fear-related behavior in the everyday lives of humans and other animals: the balancing of attention between threat and reward. In everyday life people must attend vigilantly to stimuli that presage adverse events but also to the stimuli predictive of positive events. To thrive they must identify and respond adaptively to stimuli predictive of positive outcomes while ensuring that their pursuit is not curtailed by dangerous threats. For the modern office worker this might mean balancing pursuit of promotion and a higher salary while avoiding difficult colleagues. For animals in natural environments the situation is analogous; daily life entails careful balancing between foraging for food while maintaining vigilance for predatory threats.</p><p id="P4">Here we focus on how people move between these two modes of behavior using a task known to reflect individual variation in core features of anxiety and depression in two large samples (discovery: N=374, replication: N=702<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>). It has been argued that considering how animals have evolved to deal with environmental threats may provide insights into fear and anxiety mechanisms both in normal and poor mental health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and so our task adopts a similar approach here; we examine how human participants balance attention between reward- and threat-related stimuli focusing on moments of switching between the two behaviors – foraging for reward and checking for threats and the first occasion on which checking led to actual threat detection. We do this in a gamified and continuous, but carefully controlled, task in which both reward and threat stimuli were presented in a quantified manner. We measured behavior when it was predominantly guided by reward (foraging) and when it was predominantly guided by threat (checking), and in both behavioral contexts we quantified the environmental features that drove the behaviors (rate of reward and an estimate of threat proximity that we refer to as time pressure). Importantly, participants chose themselves when and how frequently to switch from one behavior to the other. In other words, our paradigm allows participants to decide when to engage in a threat- or anxiety-related response and when not to.</p><p id="P5">The type of behavior examined—freely chosen switches between threat-guided behavior and reward-guided behavior—is one important feature of the present study. The second is that we used 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify neural processes mediating switches. The ubiquity of the need to balance reward-guided foraging and threat-guided vigilance and checking across animals suggests an evolutionarily ancient origin and its possible mediation by some of the first cephalic neural circuits evolved. These are, however, of comparatively small size in humans, often overlooked, and difficult to measure without ultra-high field imaging. We focus here on one such candidate neural circuit centered on the habenula (Hb) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). While this circuit is present in primates it is unusual in that it is present in many vertebrates including even cyclostomes – jawless fish – that diverged from other vertebrates 550 million years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The DRN is an important source of serotonergic innervation and like other neuromodulatory systems, such as the dopaminergic system with its origins in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SN), its activity is under Hb control.</p><p id="P6">While we examine activity in all four areas, an important reason for looking at DRN and Hb is that both nuclei have been linked to depression and anxiety and one way of conceptualizing such conditions is that a core feature is an inability to focus on rewarding stimuli (anhedonia) and a sustained focus on negative events. A series of recent studies have linked Hb to depression-like symptoms in rodent models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The serotonergic system is also considered the first line pharmacological target in depression and anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. As noted a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> demonstrated the task we use here is sensitive to individual variation in anxiety; for instance, higher scores on a clinical measure of compulsive checking were reliably associated with increased vigilance and more disorganized patterns of switching between foraging and checking in the current task.</p><p id="P7">Of course, the presence of cortex in the mammalian brain suggests that Hb-DRN interactions may be influenced by cortical activity. The routes by which this might happen are, however, limited. There is little direct information about Hb connections in primates but only two cortical areas, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula (AI) cortex are known to project to Hb in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We therefore also focus on these two regions of interest (ROIs). Intriguingly, in macaques, albeit in other contexts, ACC and AI carry signals related to those in DRN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Further, AI and DRN share functional connectivity related to harm avoidance behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and anxiety pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. However, surprisingly little is known about these areas’ activity in many situations including predatory threat and checking behavior.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P8">Participants were trained on the task in an online session before the scan. During the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-D</xref>) participants used arrow keys to control an animated fish in an ocean environment with rewarding food (later translated to a bonus payment), threatening predators (leading to large point loss if they ‘caught’ the fish), and a hiding space (where participants could hide from the predators). Participants attempted to gain as much reward as possible while avoiding being caught by a predator.</p><p id="P9">In the absence of a traditional task trial structure, human participants freely and continuously chose between foraging for reward or checking for predatory threat in the virtual environment during 27 blocks each lasting 90 s. Here we focus on the two most frequent actions – foraging and checking – and the environmental variables – reward rate and an index of threat level (time pressure) that principally motivated each of the behaviors. A third action – hiding – was also available and was taken on occasions when the threat was imminent. Pressing the ‘hide’ button caused the fish to escape to a safe space where it could not be caught by the predator; a subsequent button press returned the fish to the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Because hiding only occurred once per block, there are insufficient data for a full analysis of hiding-related behavior and neural activity.</p><p id="P10">Reward rate corresponded to the average amount of food available and followed a random walk (range: 0-90 units). Participants could always see how much food was available (proportion of green versus gray on bar on lower right of display (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig. 1A-D</xref>). When participants took the foraging action, which as we show below was more likely when reward levels were high, the fish dived down to obtain food.</p><p id="P11">Predators were hidden from participants’ view unless participants pressed a button to ‘check’ a portion of the surrounding area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). At that point they were able to see a segment of the environment in which there might be a predator. Predators appeared (after a random delay, 2-10.5s) at the edge of the screen and moved toward the fish’s location at the screen center. When the predator reached the screen center it either caught the fish (causing the participant to lose one ‘life’, equivalent to 100 points) or, if the fish was in hiding, the predator simply exited the environment (ending the epoch). When participants took the checking action, if the current predator was undiscovered, the section being checked advanced clockwise to the next section of the environment at each key press; after the participant discovered the predator’s location, subsequent check responses re-checked the same location. Predator types (jellyfish, squid, shark) differed in speed, and therefore, time to reach screen center (10s, 15s or 20s). Each block had only one type of predator and participants were informed which might appear before the block start. The index of threat – time pressure – indicated the imminence of the predator’s approach (the more time elapsed after the start of the block and the faster the predator, the closer the predator would be to the center of the screen and able to catch the participant’s fish avatar (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Equation 1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Actions entailed time costs, so participants had to manage their time strategically to maximize reward. For example, each foraging action took 1.5s (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">Timings</xref> in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). After making one foraging action, participants had to make another to obtain further reward. Alternatively, after the 1.5 s time elapsed, participants could switch to checking or hiding.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Participants Used Task-Relevant Information to Guide Behavior</title><p id="P13">On average, participants’ actions before predator discovery (pre-PD) consisted of approximately equal numbers of checks and forages (44.68 ± 7.80% 55.32 ± 7.80% respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>) but post-predator discovery (post-PD), behavior changed; participants focused on foraging (64.01 ± 6.14%) with only occasional checks directed towards the known predator direction (10.75 ± 6.95%) and hiding actions (25.24 ± 6.15%; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Our initial analyses, therefore, examined the pre-PD phase when the two key actions, foraging and checking, were made with a similar frequency. However, we subsequently tested the post-PD data and confirmed the pre-PD results (reviewed in final figure, Fig. 8).</p><p id="P14">The moment-to-moment balance between the two behaviors – checking and foraging – was a function of the two environment features – time pressure and reward rate at the time of action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E, F, H</xref>). Regression analyses (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD4">Equation 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>) showed that pre-PD, participants were more likely to check instead of forage as time pressure increased (<italic>t</italic>(22)=12.94, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, <italic>M</italic>=1.41 ± 0.52) and as reward rate decreased (<italic>t</italic>(22)==-5.38, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, <italic>M</italic>=-0.28 ± 0.25; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>; all t-tests in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We analyzed inter-response times (IRTs) to gain insights into when critical cognitive processes occurred. In general, IRTs were faster when time pressure increased (<italic>t</italic>(22)=7.30, p&lt;0.001) and when reward level increased (<italic>t</italic>(22)=-4.56, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). However, as noted above, as time pressure increased, participants were also more likely to check, and IRTs were slower when participants initiated checks (<italic>t</italic>(22)=4.23; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). There was a main effect of any behavioral switch (<italic>t</italic>(22)=10.16), but the significant interaction between behavioral switch and checking (<italic>t</italic>(22)=-8.07, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) demonstrated that it was switching to checking, rather than foraging, that was associated with slower IRTs. Mean IRT was slowest when switching from checking to forage and fastest when repeating forages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>). Such costs indicate switches between behavioral modes require cognitive resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). In addition, IRTs between forages became slower as participants approached a switching to checking (<italic>t</italic>(22)=4.4, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>) suggesting participants prepared to switch to checking prior to actually making the switch. IRT was also significantly slowed by discovery of a new predator (<italic>t</italic>(22)=6.18, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). Encountering a new threat requires additional cognitive processing relative to a check that does not reveal new information. In subsequent neural analyses we focus on understanding these behavioral switches and threat discovery points when higher IRTs indicated additional cognitive resources were deployed.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>A distributed neural network for the monitoring of threat and the transition to checking</title><p id="P16">Initial fMRI analysis focused on activity in the six ROIs (ACC, AI, Hb, SN, VTA, and DRN; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2A</xref>) and examined whether it was differentially related to the two key behaviors – switching to checking and switching to foraging – and the two environmental features that drove these behaviors – time pressure and reward. Time-locking to switches in behavior allowed identification of brain activity related to these discrete events despite the free and fast nature of the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs.1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>). To examine the hypothesis that activity in these ROIs occurs during behavioral switches between foraging and vigilance, we started by analysing these ROIs alongside other brain regions by conducting a whole-brain analysis. We used GLM1 (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref> <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD6">equation 6</xref>), which was structured similarly to the behavioral analyses (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD4">Equation 4</xref>), and which sought activity related to check switches, forage switches, and parametric variation in time pressure and reward rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2</xref>). Effects of time pressure were robust enough to be apparent even in the whole brain cluster-corrected results for all ROIs (p&lt;0.0002 two-tailed; Z&gt;3.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S6</xref>). The results provide initial evidence that these brain areas might constitute a distributed circuit for orienting behavior towards potential threats. The act of switching to check was also associated with significant activation in ACC in the whole brain fMRI analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To confirm our interpretation of the fMRI data we extracted parameter estimates (β weights from GLM1) in the ROIs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>. We examined parameter estimates linked to the first instance of each behavior – foraging or checking – on each occasion that participants switched (referred to, respectively, as forage switch and check switch, modeled as constants. In addition GLM1 identified parametric variation in the two key environmental features that motivated the types of switching, time pressure and reward level during each of the two switch types. A three way ANOVA performed on the parameter estimates revealed that across the six ROIs there was a main effect of switch type (switching to checking was associated with more effects than switching to foraging: F(1, 528)=30.03, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; blue bars are more positive in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref> versus 2e); a main effect of type of environmental feature (time pressure effects were stronger than reward rate effects: F(1, 528)=114.72, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; ochre bars are higher than green bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs.2d</xref> and 2e) and a three-way interaction between ROI, switch type, and environmental feature suggested time pressure signals were stronger than reward rate signals especially when switching to checking and this was particularly true in some brain areas (ACC, AI, Hb: F(5, 528)=2.33, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; ochre bars are especially larger than green bars on the left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref> versus 2e). In summary, the ANOVA revealed that time pressure-related activity, as opposed to reward rate modulations, were most apparent when switching to checking as opposed to foraging and this was especially true in ACC, AI, and Hb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-E</xref>). Moreover, it was apparent that activity related to reward rate was negligible even at the time of forage switches in these areas (apparent in the near zero reward effects in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> and in the absence of any significant effect of reward at the time of checking in the whole brain analysis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Below we discuss reward rate-related activity at the time of switching to foraging that was found in other structures, but at the time of checking the absence of significant, univariate reward-related activity in the ROIs suggested a strong attentional focus on time pressure.</p><p id="P18">So far the analysis had suggested that all six ROIs carried time pressure-related information (apparent in the significant effects of time pressure in the whole brain analysis; p&lt;0.0002; two-tailed; Z&gt;3.1 mentioned above). It is well established that some of these areas, such as the cortical regions ACC and AI carry a range of additional signals in a diverse range of tasks. We were, however, interested in the possibility that one of the subcortical areas such as DRN, where activity-behavior correlates are less well established, might be especially concerned with the tracking of this variable in order to bring about a change in behavior. This might be apparent if the strength of the time-pressure signal were especially closely related to the likelihood that a switch might occur. To examine this possibility we tested whether individual variation in time pressure signal across participants was predictive of individual variation in the frequency of checking as indexed by the percentage of responses that were checks. Not only did we carry out this test in DRN but, for comparison, in the three other subcortical areas. There was indeed a relationship between the strength of the time pressure signal and checking frequency across participants (Pearson’s r = 0.52, <italic>p</italic> = 0.012 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This remained true even after Bonferroni correction for multiple tests conducted across the four subcortical areas. The relationship between the time pressure signal strength at the time of switching to checking is not a mandatory one that is found in all brain areas in which there is a time pressure effect; while reliable effects were not found in other areas (all <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), the relationship in the DRN was replicated in an initially held portion of the data (from the period in each block after the predator was discovered; this and other replication tests are discussed below and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Notably, individual variation in the balance between foraging and checking has been shown to be related to individual variation in clinical indices of compulsive behaviors, such as checking, in a large sample study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The present results suggest that individual variation in DRN activity might be related to checking including when it becomes compulsive and problematic.</p><p id="P19">While we focus here on ACC, AI, Hb, SN, VTA, and DRN, it was also apparent from the whole brain analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>) that time pressure during checking and the act of switching to checking was associated with activity in superior colliculus, pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, and dorsal and ventrolateral parts of the periaqueductal grey. This is consistent with the suggestion that these brain structures may mediate fast responses to threat stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Interactions across the distributed network for threat monitoring and transition to checking</title><p id="P20">Next, we sought to understand how the DRN interacted with the other areas to encode time pressure and to bring about the process of behavioral change when participants switched to checking. We therefore used psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD8">Equation 8</xref>) to examine relationships between DRN (in which the link with behavior is prominent; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3</xref>) and three other areas, ACC, AI, and Hb, because, as noted above: i) their time pressure signals were stronger than their reward rate signals especially when checking and their switching signals were especially different when checking as opposed to foraging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E</xref>); ii) their anatomical connections suggest they are especially well placed to influence DRN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>; iii) in macaques, ACC and AI carry signals related to those in DRN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We found two types of interactions. The first occurred as a function of switching from foraging to checking. The second also occurred as a function of switching from foraging to checking but, in addition, this interaction also varied with time pressure.</p><p id="P21">The first pattern of interaction was evident between ACC and Hb (two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test, Z=3.28, <italic>p</italic>=0.001; Fig. 4Aii); full PPI analysis results reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S7</xref>). Stronger ACC activity was associated with stronger Hb activity during check as opposed to forage switches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4Aiii and 4Aiv</xref> illustrate how ACC-Hb interactions differed depending on switch direction). Notably, the average peak time of this effect was shortly prior to the first checking button press. Given that fMRI peak effects are delayed by the hemodynamic response function, it reflects neural events occurring several seconds before the actual check switch. This is consistent with behavioral evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>) showing participants prepared to switch to checking several seconds before actually switching. This pattern is specific to these areas; no evidence was found for similar interactions involving AI and DRN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A-C</xref>). To demonstrate the specificity of the ACC-Hb pathway we carried out a factorial style analysis examining interactions between two cortical regions, ACC and AI, and two subcortical regions, Hb and DRN. A two-way ANOVA revealed a main effect of cortical region (ACC and AI) on the extent to which switching to check moderated functional connectivity with subcortical ROIs Hb and DRN (F(1, 180)=7.03, <italic>p</italic>=0.009); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4Ai</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>); post-hoc Tukey HSD test found that peak values were greater on average for ACC than AI <italic>(p</italic> adj.=0.012; 95% CI=[-0.04, -0.01]; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S8</xref>).

Like the first interaction, it occurred between a cortical and subcortical region as a function of switching to checking versus switching for foraging but now the interaction was between AI and DRN and it occurred as a function of an additional factor – <italic>time pressure</italic> – the environmental variable that drove participants to switching. There was a significant three-way interaction between AI activity, time pressure, and switching to check that modulated DRN activity (Z=1.98, <italic>p</italic>=0.048; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4Bii</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>), such that stronger AI activity was associated with stronger DRN activity as a function of switch to checking and as a function of <italic>time pressure</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3Biii, 3Biv</xref> for depictions of how AI activity and <italic>time pressure</italic> were related to DRN activity differently depending on the direction of switch). The interaction reflects a relative decrease in AI-DRN coupling as a function of time pressure when participants switch to foraging. Again, this pattern of activity exhibited a degree of specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D-F</xref>); a factorial analysis in which we examined interactions between the two cortical regions, ACC and AI, and the two subcortical regions, Hb and DRN.

The Hb is, however, itself an important source of influence over DRN, SN, and VTA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In the next analyses we examined how Hb interacted with DRN and compared the pattern we found with SN and VTA at the time that checking or foraging actions were initiated. PPI analyses revealed Hb exerted a specific effect, in the sense that it was related to time pressure, but a general effect in the sense that the impact in DRN was similar to those seen in VTA and SN; in each case, greater Hb activity was associated with greater activity in the target brain region as a function of both checking and time pressure. This effect was specific to check switches but found in the interaction patterns of Hb with all three areas: two-way ANOVA showed a main effect of switch type (check versus forage) on the extent to which the effect of Hb activity was moderated by time pressure in all three brain areas (F(1, 270)=4.94, <italic>p</italic> = 0.027; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), with higher peak values associated with checks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S14</xref>). The average time at which peaks were significant for each PPI analysis for the three areas (DRN, VTA, SN) was 5.79s ± 0.54s after the time-locking event – the initiation of the checking action, suggesting (once the BOLD haemodynamic response is taken into account) that this effect occurred after the ACC-Hb interactions illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3</xref> and was elicited at the onset of the checking action itself. Significance testing of peak values in separate PPI analyses confirmed functional connectivity with Hb was moderated by switching to check, time pressure, and activity in SN (Z=2.16, <italic>p=</italic>0.031; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), VTA (Z=2.13, <italic>p=</italic>0.033; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), and DRN (Z=2.04, <italic>p=</italic>0.042; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Several features of the results are notable. First, that Hb interacted with ACC as a function of check switches and with VTA, SN, and DRN as a function of both time pressure and check switches suggests that Hb may play a unique role in facilitating communication between cortical and sub-cortical areas to guide behavioral change. Indeed, further PPI analysis showed that activity in Hb was moderated by an interaction between AI activity and time pressure, regardless of switch type (Z=2.16, <italic>p</italic>=0.031; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>).

Voluntary switches in behavior are a key aspect of the current task but previous studies of Hb and interconnected structures have focused on very different aspects of its activity when surprising events are encountered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Therefore in the next section, we focus on the reactive aspect of threat monitoring when participants made a checking response that actually led to the new discovery of the predator. We did this by continuing to employ the same index of threat – time pressure – but while previously we had considered both checks that led to predator discovery for the first time in a block and checks that did not, we now compared these two types of checks (we refer to this as the <italic>check outcome</italic> factor). As noted already, many checks did not lead to predator discovery but discovery checks entailed surprise and slowing of IRTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>). Because Hb and some of the regions that it projects to (the dopaminergic midbrain) have been reported to carry signals relating to surprising events, such as reward prediction errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> and because there are similar projections from Hb not just to dopaminergic midbrain but also DRN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, we examined the interactions between Hb and SN, VTA, and DRN using a PPI approach as above. Now, however, in addition, the interactions were examined as a function of whether checking led to predator discovery. Interactions were indeed sensitive to check outcome. Two-way ANOVA showed a main effect of predator discovery (F(1, 132)=23.77, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S15</xref>) on peak values for the three-way interaction between Hb activity, switching to check, and <italic>time pressure</italic> with all three areas (SN, VTA, and DRN). Notably, the average time at which peaks were significant for each PPI analysis was 8.25s ± 0.71s after button press (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5.f-h</xref>); given hemodynamic lag, this suggests that the three-way interaction between switching to check, time pressure, and predator discovery/non-discovery on interactions between Hb and the others areas was elicited by an event occurring at the point of predator discovery/non-discovery rather than at the initiation of checking (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5f-h</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5b-d</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Further analyses focusing either on predator discovery events or predator non-discovery events revealed predator discovery was linked with relatively inhibitory relationships between Hb and each ROI (SN, VTA, and DRN) as a function of time pressure. For these tests, as before, we examined activity time-locked to the initiation of checking but instead of looking at the relatively early activity actually linked to the initiation of the check (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5B-D</xref>), we focused on later activity, approximately 9s after check initiation, when the participants had seen the outcome of checking. In this way we were able to look at how activity differed when the check outcome was predator detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5F-H</xref>) or absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5I-K</xref>) PPI results showed that when switching to checking resulted in predator discovery, functional connectivity with Hb was moderated by a three-way interaction with switching to check, time pressure, and SN activity (Z=-2.43, <italic>p</italic>=0.015; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>), VTA (Z=-2.95, <italic>p=</italic>0.003; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>), and DRN (Z=-2.10, <italic>p=</italic>0.036; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>). In each case greater Hb activity was associated with lower activity in the region of interest. This is consistent with evidence that Hb has an inhibitory effect on midbrain dopamine neurons in the VTA and SN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> in response to negative-valence and aversive stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, and also plays a role in regulating DRN serotonergic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

We next looked for evidence of complementary neural activity mediating behavioral switch in the opposite direction – from checking to foraging. When looking at forage switches, we also considered reward rate because switching from checking to foraging was promoted by higher reward rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). The behavioral analyses of IRTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) had suggested that foraging was the participants’ default behavior during the task but that this behavior was intermittently interrupted by checking.</p><p id="P28">As already noted, the network of areas linked to time pressure and check switches exhibited little reward rate-related activity during checking and was less active during switches to foraging as opposed to checking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, D, E</xref>). This is striking given that the actions participants made to forage or check were nearly identical finger movements. The difference in the goal of the action—foraging or checking— despite similarity in the nature of the finger movement meant that the distributed pattern of activity across the brain was profoundly different.</p><p id="P29">However, it was possible to find reward rate-related activity when participants were switching to foraging. This was apparent in significant parametric effects of reward rate at the time of switching to foraging in the whole brain analysis (GLM1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). These were prominent in a relatively ventral part of the left striatum either side of the internal capsule and in the cross bridges spanning it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2bi</xref>). Additionally, increases in activity related to forage switches and reward levels were found in adjacent parts of the precentral gyrus in dorsal premotor and motor cortex. The reward-related and forage switch related activity is also summarized in ROIs at each location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C, D</xref>). In a final analysis we looked at interactions between these areas as a function of reward rate and the forage switches as opposed to check switches. There was a positive interaction between precentral gyrus and striatum as a function of reward rate that increased further when this led to a switch to foraging (Z=1.98, <italic>p=</italic>0.048; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>); this occurred at the time of button press and was thus likely elicited by preparation for the switch to foraging.</p><sec id="S9"><title>Replication in post-PD phase</title><p id="P30">To replicate our findings, we performed the same analyses in the post-PD phase.

While progress has been made in understanding mechanisms underlying reward- and threat-guided behavior independently, how people and other animals spontaneously switch between the two behavioral modes is not well understood. In addition to the fundamental importance of such decisions, individual variation in how they are taken is related to individual variation in clinical anxiety scores such as compulsivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In the present experimental paradigm, participants freely managed their time and decided themselves when to switch between foraging for rewards versus checking for approaching predators. Our analysis focused on switching points where participants spontaneously changed between foraging and checking. We initially focused on the task phase before participants discovered the predator (pre-PD), because during this phase switches to checking and foraging occurred with approximately equal frequency. However, effects found in the pre-PD phase were subsequently replicated in the post-PD phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P32">We found evidence of activity and specific interaction patterns across a distributed circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). DRN activity tracked time pressure, a measure of the imminence of the threat and the strength of the signal was closely related to whether a switch to checking occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Robust patterns of interaction were also found between DRN and Hb and ACC as a function of either switching to checking or time pressure (which promoted checking; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). AI-DRN interactions were especially specific and occurred as a function of both time pressure and witching to check. Once the hemodynamic response function is taken into account, the early timing of interaction effects—peaking less than 5s after switching to checking —indicates that the neural signals preceded the switches to the vigilant state.</p><p id="P33">These specific interaction patterns were complemented by a second set of more general interaction patterns, observed between Hb, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, not just with DRN but also with SN, and VTA. Functional connectivity between Hb and DRN/VTA/SN was mediated by threat level and check switches in a way that was sensitive to check outcome (i.e., whether the check revealed a new threat or not). Initially when checks were made, interactions were positive. However, once a new threat was discovered, a strong negative relationship between Hb and each region was observed as a function of threat level and checking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). The inhibitory influence exerted by Hb over VTA/SN dopaminergic and DRN serotonergic neurons has previously been emphasised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. There may initially be a small but significant risk-related excitation between Hb and DRN, VTA, and SN as a function of time pressure when the check is made; some VTA/SN neurons exhibit excitation that varies with risk during the time between a reward-predicting stimulus and an outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. DRN activity has also been reported to reflect reward variance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate has been reported in Hb afferents to DRN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">One influential idea has been that DRN encodes a prediction error signal in response to aversive stimuli that might complement one for tracking rewards in dopaminergic nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. More recent research, however, has suggested that while DRN activity may indeed reflect aversive events it also reflects appetitive ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> and that a prolonged increase in serotonin increases learning signals for aversive and appetitive stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the induction of activity in DRN does not appear to be rewarding in a simple way but instead, it leads to changes in the choices animals make as a function of both costs and benefits; for example, after DRN stimulation, mice become more likely to wait through a delay to obtain a reward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. The current results suggest that this is because DRN is not simply concerned with regulation of patience or motor inhibition when deciding how long to wait for a reward but, instead, that it has a more general role in regulating the impact that aversive and appetitive prospects have on behavior. One possibility, therefore, is that DRN has a general role in tracking both rewarding and aversive features of the environment, with the latter especially salient in the current study, in order to redirect the motivational focus for behavior. In the present study, redirection occurs between reward- and threat-related motivations. In another recent, unpublished study from our laboratory we have observed DRN activity as macaques switch between reward-related motivation and inaction. Relatedly activity patterns in zebrafish DRN can be interpreted as being related to switches between reward-guided motivation and exploration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. The current results suggest these insights from fish and non-human primate studies may be useful in understanding how humans decide when and how frequently to direct behavior to threat as opposed to rewards. In addition they shed light on how cortical and sub-cortical regions work together to track behaviorally relevant stimuli and to switch motivational modes between threat vigilance and other reward-related motivations not just in healthy behavior but potentially also when vigilant behaviors, such as compulsive checking, become overwhelming in frequency and potentially clinically problematic.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12" sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p id="P35">24 healthy adult participants (15 females), aged 18 to 35, completed the study.

Finally, GLMs were fit to each time step of the epoched data.</p><p id="P63">Given that the delay in hemodynamic response means that a BOLD signal change reflects neural activity ~6s earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>, we partitioned the ROI time courses into two phases for analysis: an early phase (0-5s post-action) when neural activity associated with the action of interest first becomes observable, and a late phase (5-10s post-action) that may reflect secondary neural processes associated with the action of interest. In support of this, a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA showed a main effect of phase on group peaks [<italic>F</italic>(1, 132) = 11.20, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, □<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = 1.44] such that parametric variation in <italic>time pressure</italic> was linked with greater BOLD response in the early phase <italic>(M</italic> = 0.10, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.01) than in the later phase <italic>(M</italic> = 0.04, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.01) across VTA, SN, and DRN ROIs while controlling for time elapsed. Some tests were carried out on only the early or late phase depending on the expected timing of the effect: the early phase was used for analyses expected to reveal effects of action preparation and/or commission, while the late phase was used for analyses expected to reveal effects of action outcome.</p><p id="P64">For each psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis, time courses were

We initially focused on this task phase because it contained similar levels of checks and forages. In the final stage of the analysis, however, we examined whether we could replicate findings from the pre-PD phase in the post-PD phase. It was not possible to analyze the data for all participants in the post-PD phase because some only made a very small number of checks during this task phase. When testing the possibility that we could replicate results (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A, C, D</xref>), we therefore focused on participants who had made more checks (&gt;40) in the post-PD phase and in whom an analysis of effects sizes indicated &lt;2% change in BOLD signal was required to detect an effect of the parameter of interest (threat level or reward) during switches to check (leaving N=12 in all replication analyses).

task.</title><p>A) At the start of a block the fish begins in the center position. In this block the surrounding area is divided into four sections that must be searched for predators. At left (not shown here) participants see their collected energy, number of lives gained (each ‘life’=1 bar of energy), and time remaining in the current block (grey/black wheel). B) When foraging the fish dives down into the patch of food and the energy bar increases by the amount of reward gained. C) When checking, the fish checks in a particular direction. In this example the fish discovers that there is a predator in the area being checked. D) When hiding, the fish dives into a cave and is safe from the predator. It can see the predator reach the screen center and then retreat, and with another button press the fish returns to the original center position. The task lacked a traditional trial structure and participants freely chose when to forage or check. Contextual factors, however, influenced participants’ decisions, including time pressure (an index of threat level; E) and reward (F; reward appears flat because it is averaged here across all epochs); mean standardized value and 95% CI shown in 1s bins across the pre-PD phase.

H) Group mean estimates and 95% confidence intervals from two-tailed single sample t-tests showing effects of model parameters on the probability that an action was a check. I, K, L) Group mean estimates and 95% confidence intervals from two-tailed single sample t-tests showing effects of model parameters on IRTs. I) There were main effects of behavioral switch, checking, and time pressure on IRTs such that each significantly slowed reaction time (all p&lt;0.001). IRTs were significantly faster during higher rewards (p&lt;0.001). There was also a significant interaction between behavioral switch and checking (p&lt;0.001). J) Group mean and standard error for the average IRTs (standardized) associated with each action sequence within each participant. IRTs were slowest when switching from checking to forage and fastest when repeating foraging. K) IRTs between forages became significantly slower as they approached an upcoming switch to checking (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). L) There was a significant main effect of whether an action occurred immediately after discovering a new predator; discovering a predator slowed IRTs (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; both pre- and post-PD phase data analyzed). *p &lt;0.05, **p &lt;0.01, ***p &lt;0.001, n.s.=not significant.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS190168-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Activity related to time pressure and switches to checking.</title><p>A) Activity in all six ROIs – Hb (Ai), DRN (Aii), AI (Aiii), ACC (Aiv), SN (av), and VTA (Avi) – was correlated with time pressure (an index of threat level) and, in ACC and AI activity reflected the switch to checking (p&lt;0.0002; two-tailed; Z&gt;3.1).

B-J) PPI analyses showing interaction between Hb and SN (B, F, I), VTA (C,G,JI), and DRN (D,H,KJ) as a function of time pressure and checking. When we looked at all check trials (B, C, D) there was a three-way interaction between Hb activity, time pressure, and switching to check on B) SN, C) VTA, and D) DRN activity; as time pressure increased, and when participants switched to checking, then higher Hb activity was associated with higher activity in SN, VTA, and DRN. Subsequent analyses looked at checks separately as a function of whether they revealed a predator for the first time (F, G, H) or not (I, J, K). When a switch to checking revealed a new predator, there was an additional, slightly later, negative three-way interaction between Hb activity, time pressure, and switching to check in SN, VTA, and DRN.
