While extensive research has focused on noroviruses, our understanding of sapoviruses (SaVs) and their interactions with the host’s immune response remains limited. HuSaVs have been challenging to propagate in vitro, making the porcine sapovirus (PSaV) Cowden strain a valuable model for studying SaV pathogenesis. In this study we show, for the first time, that PSaV Cowden strain has mechanisms to evade the host’s innate immune response. The virus 3C-like protease (NS6) inhibits type I IFN production by targeting TBK1. Catalytically active NS6, both during ectopic expression and during PSaV infection, targets TBK1 which is then led for rapid degradation by the proteasome. Moreover, deletion of TBK1 from porcine cells led to a significant increase in PSaV titres, emphasizing its role in regulating PSaV infection. Additionally, we successfully established PSaV infection in IPEC-J2 cells, an enterocytic cell line originating from the jejunum of a neonatal piglet. Overall, this study provides novel insights into PSaV evasion strategies, opening the way for future investigations for SaV-host interactions, and enabling the use of a new cell line model for PSaV research.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Sapovirus</kwd><kwd>caliciviruses</kwd><kwd>protease</kwd><kwd>NS6</kwd><kwd>TBK1</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>type I IFN</kwd><kwd>proteasomal degradation</kwd><kwd>IPEC-J2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Sapoviruses (SaVs) are small non-enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family. Together with noroviruses they are the main cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide in both children and adults. SaVs are classified into at least 19 genogroups (GI to GXIX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], depending on their genetic diversity, and they have been found to infect various animal species and humans. SaVs have a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome ranging from 7.1 to 7.7 kbp, which is linked at the 5’ end to the virus-encoded VPg protein. The SaV genome contains two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1 and ORF2. An additional ORF (ORF3) has been predicted in several sapovirus strains, however its function is still unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. ORF1 encodes all non-structural proteins and the major structural protein VP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], ORF2 encodes the minor structural protein VP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. ORF1 is translated to a polyprotein that undergoes proteolytic processing by the virus encoded 3C-like protease NS6. In SaVs, the protease is found as a protease-polymerase fusion protein and not further processed into the mature NS6 protease and NS7 RNA polymerase domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. This characteristic shared with feline caliciviruses (FCV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], but not observed in any other <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> member.</p><p id="P3">Among the SaV strains infecting humans, genogroups GI and GII are the primary cause of gastroenteritis out-breaks as well as sporadic cases. For over 40 years since its discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], human sapovirus (HuSaV) could not be propagated <italic>in vitro</italic> until recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Prior to these advancements, the porcine sapovirus (PSaV) Cowden strain (belonging to genogroup GIII) served as a valuable model for studying SaV pathogenesis and it remains the only SaV for which a robust reverse genetics system is available. The ability of this strain to replicate in porcine kidney cells <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] and the establishment of a reverse genetics system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] made it an appealing model with which to uncover the basic mechanisms of SaV biology.</p><p id="P4">PSaV is most likely endemic in pigs worldwide. It has been detected in fecal samples of domestic pigs from around the world, and in wild boars in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Although so far there is no reported SaV transmission between swine and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], there were concerns for potential zoonotic infections or recombination events, due to high genetic similarity of some PSaV strains and HuSaV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. While there is extensive research on the interplay between noroviruses and the host immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], our understanding of SaV in this context is limited. Nevertheless, it is known that SaVs exhibit sensitivity to type I IFN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], indicating the involvement of innate immune pathways in controlling SaV infections, and highlighting the need to understand the potential mechanisms employed by SaVs to evade the host’s immune response.</p><p id="P5">Innate immunity is the primary line of defense against viruses and other pathogens. In part, it relies on pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], which detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). RIG-I and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) are RLRs that recognise viral RNA genome and RNA replication intermediates. Recognition of these PAMPs triggers a cascade of signalling events via the activation of mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. MAVS signals via the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and Inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB Kinase ε (IKKε) proteins, leading to the activation of IRF3 and IRF7 transcriptional factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Upon their activation, these transcription factors translocate to the nucleus and induce transcription of type I interferons (IFNs) and other antiviral or immunoregulatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Here we show that PSaV Cowden strain has mechanisms to counteract the host innate immune response. Specifically, we have found that the virus protease (NS6) inhibits the type I IFN response by targeting TBK1 for proteasomal degradation in a manner dependent on its protease activity. TBK1 protein levels are significantly decreased during PSaV infection and they are completely rescued when the proteasome was inhibited. Depletion of TBK1 from cells, led to a significant increase of infectious PSaV titres. This highlights the critical role of TBK1 in regulating PSaV infection, and elucidates the rationale behind the targeting of TBK1 by NS6. Finally, here for the first time we established PSaV infection in IPEC-J2 cells, enteric epithelial cells, originally derived from the jejunum of a neonatal piglet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. In conclusion, our study reveals that PSaV Cowden strain, the only PSaV strain adapted to grow <italic>in vitro</italic>, possesses mechanisms to evade the host’s innate immune response. Our research shows that SaVs have mechanisms to counteract their host’s response, and paves the way for further investigations into SaV-host interactions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Cell lines and virus</title><p id="P7">HEK293T (ATCC CRL-11268), were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Sigma Aldrich), Parental LLC-PK1 (ATCC CL-101) cells and LLC-PK1 EV or KO (described in 2.7) were grow in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM, Gibco).

There is a well-established precedent for a role of viral proteases in the regulation of the IFN response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Recent studies on the human norovirus protease have indicated its capability to cleave NEMO, the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], although it is unclear how this cleavage impacts the viral life cycle. In SaVs the protease (NS6) is produced as a fusion with the polymerase (NS7). RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), when ectopically expressed, have been shown to generate uncapped 5’-triphosphate RNAs, which are recognized by RIG-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], therefore driving a robust type I IFN response. This capability can be used to establish a reporter readout in cells that relies on the activity of the authentic viral polymerase and has previously been described, the 5Br assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Briefly, over-expression of an RdRp, NS7 in the case of noroviruses, induces downstream activation of signalling pathways, such as IRF3 and NF-κB. Co-transfection of a luciferase reporter where the luciferase gene is under the control of the type I IFN promoter enables the measurement of this activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine if NS6 is an IFN antagonist, we examined the ability of NS6 to inhibit the response driven by NS7 over-expression in this assay. We generated constructs encoding the PSaV NS6-7 fusion where one of the two, or both, were catalytically active, or inactive. We co-transfected these constructs, together with an IFN-β reporter, and we further stimulated the cells with poly(I:C) transfection or left them unstimulated (NS). Active NS7 (Pol<sup>WT</sup>) induced a robust IFN-β activation, but this was only observed when NS6 was catalytically inactive (Pro<sup>MUT</sup>). Active NS6 (Pro<sup>WT</sup>) significantly inhibited IFN-β activation driven by either NS7 RdRp activity, or by poly(I:C) transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that it is a type I IFN antagonist. To further demonstrate that this effect was driven through RIG-I mediated sensing, we employed reporter gene assays where IFN-β activation was achieved by ectopic expression of RIG-I CARD domains. The IFN-β reporter and the RIG-I-CARD domains were co-expressed with increasing doses of NS6-7, where NS7 was catalytically inactive to avoid background reporter activation. NS6 restricted IFN-β activation in a dose-response and statistically significant manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Overall, these results show that NS6 strongly inhibits type I IFN activation.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><label>3.2</label><title>NS6 restricts the type I IFN pathway at the level of TBK1</title><p id="P20">To further understand how NS6 antagonizes the IFN response, we sought to investigate where on the pathway the inhibitory function is exerted. For this, we again employed reporter gene assays and we stimulated IFN by over-expression of components of the pathway, such as RIG-I-CARD, TBK1 and the constitutively active IRF3-5D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Ectopic expression of these proteins results in activation of the pathway at that particular point and its subsequent activation downstream. These molecules were co-expressed together with the IFN-β reporter and the NS6-7 (Pro-Pol) fusion, where NS6 was catalytically active (WT), or inactive (MUT). In both cases, NS7 was catalytically inactive (MUT), to prevent signal transduction caused by the <italic>de novo</italic> initiation activity. We observed that only the expression of a catalytically active NS6 significantly reduced IFN-β activation downstream of both RIG-I and TBK1 over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>). Inhibition was not observed when activation was driven by overexpression of IRF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that NS6 acts at the level of TBK1.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><label>3.3</label><title>NS6 interacts with and modulates the protein levels of TBK1</title><p id="P21">Our findings so far demonstrate that NS6 restricts type I IFN response at the level of TBK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>). To further investigate if NS6 specifically targets TBK1 for cleavage, we co-expressed HA-tagged NS6-7 fusion proteins, where NS6 is active (WT), or inactive (MUT), with FLAG-tagged porcine TBK1 (pTBK1), or GFP as a control. Although no cleavage product was observed, the total level of TBK1 protein was reduced in the presence of WT NS6, but not in the presence of a catalytically inactive NS6, while the level of GFP remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). To investigate this further and determine if this was due to limitations of the TBK1 antibody to detect a cleaved product, we used a double-tagged pTBK1 construct. We cloned pTBK1 into a mammalian expression vector with a FLAG-tag on its N-terminus and an HA-tag on its C-terminus. We overexpressed the double-tagged construct with catalytically active or inactive NS6 alongside the single-tagged pTBK1 (FLAG-pTBK1) as a control. No cleavage product was detected after immunoblotting with either anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Nevertheless, the reduction of TBK1 protein levels was consistent and independent of whether TBK1 was single or double tagged.</p><p id="P22">Since porcine and human TBK1 share 96% amino acid identity, and sapovirus proteases have been reported to share cleavage sites, we sought to determine if human sapovirus (HuSaV) NS6 protease also had a similar effect on pTBK1 protein levels. To address this, we cloned wild type HuSaV (GI.2 strain) NS6-7 into a mammalian expression vector. mCherry-tagged HuSaV and PSaV NS6-7 were then overexpressed together with FLAG-tagged pTBK1, or GFP as control. The PSaV NS6-7 was used as a positive control, whereas a condition without a protease was also included. The expression of either PSaV or HuSaV NS6-7 lead to a substantial decrease in TBK1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), but not of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Thus far, our results revealed a consistent reduction in TBK1 total protein levels, without the detection of an apparent cleavage product. To further investigate the interplay between NS6 and TBK1, and to determine if there is a physical association, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) assays. Specifically, we overexpressed HA-tagged NS6-7, where NS6 was WT or MUT, or HA-GFP, together with FLAG-tagged pTBK1. A FLAG IP was performed and samples were analysed by immunoblotting. TBK1 was found to interact with NS6-7, but not with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>), the presence of WT NS6 led to a reduction in TBK1, resulting in less TBK1 being pulled-down compared to the other conditions. Nevertheless, traces of NS6-7 were still identified, indicating the persistence of the NS6-7/TBK1 complex.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><label>3.4</label><title>TBK1 protein levels are reduced during PSaV infection</title><p id="P24">To investigate the TBK1 protein levels during infection, we infected LLC-PK1 cells with a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) of PSaV (5 TCID50/cell) and collected samples at different time points post-infection (pi). Viral protein expression was detectable by western blot primarily from 8 h pi onwards, although some VPg precursors were observable at 4 h pi. In line with our previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), we found that the levels of TBK1 were reduced from 16 h pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Quantification of the TBK1 levels observed during PSaV-infected LLC-PK1 cells, revealed that the total TBK1 levels were reduced by at least 50% when compared to mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). To assess whether the decreased expression of TBK1 was cell-type specific, we established PSaV infection in the IPEC-J2 cells, an enterocyte cell line originally derived from the jejunum of a neonatal piglet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. We found that the presence of bile acid (GCDCA) was required for efficient infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), with 300 μM being the optimal concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). High MOI infection in the IPEC-J2 cells demonstrated that TBK1 levels were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), in agreement with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A-B</xref>). Quantification of the TBK1 levels in PSaV-infected IPEC-J2 cells showed that the protein levels were decreased by approximately 50% when compare to uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>), similarly to what we observed in LLC-PK1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><label>3.5</label><title>NS6-mediated reduction of TBK1 levels is proteasomal-dependent</title><p id="P25">As detailed above, we were unable to identify a TBK1 cleavage product in either infected cells or in cells over-expressing NS6-7. The use of a double-tagged protein also failed to clearly identify a cleavage product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, to understand the mechanism of NS6-7 mediated TBK1 degradation, we sought to identify the cellular degradation pathway(s) that could mediate the subsequent turnover of the cleaved TBK1. We treated pTBK1 and NS6-7 co-transfected cells with increasing doses of inhibitors for cellular caspases (zVAD-FMK), lysosomal degradation (NH4Cl) or proteasomal degradation (MG132 and lactacystin). A construct encoding inactive NS6 (MUT) was also included as control. We found that TBK1 levels were unaffected in the presence of NS6 MUT, or when cells were treated with either of the proteasome inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), suggesting that TBK1 is cleaved by catalytically active NS6 and then targeted for rapid degradation by the proteasome. An additional protein product with a lower molecular mass was detected in lactacystin-treated cells (indicated with blue arrow). Further investigation showed that this anti-TBK1 reactive protein product was present in lactacystin-treated cells independently of the enzymatic activity of NS6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting that it is an unspecific protein which cross-reacts with the anti-FLAG antibody in the conditions tested.</p><p id="P26">In order to assess whether cleaved TBK1 is also targeted for proteasomal degradation during the course of infection, we infected LLC-PK1 cells at high MOI (5 TCID50/cell) in the presence or absence of zVAD-FMK or MG132. TBK1 levels were reduced in both DMSO- and zVAD-FMK-treated cells upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), which is in accordance with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In contrast, MG132 treatment, rescued TBK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), confirming our findings that TBK1 is targeted for degradation via the proteasome.

For this, we generated TBK1 knockout (KO) LLC-PK1 cells by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated targeting of <italic>Tbk1</italic> exon 3, which is conserved in all porcine TBK1 isoforms that result in the same size protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). After single cell selection and clonal expansion, cells were confirmed to lack TBK1 by both genomic sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). A clone that lacked TBK1 protein expression and in which the <italic>Tbk1</italic> open reading frame was disrupted by frameshift mutation in both alleles, was selected. In parallel to the KO line, another clonal line was generated by using an empty vector (EV) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">methods</xref> for details). The EV line exhibited similar TBK1 expression as the parental line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), and the single clone selection did not influence PSaV replication in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). As a further validation, we transfected the EV or KO LLC-PK1 cell lines with poly(I:C) to induce innate immune response, and we measured the <italic>IFN-β</italic> mRNA levels by RT-qPCR. Deletion of TBK1 did not affect <italic>IFN-β</italic> basal levels, but it had a profound effect on <italic>IFN-β</italic> transcription upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). We then infected TBK1 WT (EV) or KO cells with PSaV at a low MOI (1 TCID50/cell) and we measured total virus production 24 h pi by TCID50. PSaV titres from TBK1-deficient cells were 0.5-Log10 more than in WT cells, corresponding to 2.6-fold higher virus titres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Finally, this fold increase on virus yield was consistent and it was observed in 2 independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Taken all together, TBK1 plays a crucial role in facilitating type I IFN production in LLC-PK1 cells, and its deletion has a positive effect on PSaV replication and virus yield.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="discussion"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">Viruses constantly evolve to circumvent the host’s IFN response, in order to establish a successful infection. PSaV Cowden strain was the first SaV to successfully propagate <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] and to have a reverse genetic system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. It is surprising therefore that our knowledge about SaV-host interactions is currently limited. PSaV is sensitive to type I IFN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], and thus we sought to understand which mechanisms it utilises to counteract innate immune responses. We found that the 3C-like protease (NS6) of PSaV Cowden strain is an IFN antagonist, by inhibiting the type I IFN production at the level of TBK1. We also showed that TBK1 is targeted by NS6, and for this, the enzymatic activity of NS6 is required. Finally, the role of TBK1 in the IFN response against PSaV was confirmed in immortalised cells deficient for TBK1. PSaV infection in these cells results in a 2.6-fold increase of viral titres.</p><p id="P29">Positive-sense RNA viruses encode 3C or 3C-like proteins, which are chymotrypsin-like proteases. There is compelling evidence that various viral proteases of RNA viruses function as IFN antagonists by cleaving proteins involved in the IFN response, such as MAVS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], TRIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] and NEMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Recent studies within the <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family have revealed that the 3C-like proteases of human norovirus and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) counteract the host’s immune response by cleaving NEMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] and MAVS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], respectively. Whether PSaV NS6 also cleaves these proteins is yet to be determined. However, our results indicate that it also employs alternative mechanisms, as our results demonstrate that it targets TBK1, which is downstream of MAVS.</p><p id="P30">Despite multiplex experimental approaches, we did not detect any apparent NS6 cleavage product of TBK1. Notably, porcine picornavirus and poliovirus 3C proteases have been found to induce degradation of cellular targets without without the appearance of readily detectable cleavage products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. One plausible explanation for our results is that TBK1 may undergo cleavage at a proximal site, leading to rapid instability. In contrast to the porcine picornavirus and poliovirus studies detailed above, here we have demonstrated that TBK1 is degraded via the proteasome, as MG132 and lactacystin treatments restored both ectopic and endogenous levels of TBK1. The ability of viruses to target TBK1 is not unique to PSaV, as there is evidence of other viruses to either cleave TBK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], or induce its degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], as a means to impair the host’s IFN response.</p><p id="P31">Our findings indicate that TBK1 is targeted during late stages of infection, and there are several potential reasons for this observation. Firstly, it is plausible that NS6 does not co-localise with TBK1 during earlier stages of the virus life cycle, or that TBK1 activation and thus its adoption of a different structural conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] are necessary for their interaction to occur. Moreover, TBK1 may hold important pro-viral roles earlier during infection. A recent study demonstrated that PSaV induces RIPK1-dependent necroptosis, which promotes virus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. TBK1, along with IKK-ε and other IKKs, phosphorylates RIPK1, negatively regulating its kinase activity and ultimately promoting cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that NS6 targets TBK1 at a specific time pi to finely regulate the phosphorylation and activity of RIPK1. It should be noted that although TBK1 was deleted from LLC-PK1 cells, we do not anticipate a decrease in the expression levels of IKKs. This suggests that the kinase activity of RIPK1 may still be regulated to some extent. Finally, while our study has demonstrated that TBK1 is targeted during late stages of PSaV infection, it is important to acknowledge that the virus may exhibit additional mechanisms to circumvent the innate immune response earlier in the infection process. These mechanisms, have not been examined and are the subject of future investigations.</p><p id="P32">While LLC-PK1 cells have been widely used as a model for propagating PSaV, they are kidney cells and likely do not represent the natural target for PSaV. In this study, we successfully established PSaV infection in IPEC-J2 cells by supplementing the culture medium with bile acids. Specifically, we tested Glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), although it is possible that other bile acids may enhance PSaV replication to a greater extent. IPEC-J2 cells are derived from the jejunum of neonatal piglets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], which represents one of the natural hosts for PSaV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. These cells exhibit striking similarities to primary intestinal epithelial cells, making them a valuable tool for investigating the interactions between the porcine gut epithelium and enteric viruses and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first instance of PSaV infection in IPEC-J2 cells. Thus, we have provided a new, relevant tool for further investigations of PSaV replication cycle, pathogenesis, and host response in the context of the porcine intestinal environment.</p><p id="P33">Our study provides the first evidence of a SaV protein to act as innate immune antagonist. Our discovery that HuSaV NS6 also targets porcine TBK1, which shares over 96% aa identity with human TBK1, could be significant for HuSaV research. Furthermore, considering the genetic similarity between some PSaVs and HuSaVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], our findings may suggest a similar mechanism employed by HuSaV to circumvent the type I IFN response. Recent advancements in propagating HuSaV in diverse cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] and human intestinal enteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], have expanded the opportunities for studying HuSaV.

B) Immunoblot analysis of LLC-PK1 parental (Par), EV and KO lines for endogenous levels of TBK1 and GAPDH. The positions of molecular mass markers in kDa are shown on the left. C) LLC-PK1 WT (EV) and TBK1 KO cells were transfected with 1 ug/mL poly(I:C) or left untransfected as non-stimulated (NS) control. Six h later, cells were lysed and total RNA was extracted, followed by RT-qPCR. The <italic>IFN-β</italic> levels were compared to <italic>β-actin</italic> levels of each sample, and then everything was compared to EV NS to obtain fold increase. Data shown are representatives of 2 independent experiments done in triplicate. D) TBK1 WT (EV) and KO LLC-PK1 cells were infected with PSaV at 1 TCID50/cell for 24 h. Total virus yield was then measured by TCID50. Data shown are representatives of 2 independent experiments done in triplicate. E) PSaV yield from TBK1 WT (EV) and KO LLC-PK1 cells from 2 independent experiments, represented as fold change. Fold increase was calculated within each experiment. Statistical significance was measured by a Student’s <italic>t-</italic>test. ns: non-significant, **<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01, ****<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001.
