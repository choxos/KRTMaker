Its life cycle entirely relies on the cytoplasmic fate of the viral RNA genome (vRNA) through a fine-tuned equilibrium between vRNA translation, replication and packaging into new virions, all within virus-induced replication organelles (vRO). In this study, with an RNAi mini-screening and subsequent functional characterization, we have identified insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) as a new host dependency factor that regulates vRNA synthesis. In infected cells, IGF2BP2 associates with viral NS5 polymerase and redistributes to the perinuclear viral replication compartment. Combined fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization-based confocal imaging, <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays, and immunoprecipitation coupled to RT-qPCR, showed that IGF2BP2 directly interacts with ZIKV vRNA 3’-nontranslated region. Using ZIKV sub-genomic replicons and a replication-independent vRO induction system, we demonstrated that IGF2BP2 knockdown impairs <italic>de novo</italic> viral organelle biogenesis and, consistently, vRNA synthesis. Finally, the analysis of immunopurified IGF2BP2 complex using quantitative mass spectrometry and RT-qPCR, revealed that ZIKV infection alters the protein and RNA interactomes of IGF2BP2.

ZIKV belongs to the <italic>Orthoflavivirus</italic> genus within the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family which comprises over 70 arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV) and yellow fever virus. Similar to the closely related DENV, ZIKV is primarily transmitted to humans by <italic>Aedes</italic> spp mosquito bites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) and can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. When vertically transmitted to a fetus during pregnancy, this neurotropic virus can infect the placenta as well as neural progenitor cells, microglial cells and astrocytes in the developing brain, which may eventually cause severe microcephaly in newborns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Unfortunately, no antiviral treatments against ZIKV or prophylactic vaccines are currently approved. It is thus important to better understand the molecular mechanisms controlling the ZIKV replication in order to identify new therapeutic targets.</p><p id="P3">ZIKV is a single-stranded positive sense enveloped RNA virus. Its ~11 kb-long viral RNA (vRNA) genome is composed of an open reading frame flanked by 5’ and 3’nontranslated regions (NTR). The vRNA plays a central role in different steps of the viral replication cycle including being translated to produce all viral proteins, is used as template for genome neosynthesis and is selectively packaged into assembling viral particles. The vRNA, translated at the ER membrane, encodes one polyprotein which is matured into 10 viral proteins. Three structural proteins (C, prM and E), together with vRNA assemble new viral particles, and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) are responsible for vRNA neosynthesis, via the activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NS5 along with the contribution of other viral proteins and host factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). To efficiently replicate, orthoflaviviruses have evolved to establish a fine-tuned equilibrium between vRNA translation, replication and encapsidation steps since they cannot occur simultaneously. However, the mechanisms underlying the spatio-temporal fate of vRNA remain elusive. These processes occur in viral replication organelles (vRO) which result from major alterations of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are believed to coordinate in time and space the steps of the life cycle, notably through the spatial segregation of the vRNA, at different steps of the life cycle. vROs accumulate in a large cage-like compartment which is located in the perinuclear area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Three architectures of these viral organelles-like ultrastructures have been described: vesicle packets (VP), virus bags (VB), and convoluted membranes (CM). The VPs resulting from ER invagination, are spherical vesicles with a diameter of approximately 90 nm connected to the cytosol through a 10 nm-wide pore-like opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). They are believed to host vRNA synthesis. Indeed, the non-structural proteins NS5, NS3, NS1, NS4A and NS4B, absolutely required for vRNA replication, and also double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the viral RNA replication intermediate, are enriched in VPs as imaged by immunogold labeling followed by transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). It has been proposed that the RNA genome exit VPs through their pore to be directly packaged into assembling particles budding into the ER lumen. Immature virions geometrically accumulate in dilated ER cisternae referred to as virus bags (VB). The viral and cellular determinants of vRO biogenesis are poorly understood mostly because this process will be impacted (even indirectly) by any perturbations of viral replication efficiency and hence, viral factors abundance. The recent advent of replication-independent VP induction systems identified several determinants of <italic>de novo</italic> VP biogenesis, most notably including, ZIKV NS4A, NS1 and 3’NTR RNA, as well as host factors ATL2, VCP and RACK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Multiple reports have shown that cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBP) regulate the replication, translation and/or encapsidation of vRNA often through associations with 5’ or 3’ NTRs (for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>)). For instance, YBX1 associates with 3’ NTR of DENV vRNA and regulates both vRNA translation and viral particle production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether all these proteins are co-opted and regulate replication within a single ribonucleprotein (RNP) complex. In case of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), a <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> from the <italic>Hepacivirus</italic> genus, it was shown that the YBX1 RNP comprising HCV vRNA, IGF2BP2, LARP1, DDX6 and other cell proteins regulates the equilibrium between viral RNA replication and infectious particle production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). However, it is unknown whether this is a conserved co-opting mechanism in the <italic>Orthoflavivirus</italic> genus (which belongs also to the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family) and if so, whether these viruses modulate the composition of this complex to rewire its functions in favor of replication. Finally, considering that the 3’ NTR of vRNA is a key player of vRO morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), this raises the hypothesis that this viral process involves host vRNA-binding proteins prior to vRNA synthesis.</p><p id="P5">To determine whether the co-opting of these RNA-binding proteins was conserved in the <italic>Orthoflavivirus</italic> genus, we have assessed in this study the potential role of 10 host RBPs in ZIKV and DENV replication. We have identified insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) as a new host dependency factor for the ZIKV life cycle which regulates vRNA synthesis. In infected cells, IGF2BP2 associates with NS5 viral polymerase and vRNA 3’NTR. Importantly, IGF2BP2 impairs <italic>de novo</italic> vRO biogenesis and consistently, vRNA synthesis. Finally, ZIKV infection alters the protein and RNA interactomes of IGF2BP2. Altogether, our data support that ZIKV hijacks and remodels the IGF2BP2 ribonucleoprotein complex, to regulate vRO biogenesis and vRNA neosynthesis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>IGF2BP2 regulates ZIKV replication cycle</title><p id="P6">To identify new cellular proteins regulating ZIKV and DENV vRNA functions during viral replication, we hypothesized that these orthoflaviviruses have evolved to share conserved host co-opting mechanisms with HCV which belongs to the <italic>Hepacivirus</italic> genus within the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family like the <italic>Orthoflavivirus</italic> genus. Based on our previous work with host RBPs regulating HCV life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), we performed a targeted small scale RNA interference (RNAi) screening assessing the requirement of 10 host RBPs for ZIKV and DENV replication. Protein knockdown (KD) in human hepatocarcinoma Huh7.5 cells was achieved through the transduction of short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing lentiviruses, whose respective efficiencies in this cell line were previously validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). None of these shRNA had any impact on cell viability as measured by MTT assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Two days post transduction, cells were infected with pathogenic contemporary ZIKV H/PF/2013 strain (Asian lineage), ancestral ZIKV MR766 strain (African lineage) or serotype 2 DENV2 16681s strain. Two days post-infection (dpi), infectious viral particle production was measured by plaque assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-D</xref>). The KD of DEAD-box helicases RHA (RNA helicase A, also named DHX9), DDX6, DDX21 or DDX5 had no significant impact in virus production when compared to the non-target control shRNA (shNT). In contrast, the knockdowns of IGF2BP2 and LARP1 resulted in significant decrease and increase in the titers of both ZIKV strains, respectively. The observed phenotype was specific to ZIKV since no significant impact was observed for DENV. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-D</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To validate these phenotypes, we took advantage of ZIKV FSS13025 strain-based reporter viruses expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc), whose activity in infected cells can be used as a read-out of overall vRNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). IGF2BP2 KD resulted in a significant 60% decrease in viral replication. In contrast, LARP1 KD had no stimulatory effect on viral replication, suggesting a role of this host factor in virus assembly and/or release. Of note YBX1, YBX2 and DDX3 KD all resulted in a decrease in ZIKV replication although this did not translate into impacts in virus titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-F</xref>). We decided to focus further investigation on IGF2BP2 since it was our best candidate in terms of ZIKV replication impairment upon knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>). First, western blotting and RT-qPCR with transduced Huh7.5 cell lysates validated that IGF2BP2 was efficiently knocked down upon transduction at both protein and mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>), which correlated with a 74% decrease in ZIKV production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) and reductions in the expression of viral proteins NS3, NS4A and NS5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Comparable impairment of ZIKV titers upon IGF2BP2 knockdown was observed in other cell lines relevant for ZIKV pathogenesis, namely human immortalized astrocytes (NHA-hTERT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) and cancer-derived trophoblasts (JEG-3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>) as well as for a third wild-type ZIKV strain in Huh7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), <italic>i.e</italic> ZIKV FSS13025 (Asian lineage, isolated in Cambodia in 2010).</p><p id="P8">Our initial screen showed that IGF2BP2 KD had minimal impact on DENV2 replication, suggesting a ZIKV-specific phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). To confirm this, we have included in our workflow four additional strains of DENV representing the four known serotypes. IGF2BP2 knockdown did not changed the production of DENV1, DENV2 or DENV4, while DENV3 replication was only slightly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-E</xref>). As control, treatment with NITD008, an inhibitor of flaviviral NS5 polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) completely abrogated viral particle production for all orthoflaviviruses tested. Finally, IGF2BP2 KD had no impact on the replication of either WNV, another orthoflavivirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3F</xref>), or of SARS-CoV-2, another positive strand RNA virus from the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Overall, these data clearly show that the IGF2BP2 is a specific host dependency factor for ZIKV replication.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>IGF2BP2 redistributes to ZIKV replication complexes in infected cells</title><p id="P9">Following the observations that IGF2BP2 is a ZIKV host dependency factor, we investigated the impact of ZIKV infection on IGF2BP2 expression and subcellular distribution. We performed western blotting on extracts of either uninfected or ZIKV-infected Huh7.5 cells. IGF2BP2 expression remained unchanged at 2 and 3 days post-infection in contrast to DDX3 and DDX5 whose levels were decreased over the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Then, we investigated the localization of IGF2BP2 in infected cells using confocal microscopy. In uninfected cell, IGF2BP2 exhibited a homogenous distribution throughout the cytoplasm. In ZIKV-infected cells, an accumulation of IGF2BP2 in areas enriched for NS3 and viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was observed at 2 days post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), correlating with a partial colocalization with NS3 and dsRNA (Manders’ coefficients of 0.45±0.04 and 0.46±0.04, respectively). dsRNA is an intermediate of vRNA replication and hence, anti-dsRNA antibodies detect replication complexes, which along with VPs, typically accumulate in a cage-like region in the perinuclear area with viral proteins required for vRNA replication step, such as NS3 and NS5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). This compartment is typically surrounded by NS3-positive convoluted membranes which are devoid of dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). A similar, yet less pronounced, phenotype was observed at an earlier time point (1 dpi, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The relocalization of IGF2BP2 into the replication compartment raised the hypothesis that this protein interacts with viral proteins involved in vRNA replication. To test this, we generated Huh7.5 cells stably expressing HA-tagged IGF2BP2 to subsequently perform co-immunoprecipitation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). As control, we first confirmed that this tagged recombinant protein, similarly to endogenous IGF2BP2, also redistributed to the dsRNA-positive area in ZIKV infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). We next performed anti-HA immunoprecipitations with extracts from uninfected and ZIKV infected cells. Western blot analysis of immunopurified complexes showed that IGF2BP2-HA specifically associates with ZIKV NS5 polymerase but not with NS3 protease/helicase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C-D</xref>). Overall, these data show that ZIKV infection induces the physical recruitment of IGF2BP2 to the replication compartment, and further suggest that IGF2BP2 might contribute to vRNA synthesis through interactions with NS5 polymerase.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>IGF2BP2 associates with ZIKV RNA</title><p id="P11">Considering that IGF2BP2 associates with NS5 in the replication compartment and that it possesses RNA-binding activities, we evaluated whether IGF2BP2 interacts with ZIKV vRNA. IGF2BP2, along with IGF2BP1 and IGF2BP3 paralogues are highly conserved oncofetal RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) belonging to the Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein family, which typically regulate the post-transcriptional regulation of cellular RNAs. With their roles in the splicing, transport, translation, and stabilization of a wide variety of RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), IGF2BP1, 2 and 3 are involved in numerous cellular function, such as differentiation, migration, metabolism and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). IGF2BP2 is composed of six canonical RNA-binding domains, namely two N-terminal RNA-recognition motifs (RRM) and four C-terminal human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-K homology (KH) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To assess a potential association between IGF2BP2 and ZIKV vRNA, we first performed protein immunostaining coupled to single RNA molecule fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) using signal-amplified DNA branched probes to detect IGF2BP2 and ZIKV RNA, respectively. ZIKV RNA was specifically visualized since no FISH signal was detected in uninfected cells while in ZIKV-infected cells, vRNA exhibited a punctate distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Co-staining of vRNA and IGF2BP2 revealed their partial colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, white arrows, mean Manders’ coefficient=0.28±0.02 (n=31)), which strongly suggests that IGF2BP2 associates with the ZIKV RNA genome.</p><p id="P13">To test this, we performed anti-HA co-immunoprecipitation assays using extracts of Huh7.5 cells as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>. Immune complexes were subjected to RNA purification and subsequently to RT-qPCR to detect viral genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). While the overexpression of IGF2BP2 had no impact on total vRNA levels, we detected a highly significant enrichment of vRNA in purified IGF2BP2-HA complexes compared to the negative specificity control (no IGF2BP2-HA expression). This demonstrates that vRNA and IGF2BP2 are part of the same RNP complex. To further investigate if IGF2BP2 can interact with ZIKV vRNA in a direct manner, we have performed <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays using microscale thermophoresis (MST) with different regions of ZIKV vRNA and IGF2BP2 protein. We have focused our analysis on vRNA 5’ NTR and 3’ NTR, which are highly structured and are absolutely required for vRNA synthesis and translation, notably through interactions with viral and host factors (for a review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>)). Moreover, it has been shown that IGF2BP2 preferentially binds to 3′ and 5′ untranslated regions of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). ZIKV RNA 3’ NTR and 5’ NTR were synthetized by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. In parallel recombinant IGF2BP2 N-terminal and C-terminal moieties containing either the two RRM (IGF2BP2<sub>RRM</sub>) or both KH3 and KH4 domains (IGF2BP2<sub>KH34</sub>), respectively were produced in bacteria and subsequently purified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). MST revealed that IGF2BP2<sub>KH34</sub> binds both ZIKV 5’ NTR and 3’ NTR with high affinity with respective K<sub>d</sub> of 203 nM ± 51 and 418 nM ± 49, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). In stark contrast, IGF2BP2<sub>RRM</sub> specifically associated with ZIKV 3’ NTR with a lower affinity (K<sub>d</sub> = 1,598 nM ± 257) but this interaction was highly specific since no binding was detected between this recombinant protein and ZIKV 5’ NTR. It is noteworthy to mention that we could not assess higher IGF2BP2<sub>RRM</sub> concentrations than 10 μM to reach binding saturation because of protein aggregation. Overall, these data demonstrate that IGF2BP2 directly and specifically interacts with vRNA in infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>ZIKV regulates vRNA replication</title><p id="P14">The fact that IGF2BP2 associates with both ZIKV NS5 RdRp and vRNA led us to hypothesize that IGF2BP2 is involved in the vRNA replication step of ZIKV life cycle. To test this, we took advantage of reporter ZIKV subgenomic replicons based on the H/PF/2013 genome (ZIKV sgR2A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). This engineered genome has been deleted for the coding sequence of structural proteins and expresses Rluc in frame with the NS1-NS5 polyprotein. When <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed genomes are introduced in cells by electroporation, they autonomously replicate but neither virus assembly nor entry occur because of the lack of structural proteins. Hence, the luciferase activity in transduced Huh7.5 cells was used as a read-out of viral RNA replication two days post-electroporation. Strikingly, ZIKV sgR2A replication was attenuated in IGF2BP2 KD, with a significant 40% decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). To rule out that this phenotype was due to a potential defect in vRNA translation, we used mutated Rluc-expressing ZIKV sub-genomes which express a defective NS5 RdRp and do no replicate (ZIKV sgR2A GAA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A, B</xref>). Hence, the Rluc activity detected at 4 hours post-electroporation entirely relies on viral RNA translation. IGF2BP2 knockdown did not have any significant impact on Rluc activity in Huh7.5 cells transfected with either sgR2A or sgR2A GAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). These data show that IGF2BP2 positively regulates ZIKV genome replication (but not its translation), which is most likely mediated through its interactions with NS5 and vRNA.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>ZIKV infection modulates the interactions between IGF2BP2 and its endogenous mRNA ligands</title><p id="P15">Since IGF2BP2 associates with NS5 and vRNA and accumulates in the viral replication compartment, we hypothesized that ZIKV infection induces a remodeling of IGF2BP2 RNP notably regarding its content in endogenous mRNA partners. To test this, we performed immunopurifications of IGF2BP2 complexes followed by RT-qPCR as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> in order to determine the relative abundance of three known IGF2BP2 mRNA ligands (namely <italic>TNRC6A, PUM2</italic> and <italic>CIRBP</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) in both control and ZIKV-infected cells. <italic>TRNC6A, PUM2</italic> and <italic>CIRBP</italic> mRNAs were selected because ZIKV is known to alter their N6-adenosine methylation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), an epitranscriptomic RNA modification that increases the affinity for IGF2BP2, a known “m6A reader”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). As expected, we could specifically detect these mRNA in purified IGF2BP2 complexes in uninfected cells (Mock+IGF2BP2-HA condition; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figs. 7A-C</xref>).

These results show that ZIKV infection modifies the interaction between IGF2BP2 and specific endogenous mRNAs and is consistent with the notion of a virus-induced remodeling of IGF2BP2 RNP.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>ZIKV alters IGF2BP2 proteo-interactome in infected cells</title><p id="P16">Next, to assess our hypothesis of a ZIKV-remodeled IGF2BP2 RNP, we investigated whether ZIKV infection changes the protein interaction profile of IGF2BP2. We first performed western blotting on purified IGF2BP2-HA samples (prepared as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) to detect IGF2BP1, IGF2BP3 and YBX1 which are known IGF2BP2 partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).

As expected from results shown in 4C, the viral RdRp NS5 was readily detected in this complex. Interestingly, confocal microscopy showed ZIKV infection induced an accumulation of IGF2BP1, IGF2BP3 and YBX1 in the replication compartment as for IGF2BP2 with partial colocalization with dsRNA and NS3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S4, S5C-D</xref>), which supports that ZIKV physically co-opts an RNP containing these fours RBPs. This phenotype was specific to these host factors as it was not observed for the RNA-binding proteins DDX5 and LARP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A-D</xref>). Consistent with the fact that these proteins (including NS5) belong to a ribonucleoprotein complex containing IGF2BP2, their interaction with IGF2BP2 was RNA-dependent since they were barely detectable in the immunoprecipitates when the cell extracts were treated with RNase A prior to anti-HA pull-down (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>) To globally evaluate changes in the IGF2BP2 interactome upon infection, we analyzed the protein composition of IGF2BP2-HA complexes immunopurified from uninfected cells or infected with ZIKV or DENV by mass spectrometry. We identified 527 proteins which specifically interacted with IGF2BP2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A-B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The abundance of over 86% of the proteins in IGF2BP2-HA complexes (455 proteins), including IGF2BP1, IGF2BP3 and YBX1 remained unchanged upon either infection (as expected from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A-D</xref>). In contrast, in ZIKV-infected cells, the interactions of IGF2BP2 with 40 and 22 proteins were either decreased or increased, respectively, with 52 of these changes being specifically observed only in ZIKV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A</xref>). Gene ontology analysis of the 62 partners whose interaction with IGF2BP2 was altered during ZIKV infection, revealed a high enrichment of biological processes related to mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>). The interactome tree of these 62 IGF2BP2 protein partners generated with STRING database highlighted two major clusters regulated by ZIKV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9C</xref>). In line with our gene ontology analysis, one of these clusters comprised proteins involved in mRNA splicing for most of which interaction with IGF2BP2 was significantly decreased during ZIKV infection (red circles). The second identified cluster was related to ribosome biogenesis.</p><p id="P17">One of the best partners specifically modulated by ZIKV and/or DENV was Atlastin 2 (ATL2) whose interaction with IGF2BP2 was the most significantly increased upon ZIKV infection (p-value = 10<sup>-5.7</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>; highlighted with * in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B</xref>).

We validated this ZIKV-specific phenotype by co-immunoprecipitation assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S6A, S7C-D</xref>) in which we could detect a 14-fold increase in IGF2BP2-HA/ATL2 interaction when cells were infected with ZIKV compared to uninfected or DENV-infected samples. As an additional specificity control, we did not detect any interaction between ATL2 and HA-tagged VCP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7C</xref>), an ER quality control protein which was shown to be physically recruited into DENV and ZIKV replication compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), ruling out that ATL2/IGF2BP2 interaction is simply due to the presence of ATL2 within remodeled ER or because of non-specific binding to the HA-tag.

Since IGF2BP2 KD decreases vRNA replication and thus, indirectly reduces the overall synthesis of viral proteins that drive vRO formation, evaluating this hypothesis in infected cells was not possible. To tackle this challenge, we took advantage of a recently described plasmid-based system (named pIRO-Z)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) which induces vROs <italic>de novo</italic> in transfected cells in a replication-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10A</xref>).

Confocal microscopy of NS3-immunolabeled cells confirmed that the transfection efficiencies were comparable between all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10C-D</xref>). When imaged by electron microscopy, VPs were detected in 70% of the shNT-transduced cells. In contrast, IGF2BP2 knockdown resulted in a decrease in the proportion of cells containing vROs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10E-F</xref>) while the diameter of VPs remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10G</xref>). These results demonstrate that IGF2BP2 plays a role in the biogenesis of ZIKV VPs independently from vRNA synthesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">In this study, to identify new host factors that regulate viral processes involving the orthoflavivirus vRNA, we have assessed 10 RNA-binding-proteins which were previously reported to regulate the life cycle of HCV, an hepacivirus belonging to the same <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family as DENV and ZIKV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). For instance, YBX1, IGF2BP2, LARP1, DDX6, C1QBP1 were reported to positively regulate HCV RNA synthesis while inhibiting the production of infectious viral particles. Our RNAi mini-screen assessing the impact of gene depletion on DENV or ZIKV infection revealed that overall, such host factor-mediated regulations are not fully conserved across the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. Only LARP1 knockdown reduced ZIKV replication while it increased virus production as observed for HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). A comparable trend was observed for YBX1 although the differences were not significant. In case of DENV, none of the tested RNA-binding proteins increased infectious particle production. The fact that the phenotypes did not fully mirror those we have reported for HCV might reflect the differences in the architecture of the vROs induced by orthoflaviviruses (<italic>i.e</italic>., invaginated vesicles in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>)) compared to that of HCV double-membrane vesicles which result from ER protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). The best observed phenotype in our RNAi mini-screen was observed with IGF2BP2 knockdown which inhibited the replication of ZIKV but not that of other tested orthoflaviviruses or SARS-CoV-2, another positive-strand RNA virus from the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family. We further observed that ZIKV induced a relocalization of IGF2BP2 to the replication compartment in which it associates with NS5 and vRNA. Consistently, IGF2BP2 knockdown decreased the efficiency of vRNA synthesis (but not its translation) correlating with an impairment in VP formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). This highlights that IGF2BP2 is an important regulator of the vRNA replication step of ZIKV life cycle. Of note, the overexpression did not result in an increase of vRNA abundance. We believe that this is because endogenous IGF2BP2 is highly expressed in cancer cells such as the Huh7.5 cells used here and is presumably not limiting for viral replication in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Early in the ZIKV replication cycle, newly produced viral nonstructural proteins induce ER alterations to form VPs which will host the vRNA synthesis machinery including NS5 RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms governing VP morphogenesis remain poorly understood, mostly because it is experimentally challenging to discriminate phenotypes related to vRO morphogenesis from those resulting from perturbations in vRNA replication which reduce viral protein input and hence, VP abundance indirectly. In this study, using a recently engineered replication-independent VP induction system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), we identified IGF2BP2 as a novel regulator of ZIKV <italic>de novo</italic> VP biogenesis. Interestingly, IGF2BP2 associates with ZIKV RNA 3’ NTR and ATL2, which are both co-factors of VP formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), suggesting that they all regulate this process as part of the same RNP complex. <italic>In vitro</italic> RNA binding assays showed that IGF2BP2 can interact directly and specifically with vRNA 3’NTR via its RRM domains. A recombinant protein comprising the third and fourth KH domains of IGF2BP2 also bound 3’ NTR. However, this interaction appeared less specific since a comparable affinity was observed for the 5’ NTR <italic>in vitro</italic>. Besides, we cannot exclude that IGF2BP2 binds additional vRNA regions in the coding sequence, which was not tested in this study. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the KH domains of IGF2BPs mediate the binding to <italic>N</italic><sup><italic>6</italic></sup>-methylated adenosines in mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), a modification that has been detected within the RNA genome of ZIKV and other <italic>Flavividae</italic> viruses, including in the 3’ NTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Since IGF2BP2 is a “m6A reader” through KH3 and KH4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>), it is highly plausible that this RNA modification contributes to the vRNA binding specificity and the proviral roles of this host factor. Considering that the binding of KH3 and KH4 of IGF2BP1 paralogue to RNA can induce conformational changes of the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>), it will be interesting to evaluate whether IGF2BP2 co-opting by replication complexes (most likely via NS5) contributes to the structural switches and/or secondary and tertiary structures of vRNA controlling its fate during the life cycle.</p><p id="P22">To study the impact of ZIKV infection on IGF2BP2 association with endogenous RNAs, we decided to focus our analysis on three known IGF2BP2 mRNA ligands namely <italic>CIRBP, TNRC6A</italic> and <italic>PUM2</italic>. We chose to focus on those mRNA because: i) ZIKV, in addition to other <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> viruses (DENV, WNV and HCV) alter their N<sup>6</sup>-adenosine methylation status during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>), and ii) IGF2BP2 is a well described “m<sup>6</sup>A reader” which regulates the fate of bound RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). More specifically, it has been shown that ZIKV infection decreases m<sup>6</sup>A content of <italic>CIRBP</italic> mRNA and increases the one of <italic>PUM2</italic> and <italic>TNRC6A</italic> mRNAs. Unexpectedly, we observed a decreased interaction between these overmethylated mRNAs and IGF2BP2 while IGF2BP2/<italic>CIRBP</italic> mRNA association remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). This counterintuitive observation might be due to additional layers of IGF2BP2 regulation such as potential virus-dependent posttranslational modifications. Indeed, the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) was reported to phosphorylate two residues of IGF2BP2 (Ser162/Ser164) which are located between the second RRM domain and the first KH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). The simultaneous phosphorylation of these two serine residues strongly enhances the interaction between IGF2BP2 and IGF-II leader 3 mRNA 5’UTR. Interestingly, our preliminary mass spectrometry analysis of IGF2BP2 phosphopeptides abundance indicate that ZIKV decreases phosphorylation of Ser162, but not that of Ser164. Moreover, several studies reported that ZIKV infection inhibits mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that ZIKV, through the mTOR pathway, regulates the affinity of IGF2BP2 for endogenous mRNAs by modulating its phosphorylation status.</p><p id="P23">Our interactome analysis revealed global changes in the composition of IGF2BP2 RNP with 62 cellular proteins whose association with IGF2BP2 was altered during ZIKV infection. Most notably, ZIKV infection decreased IGF2BP2 interaction with 15 proteins of the mRNA splicing machinery. Interestingly, there is evidence that IGF2BP2 regulates mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) in addition to its most characterized functions in mRNA stability and translation. Furthermore, several studies reported that ZIKV infection alters mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). It was proposed that the expression of the subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), a viral non-coding RNA comprising vRNA 3’ NTR (and hence, predicted to associate with IGF2BP2 as ZIKV genome) alters splicing efficiency by sequestering splicing factors SF3B1 and PHAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). In case of DENV, NS5 was shown to associate with core components of the U5 snRNP particle and to also modulate splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). If such activity is conserved for ZIKV NS5, it is tempting to speculate that mRNA splicing is regulated in ZIKV-infected cells by an IGF2BP2/NS5/sfRNA complex. We have also demonstrated that ZIKV infection specifically induces the association between IGF2BP2 and ATL2, an ER-shaping protein which was previously reported to be required for DENV and ZIKV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). The fact that the knockdown of IGF2BP2 and ATL2 (this study and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>)) both impaired vRO biogenesis suggests that this process involves this ZIKV-specific ATL2-IGF2BP2 complex. Considering that 3’NTR is an important co-factor of VP formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), this complex might contribute to enriching vRNA to VPs through IGF2BP2/3’NTR interaction. It is noteworthy to mention that in DENV-infected cells, IGF2BP2 is relocalized to the replication compartment and associates with vRNA (unpublished data) but not with ATL2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7C-D</xref>). However, IGF2BP2 KD had very little or no effect on all tested DENV strains in contrast to ZIKV and despite our multiple attempts, we could not demonstrate evidence of a specific interaction between IGF2BP2 and DENV NS5. This suggests that i) ATL2 and NS5 are not directly involved in IGF2BP2 physical hijacking and RNA-binding activity, ii) that the physical co-opting of IGF2BP2 is not sufficient to confer the proviral activity of this host factor. However, ATL2 was reported to regulate DENV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) even if it does not associate with IGF2BP2 in that infection context. Interestingly, ATL2 interactome analysis in uninfected and DENV-infected cells showed that it associates RBMX and HNRNPC, two other known “m<sup>6</sup>A readers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). Intriguingly, ATL2/RBMX interaction was detected only in DENV-infected cells, suggesting that it is induced by the infection and might play a similar role as the one of IGF2BP2/ATL2 in case of DENV. Finally, the interaction of IGF2BP2 with both NS5 and ATL2 was RNA-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>), which is not surprising as RNA is often a structural component of ribonucleoprotein complexes. This further supports the idea that IGF2BP2 associates with NS5 and the ER after its binding to the viral RNA.</p><p id="P24">The results described in this study allows the elaboration of a model for IGF2BP2 involvement in ZIKV life cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>). In this model, very early in the life cycle, IGF2BP2 associates with vRNA and subsequently to newly synthesized NS5 (step 1). This correlates with changes in the protein composition of IGF2BP2 RNP, including induced interactions with ATL2, which target NS5/vRNA complex to the ER (step 2). Via these changes in the stoichiometry of IGF2BP2 RNP, specific endogenous IGF2BP2 mRNA ligands such as <italic>PUM2</italic> and <italic>TNRC6A</italic> mRNAs are excluded from IGF2BP2 RNP. Subsequently, this ER-bound complex induces morphological alterations of the ER membrane with the contribution of vRNA 3’ NTR and the ER-shaping activity of ATL2 to generate VPs (step 3). In addition to providing an optimal environment for vRNA synthesis, the VPs are believed to contribute to the spatial segregation of the replication complexes, assembling particles and the translation machinery, hence regulating the equilibrium between the multiple fates of vRNA. With that in mind, we cannot exclude that IGF2BP2 contributes to the coordination between replication and assembly by targeting vRNA to/through the VP pore for selective encapsidation into particles budding into the ER (step 4).</p><p id="P25">Overall, this study highlights the physical and functional interplay between ZIKV replication machinery and IGF2BP2 RNP in infected cells.

The biological process analysis generated by STRING is also shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS192705-f009"/></fig><fig id="F10" position="float"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>IGF2BP2 regulates the biogenesis of ZIKV replication organelles.</title><p>(A) Schematic representation of the pIRO system. Upon transfection in cells expressing the T7 RNA polymerase, this plasmid allows the cytoplasmic transcription of NS1-NS5 polyprotein under the control of T7 promoter, in a ZIKV replication-independent manner. NS1-5 polyprotein synthesis is under the control of ECMV IRES. The presence of both ZIKV 3’ NTR and 5’ cyclization sequence (5’ CS) is required for efficient VP induction. Finally, the activity of HDV ribozyme ensures that the 3’ terminus of the RNA is similar to that of vRNA genome. Huh7-Lunet-T7 were transduced with shRNA-expressing lentiviruses at a MOI of 5-10. Two days later, transduced cells were transfected with pIRO-Z plasmid. Sixteen hours later, cells were analyzed for (B) IGF2BP2 mRNA levels by RT-qPCR to measure knockdown efficiency, (C-D) transfection efficiency by confocal imaging of NS3-labeled cells, and (E) for VP content by transmission electron microscopy. Electron micrographs were used to measure (F) the percentage of cells with VPs and (G) the diameter of VPs in each condition. ***: p&lt;0.001; NS: not significant (unpaired t-test).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS192705-f010"/></fig><fig id="F11" position="float"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><title>A model for IGF2BP2 involvement in ZIKV life cycle.</title><p>Step 1: After NS protein synthesis early after virus entry, IGF2BP2 associates with NS5 and vRNA, thus excluding PUM2 and TNRC6A mRNA from the RNP. Step 2: The infection-induced association between IGF2BP2 RNP and ATL2 allows the targeting of vRNA/NS5 to the ER. Step 3: Viral factors and ATL2 induce the bending of the ER membrane and the formation of VPs allowing highly processive vRNA synthesis. Step 4: IGF2BP2 might be involved in the packaging of vRNA into assembling viruses by targeting the genome to the VP pore. IGF2BP2 recruitment to the replication compartment by be dependent on its mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation status.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS192705-f011"/></fig></floats-group></article>
