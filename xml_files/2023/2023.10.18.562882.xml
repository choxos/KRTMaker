Detecting their subcellular distribution is crucial to gain insights into membrane organisation and is most commonly done by over-expression of biosensors. However, this leads to perturbations of phosphoinositide signalling and is challenging in systems that cannot be transfected. Here, we present a toolkit for the reliable, fast, multiplex, and super-resolution detection of all 8 phosphoinositides using a unifying staining approach for fixed cells and tissue, based on recombinant biosensors with self-labelling SNAP tags. These recombinant biosensors are highly specific, and reliably visualise the subcellular distributions of phosphoinositides across scales, ranging from 2D or 3D cell culture to <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue. Using stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, we reveal the nanoscale organisation of PI(3)P on endosomes and PI(4)P on the Golgi and confirm the preservation of subcellular membranes. Multiplex staining enables the investigation of phosphoinositide conversions and reveals an unexpected presence of residual PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> positive membranes in swollen lysosomes following PIKfyve inhibition. This approach enables the versatile, high-resolution visualisation of multiple phosphoinositide species in an unprecedented manner.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Membrane identity is key to cellular function. A crucial hallmark of this identity are the phosphoinositides, a small family of phospholipids generated by phosphorylation of their phosphatidylinositol (PI) headgroup. Through the stepwise addition and removal of phosphate groups by lipid kinases and phosphatases, 8 distinct phosphoinositides can be generated that recruit specific effector proteins and thereby regulate a myriad of cellular functions. As such, the different phosphoinositides are involved in basically every cellular event involving membrane dynamics; ranging from cytokinesis to cell migration, autophagy, T-cell activation, membrane contact site regulation, as well as in their most well-known role as regulators of membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Edwards-Hicks et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gulluni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jimenez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Tremel et al., 2021</xref>) see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Posor et al., 2022</xref>) for recent review). In line with their cell biological importance, continuing efforts are being undertaken to establish and refine tools to visualise their subcellular distribution.</p><p id="P3">Key to the visualisation of phosphoinositides is the identification of effector domains that specifically recognise the differentially phosphorylated headgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hammond and Balla, 2015</xref>). These effector domains are often conserved Pleckstrin or Phox homology (PH and PX) domains but can also be structural folds such as GRAM, FYVE and Zinc finger domains, or the WD40 propeller found in WIPI1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Dooley et al., 2014</xref>). To further complicate matters, some proteins bind to specific phosphoinositides through polybasic regions without any conserved secondary structure, such as Exoc7 (Exo70) as part of the exocyst complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Maib and Murray, 2022</xref>). Through the combined effort of the community, these effector domains have been optimised to generate biosensors to detect phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wills et al., 2018</xref>). With the recent addition of a PX domain from <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> that recognises PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Vines et al., 2023</xref>), we now possess biosensors for each of the eight different phosphoinositides (albeit with uncertainties about PI(5)P). A common feature of many of these biosensors is the use of tandem and triple repeats to increase binding through an avidity effect, as is the case for the 3xPH domain of TAPP1, the 3xPHD domain from ING2, the 2xFYVE domain of Hrs and the 2xPX domain of SnxA to recognise PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, PI(5)P, PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> respectively.</p><p id="P4">The most common way to visualise the subcellular localisation of phosphoinositides is to ectopically overexpress the lipid effectors fused to fluorescent proteins as biosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wills et al., 2018</xref>). This approach allows for detection of membrane identity changes in live cells and has been of immense value over the last decades. However, it also suffers from a major drawback: as these biosensors are generated to have a high affinity, they can all potentially out-compete endogenous effector proteins and thereby perturb the very pathway that is under investigation. In contrast, biosensors with lower affinity and expression levels are themselves out-competed by endogenous effectors. Furthermore, this over-expression based approach is limited by the ability to deliver DNA into cells or requires time and labour extensive genomic engineering. It is therefore still a challenge for experimentalists to visualise these critically important lipids, especially in more complex systems such as 3D cell cultures or whole tissues.</p><p id="P5">One way to circumvent these pitfalls has been to stain for phosphoinositides after fixation and permeabilization using immunocytochemical techniques based on recombinant biosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gillooly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Watt et al., 2002</xref>) and antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hammond et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Maekawa and Fairn, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Marat et al., 2017</xref>). While this approach is unable to provide dynamic information, it does avoid perturbation of phosphoinositide signalling and does not require overexpression. However, the need of fixatives and detergents requires careful optimisations to avoid artifacts and the available antibodies require different staining protocols for the visualisation of distinct pools of their respective targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hammond et al., 2009</xref>). As such, there is currently no reliable tool to comprehensively visualise all subcellular phosphoinositide pools with a unifying staining approach.</p><p id="P6">To address these shortcomings, we have developed recombinant biosensors against all eight phosphoinositides in combination with self-labelling protein tags (SNAP). With the exception of the only known biosensor against PI(5)P, all of these probes are easy to purify using standard bacterial expression systems and demonstrate excellent specificities, as determined using an <italic>in vitro</italic> supported lipid bilayer approach. Using a single, unified staining protocol, we show that these probes reliably visualise all phosphoinositide species after fixation and permeabilisation and reproduce their known subcellular localisations. The ease of conjugating distinct fluorophores to the SNAP tag enables the use of inorganic dyes, including those that are compatible with super resolution STED microscopy. This reveals the nanoscale organisation of PI(3)P at endosomes and of PI(4)P at the Golgi while furthermore verifying the preservation of subcellular membranes. Labelling with distinct fluorescent dyes <italic>in vitro</italic> enables multiplex imaging and allows for the detection of phosphoinositides across scales and model systems as shown by staining in HeLa cells, NMuMG spheroids and <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal wings. To highlight the versatility of this approach, we investigate the interdependence of phosphoinositide conversion by multiplex staining for PI(3)P, PI(4)P and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> after inhibition of lipid kinases in MIA-Paca2 cells. These experiments unveil an unexpected sequestration of residual PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> positive membranes in swollen lysosomes following PIKfyve inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Recombinant biosensors are straightforward to produce and are highly phosphoinositide specific</title><p id="P7">The cell biology community has spent considerable effort to identify effector domains of proteins that recognise specific phosphoinositides for the use as biosensors (see table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). To test their suitability as recombinant probes, we designed effectors with an N-Terminal 6xHis tag followed by a SNAP tag and a flexible linker region for bacterial expression. With the exception of the 3xPHD domain of ING2 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Discussion</xref>), these recombinant biosensors are readily purified with high yields from <italic>E. coli</italic> using a standard three-step purification procedure of Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinity followed by ion exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. The inclusion of a SNAP tag then allows for versatile <italic>in vitro</italic> labelling of the probes using inorganic fluorophores for multiplexed and/or super resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To test the specificities towards their respective targets, we labelled the biosensors with SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor 488 <italic>in vitro</italic> and formed supported lipid bilayers on silica beads with liposomes composed of 95% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), and 5% of each phosphoinositide. These membrane coated beads are an ideal substrate to evaluate binding specificities, as they faithfully mimic the charge and fluidity of biological membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Pucadyil and Schmid, 2010</xref>). The quality of the lipid bilayers is verified by including 0.1% of fluorescently labelled lipids (here Atto647N-DOPE) and using this signal to generate a membrane mask to quantify the recruitment of the biosensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The biosensor for PI is a modified version of a bacterial, PI-specific PLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Pemberton et al., 2020</xref>) and shows good specificity towards PI albeit with lower affinity compared to the other probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The biosensor for PI(3)P is the well known tandem repeat of the FYVE domain from HRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Burd and Emr, 1998</xref>) and shows excellent specificity and affinity for PI(3)P with some weak binding towards PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The probe for PI(4)P is the effector domain of SidC (also known as P4C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Dolinsky et al., 2014</xref>) and shows strong binding to PI(4)P with some background binding to the other mono-phosphates PI(3)P and PI(5)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The probe for PI(5)P is the triple repeat of the PHD domain from ING2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gozani et al., 2003</xref>) and shows little specificity. Even though this probe shows stronger binding to PI(5)P compared to PI, PI(3)P, PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(4)P, it binds even more strongly to the other 5’ containing di- and tri-phosphates, suggesting a charge based binding effect in addition to 5’ binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Therefore, even though this biosensor displayed promising results from overexpression in cells, it is unlikely to be suitable as recombinant biosensor. The biosensor for PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> is the triple repeat of the C-terminal PH domain from TAPP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Goulden et al., 2019</xref>) and shows good specificity and affinity with some binding to the di- and tri-phosphates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), likely due to the strong positive charge of this probe (with a pI of 9.7). The biosensor for PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> is the recently described tandem repeat of a PX domain from <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Vines et al., 2023</xref>) and shows excellent specificity and affinity with almost undetectable binding to any of the other phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). The biosensor for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is the well-established PH domain from PLC-δ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Garcia et al., 1995</xref>) and shows reassuring specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2g</xref>). And finally the biosensor for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is the PH domain from BTK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Fukuda et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Salim et al., 1996</xref>) and shows good specificity with some minor binding to PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2h</xref>). These comprehensive and directly comparable <italic>in vitro</italic> data validate the specificity for each of the recombinant biosensors, and suggest their possibility for use in staining approaches.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Subcellular visualisation of all phosphoinositide species by a unified staining approach</title><p id="P10">Visualisation of phosphoinositides using these recombinant biosensors requires cell fixation and permeabilisation. Importantly, multiplex imaging requires a unifying staining protocol that is easy to use while preserving all of the distinct phosphoinositide pools, whether they are at the plasma membrane, Golgi, or endosomes. To achieve this objective, HeLa cells were fixed with prewarmed (37°C) 4% PFA with 0.2% Glutaraldehyde and permeabilised using 0.5% Saponin on ice and stained with 500nM of each of the separate biosensors labelled with Alexa 488 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">methods</xref> for more details).</p><p id="P11">The staining for PI in HeLa cells shows a rather diffuse pattern with some membrane staining but poor contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This is likely due to the relatively low affinity of this probe and the almost ubiquitous presence of this phosphoinositide on subcellular membranes. The staining for PI(3)P on the other hand shows excellent signal to noise ratio with clear labelling of endo/lysosomal structures throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The PI(4)P staining shows excellent labelling of all known pools of this phosphoinositide, including the Golgi, trafficking vesicles, and the plasma membrane at junctions between cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The cellular staining using the recombinant biosensor against PI(5)P shows no localisation to membranes, with the only clear signal in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). This is most likely due to the strong negative charge of open DNA and agrees with the mainly unspecific, charge based binding seen with supported lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Staining with the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> biosensors reveals faint vesicular staining, in agreement with the low steady state levels of this rare phosphoinositide in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). In agreement with its known localisation the PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> biosensor stains weakly the plasma membrane with enrichment at membrane ruffles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). The PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> biosensors reveals strong plasma membrane and a weak intracellular staining, in agreement with the well described presence of minor pools of this phosphoinositide on intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Finally, the biosensor for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> shows selective staining of sub-regions of the plasma membrane such as the leading edge and structures reminiscent of macropinocytic cups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). In summary, these stains demonstrate a unifying protocol for staining and visualization of all phosphoinositide species.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Recombinant biosensors in combination with STED microscopy reveal the nanoscale organisation of phosphoinositides</title><p id="P12">Understanding the nanoscale organisation of phosphoinositides at sub-cellular membranes is key towards gaining novel insights into their functions. To investigate this organisation, and to verify the preservation of sub-cellular membranes, we harnessed super-resolution microscopy. The inclusion of self-labelling protein tags allows for the use of bright, photostable, inorganic Janelia®Flour dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Grimm et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Grimm et al., 2021</xref>) that are exceptionally well-suited for stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy. Staining HeLa cells with the PI(3)P biosensor conjugated to JFX650 shows the well-established endosomal localisation of this phosphoinositide in “microdomains” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Gillooly et al., 2003</xref>). When viewed using STED microscopy, however, it is revealed that these domains are indeed nanoscale membrane tubulations as well as smaller vesicles that cluster around these larger endosomes and potentially fuse with, or bud from them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), as has been seen previously using correlative light and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Pucadyil and Schmid, 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To gain more insights into the nanoscale organisation of phosphoinositides, we investigated the distribution of PI(4)P at the Golgi using the same, universal staining protocol. HeLa cells expressing endogenously tagged Arf1<sup>EN-</sup>Halo were first stained live against the Halo tag using the JF571 fluorophore before being fixed, permeabilised and stained against PI(4)P using the recombinant biosensor conjugated to JFX650. Arf1 is a crucial factor in the generation of PI(4)P at the Golgi through recruitment of PI4K IIIβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Highland and Fromme, 2021</xref>) and this combination of dyes allows for two-colour STED imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wong-Dilworth et al., 2023</xref>). Excitingly, the staining for PI(4)P reveals distinct nanoclusters of this lipid at the curved rims of the cisternae where budding of trafficking intermediates is thought to occur as well as diffuse staining throughout the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The localization of the PI(4)P sensor is in fact reminiscent of COPI clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wong-Dilworth et al., 2023</xref>). Thereby, this robust approach for the visualisation of phosphoinositides enables super-resolution interrogation of membrane organisation while preserving the structure of sub-cellular membranes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Multiplex detection of phosphoinositides across scales and model systems</title><p id="P14">A staining protocol, which preserves the subcellular organisation of membranes and is compatible with the detection of each of the distinct phosphoinositides, opens up the possibility for multiplex imaging. As proof of principle, HeLa cells were stained with recombinant biosensors against PI(3)P, PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> conjugated to Alexa488, 546 or 647 and imaged using Airyscan microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Amongst numerous observations, we noted PI(4)P positive tubules in direct contact with PI(3)P positive endosomes in the vicinity of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> positive plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> (insert)). This multiplex approach highlights the intricate interactions of membranes with distinct phosphoinositide identities, critically important to the organisation of organelle contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Posor et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P15">An important advantage of recombinant biosensors is that it avoids the need of overexpression. As such, it allows for the detection of phosphoinositides in cells and tissues that cannot easily be transfected and negates the need of genome engineering. To highlight this advantage, we grew NMuMG spheroids in Matrigel for 5 days and used the same staining protocol as previously to detect PI(3)P, PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). As in 2D cell culture, these three phosphoinositides show an intricate interaction at the subcellular level with strong labelling of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at cell-cell junctions. To further test the utility of this approach in whole tissues, we stained <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal wings against PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in combination with conventional Phalloidin to visualise the actin cytoskeleton and cellular junctions. Consistent with the results from 3D culture, the recombinant biosensor against PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> shows strong labelling of cellular junctions throughout the whole tissue. Noticeably, PI(4)P is also enriched at these junctions albeit with a more diffuse staining pattern, indicating the presence of intracellular PI(4)P membranes in close proximity to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). These observations are in good agreement with the dynamic regulation of these two lipids at cell junctions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue to drive recruitment of polarity proteins through electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Dong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P16">These experiments demonstrate conclusively that this toolkit enables the visualisation of several phosphoinositide species simultaneously without the adverse effects of overexpression.

To highlight this advantage, and to make use of a novel PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Vines et al., 2023</xref>), we decided to focus on the conversion cascade leading to the generation of this rare phosphoinositide. Staining for PI(4)P, PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in combination with Airyscan microscopy reveals the close relationship of these three phosphoinositide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). While PI(4)P membranes are often in close proximity to PI(3)P containing endosomes, it is rarely found on the same vesicle. PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> on contrast is located on the same membrane as PI(3)P and enriched in domains that likely represent membrane tubulations and budding/fusion of smaller vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). To investigate the conversion cascade of PI → PI(3)P → PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, we used specific kinase inhibitors to block each conversion step in MIA–Paca2 cells, due to a low steady state level of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in HeLa cells. As expected, treatment with the potent pan PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin (at 300nM for 60 min) eliminates vesicular staining for PI(3)P as well as for PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, with minor effects on PI(4)P distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref> middle). Treatment with Apilimod, a highly selective and effective PIKfyve inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cai et al., 2013</xref>) (at 1μM for 60 min), leads to the accumulation of PI(3)P on endosomes as well as the formation of swollen lysosomes, and the depletion of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. We also observed some morphological changes in the organisation of PI(4)P membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref> bottom). This confirms the specificity of the staining approach and that the generation of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> is strictly dependent on the prior formation of PI(3)P, which accumulates on endosomes when its conversion into PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> is blocked.</p><p id="P18">Upon closer inspection of the images, we noticed that the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> biosensor detects a distinct signal in the lumen of the swollen lysosomes upon PIKfyve inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Importantly, these intraluminal membranes are inaccessible to a cytosolically expressed PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> biosensor - highlighting an additional limitation of this conventional approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). To address the nature of this staining, we investigated these swollen lysosomes using standard thin section electron microscopy. This orthogonal technique confirms the presence of these intraluminal membranes, corresponding to the staining observed using the recombinant PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> biosensor. This unexpected detection of residual PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> membranes following PIKfyve inhibition highlights another advantage of the staining approach by making intraluminal membranes accessible that are otherwise hidden from the cytosolic overexpression of these probes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">The subcellular detection of phosphoinositides using fluorescence microscopy has been instrumental for the investigation of these signalling lipids.

However, these antibodies detect different phosphoinositide pools depending on the staining protocol. As such, after permeabilisation with Saponin, they detect PI(4)P at the plasma membrane but not at the Golgi. Conversely, permeabilisation using Digitonin enabled visualisation of PI(4)P at the Golgi but abolishes staining of PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hammond et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, the recombinant biosensors that we have presented here, allow visualisation of all of these distinct phosphoinositide pools with the same, Saponin based, staining protocol. Still, to reach all subcellular compartments, their surrounding membranes have to be disrupted using detergents, which might introduce artifacts. To address this concern, we used super resolution STED microscopy and could confirm that sub-cellular organelles retain their structure following this staining protocol. Therefore, these recombinant biosensors offer a clear advance for the subcellular detection of phosphoinositides. However, some minor pools might always escape detection due to being occupied by endogenous effectors.</p><p id="P21">Out this toolkit of biosensors, the probe to detect PI(5)P is the only one that is challenging to produce recombinantly. The only established probe to detect this elusive phosphoinositide is based on the Zinc finger domain of ING2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gozani et al., 2003</xref>) and has shown promising results in over-expression based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Pendaries et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Vicinanza et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is highly unstable as recombinant protein, requires supplementation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and aggregates at high concentrations; although it can be separated from its aggregates in low concentrations using size-exclusion chromatography. Disappointingly though, even after careful biochemical qualification, the recombinant probe shows little specificity towards PI(5)P <italic>in vitro</italic> and only shows unspecific staining of the nucleolus when used to stain cells. Therefore, further work will have to be carried out in order to identify a reliable probe that works as recombinant biosensor to detect PI(5)P.</p><p id="P22">The nanoscale organisation of phosphoinositides is crucial for the recruitment of effector proteins and the downstream regulation of cellular function. To shed more light on this we made use of the development of inorganic fluorophores in combination with super resolution STED microscopy and stained cells with recombinant biosensors against PI(3)P and PI(4)P. The organisation of PI(3)P in microdomains on endo/lysosomes has been well described for over two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Gillooly et al., 2003</xref>) however their precise organisation has been somewhat unclear. By using STED, we could show that these domains are indeed nano tubulations and smaller vesicles in agreement with correlative light and electron microscopy of small GTPases on early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Franke et al., 2019</xref>). This nanoscale organisation is supported by the role of PI(3)P as effector for EEA1 in the tethering of early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Murray et al., 2016</xref>), as well as in recruitment of ESCRT-0 in the formation of multi vesicular bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Banjade et al., 2022</xref>) and in regulation of the CCC complex in WASH mediated recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Singla et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, PI(4)P is a crucial identity determinant of the Golgi and regulates secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Waugh, 2019</xref>). The nanoclusters we have observed here are consistent with the clustering of this lipid through multiple effectors in the formation of AP1 and COPI coats ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lorente-Rodriguez and Barlowe, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Tan and Brill, 2014</xref>)) and opens up new avenues for future research. We believe that this approach of staining for phosphoinositides in combination with STED microscopy will reveal further insights into the nanoscale organisation of phosphoinositides in the years to come.</p><p id="P23">The ability to reliably stain for phosphoinositides enables the investigation of these crucial lipids across scales and model systems. In addition to super resolution microscopy, the versatility of self-labelling protein tags makes differential labelling and multiplex imaging possible. As proof of principle, we have performed triple staining of the most abundant phosphoinositides: PI(3)P, PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in 2D as well as 3D cell culture. This highlights the close interactions these membranes, as has been shown for the role of PI(4)P containing membranes in regulating the scission of PI(3)P positive endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Boutry et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gong et al., 2021</xref>). To further highlight the versatility of our approach, we stained <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal wing tissue against PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(4)P in combination with Phalloidin to visualise actin filaments. This approach clearly detects high levels of both PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at cellular junctions throughout the whole tissue. We noticed that the levels of PI(4)P at junctions seemed to increase from 2D to 3D cell culture and tissue. While warranting further research, this increase in negatively charged phospholipids in polarised systems is in good agreement with the recruitment of polarity proteins through electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Dong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lu et al., 2022</xref>). Importantly, the ability to visualise phosphoinositides in model systems that are difficult to genetically modify has the potential to reveal novel insights into their functions on the tissue scale and furthermore opens up the possibility to investigate these conserved lipids in eukaryotes across the evolutionary tree.</p><p id="P24">Multiplex staining also enables the investigation of phosphoinositide conversion cascades, as we have shown for the generation of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> following inhibition of different lipid kinases. Unexpectedly, this also revealed the presence of residual PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> positive membranes in the lumen of swollen lysosomes following PIKfyve inhibition using Apilimod. While the formation of these swollen lysosomes is well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cai et al., 2013</xref>), the nature of these intraluminal vesicles is less clear. Importantly, these intraluminal vesicles are inaccessible to cytosolic kinases and phosphatases. Thus, since PIKfyve is the only known kinase that generates PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, these pools must be present prior to Apilimod treatment and sequestered into these terminal lysosomes where they cannot be broken down. Further, PIKfyve forms a constitutive complex with the scaffolding protein Vac14 and the lipid phosphatase Fab1 that catalyses 5’ dephosphorylation of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> back to PI(3)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lees et al., 2020</xref>). This indicates an intricate cross regulation of the PIKfyve:Vac14:Fab1 complex to avoid futile phosphorylation cycles. In this context, it is tempting to speculate that the inhibition of PIKfyve might also indirectly influence the activity of Fab1. Further work into this regulation is underway and the ability to stain for phosphoinositides and visualise intraluminal membranes will be crucial towards its progress.</p><p id="P25">Taken together, we believe that this toolkit is a valuable addition to the repertoire of cell biologists to investigate phosphoinositide biology. Finally, this approach has the potential to reveal novel insights related to health and disease, especially in cell types and models that cannot be transfected, such as patient derived primary cells and tissue sections.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Constructs and Cloning</title><p id="P26">DNA for all biosensors was optimized for bacterial expression, synthesised, and cloned into standard ITPG inducible bacterial expression vectors containing Kanamycin resistance.
