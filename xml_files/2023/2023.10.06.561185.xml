These adaptations are well described for peripheral tissue, though much less is known about how the energy-expensive brain adapts to food restriction, and how such adaptations differ across the sexes. Here, we examined how food restriction impacts energy usage and function in the primary visual cortex (V1) of adult male and female mice. Molecular analysis and RNA sequencing in V1 revealed that in males, but not in females, food restriction significantly modulated canonical, energy-regulating pathways, including pathways associated with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that in contrast to males, food restriction in females did not significantly affect V1 ATP usage or visual coding precision (assessed by orientation selectivity). Decreased serum leptin is known to be necessary for triggering energy-saving changes in V1 during food restriction. Consistent with this, we found significantly decreased serum leptin in food-restricted males but no significant change in food-restricted females. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that cortical function and energy usage in female mice are more resilient to food restriction than in males. The neocortex, therefore, contributes to sex-specific, energy-saving adaptations in response to metabolic challenge.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Mammals reduce their energy usage in times of food scarcity. These adaptations have been well documented for peripheral tissues and are sex-specific. For example, females, as compared to males, readily lose muscle and bone mass to reduce peripheral energy expenditure during food restriction, but lose less fat mass and overall bodyweight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, females are more likely to suppress energy-costly, reproductive functions during food restriction than males, evidenced by substantive reductions in uterine and ovarian mass, as well as a cessation of reproductive function and behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Such sex-specific differences are thought to reflect the differential importance of different organs to sex-specific survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">In contrast to peripheral tissue, whether and how the brain adapts its function and energy usage in a sex-specific manner during food scarcity remains largely unknown. The brain requires substantial amounts of energy to process and encode information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Indeed, the human brain, which comprises 2% of our body’s mass, consumes 20% of our caloric intake, over half of which is used by the cerebral cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Previously, we demonstrated that food restriction in male mice reduced energy usage in the primary visual cortex (V1) during visual processing, which was associated with a loss of orientation selectivity and visual coding precision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. These changes required a decrease in levels of serum leptin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes in proportion to fat mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, in males the cortex, like peripheral tissue, has the capacity to reduce its energy usage and function in times of food scarcity.</p><p id="P4">By contrast, it remains unclear to what extent the brain similarly contributes to energy-saving adaptations during food scarcity in mammalian females. Understanding how food restriction impacts cortical function in males and females is not only of fundamental importance for understanding the sex-specific impact of diet on brain function, but is also critical for studies of cortical function, in which food restriction is used to behaviourally motivate animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Here, we examined how food restriction leading to a 15% loss in body weight over 2-3 weeks impacts energy usage and visual coding in the primary visual cortex (V1) in adult male and female mice. We found that leptin levels, which regulate energy-saving changes in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, were maintained in females during food restriction, despite being decreased by approximately threefold in males. Consistent with these results, and using a range of experimental techniques, we failed to find significant energy-saving changes in V1 during food restriction in female mice, in contrast to male mice. Specifically, molecular analysis and RNA sequencing of V1 revealed that food-restriction significantly modified canonical energy-regulating cellular pathways in males, but not in females, including pathways associated with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling, as well as oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, using <italic>in vivo</italic> ATP and calcium imaging, we found that food restriction significantly reduced V1 ATP usage and orientation selectivity in males, but not in females.</p><p id="P6">Collectively, our study demonstrates that in times of food restriction, visual cortical function and energy usage are largely maintained in female mice, while they are reduced in males. The neocortex, therefore, contributes to sex-specific, energy-saving adaptations in response to metabolic stress. Our research highlights the importance of taking into account sex differences when studying the impact of dietary manipulations on brain function.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P7">We first examined sex-specific differences in how the neocortex adapts to food restriction in mice. Mice, 7-9 weeks of age, either had <italic>ad libwitum</italic> (CTR) access to food or were food restricted (FR) to 85% of their free feeding bodyweight, for 2-3 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Prior to any of our recordings, tissue collection, and analysis, all animals were given <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food until sated. This enabled us to examine the long-term impact of caloric restriction on neocortical function, as opposed to the short-term impacts of hunger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Sex-specific impact of food restriction on weight loss and fat mass-regulated hormone leptin</title><p id="P8">Prior to food restriction, we found that both males and females consumed the same <italic>ad libitum</italic> daily food intake, despite females weighing approximately 80% of age-matched males (weight: male vs. female; 27.82 g [95% CI: 26.84 g – 28.79 g] vs 23.21 g [95% CI: 22.35 g – 24.07 g]; t = 7.58; df = 66; p &lt; 0.001; n = 8 male and 7 female mice). Critically, we found that to achieve a similar magnitude (15%) and rate of weight loss in both sexes we had to impose a 40% greater restriction of daily food intake in females (average of 39% of <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake; n = 7 mice) compared to males (27% of <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake; n = 8 mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that female mice are more resistant to weight loss than male<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, for similar bodyweight loss (15%) maintained over 2-3 weeks, serum leptin levels, which reflect fat mass, were markedly and significantly decreased (-72%) in males (leptin: CTR male vs FR male; 6.45 ng/mL [95% CI: 4.47 ng/mL – 8.43 ng/mL] vs. 1.84 ng/mL [95% CI: 0.90 ng/mL – 2.79 ng/mL]; t = 4.58; df = 66; p &lt; 0.0001; n = 17 CTR males and 19 FR males), but only modestly and non-significantly decreased (-28%) in females (leptin: CTR females vs FR females; 3.94 ng/mL [95% CI: 2.53 ng/mL – 5.35 ng/mL] vs. 2.83 ng/mL [95% CI: 1.20 ng/mL – 4.47 ng/mL]; t = 1.00; df = 66; p = 0.32; 23 CTR females and 11 FR females) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). This is in keeping with previous findings that female mice are more resistant to fat loss than males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and that weight loss arises from other tissues including those associated with reproductive functions (ovarian and uterine mass)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>7–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cellular energy-regulating pathways in cortex are significantly impacted by food restriction in males but not in females</title><p id="P9">Decreased leptin levels are necessary for triggering energy-saving changes in the mouse visual cortex during food restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. We therefore asked whether the absence of significant change in serum leptin in food-restricted females was associated with any change in V1 energy usage. We first assessed this at the molecular level by examining AMPK phosphorylation state. AMPK is a canonical cellular energy sensor activated by metabolic stress - such as food restriction, in part via decreased leptin signalling - through phosphorylation of threonine 172 (Thr<sup>172</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Its activation results in reduced ATP expenditure, for example, through the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, and regulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In V1, we found that AMPK Thr<sup>172</sup> phosphorylation was markedly and significantly elevated (2.9 fold) with food restriction in males (AMPK Thr<sup>172</sup> phosphorylation: CTR male vs FR male; 13.19 AU/μg [95% CI: 7.68 AU/μg – 18.71 AU/μg] vs. 38.21 AU/μg [95% CI: 16.50 AU/μg – 59.93 AU/μg]; t = 2.28; df = 39; p = 0.022; n = 11 CTR males and 15 FR males), consistent with ATP savings, but only modestly increased (1.4 fold) in females; this increase was not statistically significant (AMPK Thr<sup>172</sup> phosphorylation: CTR female vs. FR female; 20.94 AU/μg [95% CI: 9.42 AU/μg - 32.46 AU/μg] vs. 29.52 AU/μg [95% CI: 8.52 AU/μg – 50. 53 AU/μg]; t = 0.64; df = 39; p = 0.11; 11 CTR females, and 6 FR females) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). We also examined the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), which is downstream of leptin signalling and is known to regulate fatty acid metabolism and energy homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. As with AMPK, we found that PPARα was significantly regulated by food restriction selectively in males, but not in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">To further investigate how energy-regulating cellular pathways are impacted by food restriction, we performed RNA sequencing on tissue dissected from V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>; n = 4 CTR male, n = 4 FR male, n = 4 CTR female, and n = 4 FR female mice). Differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2 revealed that food restriction significantly altered the expression of 657 and 585 targets in males and females, respectively (at a threshold of p-adj &lt; 0.1; only 125 of these were common to both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). To assess the functional relevance of the transcriptomic changes induced by food restriction, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify pathways enriched in the differentially expressed populations. We found that food restriction resulted in a significant alteration of 34 and 14 gene sets (at p-adj &lt; 0.05) in males and females respectively; 13 of these were common to both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>; Table 1; Table 2). In male mice, we specifically found that food restriction significantly regulated gene sets associated with canonical energy-regulating pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), including those associated with oxidative phosphorylation and mTOR signalling (mTORC1 signalling and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling), as well as fatty acid metabolism; these pathways are known to regulated by leptin and AMPK signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Notably, these pathways were not significantly regulated by food-restriction in females. In addition to these findings, we found that gene sets associated to estrogen-regulating pathways were significantly regulated in food-restricted males and not in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). This is consistent with previous findings showing that estrogen, like leptin, suppresses food intake and promotes energy expenditure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Finally, consistent with past studies in cortex, we found that food restriction in males altered gene expression associated with inflammation and reactive oxidative species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">Collectively these findings reveal that food restriction strongly affects energy-regulating cellular pathways in the cortex of male, as opposed to female, mice.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>ATP usage in V1 is significantly decreased under food restriction in males but not in females</title><p id="P12">We next examined energy usage in visual cortex during visual processing using two photon ATP imaging in V1 of awake, head-fixed Thy1-ATeam1.03<sup>YEMK</sup> mice, which express a FRET-based ATP sensor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).

As previously shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, food restriction robustly decreased the rate of cortical ATP usage in males (24% decrease) (half-time of FRET decay: CTR male vs. FR male; 8.48 min [95% CI: 7.59 min – 9.37 min] vs. 10.51 min [95% CI: 9.08 min – 11.93 min]; t = 2.87; df = 37; p = 0. 0067; n = 11 CTR males and 10 FR males) during visual stimulation; a more modest trend was observed in females (12% decrease), which was not significant compared to controls (half-time of FRET decay: CTR female vs. FR female; 8.66 min [95% CI: 7.49 min – 9.84 min] vs. 9.66 min [95% CI: 8.92 min – 10.39 min]; t = 1.36; df = 37; p = 0.18; n = 12 CTR females and n = 8 FR females) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>).

Given the non-significant impact of food-restriction on energy usage in female mice, we reasoned that orientation selectivity would also be less impacted.

Consistent with this, we found that food restriction in females did not impact visual cortical ATP usage nor orientation selectivity, both of which were reduced by food restriction in males. Our findings suggest that the contribution of neocortex to energy-saving adaptations during food restriction is sex-selective and more pronounced in males; females may rely on other energy-saving strategies, such as reducing reproductive function, to cope with food restriction.</p><sec id="S9"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="P20">Our study focused on the effects of a moderate food restriction protocol over 2-3 weeks on neocortical function and energy usage.

We addressed this limitation, in part, using Bayes factor analysis, which revealed that the impact of food restriction in males was indeed more robust than in females. This analysis also revealed that our study did not have sufficiently strong evidence to definitively rule out a smaller effect of food restriction in females, which may not have been statistically detectable.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Role of leptin and sex hormones in food restriction impact on cortical activity</title><p id="P22">Consistent with past studies, we found that food-restricted female mice resisted weight loss, and therefore required a greater restriction of food to achieve similar weight loss (relative to baseline) as males. In addition, for the same relative weight loss as males, females exhibited minimal reductions in serum leptin levels (secreted by adipocytes), consistent with past studies showing that females resist fat loss during food restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Similar effects have been observed across several mammalian species, including humans, and is thought to reflect the differential importance of fat stores for reproductive success in males and females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Notably, we previously demonstrated that reductions in leptin levels during food restriction are necessary for driving energy-saving changes in visual cortical coding in male mice; leptin therefore acts as a critical signal linking the neocortex to fat stores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. That leptin levels are not significantly affected by food restriction in females may explain the minimal impact food restriction has on cortical energy usage and coding precision in female mice.</p><p id="P23">In addition to leptin, sex hormones likely contribute to sex-specific adaptations to food restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. As with leptin, estrogen suppresses food intake and promotes energy expenditure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, in part by augmenting leptin signalling by increasing leptin-induced phosphorylation of STAT3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Moreover, estrogen can enhance ATP production by sensitizing insulin signalling, enhancing glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and along with progesterone, upregulating mitochondrial gene expression and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in our study, RNA sequencing revealed that estrogen signalling pathways were significantly regulated in male visual cortex with food-restriction, and were unchanged in females. Estrogen may thus have overlapping effects with those induced by food restriction, thereby diminishing further responses to food restriction in females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Notably, it was recently shown that sex differences in calorie-restriction’s metabolic effects that are observed in young adult mice, are largely absent in older mice, when females’ estrogen levels have declined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Further studies will be needed to explore whether the resilience of cortical function found in this study in young cycling adult females is also observed in non-cycling mice with reduced oestrogen levels, such as in aged mice.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Sex-specific regulation of cellular energy-regulating pathways</title><p id="P24">AMPK and mTOR signalling pathways are canonical regulators of cellular energy usage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. We found these pathways, along with cortical ATP usage, to be significantly modulated by food-restriction in male, but not female mice. AMPK is activated during metabolic stress, and saves energy by regulating oxidative phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, and inhibiting cellular pathways associated with energy usage, such as mTOR signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. mTOR signalling, by upregulating protein synthesis, increases ATP usage by promoting neuronal excitability, neurite outgrowth, ion channel expression, and synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. mTOR signalling is therefore ideally situated to regulate how much ATP is used in neuronal function; its inhibition may underlie ATP savings and the associated loss of coding precision with food-restriction in male mice. Notably, previous studies have found sex- and tissue- dependent regulation of AMPK and mTOR signalling, including in response to food restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. For example, in skeletal muscle, mTOR signalling is enhanced by fasting selectively in male, but not female mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Moreover, metabolic challenge by endurance training induces greater AMPK activity in cardiac tissue in male, as opposed to female mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Our study extends the sex-specific regulation of these energy-regulating pathways to the neocortex.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Importance of biological sex on the impact of food restriction on cortical function</title><p id="P25">Food restriction protocols are widely used to motivate animals in behavioural studies examining cortical function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Our findings suggest that these protocols are likely to have greater impacts on basal neocortical function in males, as compared to females.

Whilst calorie restricted diets have proven to be of benefit in this regard, the sex-dependency of such interventions have not been thoroughly investigated, though on the basis of our findings it is conceivable that males and females may respond differently to dietary interventions. The inclusion of both males and females in biomedical research, and the study of sex differences, is therefore of considerable importance for ensuring efficacious treatments are developed for both sexes.</p><p id="P27">In conclusion, we find that visual cortical coding and energy usage in females are resistant to food restriction, in contrast to males.
