Targeting PLpro function is recognized as a promising mechanism to modulate viral replication whilst supporting host immune responses. However, development of PLpro specific inhibitors remains challenging. Upcoming studies revealed the limitation of reported inhibitors by profiling them through a pipeline of enzymatic, binding and cellular activity assays showing unspecific activity. GRL-0617 remained the only validated molecule with demonstrated anti-viral activity in cells. In this study we refer to the pitfalls of redox-sensitivity of PLpro. Using a screening-based approach to identify inhibitors of PLpro proteolytic activity, we made extensive efforts to validate the active compounds over a range of conditions and readouts, emphasising the need for comprehensive orthogonal data when profiling putative PLpro inhibitors. The remaining active compound CPI-169, showed to compete with GRL-0617 in NMR-based experiments, suggesting to share a similar binding mode, opening novel design opportunities for further developments as antiviral agents.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">After over three years of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 still represents a severe threat to worldwide health and economic systems. The development of multiple vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, has improved the outcomes for infected individuals. In addition, small molecules have been brought to the clinic, including the repurposed compounds remdesivir which inhibit the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp), and the main protease (Mpro) inhibitor nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) that is approved for application in combination with ritonavir. Being key enzymes of SARS-CoV-2 replication, RdRp and Mpro were first targets for development of new specific antivirals. The papain like protease (PLpro) has now become the next most promising SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic due to its multiple functions in maturation of viral polyproteins and antagonization of host immune response. PLpro is responsible for release of nsp1-4 from the viral polyprotein and, in addition, it antagonizes host cellular ubiquitination and ISGylation processes, both playing important roles in the regulation of innate immune responses to viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].</p><p id="P4">PLpro is part of nsp3, the largest non-structural protein within the SARS-CoV-2 genome comprising multiple functions and functionally independent subunits within one protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro show an overall 83% sequence identity, being highly conserved within the coronavirus family [PMCID: PMC7430346], and raising the possibility of development of a broad spectrum anti-coronaviridae inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Nsp3 is composed of five domains, named from nsp3a to 3e, connected through different linkers and followed by two transmembrane regions (TM) and a Y-domain at the C-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The proteolytically active papain-like protease domain (PLpro) is part of the nsp3d region. PLpro is a cysteine protease with a catalytic triad formed by Cys111–His272–Asp286, which shows recognition preferences for LXGG↓XX motif (arrow indicates the cleavage site) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. S1, S2 form a narrow tunnel responsible for the recognition of two Glycines. S4 recognizes the hydrophobic side chains of Leu (or Ile). S3 lacks specific residue preference due to recognition of the peptide backbone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Besides, PLpro has two ubiquitin binding sites (Ub1 and Ub2) located distal to the active site. Whilst SARS-CoV-2 PLpro prefers to bind ISG15, SARS-CoV PLpro preferentially cleaves the K48-linked di-Ub chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. C-terminal from PLpro lays nsp3e that contains the nucleic acid binding domain (NAB). SARS-CoV NAB was shown to bind ssRNA and to unwind ATP-independent dsDNA revealing a nucleic acid chaperone like function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro reported to date include compounds reacting with the active side Cys111, zinc conjugate inhibitors, thiopurine compounds, natural products and allosteric naphthalene inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Naphthalene-based ligands form a large class of PLpro inhibitors with available structure-activity relationship (SAR) information. Among them is the well described allosteric inhibitor GRL-0617 which has demonstrated anti-viral activity in Vero-E6 cell infection models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. It has been shown to bind close to the catalytic site but not to occupy it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. The compound acriflavine was reported to be a potent nanomolar inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in enzymatic, cell based and <italic>in-vivo</italic> studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Using NMR and crystal structure of PLpro it was shown that two proflavine molecules occupy the substrate binding pocket. Natural products were also described as CoV PLpro inhibitors, including tanshinones, geranylated flavonoids, as well as polyphenols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. However, recent publications have arisen doubts on the mechanism of action of many of the proposed inhibitors. Ma and Wang revealed limitations of reported inhibitors by profiling them through a pipeline of enzymatic, binding and cellular activity assays, invalidating the tanshinone-family, YM155, SJB2-043, 6-thioguanine, and 6-mercaptopurine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. The overall homology between SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and human cysteine proteases is very low (&lt;28% sequence identity). However, inhibitors of PLpro’s capability to cleave ubiquitin and ISG15 may impact the closest human homologues UCH-L1, USP14 and USP7 (HAUSP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Assay development-Stability of enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro</title><p id="P6">Being a multi domain protein SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 comprises multiple functions.

Similar effects were seen using the Z-LRGG-AMC substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1-D</xref>). In addition, the loss of activity was rescued by addition of 1 mM DTT at the step of substrate addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1-E</xref>).

PR-619 and GRL-0617 were incorporated as reported positive controls for PLpro inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. All screened plates passed the quality control for HTS with a Z’ &gt; 0.5 (Mean 0.73) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2. Fig</xref>.). Fifty-four (54) compounds, with &gt;50 % inhibition, were selected for hit-confirmation; 50 out of 54 hits were confirmed. False positive hits, causing quenching of the AMC-signal, were removed from analysis. As DTT not only stabilizes the protein but also alters the apparent potency of reactive compounds, we evaluated inhibitor sensitivity towards reducing conditions. Hits were retested in presence of 1 mM L-cysteine, which has a lower reducing potential. Only six compounds retained their inhibition activity: CPI-169, Semapimod, SRT 1720 Sennoside A, Purpurogallin, DOM_SIM710 (3’,4’,5’,5,6,7-hexahydroxyflavone), and the positive control PR-619 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3.

Walrycin B was included as the most potent hit from the quinone-like compound series, confirming its loss of activity in absence of DTT. PR-619, CPI-169, Semapimod and GRL-0617 did not show changes in potencies in different buffers. In contrast Sennoside A lost inhibitory capacity in buffer with less reducing potential (L-Cys), Purpurogallin and DOM_SIM_710 showed increased inhibitory capacity in L-cysteine buffer. In addition, we observed DOM_SIM_710 and Purpurogallin to be more potent against PLpro compared to PLpro-NAB, whereas Semapimod (FhG) was only active against PLpro-NAB, although this result was not confirmed using Semapimod from the EOS collection (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Broad-spectrum activity and selectivity of identified inhibitors</title><p id="P11">PR-619, CPI-169, Semapimod, Sennoside A, Purpurogallin, DOM_SIM710, as well as GRL-0617 and Walrycin B were tested against PLpro of SARS-CoV and Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 to analyse their specificity or for broad-spectrum activity. For all tested compounds little difference was observed between PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Pan-inhibition of PR-619, Sennoside A and Walrycin B was observed against PLpro and Mpro SARS-CoV-2, whereby the inhibition of Mpro caused by Walrycin B was as well DTT dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4.

With regards to the closest homologue proteins of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in humans, we selected the deubiquitinase USP14 and USP7, and Cathepsin-L as representative of the cysteine protease family. All compounds, but CPI-169 and GRL-0617 showed inhibition of at least one of the human targets, with being more active compared to cathepsin-L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). With Walrycin B and Semapimod we observed pan-activity.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Confirmation of CPI-169 binding to PLpro</title><p id="P12">Hit profiling and selectivity tests confirmed CPI-169 as a promising inhibitor of PLpro. To verify compound binding we performed thermal-shift assays (TSA) using the PLpro-NAB construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). GRL-0617 was included as control for reported binding to PLpro, and Walrycin B to evaluate the mode of inhibition for PLpro. While GRL-0617 and CPI-619 showed a concentration-dependent TSA stabilization of the PLpro-NAB, Walrycin B exhibited protein destabilization effect in presence of 1 mM DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). No influence of 1 mM L-cysteine in buffer was observed for GRL-0617 and CPI-169, while Walrycin B lost its effect on PLpro-NAB. The PLpro-NAB C111S mutant was used to verify putative activity of inhibitors towards the active site cysteine. Incubation of PLpro-NAB or PLpro-NAB C111S mutant with GRL-0617, as well as with CPI-169, resulted in increasing the Tm. The stability of the PLpro-NAB C111S was not changed in the presence of Walrycin B. Comparable results were obtained using the PLpro and PLpro C111S constructs (data not shown).</p><p id="P13">In order to characterize modifications occurring at the catalytic cysteine due to presence of compounds, mass mapping was performed. PLpro-NAB was incubated with Walrycin B in the presence and absence of DTT. PD119507, which was previously reported as a redox-active compound generating free radicals was used as control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. In presence of DTT and the compounds, the catalytic cysteine was highly oxidized, to di-oxidized and trioxidated forms. These effects are not observed when the protein is not exposed to either compounds, or when it is treated with both compounds in the absence of a reducing agent.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Docking of CPI-169 in GRL-0617 binging pocket</title><p id="P14">Due to similarities in biochemical and biophysical characteristics between CPI-169 and GRL-0617 we hypothesized a comparable binding mode. We conducted docking experiments using PLpro bound GRL-0617 as reference structure (PDB: 7JRN). We found that CPI-169 can occupy the same allosteric cavity as GRL-0617 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5</xref>). CPI-169 docking score (PLP scoring function) was in the same range of reference compound, even if it showed less potency.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Confirmation of competitive binging of CPI-169 in GRL-0619 binding pocket using STD NMR</title><p id="P15">To confirm the hypothesis of CPI-169 binding in GRL-0617 site, a competitive STD-NMR assay was performed, considering the ten times higher IC<sub>50</sub> of CPI-169 compared to GRL-0617 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The STD amplification factors were calculated for the methyl protons exhibiting STD signals with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio at a concentration of 0.15 mM of CPI-169 used for the competitive NMR study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6. Fig</xref>.). Notably, tr-NOESY experiment validated the docking pose, with the only difference in the methoxide substituent of the pyridine ring, more distant from the indole moiety (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7.

After the addition of GRL-0167 at a concentration twice that of CPI-169, most of the amplification factors of the methyl protons of CPI-169 were reduced, while the amplification factor of H37 was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8. Table</xref>). The results indicate that CPI-169 is distinctly removed from the GRL-0617 binding site, while the methoxide substituent of the pyridine ring, which does not overlay with GRL-0617 in the docking model, still interacts with the outer part of the pocket, supporting the model pose of CPI-169 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5-D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is a key enzyme involved in maturation of the viral polyprotein and evasion of host immune response. Nevertheless, structural specificities, such as its active site dynamic flexibility, imply that both rational drug design and development of robust in-vitro screening assays for hit identification are challenging.</p><p id="P17">At the onset of this study, we observed high sensitivity of PLpro enzyme activity towards assay redox condition. The sensitivity of PLpro to redox agents and compounds was also reported by Arya et al., who showed that DTT (5mM) prevents aggregation of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in biochemical assay, although with minor effect on enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. In our hands, the relatively low specific enzymatic activity of PLpro under non-reducing conditions can be reversed by the addition of DTT or L-cysteine. The most likely mechanism is the reversible oxidation of SH-groups of cysteines to sulfenic acid, especially catalytic Cys111.</p><p id="P18">To the best of our knowledge, we present here the first large-scale repurposing screen for SARS-CoV-2 PLpro using its preferred physiologically relevant substrate ISG15 in combination with the enzyme construct that includes the PLpro and the NAB domain. Primary screening in the presence of DTT gave a 0.54 % hit rate, in line with reported low hit rate of PLpro screening campaigns under similar conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. However, replacing DTT with L-cysteine resulted in a loss of inhibition capacity of majority of hits. We assume that the inhibition of proteolytic activity by these compounds is due to their reaction with DTT leading to a nonspecific inhibition of PLpro. Previously, Ma et al., 2022 provided strong evidence to invalidate multiple repurposed compounds, initially reported to inhibit PLpro in biochemical assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Here, we confirm the unspecific inhibition of PLpro for many of these compounds, providing explanation related to their reactivity in strong reducing agents such as DTT. Among them, we identified a group of ortho-quinonoid and para-quinonoid derivatives, such as SF1670 and NSC663284. Previously this compound class was analysed for inhibition of CDC25, a subfamily of dual-specificity protein tyrosine phosphatases presenting a cysteine in active site. Due to activity only in presence of DTT and oxygen authors assumed a reduction to semiquinone anion radicals, producing reactive oxygen species that result in irreversible oxidation of cysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. For Walrycin B we observed similar reactivity, supporting our data in binding assays and mass mapping.</p><p id="P19">A small group of compounds: PR-619, CPI-169, Semapimod, Sennoside A, Purpurogallin, DOM_SIM710 retained their activity in both L-cysteine and DTT buffer. By analysing the specificity and broad-spectrum activity towards human target proteins USP14, USP7 and cathepsin-L, and viral SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV PLpro, we revealed selective inhibition of PLpro only for CPI-169. Using TSA, and NMR we showed a similar behaviour of CPI-169 compared to GRL-0617, previously proposed by Shen et al. (preprint 2021) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Both compounds bound PLpro as well as to Cys111Ser mutant of PLpro, indicating a catalytic Cysteine111 independent binding, indirectly showing possible allosteric nature of the CPI-169 inhibition. This hypothesis was proved by STD-NMR assay, through which we were able to identify the binding pocket of CPI-169 as the same as the GRL-0617 one. NMR results well match with the docking prediction and pose, highlighting weaker interactions with the PLpro with respect to GRL-0617, supporting the lower potency of this inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6.

summary</title></caption><p>The increasing knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 allowed the development of multiple strategies to contain the spread of COVID-19 infection. Nevertheless, effective antiviral pharmacological treatments are still rare and viral evolution allowed a fast adaptation and escape from available containment methods. The papain like protease (PLpro) has now become the next most promising SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic due to its multiple functions in virus replication cycle and antagonization of host immune response. However, due to inherent flexibility and sensitivity of this enzyme specific inhibitors are rare. Here we report on a screening strategy using repurposing of known drugs that takes into account PLpro characteristics to identify new inhibitors, showing the success of the approach by identifying CPI-169 that competitive targets the well described GRL-0617 inhibitor binding pocket of PLpro and helping to design further antiviral agents.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Key kinetic parameters of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro-NAB using different substrates.</title><p>A: 1 nM PLpro-NAB incubated with ISG15-AMC, B: 100 nM PLpro-NAB incubated with Z-LRGG-AMC.
