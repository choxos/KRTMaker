However, their recruitment to the gut-draining mesenteric lymph node (mLN), where they support the development of the adaptive immune response is still elusive. Here, we demonstrate the mechanism underlying the recruitment of eosinophils to the murine mLN post gastrointestinal helminth infection. We found that mLN eosinophils accumulated at immune interactive sites such as the interfollicular and paracortical regions in an IL-4Rα-dependent manner and was directly associated with the reduced availability of stromal derived eosinophil chemoattractants. Using multiplex imaging we confirmed that eosinophils associate within a stromal niche containing Lyve1<sup>+</sup> lymphatic vessels, ER-TR7<sup>+</sup>Pdpn<sup>+</sup> FRCs, and extrafollicular CD138<sup>+</sup> plasma cells. Experiments utilising complete and mixed bone marrow chimeras demonstrated that mice lacking IL-4Rα expression or LTβ expression selectively on B cells had diminished eosinophilia and reduced extrafollicular plasma cell numbers within the mLN. When co-cultured with LTβR activated FRCs, eosinophils gained an active phenotype with enhanced <italic>Il1rl1</italic> (ST2) receptor expression. LTβR ligation on FRCs resulted in enhanced IL-33 expression along with enrichment of distinct reactomes. Additionally, deletion of LTβR in FRCs reduced the homing capability of eosinophils to the mLN, confirming the significance of lymphotoxin signalling in granulocyte recruitment. Overall, these results highlight the previously unknown role of B cell-stromal cell crosstalk in driving mLN eosinophilia and their potential role in regulating the quality and magnitude of the humoral immune response generated within the mLN.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Eosinophils</kwd><kwd>IL-4Rα</kwd><kwd><italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic></kwd><kwd>Mesenteric lymph node</kwd><kwd>Fibroblastic Reticular Cells</kwd><kwd>Lymphatic endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>Stromal cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Lymph nodes (LNs) are highly organised structures essential for eliciting the adaptive immune response by facilitating immune cell interactions. The non-haematopoietic portion of LNs consist of fibroblastic and endothelial stromal cells which regulate and support immune cell migration and interaction within and to the LN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Various stromal subtypes including fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs), lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) have been implicated in regulating the recruitment, migration and localisation of B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) within the LN to foster close interaction between the immune cells and facilitate the adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The recruitment of lymphocytes and DCs to the LN requires CCR7 expression and is mainly driven by CCL19, CCL21, and CXCL13 produced by FRC subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). In contrast, emerging evidence suggests that granulocytes home to the LN in a CCR7 independent manner to support lymphocyte function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). However, the association of lymphoid stromal cells with granulocytes such as eosinophils and their recruitment to distinct lymphoid niches during homeostasis and/or during inflammation is understudied.</p><p id="P3">Eosinophils are effector cells that mainly reside in the gastrointestinal tract and play a major role in homeostasis, as well as in settings of type-2 immunity and inflammation, including helminth infections and allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Eosinophils are terminally differentiated cells that originate in the bone marrow from granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) and are present at low levels in the blood and mucosal surfaces under homeostatic conditions, such as the intestinal lamina propria and lungs. They accumulate in larger numbers in inflamed or infected tissues via a type 2 cytokine mediated axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), and not only amplify the type 2 response by secreting cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) but cause extensive tissue damage during worm expulsion due to degranulation; and as a result eosinophils are considered to be final stage effector cells. Alongside their effector functions, studies have shown that eosinophils have a major role in supporting the lymphoid adaptive immune response via B cell priming and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), antibody class-switching and maintaining gut homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P4">B cell follicle formation and B cell survival are commonly associated with lymphoid stromal cells, and we have previously shown that following infection with gastrointestinal helminth, <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus (Hp), g</italic>ut homeostasis is perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The anti-helminth type-2 response within the draining mesenteric lymph node (mLN) is characterised by an accumulation of T-helper 2 (Th2) CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, B cell follicle expansion, and extrafollicular B cell accumulation, which is supported by stromal subset expansion, proliferation, and remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). FRC crosstalk with B cells governs the overall lymphoid stromal expansion and chemokine secretion to support strategic immune cell positioning, yet the role of B cell-stromal cross-talk in driving the recruitment of eosinophils into the mLN is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>)</p><p id="P5">We and others have previously shown that following infection with <italic>Hp,</italic> IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 were significantly increased in the mLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, secreted from Th2 cells and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) activate eosinophils and drive eosinophilia in infected or inflamed tissues by inducing the secretion of eosinophil-specific chemokines eotaxin-1 (CCL11), eotaxin-2 (CCL24), eotaxin-3 (CCL26) and RANTES (CCL5) from epithelial cells, macrophages, mononuclear cells and fibroblasts. However, the contribution of chemokine induced eosinophil recruitment into lymphoid niches is largely unexplored and little is known about which cellular sources provide these eosinophil chemoattractants.</p><p id="P6">Given the central role of stromal cells and B cells during the anti-helminth response, which overlaps with the role of eosinophils in type-2 immunity and maintenance of B cell function, we asked what role B cells and stromal cells might play in eosinophil recruitment to the mLN and how this might support humoral immunity to helminth infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Here we have used a combination of bone marrow chimeras and advanced imaging methods, as well as flow cytometry and gene expression analysis to determine the mechanism by which eosinophils are recruited into the mLN post-gastrointestinal helminth infection. Using the model murine helminth, <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus,</italic> we found that eosinophils are recruited to the mLN in an interleukin-4 receptor α-chain (IL-4Rα) dependent manner. Our results highlight a novel role of IL-4Rα signalling during helminth infection which is important for B cell-stromal crosstalk leading to chemoattractant secretion by stromal cells that guides the recruitment, accumulation, and survival of eosinophils within the mLN.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mesenteric lymph node eosinophilia requires IL-4Rα during helminth infection</title><p id="P7"><italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic> (<italic>Hp</italic>) is a natural murine gastrointestinal helminth and serves as an excellent tool for studying type-2 immunity and as a model of chronic human helminth infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Helminth infection induces eosinophilia into infected tissues, however, the presence of eosinophils in secondary lymphoid organs like the mLN is understudied. In order to evaluate mLN eosinophilia, we infected C57BL/6J mice with <italic>Hp</italic> and harvested the mLN from naïve and infected mice. Using flow cytometry we identified CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>-</sup>CD19<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> Ly6G<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>Siglec-F<sup>+</sup> cells as eosinophils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>) which were significantly increased within the mLN over the time course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Both the percentage and absolute number of eosinophils within the mLN were significantly higher at 12- and 21 days post infection (dpi) compared to naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). During <italic>Hp</italic> infection, a strong Th2 response is generated within the mLN, characterised by high levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). As both IL-4 and IL-13 signal through IL-4Rα, which is key to anti-helminth immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), we utilised IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> as well as mice in which IL-13 had been deleted by a reporter allele insertion (IL-13<sup>gfp/gfp</sup> mice) to assess the role of these cytokine signalling pathways in mediating mLN eosinophilia. Following <italic>Hp</italic> infection, the entire chain of mLNs were harvested from naïve and infected WT, IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> and IL-13<sup>gfp/gfp</sup> mice and analysed using flow cytometry. We observed a significant increase in the total weight and cellularity of the mLN post infection in WT but not in IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C-D</xref>), with the marked increase in eosinophil numbers seen in the infected WT mice ablated in infected IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-F</xref>). However, depletion of IL-13 alone (IL-13<sup>gfp/gfp</sup>) was not sufficient to completely reduce the number of eosinophils following infection, suggesting IL-13 signalling is dispensable for the recruitment of eosinophils into the mLN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E-F</xref>). As eosinophilia into infected tissues is IL-5 dependent, we also analysed the number of eosinophils in the mLNs of infected mice where IL-5 had been depleted (IL-5<sup>R5/R5</sup> mice) and found that these mice had a significant reduction of eosinophils post <italic>Hp</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1G-H</xref>), confirming IL-5 also plays a role in eosinophilia into the mLN, as expected. As the spatial organisation of the T cell and B cell zones following <italic>Hp</italic> infection is mediated by IL-4 signalling via IL-4Rα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), we considered the possibility that the lack of eosinophilia in IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice may be a result of differential stromal remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). To investigate this in detail, we conducted high-resolution multiplex imaging of WT and IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mLN post <italic>Hp</italic> infection. These imaging studies revealed that WT infected mice had an increased accumulation of Siglec-F<sup>+</sup> eosinophils in the cortical and FRC rich paracortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Interestingly, in IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice there were few Siglec-F<sup>+</sup> cells in the paracortical T cell zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>) with some accumulation of eosinophils in the medullary region. Collectively, these observations indicated that Siglec-F<sup>+</sup> eosinophils are recruited to and localise in distinct regions of mLN following helminth infection in an IL-4Rα dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Interfollicular accumulation of eosinophils requires IL-4Rα</title><p id="P8">Next, we used multiplex imaging to extend these observations by taking advantage of the fact that <italic>Hp</italic> infection induces stromal remodelling and recruits immune cells to immune interactive sites like the T/B border and interfollicular region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). mLNs were harvested from WT and IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 0- (naïve) and 21 dpi and stained for LECs (Lyve1<sup>+</sup>) and eosinophils (Siglec-F<sup>+</sup>). LECs are key players in lymphocyte migration and during <italic>Hp</italic> infection expand throughout the LN to support B cell follicle formation and T cell-DC interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Lyve1 staining was performed to define and identify cortical, medullary, and paracortical segregation. The naïve mLN from both WT and IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed no sign of eosinophilia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2A-B</xref>). In WT mice, eosinophils were recruited to the paracortical region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, inset 1) and the IFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, inset 2) at 21 dpi, whereas in IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice, fewer eosinophils were recruited into the IFR and/or the T/B border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). This suggested that IL-4Rα supported the migration of eosinophils into mLN immune interactive sites. High-resolution images of 21 dpi mLN from WT and IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed a close association of lymphatic vessels and follicular B cell clusters alongside eosinophils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2C</xref>) suggesting that eosinophils access the cortical lymphatic sinuses, which are known to serve as egress sites for immune cells in close association with the B cell follicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) and potentially support B cell function by providing survival factors and support antibody isotype class switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). To further confirm the eosinophil association with stromal cells, 21 dpi mLN from WT and IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice were subjected to deep tissue imaging. Staining of vibratome sections further confirmed the enhanced eosinophilia in WT mice compared to IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice confirming the 2D histological findings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Movies S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">2</xref>). The observed close association of eosinophils with both FRCs and LECs suggests a potential role of stromal cells in mLN eosinophilia. Collectively, these observations highlight the previously unknown association of eosinophils with lymphoid stromal cells and suggests that IL-4Rα is key to their accumulation in immunological niches.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Non-haematopoietic stromal cells provide eosinophil chemoattractant</title><p id="P9">Given the increase of eosinophils in the mLN post infection, translocation to distinct lymphoid niches, and association with stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), we speculated that chemokine signals may arise from the mLN stroma to support eosinophil recruitment. To evaluate this hypothesis, the total CD45<sup>-</sup> stromal cells from naïve and infected WT and IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice were isolated for gene expression analysis. The three key murine eosinophil chemoattractants, RANTES (CCL5), eotaxin-1 (CCL11), and eotaxin-2 (CCL24) were evaluated for their relative expression. All three genes were expressed by the CD45<sup>-</sup> stromal fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-C</xref>). A strong upregulation of <italic>Ccl24</italic> was observed during the early phase of infection in WT mice in an IL-4Rα dependent manner, which remained elevated at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), whereas an increase in <italic>Ccl11</italic> was observed during the later phase of infection, i.e., 12 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Interestingly, analysis of the key stromal subsets using RNA-seq database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Immgen.org">Immgen.org</ext-link>, confirmed the differential expression of eosinophil chemoattractants by the key stromal subsets found in secondary lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). All subsets express some CCL5 while FRCs had the highest expression of <italic>Ccl11</italic> and LECs expressed the most <italic>Ccl24</italic>. Considering an enhanced <italic>Ccl24</italic> expression in the stromal fraction post infection, we further validated these findings using immunofluorescence microscopy with naïve and infected mice mLN cryosections. mLN sections were stained with Lyve1, podoplanin (Pdpn) and CCL24. Interestingly, there was little to no detectable expression of CCL24 in naïve mLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). However, post <italic>Hp</italic> infection at 12 and 21 dpi, a significant increase in CCL24 expression was observed. Closer analysis revealed that Lyve1<sup>+</sup> LECs and not Pdpn<sup>+</sup> FRCs were the main source of CCL24 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F-G</xref>). These data suggested that the lymphatic endothelium is the principal cellular source of CCL24 during infection and provides an explanation for the preferential localisation of eosinophils in proximity to the lymphatic vessels. Overall, these findings highlight the role of IL-4Rα driven chemoattractant expression by stromal subsets within the mLN which in turn regulate the eosinophil recruitment and localisation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>IL-4Rα dependent cortical/medullary association of eosinophils with extrafollicular plasma cells</title><p id="P10">Following the observation that eosinophils localise within close vicinity of B cell follicles and lymphatics, we hypothesised that they would also be closely associated with mLN extrafollicular B cells and plasma cells. mLN sections from naïve and infected WT and IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice were analysed immunohistochemically to confirm the localisation of CD138<sup>+</sup> plasma cells with the lymphatic sinuses. Immunohistochemical staining of mLN serial sections showed that following infection there is an enhanced extrafollicular B cell response with a significant expansion of Lyve1<sup>+</sup> sinuses, whereas IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> infected mice failed to mount such response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3A-B</xref>). We observed that in the cortical/medullary and paracortical regions of the mLN in WT naïve mice there was little to no presence of eosinophils (Siglec-F<sup>+</sup>) and plasma cells (CD138<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, insets i, ii). Additionally, in the paracortical region, we observed no lymphatics (Lyve1<sup>+</sup>), which correlated with the lack of eosinophils and plasma cells in this region. Comparatively, in the WT 21 dpi mice we observed a significant increase in both eosinophils and plasma cells in the cortical/medullary and paracortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, insets iii, iv) a feature not evident in mice lacking IL-4Rα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, insets v, vi). Quantification of immunofluorescence images, highlighting the area occupied by plasma cells and eosinophils, complemented the immunohistochemical staining showing that eosinophils and plasma cells co-existed within the mLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D-E</xref>). Additionally, analysis by flow cytometry highlighted that expansion of the plasma cell population following <italic>Hp</italic> infection is IL-4Rα dependent, with a significant reduction in plasma cell numbers in IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 12 and 21 dpi compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F-G</xref>). These data suggest that following helminth infection, IL-4Rα driven expansion of the lymphatic network supported eosinophil and plasma cell co-localisation in the cortical/medullary and paracortical regions, which has the potential support the extrafollicular B cell response, which is key to anti-helminth antibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>IL-4Rα expressing B cells drive mLN paracortical eosinophilia</title><p id="P11">We next investigated whether IL-4Rα expression on non-haematopoietic stromal cells (CD45<sup>-</sup>) or haematopoietic cells (CD45<sup>+</sup>) were important for mLN eosinophilia.

WT mice were lethally irradiated and reconstituted with bone marrow from B cell deficient (Jht<sup>-/-</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>) or T cell deficient (TCRβδ<sup>−/−</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>) mice and mixed with bone marrow from LTβ<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The resultant mice lacked the expression of LTβ on either B cells (Jht<sup>-/-</sup> + LTβ<sup>-/-</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>) or on T cells (TCRβδ<sup>−/−</sup> + LTβ<sup>-/-</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Control mixed bone marrow chimeras were also generated using WT donors alongside LTβ<sup>-/-</sup> (Jht<sup>-/-</sup> + WT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>) and TCRβδ<sup>−/−</sup> (TCRβδ<sup>−/−</sup> + WT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). The recipient mice were infected with <italic>Hp</italic> and the mLN was collected at 21 dpi. Under steady state conditions, we observed no apparent difference in terms of lymphoid organisation and numbers of eosinophils in LTβ deficient B cells and LTβ deficient T cells as well as in control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5A-D</xref>). Furthermore, no paracortical eosinophilia was observed in these animals. However, post <italic>Hp</italic> infection, mice that were selectively deficient for LTβ expression on B cells failed to expand the lymphatics network and were unable to recruit eosinophils into the interfollicular and paracortical regions of the mLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Higher magnification images further confirmed the reduced eosinophil association with cortical lymphatics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>, white dotted insets). Comparatively, mice sufficient for LTβ on B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">F</xref>) were able to recruit eosinophils to the mLN and have an expanded lymphatics network following infection. Mice that were LTβ deficient or sufficient on T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">G-H</xref>) had comparable eosinophilia in the mLN following infection. Eosinophils were seen in close association with Lyve1<sup>+</sup> lymphatic endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A-B</xref>) confirming that B cell crosstalk with stromal cells yields a favourable niche that supports eosinophil recruitment and interaction with stromal and immune cells within the mLN. Furthermore, these results confirmed that LTβ expression on B cells and not T cells in response to <italic>Hp</italic> infection is crucial for the recruitment of eosinophils into the follicle-proximal regions of the mLN by supporting the expansion of the stromal network.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>LTβR activated FRCs enhances eosinophil activation and migratory capacity</title><p id="P14">Having established that eosinophils are present at the IFR and paracortical region were also in close proximity with B cells on the stromal scaffold, we hypothesised that eosinophil activation and gene expression were linked to their interaction with the activated stroma. To directly assess this hypothesis, we ligated LTβR on cultured mLN FRCs using a LTβR agonist antibody (Clone 4H8WH2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>, condition 1); also considering eosinophils have long been associated with providing B cell proliferative and survival factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) we mimicked a cell-based activation model using purified naïve B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7A</xref>, condition 2). Both treatments resulted in an activated FRC phenotype and were later used for co-culturing with bone marrow-derived eosinophils. After 8 hours of co-culture, the eosinophils were purified, and bulk RNA sequencing was performed to identify global changes in the transcriptomes of eosinophils post co-culture with the activated FRCs. We identified that eosinophils co-cultured with B cell activated FRCs had a greater enrichment of <italic>MhcII</italic>, <italic>Ccr7</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Il1</italic>β, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B-E</xref>), suggesting the interaction of B cells with FRCs provides alternative factors that enhance eosinophil activation as well as B cell priming capabilities. Furthermore, extracellular activation of eosinophils is regulated through the NF-κB signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), so we performed subsequent analysis to assess the expression of NF-κB signalling components: <italic>Nfkbie, Relb, Nfkb1, Nfkbib, Rela, Nfkb2</italic> and <italic>Nfkbiz</italic> in eosinophils obtained from the co-culture. In both conditions, comparable NF-κB activation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7F-G</xref>). We further analysed various known functional modules, including adhesion, tissue repair and degranulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7H-J</xref>), as well as cytokines, chemokines, and Ig-receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig. S6A-C</xref>), which are important for eosinophil function, and the gene expressed remained mostly conserved between the two groups. Analysis of cytokine/chemokine receptors in eosinophils showed an enrichment of the ST2 (<italic>Il1rl1</italic>) receptor along with <italic>Il5ra</italic> and <italic>Tnfrsf1a</italic> (target gene for STAT 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7K</xref>). We next performed STRING analysis to find putative direct and indirect interactions on these genes. The STRING analysis yielded a total of 31 biological processes based on gene ontology (GO) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Table S1</xref>). We focused on proteins relating to the regulation of IL-5 production (GO:0032674) considering IL-5 is one of the key survival factors for eosinophils. Out of 22 known proteins within the network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig. S6D</xref>), STRING analysis predicted co-expression and/or co-occurrence between the ST2 receptor (<italic>Il1rl1</italic>) and <italic>Il5ra</italic> within our network which could be linked to receiving survival signals from both IL-5 and IL-33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7L</xref>). The wider network representation further highlights a distinct cluster of proteins where eosinophil peroxidase (Epx) was also associated with IL5ra and IL-33 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig. S6D</xref>), suggesting IL-33 may also be involved with eosinophil immune functions. Overall, these results highlight a previously unidentified role of activated FRCs and the niches they create by interacting with B cells within the mLN, which in turn can modulate the eosinophil activation and gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Loss of lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTβR) on CCL19<sup>cre+</sup> FRCs attenuates eosinophilia</title><p id="P15">We have previously established that lymphotoxin expressing B cells interact with LTβR expressing CCL19<sup>+</sup> stromal cells to govern the expansion and remodelling of mLN niches and eosinophilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). We further validated these findings using our co-culture system where FRCs were activated through LTβR signalling. Ligation of LTβR using an agonist antibody enhanced the IL-33 expression in FRCs which was further enhanced by lymphotoxin-expressing B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig.8A</xref>). The activated phenotype of FRCs was confirmed by analysing ICAM-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig.8B</xref>) which is in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Since we have shown that LTβR activated stromal cells are required for mLN eosinophilia and FRC-derived IL-33 may play a role in eosinophil function via the ST2 receptor, we further evaluated how IL-33 influenced eosinophil gene expression. To explore how stromal-derived IL-33 influenced the gene expression profile of eosinophils, we performed bulk RNA sequencing analysis by utilising datasets of known IL-33 induced genes in eosinophils (GSE43660, GSE182001), and identified 4757 genes (with a FKPM &gt; 1) that were enriched in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8C</xref>). We found no distinguishable difference in the gene expression pattern between the two stromal cell activating conditions suggesting LTβ signalling, whether indirectly via B cells or directly via the agonist antibody induced a similar expression profile in eosinophils. Highly enriched IL-33 induced genes (with a FKPM ≥ 5; 3649 transcripts) were analysed using the reactome database to gain insight into the key pathways that were being upregulated in eosinophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8D</xref>). Reactome pathways that were significantly enriched included the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGFR2 pathway and VEGF signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8D-E</xref>), which has been linked to enhanced eosinophil chemotactic and degranulation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Validation by RT-PCR confirmed that <italic>Vegfa</italic> expression was significantly increased in eosinophils that had been co-cultured with LTβR activated FRCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8F</xref>). Both gene expression analysis and bulk RNA sequencing showed that eosinophils co-cultured with activated stroma have significantly increased expression of <italic>Icam1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8G</xref>) and an enriched expression of adhesion molecules involved in extracellular matrix-receptor interactions and focal adhesion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig. S6E-F</xref>). This suggested that stromal cell derived IL-33 might enhance eosinophil accumulation within the mLN through enhancing chemotaxis as well as cell-cell adhesion. Additionally, other significantly enriched reactomes included hemostasis, IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF signalling and IL-4 and IL-13 signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>), which are linked to tissue repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7I</xref>), degranulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7J</xref>), platelet activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig. S6G</xref>) as well as promoting the adaptive immune response through antigen processing and presentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig. S6H</xref>), suggesting stroma not only provide a suitable niche for eosinophil recruitment, but support and modulate the eosinophil immune function within the mLN microenvironment.</p><p id="P16">As LTβ activation of CCL19<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts induces cytokine and chemokine secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) which we have shown enhances eosinophil activation, survival, and chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig. S6</xref>), we next aimed to confirm the importance of LTβR ligation of FRCs in supporting eosinophilia into the mLN. Since lymphotoxin expressing B cells are critical for the recruitment of eosinophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), we hypothesised that the expansion of the lymphoid infrastructure to support incoming eosinophils was governed by LTβR expressing stroma. To assess this, we used mice that have cre-recombinase expression under the control of the CCL19 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) which were crossed to LTβR<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice resulting in a selective deletion of LTβR on CCL19<sup>+</sup> stromal cells. <italic>Hp</italic> infection of Cre<sup>+</sup> (CCL19<sup>Cre+</sup> x LTβR<sup>fl/fl</sup>) showed a significantly decreased presence of eosinophils within the mLN compared to Cre<sup>-</sup> (CCL19<sup>Cre-</sup> x LTβR<sup>fl/fl</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8H-I</xref>). Thus, our data suggested that FRCs positioned in the mLN interfollicular regions and paracortical regions contribute to eosinophilia into the mLN.

The presence of eosinophils in close association with extrafollicular CD138<sup>+</sup> plasma cells further suggests that they can support the humoral immune response against helminths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). IL-4Rα expression on hematopoietic cells is key to mounting a protective immune response against nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) where IL-4Rα expressing B cells drive the expansion and remodelling of stromal subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). This further emphasises the importance of stromal-immune cell interaction towards an enhanced type-2 response by repositioning cells at immune interactive sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), with previous studies highlighting that immune cell positioning by lymphoid organ stromal cells is key to a rapid T cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) as well as B cell survival and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). As eosinophils have also been implicated in supporting B cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), exploring the cellular constituents at the interfollicular region (IFR) and T/B border, which are important immune niches, will be crucial to determine the spatial cellular diversity in these sites. The IFR lies between the B cell follicles and the T cell zone and is where B cells, T cells, and DCs interact to generate the adaptive immune response. Our results demonstrated that eosinophil recruitment to immune interactive sites within the mLN required IL-4Rα expressing B cells, which supports previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Our results further confirm the importance of both IL-5 and IL-13 in driving mLN eosinophilia. Both IL-5 and IL-13 play an important role in the type-2 immune response as well as in eosinophil recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) to mucosal and adipose tissues. Our results further suggest that since both FRCs and LECs are capable of producing eosinophilic chemoattractant as well as IL-33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) that can function as an activator and survival factor for eosinophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), IL-13 might be dispensable for mLN eosinophilia.</p><p id="P20">The presence of CCR7 on eosinophils highlights their migratory potential from the periphery to the lymphoid compartment as seen previously in allergic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). This suggests that stroma-derived eosinophil chemoattractants as well as CCR7 ligands, CCL19 and CCL21, can operate in synergy to localise these granulocytes to distinct regions of the mLN where DC clustering, antigen presentation, and T cell and B cell activation takes place. The localisation of eosinophils in the paracortical region of the mLN is in keeping with the notion that FRCs through the secretion of CCL11, CCL19, and CCL21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>) can recruit eosinophils and supposedly support eosinophil antigen presentation and T-lymphocyte activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). However, the route and mechanisms of this migration and antigen presentation are not yet well defined and would require further investigation.</p><p id="P21">The stromal subset expansion mediated through intrinsic B cell IL-4Rα signalling and provision of lymphotoxin further supports the secretion of eosinophil chemoattractant CCL24, which has been previously shown to be an important player in type-2 immunity as well as susceptibility to helminth infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). These findings support our previous observation and highlight the role of stromal expansion and remodelling towards the development of a type-2 response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Immgen analysis indicated the differential expression of CCL24 within the stromal subsets, which could be linked to LEC expansion as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). FRC-B cell crosstalk supports LEC expansion during a helminth infection and loss of LTβR on CCL19<sup>+</sup> FRCs abrogates LEC expansion and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>); therefore, the reduced eotaxin-2 expression in IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice can be linked, although indirectly, to the lack of LEC expansion. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of lymphangiogenesis in IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice is required to assess the link between CCL24 expression and LEC expansion. Nevertheless, the reduced LEC numbers seen in infected CCL19Cre<sup>+</sup> x LTβR<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) directly complement the reduced eosinophilia we observed. A limitation of our study is that we could not compare the contribution of other immune cells such as DCs, macrophages, and ILC2s in driving mLN eosinophilia. Nevertheless, the loss of CCL24 in IL-4Rα<sup>-/-</sup> mice is in line with previous work highlighting the type-2 dependency of this cytokine in diverse settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>).

Our findings further strengthen the hypothesis that stromal cells not only regulate local B cell survival but may also indirectly regulate the peripheral population by recruiting eosinophils from the tissue to the mLN which allows these effector cells to migrate back into circulation. The lymphotoxin activated FRC-eosinophil co-culture highlights the capability of activated FRCs to modulate both MHC-II expression as well as ICAM-1 expression in eosinophils. A possible mechanism of such regulation could be that FRC-derived IL-33 directly programs eosinophil ICAM-1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). FRC-derived IL-33 has recently been shown to induce the beiging of white adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>); a process where eosinophils, ILC2, and type-2 cytokines play a pivotal role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). The upregulation of ICAM-1 on eosinophils and their presence at the IFR of the mLN further strengthen the notion that eosinophils might provide an additional scaffold at these sites for B cell adhesion and synapse formation, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). The association of eosinophils with vasculature and FRCs further hints that ICAM-1 supports VEGF-A mediated chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>), and previous reports have shown that IL-33 induced ICAM-1 expression enhances adhesiveness of eosinophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Considering the high levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-33 and the constant presence of eosinophils within the mLN over the time course of infection also suggests that the lymphoid microenvironment provides suitable survival niches for granulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).

The final figure panels (graphs and images) were arranged and converted to .TIF file (LZW compression) using Adobe Photoshop 24.02 edition 2023.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Deep tissue imaging of mLN to visualise eosinophils</title><p id="P30">C57BL/6J and IL-4Rα<sup>−/−</sup> mice were infected with <italic>Hp</italic> and the mLN was collected at 21 dpi for vibratome sectioning and deep tissue imaging to identify eosinophil association with stromal cells. 200μm thick vibratome sections were generated using Leica VT1200S vibratome. Post sectioning, tissue was blocked in blocking solution followed by two stage staining as described previously with slight modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). We used antibodies against well-established markers like Siglec-F, Lyve1, and GP38 to identify eosinophils, lymphatics, and FRCs, respectively. The stained tissue was cleared using the Miltenyi Biotec MACS Clearing Kit protocol as per the manufacturer’s recommendation. Stained samples were imaged using a Zeiss confocal microscope. The 3D reconstruction and movies were made using IMARIS (Bitplane) and exported as a .mpg file.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Eosinophil-stromal cell co-culture</title><p id="P31">Bone marrow-derived eosinophils were generated <italic>in vitro</italic> as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Briefly, bone marrow cells were obtained from femurs and tibiae of WT C57BL/6 mice by flushing with complete RPMI 1640 media containing 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, non-USA origin). Red blood cells were lysed using ACK lysis buffer, and 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL were plated in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS, penicillin-streptomycin and further supplemented with stem cell factor (100 ng/ml), and FLT3Ligand (100 ng/ml) (both from Miltenyi Biotec) from culture days 0 to 4. Cultures were changed on day 4 to new complete RPMI 1640 medium containing recombinant murine IL-5 (10 ng/ml, Peprotech) and further fed with IL-5 every other day between days 10 to 14. Cells were collected on day 14 (typically containing more than 92% eosinophils), counted, and used for the co-culture experiment. Naïve B-cells were isolated from whole mLN by negative selection as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). mLN derived stromal cells were cultured i<italic>n vitro</italic> as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). In brief, single-cell suspensions from whole mLN were generated using enzymatic digestion and plated at a density of 20 × 10<sup>6</sup> in a 6-well plate. After 24 hours non-adherent cells were removed and adherent cells were further cultured for 7-10 days, with culture media changed every other day. After 7-10 days of culture, the adherent cells containing primarily FRCs and LECs were removed and seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> per well. Stromal cells were co-cultured with 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> naïve B cells or stimulated with 2 µg/mL anti-LTβR antibody for 16 hours in triplicate wells. The stromal cells were washed thrice with PBS to remove agonist antibody or B cells before adding the eosinophils. After washing 0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> eosinophils were added to activated stroma and co-cultured for an additional 8 hours. Post co-culture, eosinophils from triplicate wells were pooled and stroma were harvested and stored in RNA lysis buffer at -80°C until analysed for gene expression and bulk RNA sequencing as detailed below. In a separate set of experiments, FRCs were either stimulated with anti-LTβR agonist antibody (Clone 4H8WH2, 2μg/ml, Adipogen) or with B cells isolated from mLN using negative selection (1:5 ratio) for 24 hours. Post stimulation, cells were washed, and triplicate wells were pooled and stored in RNA lysis buffer at -80°C until analysed for gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis</title><p id="P32">The stromal and cellular fractions were separated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). In brief, the mLN was gently mashed through a 40μm cell strainer using a 5 mL syringe plunger. The filtered cells represented the cellular fraction, and the matter left on the strainer represented the stromal cell fraction. The RNA from the stromal fraction was extracted with Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research) and reverse transcribed using RevertAid cDNA synthesis reagents (Thermo Scientific) for qPCR analysis. RNA from the co-culture experiment was extracted using the RNeasy UCP Micro Kit (Qiagen), and reverse transcribed using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). The qPCR was performed using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT system.

Gene expression was normalised against endogenous control and 2<sup>-</sup>δδct values were calculated and presented as relative expression to naïve cells. The eosinophil chemoattractant profile for lymphoid stromal cells were also analysed using datasets available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Immgen.org">Immgen.org</ext-link>.

RNAseq was performed for duplicate samples per condition. Total RNA from eosinophils isolated from the co-culture was extracted using the RNeasy UCP Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA libraries were constructed and sequenced by BGI Genomics (China) using DNBSEQ sequencing technology. Raw transcripts were filtered through SOAPnuke (V1.5.2) and hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts 2 (HISAT2, V2.0.4) software was used to map the raw data reads. Raw data reads were mapped to the murine reference genome <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, NCIB: GCF_000001635.27_GRCm39. NOISeq analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs were defined as log2 of the sample (expression value + 1). Data were directly deposited to the BGI-Dr Tom web-based analysis portal. Read counts were normalised to FKPM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using normalised read counts, with a max threshold of 500 and a minimum threshold of 15 reads. GSEA enrichment plots were generated using the KeggPathway database. Phyper function in R was used to determine the P-value and the Q-value was obtained by correcting the false discovery rate (FRD) of the p-value. All data was analysed and Reactome pathway enrichment was carried out using the BGI Dr. Tom system. All heatmaps, GSEA graphs, and enrichment plots were exported as .png files.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>STRING analysis</title><p id="P34">Enriched genes from the bulk RNA seq were mined and analysed using STRING platform V12 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cn.string-db.org/">https://cn.string-db.org/</ext-link>) and Cytoscape V3.10.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cytoscape.org/index.html">https://cytoscape.org/index.html</ext-link>). The species was restricted to <italic>Mus musculus</italic> and gene IDs derived from Dr. Tom were uploaded to the platforms. Using the STRING platform subnetwork analysis was performed on a given set of genes using GO term and biological processes annotation. The known interactions were shown using cyan and magenta lines and the predicted interactions were represented using green, red, blue, light green, and black lines. Kmeans clustering was also performed to find two defined clusters of proteins within the regulation of IL-5 production GO network, with each cluster highlighted using red or green colour. The Cytoscape platform was used to highlight the gene expression (FKPM) of each individual gene within a given network. The strength of the interaction is depicted by the line density based on predicted protein interactions from the String: protein query plug-in. The network maps were directly exported as a .png file. The geneset analysis datasets were exported to excel files and both counts within the network as well as the total network and background number were presented.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P35">Flow cytometry and gene expression analyses are expressed as means ± SEM.
