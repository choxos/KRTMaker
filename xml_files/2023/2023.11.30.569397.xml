Defects in ciliary structure or function often lead to diseases that are collectively called ciliopathies. Cilia and flagella associated protein 410 (CFAP410) localizes at the basal body of cilia/flagella and plays essential roles in ciliogenesis, neuronal development, and DNA damage repair. It remains unknown how its specific basal body location is achieved. Multiple single amino acid mutations in CFAP410 have been identified in patients with various ciliopathies. One of the mutations, L224P, is located in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of human CFAP410 and causes severe <underline>s</underline>pondylo<underline>m</underline>etaphyseal <underline>d</underline>ysplasia, <underline>ax</underline>ial (SMDAX). However, the molecular mechanism for how the mutation causes the disorder remains unclear. Here, we report our structural studies on the CTD of CFAP410 from three distantly related organisms, <italic>Homo sapiens, Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, and <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.</italic> The crystal structures reveal that the three proteins all adopt the same conformation as a tetrameric helical bundle. Our work further demonstrates that the tetrameric assembly of the CTD is essential for the correct localization of CFAP410 in <italic>T. brucei,</italic> as the L224P mutation that disassembles the tetramer disrupts its basal body localization. Taken together, our studies reveal that the basal body localization of CFAP410 is controlled by the CTD and provide a mechanistic explanation for how the mutation L224P in CFAP410 causes ciliopathies in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CFAP410</kwd><kwd>cilium</kwd><kwd>ciliopathies</kwd><kwd>flagellum</kwd><kwd>protein</kwd><kwd>structure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cilia and flagella associated protein 410 (CFAP410) is coded by a gene that was mapped to chromosome 21 open reading frame 2 and thus named C21orf2 originally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The gene was first thought as a candidate for a few genetic disorders based on its chromosomal location and the predicted mitochondrial localization of its coded protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Later mutational analysis excluded CFAP410 as the causative factor for those disorders and instead suggested it is a compelling candidate for retinal dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that CFAP410 localizes to the basal body in mIMCD3 and hTERT-RPE1 cells as well as to the base of the connecting cilium in mouse photoreceptors, whereas genome-wide siRNA screen and biochemical studies suggest that it works together with NEK1 and SPATA7 as a functional module in ciliogenesis and DNA damage repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P3">CFAP410 is also one of the genes implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the loss of motor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Moreover, the expression level of CFAP410 is substantially reduced in the brain of Down syndrome patients, implicating its function in neuronal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. All these diversified functions of CFAP410 can be linked to its localization and function in cilia, as many neurological disorders are caused by defects in primary cilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P4">CFAP410 exhibits significant sequence conservation across phyla and is present in all sequenced genomes of ciliates, including algae, protists, and animals. <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> CFAP410 (HsCFAP410) consists of 255 amino acids. Several single residue mutations of HsCFAP410 have been identified in patients with skeletal and/or retinal disorders including spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, axial (SMDAX) and retinal dystrophy with or without macular staphyloma (RDMS). Both disorders are genetically autosomal recessive and manifested as dysplasia of the ribs, vertebral bodies, ilia, proximal femora in skeletons, and retinitis pigmentosa in eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. These clinically identified mutations include I35F, C61Y, R73P, Y107C, Y107H, V111M and L224P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. However, it remains mysterious how these single-residue mutations of HsCFAP410 cause the deleterious defects due to a lack of high-resolution structures of the protein.</p><p id="P5">We found that CFAP410 consists of two folded modules, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD), which are connected via a long unstructured linker.

We further revealed that the CTD is necessary for the targeting of CFAP410 to the basal body. The disease-causing L224P mutation both disrupts the tetrameric assembly and abolishes the basal body localization of CFAP410. Our work altogether explains how CFAP410 localizes to the basal body and why the single-residue mutation L224P causes ciliopathies.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Crystal structures of the C-terminal domain of three CFAP410 orthologs</title><p id="P6">To investigate the three-dimensional structure of CFAP10, we chose homologs from three diverse species <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>. Our folding analyses suggested that all these CFAP410 orthologs contain two folded regions, including a globular domain at the N-terminus and a highly conserved small domain at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-D</xref>). The two domains are connected by a long disordered loop. Sequence alignments of homologs from various <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> species showed that both domains are highly conserved, whereas the connecting loop has very low homology and is variable in length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). Similar conservation patterns are also seen in homologs from mammals and algae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A-C</xref>), and such pattern is also preserved across species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We attempted to crystallize the CTDs of <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> CFAP410 proteins. Multiple truncations were chosen based on sequence conservation and secondary structural predictions. Synthetic polypeptides of these truncations were further purified and subsequently used for crystallization trials. The CTD truncations that finally generated well-diffracting crystals were fragments covering residues 256-295, 212-246 and 213-246 of <italic>H. sapiens, T. brucei</italic> and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> CFAP410 proteins, respectively. The crystal structures were determined at 1.29-1.50 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The 2<italic>F<sub>o</sub></italic>-<italic>F<sub>c</sub></italic> electron density maps for all three structures show very high quality, with the side chains of almost all residues in these CTDs having been confidently built and refined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">All these three crystal structures show a similar homotetrameric arrangement, with each monomer consisting of two α helices that form an open nutcracker-like conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). Despite some variations in the tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), all monomers in the three proteins essentially adopt an identical conformation, with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of &lt;0.5 Å for all aligned backbone atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Each of the two helices consists of approximately 15 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The CFAP410-CTD is a dimer of two individually folded dimers</title><p id="P9">Multiple single-residue mutations of HsCFAP410 have been identified in patients with SMDAX or RDMS, one of which is L224P located in its CTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. With the crystal structures we were able to examine how this mutation may affect the folding and/or assembly of the domain. We observed in our crystal structures that two CTD monomers form a criss-cross dimer. Two such dimers further pack into a tetramer in a head-to-head manner. The centrally packed N-terminal helix (i.e. H1) consists of mostly hydrophobic residues that are involved in either intra- or inter-dimer interactions, whereas the peripheral C-terminal helix (i.e. H2) is less hydrophobic and contains multiple polar and charged residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Besides the aforementioned mutation site L224 in H1, there is another highly conserved alanine (Ala) residue that is located in the center of the same helix as L224 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). While the Leu residue is fully buried in the dimeric interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), the Ala residue is situated on the hydrophobic inter-dimer interface, with the four equivalent copies arranged in a diamond-like shape across both interfaces of the two dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To find out whether and how these highly conserved Leu and Ala residues contribute to the formation of the tetramer, we first examined the wild-type and mutants A219E and L224P of CrCFAP410-CTD using the static light scattering (SLS) method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Our data demonstrated that the wild-type protein formed a tetramer as revealed in the crystal structure, but mutant A219E became a dimer. Surprisingly, mutant L224P completely disrupted the oligomeric structure and formed only a monomer. The same results were also observed for the CTDs of <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> CFAP410 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We next checked whether either of these two mutants affects the folding of the proteins using the circular dichroism (CD) method. Our results showed that for HsCFAP410-CTD both the wild-type and mutant A219E adopted the same conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). However, the disease-causing mutant L224P lost all characteristic helical features and became completely unfolded. Consistent results were also seen for both <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> CFAP410 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To better understand the dramatic influence of the disease-causing mutant L224P on the structural stability of HsCFAP410, we further carried out molecular dynamics simulation analyses on both the wild-type and the mutant. Our conformational analyses of the simulation data showed that while the wild-type model of HsCFAP410-CTD agreed very well with the crystal structure (RMSD = 0.8 Å), the simulated model of L224P was drastically different from the wild-type crystal structure, with the associated all-atom RMSD of 4.4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Such structural changes were seen in all four subunits of the complex structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The most dramatic difference can be attributed to the major disruption of intra-dimeric contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). The simulation analyses also indicated significant changes in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic components in mutant L224P in comparison with the wild-type structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D, E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>TbCFAP410 is essential for cytokinesis</title><p id="P13">We next examined the function of CFAP410 <italic>in vivo</italic>. First of all, we examined the localization of TbCFAP410 in <italic>T. brucei</italic> by endogenously tagging the protein with an N-terminal mNeonGreen fluorescent protein. The fused protein was expressed in a cell line that also expresses SAS6, a basal body marker, endogenously tagged with mScarlet. We observed that in 1K1N cells, mNG::CFAP410 was concentrated at the posterior cell tip, with a slight enrichment observed at the basal body region above the cytoplasmic signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, left). As the cell cycle progressed to the 2K1N and 2K2N stages, the mNG::CFAP410 signal extended as a line from the posterior cell tip along the ventral edge of the cell. We further generated detergent-extracted cytoskeletons to confirm whether mNG::CFAP410 was stably associated with the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, right). In cytoskeletons of 1K1N cells, mNG::CFAP410 was concentrated at the posterior cell tip, with an additional weaker signal from the basal body region. Later in the cell cycle (2K1N and 2K2N), the mNG::CFAP410 signal extended from the posterior cell tip along the ventral edge, with an additional signal from the now duplicated basal body region. This suggests that CFAP410 is associated with microtubule organizing centers in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, predominantly the posterior cell tip.</p><p id="P14">Next, we depleted TbCFAP410 by RNAi to determine its function in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Depletion of CFAP410 after RNAi was confirmed by western blot, with a complete loss of mNG::TbCFAP410 protein after 24 h of induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). We observed that TbCFAP410 depletion substantially reduced cell growth by 48 h after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). To understand the causes of the growth defect, we further quantified the cell types present in the culture after RNAi-induction. After 24 h, the depletion of TbCFAP410 caused a minor reduction in the number of 1K1N cells, with a concomitant increase in 1K0N (zoids) and 1K2N cells, when compared to the non-induced groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D, E</xref>). This effect continued with more aberrant cells, with multiple kinetoplasts and nuclei appearing at 48 h. This suggests that TbCFAP410 plays an important role in <italic>T. brucei</italic> cytokinesis.</p><p id="P15">After TbCFAP410 RNAi induction, we noted that there were many cells in which the kinetoplast was very close to the posterior cell tip and other cells with an elongated posterior cell tip. To investigate this further, we measured the kinetoplast to the posterior cell tip in detergent-extracted cytoskeletons. Although we observed only little change in the average distance from the posterior cell tip to kinetoplast in 1K1N cytoskeletons after induction, there was a substantial increase in the range of these measurements, with cytoskeletons observed having a more reduced or increased distance from the kinetoplast to the posterior cell tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Moreover, in 2K2N cells the posterior kinetoplast was positioned significantly closer to the posterior cell tip after RNAi induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). These data suggest that TbCFAP410 is required for the regulation of the posterior cell tip elongation during the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The tetrameric assembly of the CFAP410-CTD is essential for its localization</title><p id="P16">We next examined which part of CFAP410 controls its specific localization to the basal body and how the disease-causing mutation L224P affects its function <italic>in vivo</italic>. All target proteins were expressed in <italic>T. brucei</italic> using a tetracycline-inducible expression system, with an N-terminal mNeonGreen fluorescent protein tag. Since the cell lines had a strong cytoplasmic signal, we also generated detergent-extracted cytoskeletons to categorize the localization of the TbCFAP410 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). The mNG-tagged wild-type protein localized to both the posterior end and the basal body region, as seen with the endogenously tagged protein. In the mutant A267E, the mNG::CFAP410 signal was exclusively found at the posterior of most cytoskeletons (63.5%), while full-length TbCFAP410-L272P and the two CTD-lacking constructs, NTD and NTD-linker, did not show any signal in cytoskeletons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Notably, all constructs were induced for 24 h and their expression was confirmed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C, D</xref>). This suggests that both the presence of the CTD and the integrity of its oligomerization are essential for the interaction of TbCFAP410 with the basal body and posterior cell tip.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">CFAP410 is a protein present in all ciliates and plays an essential role in ciliogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Located at the basal body, the protein is highly conserved across phyla including algae, protista and animals. Here we report our structural studies on the CTD of three orthologs of CFAP410 from <italic>T. brucei</italic>, <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, and <italic>H. sapiens</italic>. CFAP410 is a bimodular protein comprising two folded domains, i.e. NTD and CTD, which are connected via a variable unstructured loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). The crystal structures show that all three CTDs adopt a similar nutcracker-like conformation composed of two helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Two CTDs first form an intercalated homodimer, and two such dimers further assemble into a tetramer by packing head-to-head via their first helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Multiple single-residue mutations of HsCFAP410 have been identified in patients with SMS or RDMS ciliopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. One of these mutations, L224P, is located in the CTD. Our biochemical studies showed that such mutation not only disrupts its helical property but also causes complete disassembly of the tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Consistently, our simulation analyses indicated significant changes in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic components in mutant L224P in comparison with the wild-type structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Our results also suggest that CFAP410-CTD consists of two independently folded dimers, as mutation of the highly conserved Ala residue on the inter-dimer interface disassembles the tetramer to two dimers, but the dimer maintains the same secondary structure as the wild-type protein.</p><p id="P19">Our <italic>in vivo</italic> data showed that TbCFAP410 localizes to both the basal body and the posterior cell tip. Depletion of TbCFAP410 by RNAi not only caused growth defects, but also resulted in aberrant cells with multiple kinetoplasts and nuclei appearing, demonstrating that TbCFAP410 plays an important function in cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). We observed that the A267E mutant that breaks the tetramer into two dimers could still localize to the posterior cell tip, but failed to target to the basal body. However, the equivalent disease-causing mutant L272P of TbCFAP410 completely lost its localization to both the posterior cell tip and the basal body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). It suggests that targeting TbCFAP410 to the basal body requires both the tetrameric assembly and the correct folding of its CTD. Consistently, we found that two truncated constructs containing either the NTD alone or the NTD together with the linker failed to localize to either the basal body or posterior cell tip.</p><p id="P20">Previous immunofluorescence studies showed that CFAP410 co-localizes with both the serine/threonine kinase NEK1 and a retinal ciliopathy protein called SPATA7 at the basal body in hTERT-RPE1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Other studies also showed that CFAP410 is a component of a retinal ciliopathy-associated protein complex containing both NEK1 and SPATA7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Direct robust interaction between CFAP410 and NEK1 has recently been observed in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. The interaction possibly involves both the NTD and the CTD of CFAP410. It was shown previously that the L224P mutant of CFAP410 abolishes its interaction with NEK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Given that the mutant L224P not only disassembles the tetramer of CFAP410-CTD but also causes the unfolding of the helical structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), the tetrameric assembly of CFAP410 seems to play an essential role in its interaction with NEK1. Therefore, the disrupted location of TbCFAP410-L272P to the basal body we observed here could be attributed to its abolished interaction with NEK1 as what occurs in human cells.</p><p id="P21">In summary, taking together our structural, biochemical and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, we conclude that CFAP410 forms a tetramer via its CTD, which fuses the four globular NTDs together to form an oligomeric protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The tightly packed eight-helix bundle of the CTD controls the specific localization of CFAP410 to the basal body possibly by directly interacting with the serine/threonine kinase NEK1. The single-residue mutation L224P in HsCFAP410 that causes the autosomal recessive ciliopathy SMDAX could thus be attributed to the disruption of its oligomeric assembly that abolishes its interaction with a partner protein at the basal body.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Preparation of synthetic polypeptides</title><p id="P22">Wild-type and mutant polypeptides of the C-terminal region of <italic>T. brucei, H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> CFAP410 were chemically synthesized and purified by an in-house facility.

The complete system was then energy-minimized using position restraints placed on protein Cα-atoms, and subjected to 5,000 steps of NVT molecular dynamics (MD) with a 0.5-fs time step and subsequent 250,000 steps of NPT MD with a 1-fs time step. After this initial equilibration, a 1 μs NPT production MD run was simulated (5×10<sup>8</sup> steps with a 2-fs time step) for each system. All analysis was performed on the final 750 ns of each simulated trajectory. A twin-range (10 Å, 10.5 Å) spherical cut-off function was used to truncate the van der Waals interactions.
