In vertebrates, this insulator function is mostly attributed to clusters of CTCF sites located at topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries. However, TAD boundaries allow a certain level of physical crosstalk across regulatory domains, which is at odds with the highly specific and precise expression of developmental genes. Here we show that developmental genes and nearby clusters of CTCF sites synergistically foster the robust insulation of regulatory domains. Firstly, we found that the TADs containing developmental genes have distinctive features, including the sequential organization of developmental genes and CTCF clusters near TAD boundaries. Most importantly, by genetically dissecting representative loci in mouse embryonic stem cells, we showed that developmental genes and CTCF sites synergistically strengthened the insulation capacity of nearby boundaries through different mechanisms. Namely, while CTCF sites prevent undesirable enhancer-gene contacts (<italic>i.e</italic>. physical insulation), developmental genes preferentially contribute to regulatory insulation through non-structural mechanisms involving promoter competition rather than enhancer blocking. Overall, our work provides important insights into the specificity of gene regulation, which in turn might help interpreting the pathological consequences of certain structural variants.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The specific and precise expression of developmental genes during embryogenesis requires the concerted action of several types of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Among them, enhancers are able to activate gene transcription by communicating with gene promoters across large linear distances <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In contrast, insulators (also known as boundary elements) protect gene promoters from the activity of enhancers located in adjacent regulatory domains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In order to execute this enhancer-blocking function, insulators need to be located between an enhancer and the protected promoter. Thus, enhancer activity is typically constrained within discrete regulatory domains containing cognate gene promoters and demarcated by insulators at both ends <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Insulators are best understood in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where the combinatorial binding of several architectural proteins (<italic>i.e</italic>. Cp190, CTCF, Su(Hw), BEAF-32, GAF) to these elements enables their enhancer-blocking activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In mammals, the repertoire of architectural proteins is markedly reduced and CTCF is considered the main insulator-binding protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">More recently, the emergence of novel methodologies, such as Hi-C, has resolved the 3D organization of genomes at high resolution. These studies revealed that, in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, insulators often coincide with the boundaries of large contact domains that were termed “compartmental domains” or “topologically associating domains” (TADs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Consequently, TADs often overlap with regulatory domains, particularly those containing major developmental genes whose expression is regulated by long-range enhancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In mammals, the formation of TAD boundaries involves the stalling of loop-extruding cohesin complexes by CTCF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In contrast, cohesin and loop extrusion might not play a major role in TAD boundary formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which might instead involve pairwise looping between insulator elements due to the dimerization of architectural proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the binding of architectural proteins can only explain the formation of a fraction of TAD boundaries, suggesting that alternative mechanisms should exist <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Interestingly, many architectural protein-independent boundaries are located proximal to active transcription start sites (TSS) and housekeeping genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Recent reports indicate that transcription and/or active promoters can participate in the formation of contact domains and physical boundaries <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, but whether this can globally contribute to regulatory insulation and enhancer-blocking is largely unknown. In fact, due to the intermingling of chromatin domains, it has been shown that, at least at certain loci, the location of genes near or within boundaries might facilitate, rather than block, the communication with enhancers located along neighbouring TADs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Similarly, strong enhancers might be able to bypass boundaries and activate genes across TADs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Therefore, rather than impenetrable walls, TAD boundaries might act as dynamic and partially permeable barriers, allowing certain level of physical crosstalk across regulatory domains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The permeability of TAD boundaries is at odds with the remarkable tissue specificity and spatiotemporal precision with which most developmental genes are expressed, even in the absence of CTCF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> or other architectural proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, besides boundary elements, additional mechanisms might ensure the robust insulation of developmental regulatory domains. In this regard, work mostly based on the genetic dissection of the mammalian alpha and beta globin loci, as well as reporter assays in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, suggests that promoters can also regulate enhancer-gene communication through either promoter competition or enhancer blocking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. When located within the same domain, several promoters can, in principle, share and get activated by a common enhancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. However, depending on the presence of distinct promoter elements, the activation of a preferred gene can preclude the expression of its neighbours independently of insulators. Promoter competition occurs when the preferred gene gets specifically activated regardless of its relative position with respect to the shared enhancer/s and neighbouring gene/s <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. It has been previously suggested that the competition between promoters for a shared enhancer might involve mutually exclusive enhancer-promoter contacts (“flip-flop” model) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. However, more recent observations support non-structural mechanisms whereby promoters and enhancers share transcriptional hubs/condensates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, within which promoters might compete for rate-limiting factors (e.g. TFs, GTFs, RNA Pol2) required for gene transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. In contrast, promoter-driven enhancer blocking occurs when the preferred gene prevents the expression of its neighbours only if placed between the shared enhancer/s and the other gene/s, thus resembling how insulators work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Recent studies suggest that promoter-driven enhancer blocking might involve structural mechanisms, whereby protein complexes present at promoters (e.g. RNA Pol2) act as weak barriers against cohesin-mediated loop extrusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. It is currently unclear how prevalent these two promoter-dependent mechanisms are within endogenous loci and whether they significantly contribute to gene expression specificity, particularly in mammals. Similarly, it is largely unknown whether insulators, architectural proteins and promoters might somehow crosstalk in order to modulate the insulation of regulatory domains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In the present study, we uncovered that a significant fraction of developmental genes in both mice and humans are located near TAD boundaries that contain clusters of CTCF binding sites. Furthermore, at these boundaries, developmental genes and CTCF sites are often organized in a sequential and evolutionary conserved manner, with the genes preceding the CTCF clusters. In contrast, genes previously reported as capable of bypassing boundaries <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>– <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> are typically flanked by CTCF sites and, thus, located within CTFC clusters. Most importantly, through the exhaustive genetic dissection of a couple of representative developmental loci (i.e. <italic>Gbx2/Asb18, Six3/Six2</italic>), we show that the positioning of developmental genes close to boundaries does not facilitate their own expression. Instead, we found that developmental genes and CTCF sites synergistically strengthen the regulatory insulation capacity of the nearby TAD boundaries. Finally, we show that developmental genes seem to preferentially contribute to regulatory insulation through non-structural mechanisms that involve promoter competition rather than enhancer blocking. Overall, our work provides important insights into the mechanisms contributing to the robust and specific expression of developmental genes during mammalian embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>TADs containing developmental genes display distinctive features</title><p id="P7">While dissecting the regulatory landscapes of a few representative developmental genes characterized by the presence of large CGI clusters and polycomb domains at their promoters (e.g. <italic>TFAPA, Six3, Lhx5</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, we noticed that these genes were often located within TADs displaying rather unique features. Namely, these “developmental” TADs (i) showed low gene density and (ii) displayed a skewed gene distribution, as the developmental genes were often located near TAD boundaries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1-2</xref>). To evaluate whether these features are prevalent among “developmental” TADs, we used TAD maps previously generated in either mouse or human cells and defined developmental genes based on the presence of broad polycomb domains around their TSS: <list list-type="simple" id="L1"><list-item><label>(i)</label><p id="P8">Gene density: We first classified TADs previously identified in mESC and hESC according to gene density (High, Medium or Low) and performed Gene Ontology analyses for the genes contained within each TAD category. Interestingly, TADs with low gene density were strongly and specifically enriched in developmental genes, while High and Medium gene density TADs showed milder gene ontology enrichments and were not particularly enriched in developmental terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>, Data S1-2). Next, to evaluate whether these observations could be generalized, we considered TAD maps previously generated in additional human (n=37) and mouse (n=14) cell types. Notably, developmental genes (i.e. genes with broad polycomb domains) were significantly enriched within TADs with low gene density in all the considered mouse and human cell types (Fisher test p-values obtained were smaller than 4.2e-05 and 1.6e-10 in humans and mice, respectively, for all tests performed, with an average odds ratio of 2.0 (95% confidence interval: 1.9 to 2.1) in humans and 2.1 in mice (95% confidence interval: 2.0 to 2.2). In contrast, housekeeping genes were not enriched within low gene density TADs in any of the analyzed TAD maps (Fisher test p-value=1 for all tests, average odds ratio of 0.36 and 0.6 in humans and mice, respectively).</p></list-item><list-item><label>(ii)</label><p id="P9">Gene distribution: It was previously shown that TAD boundaries are enriched for housekeeping genes in comparison to tissue-specific genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. However, from a regulatory standpoint, developmental and tissue-specific genes represent fundamentally different gene categories, as they typically differ in the type of promoter (i.e. CpG-rich for developmental genes and CpG-poor for tissue-specific genes) and long-range enhancer responsiveness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. To investigate the distribution of different types of genes (i.e. housekeeping, developmental, all) with respect to TADs, we divided TADs in 10 bins of equal sizes and calculated the number of genes within each bin based on the location of their TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition, genes located outside TADs (i.e. within TAD boundaries or inter-TAD genomic regions) were assigned to a bin labelled as bin 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Next, we computed the percentage of genes located in each bin. Notably, while housekeeping genes were often found within or close to TAD boundaries (i.e. enriched in bin 0 and bin1), developmental genes were preferentially located inside TADs and near their boundaries (i.e. enriched in bin 1 and depleted in bin 0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-E</xref>). The tendency of housekeeping genes to be located within TAD boundaries and of developmental genes to occupy intra-TAD boundary-proximal locations was more pronounced when considering high-resolution TAD maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). The preferential location of developmental genes close to TAD boundaries was similarly observed in both mice and humans, suggesting that it might represent an evolutionary conserved feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-E</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Sequential organization of developmental genes and clusters of CTCF sites at “developmental” boundaries</title><p id="P10">Based on the previous observations, we then evaluated whether the boundaries close to developmental genes (i.e. “developmental” boundaries) display any distinctive features. First, we compared the number of CTCF peaks and CTCF ChIP-seq aggregated signals at “developmental” and “non-developmental” (i.e. “other”) TAD boundaries (developmental boundaries are defined as those having a developmental gene located in bin 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). For both CTCF metrics, the “developmental” boundaries showed higher values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>). Interestingly, despite these differences in CTCF binding, insulation scores and boundary strength (i.e. physical insulation) at “developmental” boundaries were similar to those observed at “other” TAD boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">On the other hand, upon visual inspection of several “developmental” boundaries we noticed that developmental genes and CTCF clusters were sequentially organized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1-2</xref>), with the developmental genes typically preceding most of the CTCF peaks (i.e. the CTCF peaks were preferentially located in the genomic regions separating the genes from the nearby TAD boundaries). To evaluate whether this sequential organization of developmental genes and CTCF clusters is somehow characteristic of “developmental” boundaries, we performed a global analysis of the distribution of CTCF peaks around genes located in bin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Briefly, for each gene, we considered a window of +/-100 Kb around its TSS and compared the number of CTCF peaks (and associated CTCF ChIP-seq signals) located between the gene TSS and the nearby TAD boundary with the number of peaks (and associated CTCF ChIP-seq signals) located between the gene TSS and the center of its TAD (ΔCTCFpeaks@Bdry and ΔCTCFsignal@Bdry; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Notably, the fraction of boundary-proximal genes in which the CTCF peaks and their associated signals were higher towards the TAD boundaries than towards the TAD centre (i.e. genes displaying negative ΔCTCFpeaks@Bdry and ΔCTCFsignal@Bdry values) was significantly larger for “developmental” genes than for other gene types (i.e. all, housekeeping) in both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). This indicates that boundary-proximal genes in general and housekeeping genes in particular are frequently flanked by CTCF peaks, while for developmental genes the nearby CTCF peaks tend to accumulate in the genomic regions extending from the genes towards the TAD boundaries (i.e. developmental genes preceding the CTCF peaks). It has been previously proposed that the positioning of certain housekeeping (e.g. <italic>Mcm5</italic>) or developmental (e.g. <italic>Dbx2, Pitx1</italic>) genes near or within TAD boundaries might enable them to bypass those boundaries and communicate with enhancers located in two adjacent regulatory domains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. However, upon closer inspection of some of these genes we noticed that they were flanked by CTCF sites, rather than located next to them (i.e. there is a similar number of CTCF peaks at both sides of the gene) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5-6</xref>). Recent reports indicate that this location within, rather than adjacent to, CTCF clusters could facilitate cross-boundary contacts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">Therefore, the sequential organization of developmental genes and CTCF clusters at “developmental” boundaries seems to represent a frequent and evolutionary conserved feature of mammalian genomes. To address the potential functional relevance of this sequential organization, we genetically dissected a couple of representative loci: <italic>Gbx2</italic> and <italic>Six3/Six2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1-2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The positioning of <italic>Gbx2</italic> near a TAD boundary does not facilitate the maintenance of its own expression in ESC</title><p id="P13">We first focused on <italic>Gbx2</italic>, a major developmental gene with important functions in different processes such as neural patterning or naïve pluripotency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. <italic>Gbx2</italic> is highly expressed in mESC, presumably due to the regulatory activity of a super-enhancer (SE) located approximately 60 Kb downstream of its TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Gbx2</italic> and its SE are found within a gene-poor TAD, with <italic>Gbx2</italic> being located ~10 Kb upstream from three CTCF sites that constitute the 3’ TAD boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Moreover, this CTCF cluster separates <italic>Gbx2</italic> from <italic>Asb18</italic>, a tissue specific gene located within the neighbouring TAD (~60 Kb downstream of the CTCF cluster) and that is inactive in mESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). To start evaluating whether the sequential positioning of <italic>Gbx2</italic> and the CTCF cluster at the 3’ boundary is of any functional relevance, we first generated multiple mESC clonal lines homozygous for the following re-arrangements: (i) <italic>71Kb INV</italic> - a 71 kb inversion that re-positions <italic>Gbx2</italic> and the SE with respect to the CTCF cluster, placing the enhancer in between <italic>Gbx2</italic> and <italic>Asb18</italic>; (ii) <italic>Δ3xCTCF</italic> - a 10 Kb deletion that eliminates the three CTCF sites, which in principle should lead to the fusion of the <italic>Gbx2</italic> and <italic>Asb18</italic> TADs; (iii) <italic>Δ3xCTCF</italic>:<italic>71Kb INV</italic> - both the 71 Kb inversion and the 10 Kb deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). Next, we measured <italic>Gbx2</italic> and <italic>Asb18</italic> expression in all the generated mESC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-D</xref>). Regarding <italic>Gbx2</italic>, we found that neither the inversion nor the deletion affected its expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). This suggests that, in contrast to previous reports <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, neither the positioning of <italic>Gbx2</italic> close to the 3’ boundary nor the CTCF sites are important for the maintenance of <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression. In contrast, both the inversion and the deletion significantly increased <italic>Asb18</italic> expression, with the inversion having a larger effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Moreover, when both re-arrangements were combined, <italic>Asb18</italic> expression levels were increased to a similar extent as with the inversion alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Considering the established function of tandem CTCF sites as insulators <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, the effects of the 10 Kb deletion on <italic>Asb18</italic> expression were somehow expected. However, the results obtained for the inversion were more surprising and suggest that, when positioned close to the 3’ boundary, <italic>Gbx2</italic> might display enhancer blocking activity and, thus, contribute to the physical insulation of its own regulatory domain. To directly assess this possibility, we performed Capture-C experiments using the <italic>Gbx2</italic> SE or the <italic>Asb18</italic> promoter as viewpoints in all the previous ESC lines. As expected, the deletion of the CTCF sites reduced the physical insulation between the <italic>Gbx2</italic> and <italic>Asb18</italic> TADs, thus increasing the contact frequency between <italic>Asb18</italic> and the SE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). In contrast, the 71 Kb inversion strongly increased the contact frequency between the SE and the CTCF sites, but had a minor impact on the <italic>Asb18</italic>-SE contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). This suggests that the increased expression of <italic>Asb18</italic> in cells with the 71 Kb inversion is unlikely to be caused by the loss of <italic>Gbx2</italic> enhancer blocking activity.

More specifically, we show that, within these TADs, developmental genes and CTCF clusters are often sequentially organized (with CTCF peaks being predominantly located between genes and TAD boundaries) and synergistically strengthen the regulatory insulation capacity of nearby boundaries, thus contributing to the establishment of specific expression patterns during development.</p><p id="P25">The large size and low gene density of “developmental” TADs might be required to accommodate the complex enhancer landscapes responsible for the specific, yet diverse, spatiotemporal expression patterns that many developmental genes display during embryogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. Furthermore, due to the long-range responsiveness of developmental gene promoters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, their cognate enhancers can be separated by large linear distances and, thus, located anywhere within “developmental” TADs.

In contrast, the investigated developmental genes do not seem to act as strong physical barriers preventing ectopic enhancer-gene communication (<italic>i.e</italic>. enhancer blocking), but preferentially contribute to regulatory insulation through promoter competition. The contribution of developmental genes to regulatory insulation through non-structural mechanisms is also in agreement with the fact that “developmental” boundaries show similar insulation scores (<italic>i.e</italic>. physical insulation) to those observed for TAD boundaries in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>). We hypothesize that, by being close to boundaries, developmental genes are more likely to be located at shorter linear distances from their cognate enhancers than the potential competing genes located at the other side of the boundaries. Considering that short linear distances facilitate the functional communication between genes and enhancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>, this might give developmental genes a competitive advantage over genes located on the other side of the “developmental” boundary <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. At the molecular level, it is currently unclear which mechanisms might explain how active genes contribute to insulation through promoter competition. Recent work suggests that RNA Pol2 can act as a weak physical barrier against cohesin-mediated loop extrusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, forced activation of candidate genes in ESC does not cause changes in chromatin insulation, suggesting that transcription and RNA Pol2 recruitment are not sufficient for the emergence of TAD boundaries <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. Moreover, the potential role of RNA Pol2 as a loop extrusion barrier can not explain how developmental genes contribute to insulation through promoter competition, as this does not require the placement of developmental genes in between enhancers and non-target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

Although these models and the putative rate-limiting factors await experimental validation, we speculate that nearby promoters with strong enhancer responsiveness and similar architecture (e.g. <italic>Six3</italic> and <italic>Six2</italic>) might be particularly sensitive to promoter competition unless insulated by large CTCF clusters. On the other hand, it is also possible that the investigated developmental genes can act as weak enhancer blockers whose effects on physical insulation can not be easily detected due to the current resolution and sensitivity of Capture-C and other 3C methods, but that, nevertheless, can still lead to strong transcriptional changes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>.

Although CTCF sites might facilitate ultra long-range enhancer-gene contacts (e.g. <italic>Shh, Sox9</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>, at shorter distances CTCF sites seem to be dispensable and other types of tethering elements (e.g. CpG islands in vertebrates, GAGA elements in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) can mediate intra-TAD enhancer-gene communication <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our data as well as recent work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup> suggest that, in the context of “developmental” boundaries, the main role of architectural protein clusters (e.g. CTCF) is to robustly insulate the regulatory domains of major developmental genes. Accordingly, global 3D genome organization studies show that developmental genes and their cognate enhancers are typically located within the same TADs, suggesting a strong functional overlap between topological and regulatory domains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, there are loci, with the <italic>Hox</italic> gene clusters being a notable example, in which genes and their cognate enhancers can be located in different TADs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. In these cases, the location of genes within or close to TAD boundaries might allow them to bypass those boundaries and communicate with enhancers located in more than one TAD in order to achieve proper gene expression patterns <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Upon closer inspection of genes capable of bypassing boundaries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5-6</xref>), we noticed that they are typically flanked by strong CTCF sites and, thus, located within, rather than next to, CTCF clusters. This organization might favour boundary bypass, TAD intermingling and communication with regulatory elements located on either side of the genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. In contrast, for the two developmental genes that we investigated, we found no evidences indicating that CTCF clusters facilitate their expression or the communication with their cognate enhancers. Instead, we found that the sequential organization of genes and CTCF clusters at “developmental” boundaries is a prevalent and evolutionary conserved feature that seems to strengthen the insulation of important developmental loci.</p><p id="P28">Lastly, our findings might also have relevant medical implications, particularly in the context of structural variants (SV) causing congenital defects through long-range pathomechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. For example, deletions spanning TAD boundaries can lead to pathological gains in gene expression through enhancer adoption mechanisms whereby enhancers can induce the expression of non-target genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>. Our data indicates that the pathological effects of this type of SVs might change (i.e. stronger or weaker induction of non-target genes) depending on whether the deletions include not only CTCF sites, but also nearby developmental genes.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>ESC maintenance and differentiation protocol</title><p id="P29">E14Tg2a (E14) mouse ESCs were cultured on gelatin-coated plates using Knock-out DMEM (Life Technologies, 10829018) supplemented with 15% FBS (Life Technologies, 10082147), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), antifungal and antibiotics (Sigma-Aldrich, A5955), β-mercaptoethanol (ThermoFisher Scientific, 21985023), Glutamax (ThermoFisher Scientific, 35050038) and MEM NEAA (ThermoFisher Scientific, 11140035).

In order to make these boundary strength values more comparable to those obtained from the 4D Nucleome data portal, only TAD boundaries with a strength larger than 0.2 were considered, while a strength value=0 was assigned to the remaining boundaries Once ready, the insulation score, boundary strength and CTCF datasets were used to compute several metrics for TAD boundaries in both mice and humans. TAD boundaries were defined using the start and end coordinates of TADs previously identified in mESC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup> and hESC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref></sup>. Next, each TAD boundary was expanded by +/- 50 Kb and the following metrics were calculated within the resulting 100 Kb window: (i) the number of overlapping CTCF peaks, (ii) the CTCF aggregated signal (sum of the CTCF bigwig signal for all the peaks overlapping with the 100kb window), (iii) the insulation score (minimum insulation score value in the 100kb window computed with <italic>bigWigAverageOverBed</italic>) and (iv) the boundary strength (maximum boundary strength value computed by <italic>cooltools</italic> for any bin in the 100kb window). In addition, TAD boundaries were classified as “Developmental” or “Other”: “Developmental” boundaries were defined as those associated with a developmental gene located in bin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1 1B</xref>); “Other” included all the remaining boundaries. Moreover, a set of 5000 “random” TAD boundaries was generated by randomly selecting 5000 regions in the mouse and human genomes.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title><italic>In silico</italic> analysis of the distribution of CTCF sites around genes located close to TAD boundaries</title><p id="P53">Gene located close to TAD boundaries were defined as those assigned to bin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) according to TAD maps previously generated in mESC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup> and hESC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref></sup>. Then, for each “bin 1” gene, the number of CTCF peaks (obtained as described in the previous section) located within a +/- 100 Kb window around its TSS was calculated. The 100 Kb window extending from the gene TSS towards the TAD boundary was defined as the “outer window”, while the 100 Kb window extending from the gene TSS towards the center of the TAD was defined as the “inner window” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). After calculating the number of CTCF peaks in the “inner” and “outer” windows, we computed the <italic>ΔCTCFpeaks@Bdry</italic> metric for each gene as the number of CTCF peaks located in the “inner window” minus the number of CTCF peaks located in the “outer window”. In addition, the CTCF bigwig signals associated with the CTCF peaks were used to calculate the <italic>ΔCTCFsignal@Bdry</italic> metric for each gene as the aggregated signal for all the CTCF peaks located in the “inner window” minus the aggregated signal for all the CTCF peaks located in the “outer window”.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary

Then, the genes present within each TAD group were subject to GO enrichment analysis.
