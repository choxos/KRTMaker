There are currently no effective antivirals available against BKPyV. As polyomaviruses are small DNA viruses that express very few proteins and utilise host DNA polymerases for their replication, there is limited possibility of targeting viral proteins for therapeutic intervention. As such, there is increasing interest in targeting host pathways to inhibit these viruses. To identify host genes required for BKPyV infection we have conducted the first genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen in BKPyV infected cells. This led to the identification of methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A), which we have validated as a host dependency factor for BKPyV infection. MAT2A is a druggable host enzyme that synthesises S-adenosylmethionine, the principal co-factor and methyl donor within cells. We have found that a small molecule inhibitor of MAT2A is a potent antiviral drug inhibiting BKPyV replication, offering a new therapeutic option for treatment of BKPyV diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Polyomavirus</kwd><kwd>CRISPR screen</kwd><kwd>S-adenosylmethionine</kwd><kwd>Large T antigen</kwd><kwd>virus-host interaction</kwd><kwd>antiviral therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">First isolated more than 50 years ago, the ubiquitous human pathogen BK Polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a small non-enveloped DNA virus of approximately 45 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Gardner <italic>et al.,</italic> 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hurdiss <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>). After infection in early childhood BKPyV establishes a life-long persistent infection of the reno-urinary tract, with serology studies suggesting up to 80-90% of the population are infected throughout the course of their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kean <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ambalathingal <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). Primary infection is usually asymptomatic or causes a short mild fever, followed by persistent infection and periodic shedding in a patient’s urine throughout their life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ambalathingal <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). Disease predominantly occurs in immunosuppressed patients, in whom BKPyV reactivation can lead to uncontrolled viral replication and subsequent damage to the reno-urinary tract. Of particular concern are kidney transplant and haematopoietic stem cell transplant patients who can, respectively, often develop polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN) or haemorrhagic cystitis (HC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Egli <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hingorani, 2016</xref>). Therapeutic options to treat BKPyV infection remains limited to general DNA virus antivirals such as cidofovir, which are nephrotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Izzedine, Launay-Vacher and Deray, 2005</xref>) and ineffective. Therefore, current treatment for patients suffering from PVAN is reduction of the immunosuppressive drug regimen leading to increased risk of transplant graft loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Johnston <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010</xref>). There is therefore an urgent need for a greater understanding of BK polyomavirus-host interactions during infection to identify new therapeutic strategies.</p><p id="P4">BKPyV entry into cells is mediated by b-series gangliosides such as GT1b and GD1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Low <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Neu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>) followed by caveolin-independent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Zhao <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>). Endosomes-containing virions then appear to be trafficked along microtubules to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via a late endosomal recycling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Moriyama and Sorokin, 2008</xref>). In the ER, virion disassembly begins with disassociation of VP1 disulphide bonds, reducing virion rigidity and exposing VP2 and VP3 sequences, which in turn hijack the ER associated protein degradation (ERAD) and proteasome pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Jiang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bennett, Jiang and Imperiale, 2013</xref>). This allows partially disassembled virions to be transported out of the ER to nuclear pores, where the α/β importin pathway facilitates virion import into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bennett <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P5">A simple virus of limited coding capacity, the BKPyV genome expresses just 8 viral proteins, none of which have polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abend <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Nomburg <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>). As such, BKPyV is wholly reliant on host DNA replication machinery for its genome replication and production of progeny virions. A genome-wide CRISPR screen offered a convenient and unbiased approach to identify host genes essential for BKPyV infection. Identification of host genes important in BKPyV entry and early gene expression would not only further elucidate the viral entry pathway, but may also determine unidentified, druggable host gene products required for BKPyV infection. Such host genes may be favourable targets for prophylactic drugs in kidney and stem cell transplant recipients, with the aim of preventing reactivation of BKPyV infection.</p><p id="P6">The use of genome-wide CRISPR screens to increase our understanding of virus infection processes has been highly successful. For example, such screens identified host LDL-receptor (LDLRAD3) as the entry receptor for Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Ma <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). In a similar manner TRIM26 was shown to be an essential factor for successful Hepatitis C (HCV) replication in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Liang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). Furthermore, CMTR1 was found to be an essential factor for efficient cap snatching during Influenza A infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Li <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). Whole-genome CRISPR screens have also been used to investigate differences in host factors required for the entry of wild type and spike deletion mutants of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zhu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). To date, CRISPR screens have not been applied to the investigation of BKPyV infection, although a genome-wide siRNA screen has been used successfully to investigate BKPyV entry and replication, identifying Rab18 and Syntaxin 18 as important host factors for intracellular viral trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Zhao and Imperiale, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We have conducted the first genome-wide CRISPR screen for BKPyV replication and have identified several host-dependency factors for BKPyV entry and/or early viral gene expression. Validation of a key hit, methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A), by functional gene knockout and chemical inhibition, revealed the importance of this host enzyme for BKPyV infection and replication. MAT2A catalyses the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) from methionine and ATP. SAM is an essential co-factor and methyl donor in a range of host methylation reactions and is required for splicing, gene expression and cellular chromosome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Katoh <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011</xref>). As such MAT2A may be important for a variety of stages of the BKPyV lifecycle. A number of well described small molecule inhibitors of MAT2A activity have recently been developed, some of which are currently in Phase I clinical trials as cancer therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Li <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>), highlighting potential drug-repurposing opportunities for treatment of BKPyV-associated diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Generation of Cas9-RPTE/TERT1 cells constitutively expressing active Cas9</title><p id="P8">To identify host genes important for early stages of BKPyV infection (entry to cells and expression of the early viral gene products), a fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-based genome-wide CRISPR screen was designed and implemented. Human telomerase immortalised renal proximal tubule cells (RPTE/TERT1), a cell type which best mimics the natural site of BKPyV infection, were modified to stably express Cas9 by lentivirus transduction. The established Cas9-RPTE/TERT1 cell line constitutively expresses Cas9, as shown by Western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1Ai</xref>). To confirm Cas9 activity, Cas9-RPTE/TERT1 cells were transduced with a lentivirus expressing β2M-specific sgRNA and surface MHC class I levels were quantified by FACS; without β2M MHC class I cannot be transported to the plasma membrane. Greater than 99% of cells demonstrated no detectable MHC class I on the surface of β2M sgRNA transduced cells, confirming efficient Cas9 activity in our Cas9-RPTE/TERT1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1Aii</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies host dependency factors for BKPyV infection</title><p id="P9">After binding and entry, the earliest viral proteins expressed during BKPyV infection are large T antigen (LTAg) and small T Antigen (stAg), of which LTAg protein is easily detected by immunofluorescent staining using commercially available antibodies. Furthermore, lentiviral sgRNA vectors can express fluorescent protein markers such that transduced cells can be readily identified. These two features were exploited in the design of our FACS-based screen using the Bassik Human CRISPR Knockout Library, a lentiviral genome-scale CRISPR library that targets all ~20,500 protein-coding genes in the human genome with 10 sgRNAs per human gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Morgens <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). The lentiviral vector also expresses a puromycin resistance gene and an mCherry gene.</p><p id="P10">Cas9-RPTE/TERT1 cells were transduced with the CRISPR Knockout Library and selected with puromycin for 8 days to remove untransduced cells. Approximately 200 million cells were then infected with BKPyV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 infectious units per cell (IU/cell), while at least 50 million were cells left uninfected, to serve as the reference library. Infected cells were fixed, permeabilised and immunostained for the viral early gene LTAg at 3 days post BKPyV infection. These cells were then sorted by FACS to collect mCherry positive cells (representing lentiviral transduced cells) and the bottom 10% of cell population for LTAg signal (representing reduced early viral gene expression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">As the cell population was infected at an MOI of 5 so that &gt;99% of cells should be infected, cells demonstrating lower levels of LTAg are more likely to harbour sgRNA-mediated genetic alterations that disrupt host cell genes required for BKPyV infection. As such, sgRNAs of interest would be enriched in the sorted population when compared to the uninfected and unsorted reference library. In particular, sgRNAs enriched in the sorted population should be specific for genes important in BKPyV entry and early viral gene expression. DNA was extracted from both the sorted “low LTAg” population and the reference library, and sgRNA sequences were amplified by PCR and subjected to Illumina HiSeq. Both library and sorted population reads were trimmed, mapped and quality controlled, showing a balanced high proportion of reads were able to be mapped correctly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Screen data were analysed using the MAGeCK method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Li <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014</xref>), to identify positively selected genes via enrichment of sgRNA sequences associated with these genes in DNA extracted from the sorted population compared with a reference library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The enrichment of sgRNA-target genes in the sorted population, compared with a reference library, is displayed with genes plotted alphabetically on the x axis and -Log(p-value) on the y axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Most genes fell below a -Log(p-value) of 2 (p&gt;0.01) which we considered as background noise. Approximately 200 genes were significantly overrepresented, scoring above this threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>; highlighted in yellow, blue, or red). These genes were analysed using the Database for Annotation, Visualisation, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to determine the enrichment of any biological processes and pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected, RNA and mRNA splicing pathways were identified; LTAg translation can only occur from spliced BKPyV early gene mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B and C</xref>; highlighted in blue). Another pathway of interest that was identified is Notch signalling, a pathway which regulates cell growth by mediating G1/S progression. Such cell cycle progression is known to be important in BKPyV infection, during which the G1/S check point is bypassed, and a pseudo-G2/M arrest is induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Caller <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Of particular interest was one of the most significant hits identified in the screen: <italic>MAT2A.</italic> This gene encodes for the protein methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A). MAT2A catalyses the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) from methionine and ATP. SAM is the methyl donor for a range of host methylation reactions that are involved in the regulation of gene expression and thus MAT2A may be important for various aspects of the life cycle of BKPyV.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Generation of a MAT2A CRISPR knockout cell line</title><p id="P14">To validate MAT2A as a host dependency factor for BKPyV infection, we created a stable MAT2A functional knockout cell line by transduction of Cas9-RPTE/TERT1 cells with a lentivirus encoding a MAT2A-specific sgRNA. MAT2A has been shown to be a gene essential for cell survival in haploid human cell models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Blomen <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>), thus complete gene function knockout may not be feasible in RPTE cells. Western blot analysis of the puromycin selected population showed clearly reduced, but not abolished, MAT2A expression and so single cell cloning was conducted. Analysis of the selected cell clone, with or without BKPyV infection, demonstrated a significantly reduced signal in Western blot analysis with a MAT2A antibody (which detects two bands), although a faint signal persisted, suggesting a potentially incomplete knockout of MAT2A had been achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure. 2A</xref>). It is important to note that MAT2A also shares a high level of sequence identity with MAT1A (84.3%), and thus many if not all commercially available antibodies to MAT2A are likely to also detect MAT1A, and vice versa. The antibody used for these studies is reported to cross-react with MAT1A. Therefore, it is unclear whether the faint signal observed in our Western blot analyses of MAT2A is due to low level expression of MAT2A or is due to antibody cross-reactivity with MAT1A. Nevertheless, a significant &gt;7-fold reduction in the signal detected with the MAT2A antibody was observed across multiple Western blots, suggesting these cells are not simply lacking one allele of <italic>MAT2A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure. 2B</xref>). Immunostaining with a reportedly MAT1A-specific antibody showed no difference in signal intensity for the predominant upper band in Western blots, but reduced signals for the lower band in our MAT2A knockout cells. This suggests MAT1A is expressed in RPTE/TERT1 cells, despite being reported to be a liver specific protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Torres <italic>et al.,</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Ramani and Lu, 2017</xref>) and its expression is unaffected by the MAT2A sgRNA sequence used. Furthermore, the MAT1A-specific antibody also appears to cross-react with MAT2A (the lower band) which is greatly reduced in our MAT2A knockout cells. Expression of MAT1A in RPTE/TERT1 cells may help these cells survive in the absence of MAT2A function.</p><p id="P15">Amplification and sequencing of the genomic DNA region from our MAT2A knockout cells encompassing the target site of the sgRNA was used to identify genetic lesions introduced during the CRISPR gene editing process. One MAT2A allele was found to have a single base insertion, introducing a frameshift, and resulting premature stop codon near the N-terminus of MAT2A (after amino acid 56). However, the second allele only contained a single base substitution, causing a change in MAT2A amino acid sequence from alanine at position 55 to glycine (A<sub>55</sub>G; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). Alanine to glycine is a relatively modest change to an amino acid side chain (loss of a single methyl group), and so may be predicted to have little impact on MAT2A expression or function. However, this mutation is at a crucial point in the ligand binding pocket, where van der Waals forces act between the hydrophobic alanine at position 55 of MAT2A and the methionine ligand itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Shafqat et al., 2013</xref>). Also, the mutation of a hydrophobic alanine to a neutral glycine may destabilise the protein leading to loss of expression. Western blot data supports this notion, as there is a greater reduction in total MAT2A levels (&gt;7-fold) than would be expected if one allele still expressed full length MAT2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). It should be noted that mutations at the equivalent alanine residue in MAT1A (e.g. A<sub>55</sub>D) are known to have highly pathogenic effects such as neural demyelination, indicating the importance of an alanine residue at this location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Ubagai <italic>et al.,</italic> 1995</xref>). Alanine at the equivalent residue is conserved in MAT2A homologs across taxonomic kingdoms from humans to plants to bacteria, further indicating its importance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>).</p><p id="P16">SAM is known to be necessary for a wide range of cellular activities, and MAT2A may be essential for cell viability, as suggested from studies in haploid cell culture models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Blomen <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>). Survival of our MAT2A knockout cell line might be due to expression of MAT1A or utilisation of the methionine salvage pathway generating sufficient SAM for essential cellular process. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that our MAT2A knockout cell line expresses a limited amount of MAT2A from the A<sub>55</sub>G point-mutated allele. Nevertheless, considering all the data generated during our studies, our cell line is likely to be a functional MAT2A knockout and any residually expressed of MAT2A has significantly reduced function.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Knockout of MAT2A function inhibits BKPyV infection</title><p id="P17">To test the impact of loss of MAT2A activity on early stages of the BKPyV infection cycle we infected the MAT2A functional knockout (MAT2A K/O) cell line and parental RPTE/TERT1 cells with BKPyV (MOI 3) and fixed for immunofluorescence at 48 hours post infection (hpi). Cells were probed for early viral protein expression (LTAg), and the number of infected cells were enumerated as a percentage of total cell numbers (DAPI stain) and normalised to parental RPTE/TERT1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3Ai</xref>). We observed a significant reduction in the number of LTAg-expressing MAT2A K/O cells compared to parental cells. The size of infected nuclei, often seen as an indicator of BKPyV replication and virus assembly, was also significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3Aii</xref>).

At 48 hpi we observed a &gt;100-fold reduction in the viral titre in MAT2A K/O cells compared to parental cells. The difference in BKPyV titre was reduced to just 8-fold by 72 hpi, likely due to continued slow replication of BKPyV in MAT2A K/O cells, whereas parental cells had reached the maximum level of infectious virus production by 48 hpi.</p><p id="P21">Taken together this data suggests that loss of MAT2A activity impacts the entire BKPyV lifecycle from early gene expression onwards resulting in significant reductions in virus production.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Potent inhibition of BKPyV infection by PF-9366, a small molecule inhibitor of MAT2A</title><p id="P22">MAT2A exists as a homodimer or tetramer, with the methionine and ATP binding active site at each MAT2A dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Shafqat <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>).

A clear dose dependent effect of PF-9366 on the number of LTAg positive cells was observed, which reached statistical significance at concentrations of 5μM and above.</p><p id="P25">To explore whether inhibition of MAT2A has an influence on viral genome replication, RPTE/TERT1 cells were treated with a range of PF-9366 concentrations or DMSO control as above and DNA was extracted at 48 hpi. The amount of BKPyV genome and cellular genome present in each sample was quantified by qPCR using primers specific to BKPyV DNA and the cellular housekeeping gene <italic>GAPDH.</italic> Viral DNA was normalised to cellular DNA levels and drug treated samples normalised to DMSO control. These data demonstrated a potent dose-dependent reduction of BKPyV DNA in cells treated with PF-9366, showing a significant ~4-fold reduction at 2.5μM PF-9366, increasing to &gt;10-fold reduction in BKPyV genome copy number at 20μM PF-9366 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Next, the impact of MAT2A inhibition by PF-9366 on early and late viral protein (LTAg and VP1) and MAT2A expression was analysed. RPTE/TERT1 cells were treated with a dose-range of PF-9366 or DMSO as a control and infected with BKPyV as above. At 48 hpi cells were harvested, lysed and protein expression levels determined by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Reduced LTAg expression was only observed at PF-9366 concentrations of 10μM and higher, whereas VP1 expression appeared more sensitive to PF-9366 with undetectable levels of VP1 at the highest dose of PF-9366 (20 μM).</p><p id="P27">Of interest is the effect of PF-9366 on MAT2A expression levels. Even at the lowest dose of 2.5μM PF-9366, a substantial increase in MAT2A expression compared to the untreated control was observed, consistent with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Torres <italic>et al.,</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Quinlan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). MAT2A is involved in a feedback loop which regulates available cellular methionine levels, where MAT2A expression increases in response to low cellular SAM levels. Therefore, the reduction in SAM levels caused by PF-9366 inhibition of MAT2A leads to increased expression of MAT2A. This compensation may reduce the impact of PF-9366 at lower inhibitor concentrations. At the highest dose of PF-9366 used (20μM) MAT2A protein levels were similar to DMSO treated control. This suggests that high doses of PF-9366 may prevent de novo synthesis of MAT2A, possibly due to a general suppression of transcription and/or translation.</p><p id="P28">These data suggest that inhibition of MAT2A has a greater effect on BKPyV genome replication and late gene expression than entry or early gene expression, suggesting that MAT2A activity is important for at additional aspects of the viral lifecycle beyond LTAg expression. The cumulative effect of MAT2A inhibition on the production of infectious virus was assessed by measuring virus titre in the presence of increasing doses of PF-9366. RPTE/TERT1 cells were treated with a dose-range of PF-9366 or DMSO as a control and infected with BKPyV as above. After 48 hours, cells were harvested, and viral titres were assessed by FFU, with data was normalised to DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). At the lowest dose of PF-9366 (2.5μM) virus replication was significantly reduced by &gt;2.5-fold and viral titres decreased in a dose-dependent manner with ~10-fold reduction at 20μM PF-9366. The impact of PF-9366 on viral titres was similar to the effect observed on genome copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting the primary effect of MAT2A inhibition by PF-9366 is inhibition of BKPyV genome replication, leading to reduced late gene expression and virion assembly.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Inhibition of BKPyV replication by PF-9366 is specific to MAT2A function</title><p id="P29">To confirm the specificity of PF-9366 for MAT2A the impact of PF-9366 on BKPyV replication in our MAT2A functional knockout cells was investigated. MAT2A K/O cells were treated with a dose-range of PF-9366 or DMSO as a control and infected with BKPyV as described above with the exception of using a higher MOI of 3 IU/cell. This is because MAT2A K/O cells were less susceptible to infection than the parental RPTE/TERT1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). At 48 hpi cells were either formaldehyde fixed and stained for LTAg and DAPI to investigate virus entry, harvested and DNA extracted for analysis of viral genome replication, or lysed and protein expression levels determined by Western Blot, or viral titres assessed by FFU assays.</p><p id="P30">No significant change in the number of cells infected with BKPyV, or the expression of LTAg or VP1 was observed in the presence of 2.5μM, 5 μM or 10μM PF-9366 compared to DMSO treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A and C</xref>). Furthermore, no significant difference in BKPyV genome levels was observed at any concentration of PF-9366 compared to DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Similarly, little-to-no difference in the production of infectious BKPyV was observed in the presence of 2.5μM, 5μM or 10μM PF-9366 compared to DMSO treated MAT2A K/O cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). These data suggest PF-9366 only exerts an inhibitory effect on BKPyV replication when active MAT2A is expressed in cells. Interestingly, MAT2A K/O cells treated with the highest dose (20μM) of PF-9366, did show modest effects (~2-fold reduction) on the number of LTAg positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) and slightly reduced LTAg protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, more substantial reductions in VP1 expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) and production of infectious titre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>) were observed in MAT2A K/O cells treated with 20μM PF-9366.</p><p id="P31">Western blot analysis showed no change in MAT2A expression at any concentration of PF-9366 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting this MAT2A inhibitor is unable to influence the SAM feedback loop that would normally induce MAT2A expression. This is consistent with a lack of MAT2A activity in our MAT2A K/O cell line, suggesting that even if a low level of the MAT2A-A<sub>55</sub>G mutant is expressed in these cells, this mutant enzyme is inactive.</p><p id="P32">The observed impact of 20μM PF-9366 on VP1 expression and infectious virus production may be due to inhibition of MAT1A, causing reduced viral replication by further reducing cellular SAM levels in our MAT2A K/O cells. PF-9366 has been shown to inhibit MAT1A enzymatic activity by 50% at saturating concentrations. Alternatively, this high dose of PF-9366 may have off-target effects in the MAT2A K/O cells.</p><p id="P33">Taking all the data from this study together, we have identified MAT2A as an important host dependency factor for BKPyV replication in human kidney epithelial cells. Our data highlights the potential for targeting MAT2A with small molecule inhibitors as a therapeutic avenue to exploit for treating BKPyV disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P34">Although the lifecycle of BKPyV has been studied for more than 50 years, we still know little about the host factors and pathways required for successful virus replication. In this study, we have employed the power of genome wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening to identify host pathways involved in the early stages of BKPyV infection, namely up until early viral gene expression. One primary aim of this study was to identify druggable host proteins that are important for BKPyV infection as potential therapeutic targets. Our identification of MAT2A as a host dependency factor for BKPyV replication provides one such target for which small molecule inhibitors have been developed, raising the exciting potential for drug repurposing opportunities to treat BKPyV-associated diseases.</p><p id="P35">We have validated the requirement for MAT2A activity for BKPyV replication through generating a functional MAT2A knockout cell line and using the small molecule MAT2A inhibitor PF-9366. These orthogonal methods of antagonising MAT2A function both lead to significant reductions in the efficiency of BKPyV infection as well as in early and late viral protein expression, viral genome replication and the production of new infectious virions. This indicates MAT2A activity, and thus presumably methylation reactions, are important at different stages during BKPyV replication. Viral RNA splicing is one process that is likely to be sensitive to MAT2A inhibition and the consequent reduction in SAM levels: the function of splicing regulators can rely on their methylation status, for example SRSF1 methylation by PRMT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Radzisheuskaya <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>). A complex splicing pattern of both early and late viral mRNA occurs during polyomaviruses infection and is an essential process for the expression of many viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Nomburg <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>). Specific splicing factors were also present within the top hits of our CRISPR screen (e.g., AQR, PTBP2, SFPQ, SRSF11) attesting to the importance of mRNA splicing for BKPyV infection. Translation of viral mRNAs may also be inhibited by reduced SAM levels; methylation of adenosines at the N6 position (m6A) in late viral mRNAs of the related simian polyomavirus SV40 have been shown to enhance viral gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Tsai, Courtney and Cullen, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Upon sequencing the exon 2 region of the <italic>MAT2A</italic> alleles in our RPTE/TERT1 MAT2A-KO clone to identify the indels near the sgRNA binding site, we discovered that while one allele of <italic>MAT2A</italic> had a frame shift resulting in a premature stop codon that should ablate protein function, the other allele had a single non-synonymous base substitution in codon 55 resulting in a coding change from alanine to glycine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). While this coding change appears to be relatively conservative, our data indicates this is a loss of function mutation. Firstly, MAT2A protein expression in our MAT2A-KO cell line was reduced by greater than 50%, suggesting this A<sub>55</sub>G mutation destabilises the MAT2A protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The expression of MAT2A may also be more reduced than is apparent from Western blot data because at least some of the observed signal is likely to arise from cross-reactivity of the antibody used with MAT1A; human MAT1A and MAT2A are both 395aa in length with 84.3% identity and very similar predicted molecular weight (43.6 kDa). Secondly, the MAT2A inhibitor PF-9366 showed no impact on MAT2A expression levels in our MAT2A-KO cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Inhibition of MAT2A activity by PF-9366 has been shown to stimulate MAT2A expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Quinlan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>), likely due to a feedback loop based on cellular SAM concentrations, which we also observed in parental RPTE/TERT1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This suggests that even if the A<sub>55</sub>G mutant form of MAT2A is expressed, it is not sensitive to PF-9366 and so has presumably lost some enzymatic activity. The side chain of alanine at position 55 in both MAT1A and MAT2A project into the SAM binding pocket and forms van der Waals forces with SAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Shafqat <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>). Furthermore, an alanine at this position is conserved in MAT1A/2A homologues throughout nature, supporting an important role of the methyl side chain of alanine 55 for MAT2A function.</p><p id="P37">Given the central importance of SAM for all methylation reactions in the cell, it is somewhat surprising that cells with such reduced MAT2A activity are viable. Indeed, this may explain why our MAT2A KO cells may not have a complete knock-out of MAT2A expression and retain a full-length copy of MAT2A with a single amino acid change, which perhaps retains a low level of activity. Alternatively, SAM levels in MAT2A-deficient cells may be maintained by MAT1A, which appears to be expressed in RPTE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) despite generally being considered a liver-specific enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Torres <italic>et al.,</italic> 2000</xref>). Expression of MAT1A in RPTE cells is also consistent with the fact that PF-9366 only demonstrated an impact on BKPyV infection at the highest dose used (20μM); MAT1A is only partially inhibited by PF-9366 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Quinlan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P38">When comparing our CRISPR/Cas9 screen data to that of an siRNA screen on BKPyV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Zhao and Imperiale, 2017</xref>), we observed surprisingly little overlap in the top hits, with only 3 genes in common within the top 200 hits from both screens (MAT2A, ABCC3, TIMM8B). However, the two screens were conducted using different experimental set-ups, and so it is difficult to draw comparisons on the relative value of CRISPR/Cas9 KO screens versus siRNA knock-down screens without conducting them in parallel with the same experimental conditions and readouts. Despite there being little overlap between the two screens, it is notable that MAT2A is within the top 100 hits from both screens.</p><p id="P39">In summary, we have conducted the first genome-wide CRISPR screen for host factors required for infection by a human polyomavirus. This has identified MAT2A as an important host enzyme for BKPyV replication. This provides a potential for therapeutic development based on repurposing small molecule inhibitors of MAT2A that have been developed for treating specific (MTAP-deletion) cancers. It will be interesting to investigate whether patients participating in ongoing clinical trials for MAT2A inhibitors show any changes in natural shedding of BKPyV in urine. Our screen data also highlights other host pathways that may be important for BKPyV infection that warrant further investigation. It will be important to conduct additional genome-wide screens for host factors involved in late stages of virus replication to increase our understanding of virus-host interactions and to broaden the range of potential therapeutic targets for treating BKPyV-associated diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell types, virus and primary antibodies</title><p id="P40">RPTE/TERT1 cells (ATCC CRL-4031) were cultured in DMEM/Hams F-12 supplemented with HEPES (10 mM), hEGF (10 ng/ml), Triiodo-L-thyronine (5 pM), L-ascorbic acid (3.5 μg/ml), holo-transferrin (5 μg/ml), prostaglandin E1 (25 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (25 ng/ml), sodium selenite (8.65 ng/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), G418 (100 μg/ml), 10 μg/ml gentamicin and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B and foetal calf serum (FCS) (0.5%).
