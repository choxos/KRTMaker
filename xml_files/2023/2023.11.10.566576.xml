There is a need to risk-assess newly emerged variants in near “real-time” to estimate their potential threat to public health. The recently emerged Omicron sub-variant BA.2.86 raised concerns as it carries a high number of mutations compared to its predecessors. Here, we assessed the virulence of BA.2.86 in hamsters. We compared the pathogenesis of BA.2.86 and BA.2.75, as the latter is one of the most virulent Omicron sub-variants in this animal model. Using digital pathology pipelines, we quantified the extent of pulmonary lesions measuring T cell and macrophage infiltrates, in addition to alveolar epithelial hyperplasia. We also assessed body weight loss, clinical symptoms, virus load in oropharyngeal swabs, and virus replication in the respiratory tract. Our data show that BA.2.86 displays an attenuated phenotype in hamsters, suggesting that it poses no greater risk to public health than its parental Omicron sub-variants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>BA.2.75</kwd><kwd>BA.2.86</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>coronavirus</kwd><kwd>virulence</kwd><kwd>pandemic preparedness</kwd><kwd>hamster</kwd><kwd>digital pathology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is characterised by the continuous emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). The Omicron subvariant BA.2.86 was initially detected from samples collected in July 2023, and subsequently designated as a variant under monitoring (VUM) by the World Health Organisation after its detection in multiple countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). BA.2.86 is most closely related to BA.2 circulating in Southern Africa in early 2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The concerns related to BA.2.86 emergence are due to the high number of mutations compared to its predecessor (50 along the entire genome, including 33 in spike) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). BA.2.86 does not appear to escape existing population immunity (conferred by either XBB.1.5, or BA.4/BA.5 breakthrough infections) significantly more than the currently dominating variants XBB.1.5 and EG.5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). A recent report from the UK, also suggests that individuals that have not been vaccinated since 2022 maintain sufficient cross-neutralising activity against BA.2.86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P3">In addition to their immunoevasive properties, emerging new variants need also to be risk-assessed for their intrinsic virulence. The BA.1 variant displays an attenuated phenotype, compared to the previous circulating variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). However, there is no evolutionary pressure on the virus to decrease virulence, unless this affects virus transmission.</p><p id="P4">Hamsters have proved to be an excellent model to assess SARS-CoV-2 virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) as they are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and develop lesions in the respiratory tract resembling those induced in humans. Importantly, so far there has been a good correlation between the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in hamsters and humans. For example, the higher level of virulence of Delta in the human population, compared to the original B.1, has been recapitulated in hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p><p id="P5">We have recently developed a digital pathology pipeline to quantify SARS-CoV-2-induced lesions in the respiratory tract, as a proxy for viral virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Using these methods, we confirmed how Delta is more virulent than BA.1. We also showed that Omicron sub-variants BA.2.75 and the recently emerged EG.5.1 have regained some virulence, although not reaching the levels observed for the pre-Omicron variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Here, we experimentally infected hamsters with either BA.2.86 (n=8), BA.2.75 (n=6), or mock-infected controls (n= 4). We compared BA.2.86 virulence to BA.2.75, as in our hands the latter is among the most virulent of the Omicron sub-variants. We monitored animals’ weight and clinical signs daily until 6 days post-infection (dpi), before culling them for post-mortem analyses. Tissues were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin wax as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). We also took oropharyngeal swabs for RNA extraction and quantification of viral load at 1, 2 and 5 (dpi). Animals infected with BA.2.75 displayed a moderate weight loss, while animals infected with BA.2.86 gained some weight during the duration of the experiment, although not as pronounced as in the animals of the mock-infected group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). All (6/6) BA.2.75-infected, as opposed to only 3/8 BA.2.86-infected, hamsters displayed mild clinical signs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The remaining 5 BA.2.86-infected animals, like the mock-infected group, showed no clinical signs. Virus load was ~ 3-7 fold higher in BA.2.75-infected animals, compared to those infected with BA.2.86 at 1 and 2 dpi, while virus RNA was detectable at 5 dpi only in 5/6 BA.2.75-infected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We quantified virus-induced pulmonary lesions using software-assisted whole lung section (collected at 6 dpi) imaging of immunohistochemistry, and downstream automatic quantification of positive signal, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Briefly, we quantified the levels of alveolar epithelial hyperproliferation using TTF1 antibodies, but excluding by machine learning approaches individual TTF1<sup>+</sup> type 2 pneumocytes and epithelia bronchial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). We quantified T cell and macrophage infiltrates using CD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) and IBA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>) antibodies, respectively. We detected higher levels of alveolar epithelial proliferation, T-cell and macrophages infiltrates in the lungs collected from BA.2.75 infected hamsters, while lungs from BA.2.86-infected animals were not significantly different from mock-infected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G-I</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We also infected an additional groups of hamsters with BA.2.86 (n=4), and culled them at 2 dpi in order to assess viral replication in the lungs at the early times post-infection, as we and others have shown that virus is largely cleared by 6 dpi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). As expected, in BA.2.86 infected animals we detected virus in the trachea, as well as large bronchi and only very occasionally in the lung parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J-L</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The results presented above in experimentally infected hamsters, are in line with a recent observation in England, where 45 infections caused by BA.2.86 were diagnosed in residents and staff of a care home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Although BA.2.86 showed a very high attack rate (87%), less than half of the infected patients were symptomatic and only one was hospitalised. Overall, our study shows that the newly emerging variant BA.2.86 is relatively non-pathogenic in hamsters. Our data suggest that at present, this variant should not pose a greater risk than the original Omicron variant.</p></body><back><ack id="S1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the Histology Research Service, University of Glasgow for their excellent support and the high quality of their services.
