To understand dysregulated hematopoiesis in DS, we integrated single-cell transcriptomics of over 1.1 million cells with chromatin accessibility and spatial transcriptomics datasets using human foetal liver and bone marrow samples from three disomic and 15 trisomic foetuses. We found that differences in gene expression in DS were both cell type- and environment-dependent. Furthermore, we found multiple lines of evidence that DS haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are “primed” to differentiate. We subsequently established a DS-specific map of enhancer-gene relationships in disomic and trisomic HSCs using 10X Multiome data. By integrating this map with genetic variants associated with blood cell variation, we discovered that trisomy restructured enhancer-gene maps to dysregulate enhancer activity and gene expression critical to erythroid lineage differentiation. Further, as DS mutations display a signature of oxidative stress, we validated both increased mitochondrial mass and oxidative stress in DS, and observed that these mutations preferentially fell into regulatory regions of expressed genes in HSCs. Altogether, our single-cell, multi-omic resource provides a high-resolution molecular map of foetal haematopoiesis in Down’s Syndrome and indicates significant enhancer-gene restructuring giving rise to co-occurring haematological conditions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Children with trisomy of chromosome 21 (Ts21), also known as Down’s syndrome (DS), have a 150-fold higher risk of developing myeloid leukaemia in the first five years of life compared to the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The current leukaemogenesis model in DS proposes cell-intrinsic events that start in Ts21 foetal liver via specific somatic mutations in the transcription factor GATA1, leading to preleukaemia development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Preleukaemia spontaneously resolves in most newborns, but it can progress to leukaemia when persistent GATA1 mutant clones acquire additional mutations post-birth, which are often in chromatin regulators and signalling factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The proposed model, while insightful, does not explain further numerous haematological abnormalities present in Ts21 foetal liver and newborns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Neonates with DS are often born with defects in red blood cell production, such as polycythaemia (increased number of erythrocytes) or macrocytosis (large erythrocytes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, in a process that is not fully understood but independent of any leukaemia-inducing mutations. These haematological abnormalities are highly variable in both severity and penetrance across individuals, suggesting that factors such as epigenetics, the composition of the microenvironment, and gene-environment interactions may also contribute to the disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. For example, during foetal development, haematopoiesis occurs simultaneously in both the foetal liver and bone marrow (BM). Previous research in DS has shown an increase in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors in the foetal liver but not in the BM, along with a reduction in granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, emphasising the microenvironment’s relevance.</p><p id="P4">Notably, Ts21 foetal liver haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) not only display an elevated mutational rate but also exhibit a unique mutational signature related to oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Oxidative stress is a potent driver of mutagenesis and is considered a potential cause for the GATA1 mutations observed in Ts21 preleukemia and acute megakaryocytic leukaemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, given the well-know and substantial impacts of chromatin organisation on mutation patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and Ts21’s effect on reconfiguring the entire 3D genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, it remains to be evaluated whether Ts21-induced genome-wide reshaping of chromatin organisation in a cell-type-specific manner underlies distinct haematological phenotypes observed in Ts21, such as an increase in erythroid cells but an impairment in the lymphoid lineage. Further, it remains to be determined how altered chromatin organisation in Ts21 in combination with heightened oxidative stress exposure could potentially create an environment conducive to acquiring mutations that contribute to the development of preleukaemia and leukaemia.</p><p id="P5">Here we combined single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) from 1.1 million cells, 10X multiome, spatial transcriptomics and single-cell <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation assays to examine how foetal haematopoietic cells with an altered dosage of chromosome 21 genes interact with particular niches (foetal liver versus BM) and how these interactions differ from those in disomic foetuses.

In order to capture a full diversity of blood and niche cell types present in the foetal liver and BM (isolated from the femur), we implemented a variety of sorting and column-enrichment strategies. We isolated cells from 15 Ts21 and three disomic foetuses (median age 14 post-conception weeks (pcw)), from each of the following three populations: CD235-(niche and haematopoietic cells depleted of erythrocytes), CD34+/Lin-(haematopoietic progenitors), and CD45+ (pan-haematopoietic marker), and sequenced their transcriptomes using 10x Genomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">2</xref>). In addition, we collected part of the liver from 11 Ts21 and five disomic foetuses for spatial transcriptomics (STx) analysis using 10X Genomics Visium. Finally, for three Ts21 and three disomic liver samples, we performed 10X Multiome analysis of CD45+ cells, combining a single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) and snRNA-seq from the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cellular and spatial organisation of Ts21 and disomic foetal samples</title><p id="P7">Following quality control (QC) (see Methods), our scRNA-seq dataset comprised 943,074 cells from Ts21 and 164,478 cells from disomic foetuses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">2</xref>). We identified eight major blood and niche cell types in both the Ts21 and disomic foetal liver and femur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 2</xref>) which were further resolved into 37 cell types in femur and 25 in liver (see Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Results</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 1c-f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">3</xref>, &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 3-7</xref>). Overall, the frequency of most cell types was similar between Ts21 and disomic liver samples, however, there were notable differences. In Ts21, we detected an increase in HSC/Multipotent Progenitors (MPPs) (as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>), erythroid cells, mast cells and megakaryocytes (FDR &lt; 0.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 8</xref>). Furthermore, there was an additional population of highly cycling HSCs in Ts21 liver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 3</xref>). In line with previously reported impairment in B cell development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, we did not detect a distinct cluster of mature B cells in the Ts21 foetal liver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">4</xref>). In contrast, the proportion of myeloid cells was decreased in Ts21 liver compared to disomic liver (FDR &lt; 0.1 for each population) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 8</xref>). Importantly, we experimentally validated that the Ts21 causes wide perturbation in the stem and progenitor compartment in the foetal liver using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 6</xref>), which underscores the robustness of our computational classification of cell types in scRNA-seq. Haematopoietic differentiation appeared to be less perturbed in Ts21 samples within the BM compared to the liver, as the population of cycling HSCs and dysregulated progression of B cell maturation was mainly detected in the latter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 3</xref> <italic>versus</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 4</xref>). We subsequently confirmed the robustness of our cell-type annotations and differences in frequency of cell types between Ts21 and disomic liver samples after integration using Harmony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and scVI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, as well as reference-query mapping from a published disomic foetal liver atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and our Ts21 liver cells to disomic liver cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Results</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 7</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">9</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To validate differences in cell abundances and examine how scRNA-seq-identified cell types are spatially arranged in DS, we performed spatial transcriptomics. We performed 10X Visium on two consecutive 10 µm sections from 11 Ts21 foetal livers (all matched to the original samples used for the scRNA-seq) and five disomic foetal livers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 9</xref>). We estimated the abundance of cell types within each Visium spot by leveraging cell-type expression profiles from the scRNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Once cell types were resolved on tissue, we examined the frequency of different cell types across all sections in Ts21 <italic>versus</italic> disomic samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). As in the scRNA-seq dataset, the number of HSCs was higher (although not statistically significant) in Ts21 compared to disomic liver. Furthermore, hepatic stellate cells (FDR=2.3E-07), activated stellate cells (FDR=0.003), and Kupffer cells (FDR=0.01) were less abundant in Ts21 foetal liver compared to the disomic tissue, whereas mast cells (FDR=0.002), late erythroid cells (FDR=1.8E-06), pDC (FDR=0.002), pro B cells (FDR=0.03), and hepatocytes (FDR=2.3E-06) showed higher frequency in Ts21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>, e). The high concordance in the results obtained in scRNA-Seq and Visium suggests that our spatial “map” of different cell types accurately represents their distribution in the tissue and revealed significant alterations in myeloid and lymphoid lineage abundances.</p><p id="P9">To investigate whether observed differences in cell frequency affected the spatial organisation of cells in Ts21 <italic>versus</italic> disomic liver, we quantified the colocalization of cell types residing in the same Visium spot (see Methods). Our analysis showed that haematopoietic populations with close lineage relationships tended to co-localise in the same spot in disomic foetal liver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 10</xref>). For example, relative abundance of HSC/MPPs was highly correlated with megakaryocyte-erythroid-mast progenitors (MEMPs), granulocyte progenitors, pre-pro B cells and early erythroid cells; monocyte progenitors were correlated with monocytes and NK progenitors with NK cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 10a</xref>). In addition, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), known to reside in close vicinity in foetal liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, were also highly correlated in our Visium data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 10</xref>). LSECs act as gatekeepers that prevent hepatic stellate cell activation and in disomic liver activated stellate cells were often co-localising with arterial endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 10a-b</xref>). In Ts21 however, several close interactions were perturbed; hepatic stellate cells were more correlated with arterial endothelial cells and pre-pro B cells lost their connection with HSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 10a-b</xref>). This indicates that both the cell abundance and co-localisation of cell types in Ts21 foetal liver are markedly distinct from that in disomic samples.</p><p id="P10">We next calculated, based on the co-expression of genes in different cell types clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, which ligand-receptor pairs (L-Rs) are potentially involved in HSC/MPP cell interactions in Ts21 and the disomic foetal liver (see Methods). HSC/MPPs shared the most L-Rs with arterial endothelial cells and the least with hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 10c</xref>). We identified a number of well-known L-Rs involved in HSC/MPPs development and function which were present in both Ts21 and disomic samples, such as VEGFB-FLT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, ANGPT1-TEK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, and NOTCH1-JAG1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 10d</xref>). Gene-set enrichment analysis of L-Rs expressed in HSC/MPPs (used for their interaction with arterial endothelial cells) revealed engagement of ERK1/2 cascade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 10e</xref>) which is a common target of growth factors regulating haematopoiesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Activation of ERK1/2 pathways promotes HSC proliferation, a hallmark of foetal haematopoiesis, at the expense of quiescence. The interaction of HSCs with hepatocytes (both in Ts21 and disomic) included L-Rs relevant for iron ion uptake such as TFRC-TF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Figure 10d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Osteo-lineage development is altered in Ts21 bone marrow</title><p id="P11">Osteo-lineage is an important regulator of the HSC’s activity in the BM. Therefore, we examined if Ts21 affects differentiation and gene expression of osteoblasts in BM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 5-6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Results for annotations</xref>). Interestingly, the osteo-lineage appeared perturbed in Ts21 with many of the key osteo-lineage genes (such as <italic>BGLAP, IBSP</italic>, or <italic>SP7</italic>) being sparsely expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 4</xref>). To examine this further, we generated a differentiation trajectory within the BM niche and calculated dynamically expressed genes along the osteo-lineage trajectory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> (from CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells to leptin receptor positive CAR (<italic>LepR</italic>+ CAR) cells to osteoprogenitors to osteoblasts, the latter being present only in disomic BM) (see Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f,g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 11a</xref>).

In contrast, genes related with “extracellular matrix organisation” and “epithelial cell proliferation” were negatively correlated. In Ts21, however, there was a weaker correlation between terminal state probability (a quantitative measure of osteo-lineage differentiation) and gene expression (both positive and negative) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>) suggesting a less coordinated regulation of osteo-lineage related genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 11b</xref>) that partially impeded osteo-lineage development.</p><p id="P12">We further observed that a population of endothelial cells (here termed transitioning endothelial cells) formed a continuum that connected clusters from endothelial cells with the osteo-lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>, h; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Figure 11c</xref>), suggesting that endothelial cells can go through endothelial-to-osteoblast transition in disomic foetuses. It has been recently reported that endothelial cells can give rise to BM stromal niche cells through endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndoMT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.

To assess microenvironmental effects in DS, we examined gene expression across all cell types in foetal liver vs BM (see Methods).

We further observed an exponential relationship in dysregulation of genes on chr21 <italic>versus</italic> non-chr21 genes (in contrast to an approximate linear relationship of chr1 versus non-chr1 genes), suggesting that a “critical mass” of around 30%-50% dysregulated genes on chr21 was necessary before widespread (&gt;10%) dysregulation can take place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). This widespread dysregulation was not driven by individual genes, such as particular chromatin modifiers or TFs, indicating a potential contribution of feedback loops or synergistic regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Results</xref>).</p><p id="P14">As Ts21 leukaemia is believed to originate from foetal liver HSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, we analysed gene-environment interactions specifically in HSCs.

We first set out to identify maps of enhancer-gene relationships in disomic and Ts21 HSCs. We then used these maps to assess whether trisomy influences enhancer-gene interactions to alter gene expression. We established maps of enhancer-gene relationships in disomic and Ts21 HSCs by correlating peak accessibility with gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>; see Methods). We identified 191 and 1,564 significant peak-gene links in disomic and Ts21 HSCs respectively (FDR &lt; 0.2), with a greater number of links being identified in Ts21 HSCs even after downsampling cells to the disomic HSC count (773 significant links; 4.1-times more) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b, c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 13</xref>). Of all identified peak-gene links, only 69 were shared between disomic and Ts21 HSCs (representing 36.1% of those found in disomic HSCs).

We found a significant interaction term for 62.1% (72/116) of all significant peak-gene links that were specific to disomic HSCs.

This suggests that the greater activation of those regulatory elements and more widespread transcription (i.e. more genes expressed and higher expression) in Ts21 HSCs allowed these peak-gene links to be discovered. Finally, 21.7% (15/69) of peak-gene links detected in both disomic and Ts21 HSCs (FDR &lt; 0.2) had a significant interaction, resulting in the dampening or strengthening of the peak-gene relationship in Ts21.

As a result, the highly variable genes will be impacted by disomic versus Ts21 differences and insufficiently capture the genes relevant to liver- or femur-residing cells. Therefore, we chose to create disomic liver, Ts21 liver, disomic femur, and Ts21 femur datasets to most accurately annotate the population of the individual cells in the data. Within each of the four merged datasets, we applied log-normalization, using the scaling factor 10,000 to correct for between-sample differences in library size, and calculated highly variable genes, using the Seurat implementation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref></sup>.

This is particularly useful for broad cell types such as erythroid cells that were further split into early and late erythroid cells. Following the between-sample batch correction above, we computed a neighborhood graph using the UMAP approach implemented in Scanpy and subsequently clustered with the Leiden algorithm. For visualisation purposes, we used Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) manifold embedding to capture the global features in two and three dimensions. We identified marker genes for each cluster by performing a Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction, and we annotated clusters using these marker genes and canonical marker genes. We performed further clustering, by manually choosing clusters to subcluster using K-means clustering, merging clusters of the same cell type, and performing marker gene detection.

We first tested whether cell-type-specific overexpression of a particular gene on chromosome 21 can lead to greater dysregulation on either chromosome 21 or on other chromosomes. Since the probability of a gene being differentially expressed is linked to the number of cells tested in the DE analysis, we tested this using log-fold change values. For each chr21 gene and across cell types, we tested the Pearson correlation between log2-fold change of gene expression (from Ts21 vs disomic samples) and (i) chr21 DEG % or (ii) non-chr21 DEG % and determined the significance of the correlation using FDR &lt; 0.1. Second, we reasoned that overall expression of an important chr21 gene could lead to greater dysregulation, as a highly-expressed chromatin modifier or transcription factor might have a consistent 50% overexpression in Ts21 across cell types, but the overexpression might matter more in the cell types where the gene is expressed. We tested this for each chr21 gene.

Downsampling allows the ability to compare two analyses from distinct datasets that are confounded by differences in size.

Similarly, within Ts21 <italic>versus</italic> disomic analyses, we downsampled the Ts21 and disomic liver data based on foetus-sample-cell counts in the Ts21 and disomic femur data. As an additional restriction in our downsampling, we ensured that foetuses present in both liver and femur data, with equal or greater number of cells and samples in the liver compared to femur, would still be selected in the downsample. The downsampling routine was repeated 100 times, such that 100 new datasets were created that match the smaller dataset.

We compared the proportions of cycling cells using a Mann-Whitney U test.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Evaluating the regional distribution of catalogued somatic mutations</title><p id="P74">Using publicly available data, we evaluated the hypothesis that Down’s syndrome impacts the regulatory landscape to influence where somatic mutations occur. First, we downloaded somatic mutation data from Hasaart et al. in foetal Ts21 and disomic HSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and converted the mutation positions from hg19 to hg38 using liftOver. Second, we identified genes expressed in Ts21 HSCs. We used the filtered set from the Ts21 cycling versus less-cycling HSC differential expression analyses, which were identified by the filterByExpr() function. Next, we narrowed down the Ts21 and disomic sets of mutations within the HSC-expressed genes to the set of non-coding intronic mutations. Finally, we downloaded cCREs in hg38 from ENCODE, and for Ts21 and disomic mutation sets, we calculated the proportion of intronic somatics in Ts21 HSC-expressed genes that overlap with ENCODE cCREs. To determine significant differences, we bootstrapped the disomic intronic mutation set for 1000 times, and compared the observed Ts21 proportion to the disomic distribution. We calculated P-values as the proportion of bootstrapped disomic mutation sets with larger values than the Ts21 value.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Analysis of the 10x Visium data</title><p id="P75">For disomic and Ts21 liver datasets, we used our annotated cell types from the disomic and Ts21 large scRNA-seq datasets as our input reference data for Cell2location<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Next, we merged all SpaceRanger outputs of tissue sections for disomic liver and then separately for Ts21 liver to create two Scanpy objects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref></sup>. We removed mitochondrial genes and spots with the total expressed gene count less than 800 (the remaining spots were of sufficient good quality for downstream analysis).</p><p id="P76">We then estimated cell type abundances for each spatial spot. Using Cell2location, we trained a negative binomial regression model on the input reference data. We applied our model to the Scanpy formatted data, considering tissue section as a covariate to account for distinct batches. We used the estimated posterior mean value of each cell type (from Cell2location) as the local abundances. For each section, we computed the section-level relative abundance of each cell type as the proportion of its estimated abundance across all spots over the total estimated abundance of all cell types across all spots. We compared relative abundances between disomic and Ts21 using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, and corrected p-values by using Benjamini-Hochberg.</p><p id="P77">To evaluate cell type colocalisation, we computed spot-level relative abundance of each cell type, dividing each cell type’s abundance on an individual spot by the total abundance of all cell types on the same spot. We then computed a Pearson distance matrix among cell types, based on these spot-level relative abundances across sufficient-quality spots of tissue sections in the same disease status, respectively for Ts21 Liver and disomic Liver. We next did hierarchical clustering, with inter-cluster distance estimated by the Ward variance minimization algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Processing the multiome data</title><p id="P78">We performed the initial processing of multiome data using <italic>Seurat</italic> and <italic>Signac</italic>. After cellranger processing, we identified high-quality multiome cells for downstream analysis if they satisfied the following criteria: &gt;750 RNA UMIs, &gt;250 expressed genes, &lt;40% mitochondrial read fraction, TSS enrichment score &gt; 3, and &gt;1000 ATAC fragments in peaks.</p><p id="P79">We next identified and annotated transcriptionally distinct clusters within Ts21 and disomic samples using Seurat. We created Ts21-specific and disomic-specific expression matrices by merging the matrices across Ts21 or disomic samples respectively. Within the separate Ts21 and disomic expression datasets, we log-normalized with a scaling factor of 10000, identified 2000 highly variable genes, scaled and centered the data, performed PCA, and used Harmony with lambda = 1 to batch correct for sample-specific variation. We then constructed a k-nearest neighbours graph based on the euclidean distance in PCA space (using the first 30 components), and identified transcriptionally distinct clusters using the leiden algorithm. We nominated marker genes for each cluster by performing a Wilcoxon signed-rank test that compares cells within one cluster to all other cells. We performed further clustering by performing K-means clustering and we merged clusters of the same cell type. With this approach, we annotated each cell in two separate multiome datasets (Ts21 and disomic). The Harmony-corrected datasets were visualized in two dimensions using UMAP.</p><p id="P80">Our overarching process for creating the chromatin accessibility matrix was to call peaks within each sample before calling a final set of peaks from cell-type-specific ATAC profiles. We first called peaks within each sample using <italic>macs2</italic>, as implemented with default parameters in Signac’s <italic>callPeaks</italic>() function. We created a unified set of peaks across all samples by combining any intersecting peaks into a single peak, and removing the combined peaks that were less than 20 bp or more than 10 kb wide. This set of peaks was used to compute a cell x peaks matrix for each sample from the ATAC fragments file. Using all peaks present in at least 10 cells, we ran latent semantic indexing (a two-step procedure of first using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) normalisation and then singular value decomposition) to project the ATAC matrix into a reduced dimension representation. We performed batch correction over all samples using Harmony before constructing a k-nearest neighbours graph across the first 30 components (except omitting the first component, which correlates with sequencing depth). This graph was used to perform clustering using the leiden algorithm with resolution = 1, and within each cluster, a new set of peaks were called using macs2. This set of peaks was combined into a unified set of peaks, which was used to form the final cell x peaks matrix which contained all final Ts21 and disomic cells.</p><p id="P81">For downstream analyses involving a single combined dataset, the two datasets were merged into a single matrix. Log-normalization, scaling, PCA, Harmony batch correction, and UMAP were applied to the combined dataset.</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Myeloid Trajectory analysis of snRNA using CellRank</title><p id="P82">Processed snRNA data from multiome was subset to cells of myeloid lineage. Both disomic and Ts21 cohorts were downsampled to 15,000 cells. A trajectory graph was calculated using Pegasus’ force directed layout (FLE) function. Instead of UMAP space, the cell trajectories were plotted in FLE space. Trajectory analysis of the RNA expression data closely followed the CellRank tutorial “CellRank beyond RNA velocity.” Moments of connectivity were calculated using scVelo with 30 principal components and 15 neighbours. The root cell was manually selected according to the diffusion map of HSCs, selecting the cell with the greatest Euclidean distance in FLE space from the centre of the cluster, indicating a cell with a divergent transcriptome. The pseudotimeKernel was used to calculate pseudotime with default parameters. The CytoTRACEKernel was used to compute the transition matrix with the parameters used in the tutorial (threshold_scheme=“soft”, nu=0.5). To compute terminal states and the probability of each cell differentiating toward each terminal state, the GPCCA estimator was utilised with default parameters. Schur decomposition was performed, and 5 terminal states were automatically selected according to an eigengap in the real part of the eigenvalues. Terminal states were labelled according to the cell type with the closest association (Late erythroid, Monocytes, Mast cells, pDCs, Megakaryocytes) and absorption probability was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="S36"><title>Topic modelling of HSC multiome using MIRA</title><p id="P83">Only HSCs were included for all downstream MIRA analysis. Out of the 6,215 HSCs, 3,784 were Ts21 and 2,431 were disomic. All MIRA analysis closely followed the online tutorials.</p><p id="P84">To generate the latent topics for RNA, the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework uses raw expression counts as input. Rare genes were removed by filtering genes only expressed in 15 or fewer cells. 7,905 exogenous genes were selected using Scanpy’s highly variable gene function, selecting for all genes with a minimum mean dispersion of 0.1. Exogenous genes are genes which will be captured in topics but will not be used as VAE features. 4,359 endogenous genes were selected by filtering the exogenous genes for those with a normalised dispersion greater than 0.5. Endogenous genes will be used as features for the VAE network. The ExpressionTopicModel was instantiated with the default parameters. The learning rate bounds were manually tuned to cover the portion of the learning rate vs loss curve with the steepest slope. The model was then tuned using TopicModelTuner with default iterations, a minimum number of topics set to 2, a maximum number of topics set to 15, a batch size of 32, 3-fold cross-validation, and a training size of 0.8.</p><p id="P85">To generate the latent topics for ATAC, the VAE framework uses binarized peak counts. Peaks were filtered according to the epiScanpy tutorial. Using the same process for RNA, 72,541 exogenous peaks and 45,095 endogenous peaks were selected according to a minimum mean dispersion of 0.05 and a normalised dispersion greater than 0.5. The AccessibilityTopicModel was instantiated with the default parameters and “dataset_loader_workers” set to 3. The learning rate bounds were manually tuned to cover the portion of the learning rate vs loss curve with the steepest slope. The model was then tuned using TopicModelTuner with default iterations, a minimum number of topics set to 2, a maximum number of topics set to 15, a batch size of 8, 1-fold cross-validation, and a training size of 0.8.</p><p id="P86">Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on the expression topics using MIRA’s wrapper of enrichr and the top 200 genes associated with each topic. For the accessibility topics, transcription factor (TF) binding sites were annotated in peaks using MIRA’s motif scanning and the hg38 reference from the UCSC repository. Each peak was scanned according to the JASPAR 2020 vertebrate collection of TF binding motifs. TF’s that were not expressed in the RNA data were removed. For comparing RNA and ATAC topics, the joint data was split into a disomic and Ts21 dataset and MIRA’s “get_topic_cross_correlation” function was performed.</p></sec><sec id="S37"><title>Trajectory analysis of HSC multiome using MIRA</title><p id="P87">First, a joint embedding space was calculated using MIRA’s “make_joint_representation” function to combine both modalities. A neighbourhood graph and UMAP embedding was performed on the joint representation (15 neighbours and a minimum distance of 0.1). The datasets were then batch corrected using Harmony on the joint UMAP features. The neighbourhood graph and UMAP embedding were re-calculated on the harmony adjusted feature space.</p><p id="P88">We next calculated several different HSC branches. First, the diffusion map was calculated using Scanpy “diffmap” with default parameters and then normalised by MIRA to regularise distortions in magnitude of the eigenvectors. Schur decomposition was performed and the eigengap heuristic was used to automatically select the proper number of diffusion components within the data (3). The data was subsetted to 3 diffusion components and the neighbourhood graph was calculated on the diffusion map embedding and components were connected. Pseudotime was calculated using MIRA’s “get_transport_map” function which defines a transport map using a Markov chain model of forward differentiation. A root cell was selected as the maximum value of the third diffusion component based on the suggestion in the tutorial. This root cell was located in the centre of the highest density of HSCs. Terminal cells were identified using MIRA’s “find_terminal_cells” function with 8 iterations and a threshold of 0.01. There were 3 distinct clusters of terminal cells, the cell in each cluster farthest away from the root cell was selected, and the probability of each cell differentiating toward those 3 branches was calculated. The lineage probabilities were parsed into a bifurcating tree structure using “get_tree_structure” with the threshold set to 1. Expression and accessibility dynamics across time were plotted using a streamgraph that depicts this tree structure.</p></sec><sec id="S38"><title>Regulatory potential modelling of HSC multiome using MIRA</title><p id="P89">MIRA’s LITE modelling was performed to link gene expression to nearby cis regulatory elements. For every gene, MIRA learns a regulatory window describing a range where changes in local accessibility appear to influence gene expression. The regulatory window decays exponentially both upstream and downstream according to the transcription start site (TSS) of each gene. Consequently, each gene is associated with a unique TSS using non-redundant human TSS annotations (hg38 GENCODE VM39). The model was trained on the union of genes that were highly variable and were the top 5% most activated in each of the 10 expression topics (n=5,367). The genes that did not have an annotated TSS were removed leaving 4,454 genes. The LITE model was instantiated with default parameters and the raw expression and accessibility data was then fit (4 out of 4,454 genes failed to fit). Now that each gene contained a trained regulatory potential model, the expression of each gene was estimated by calculating the maximum a posteriori prediction given the accessibility state of each gene in each cell.</p><p id="P90">Next, we identified TFs that regulate the expression of genes specific to each of the three HSC branches using MIRA’s probabilistic <italic>in-silico</italic> depletion method. MIRA simulates “computational knockouts” of each TF. MIRA uses regulatory potential (RP) modelling to predict gene expression based on local chromatin accessibility, and then masks cis-regulatory elements with specific motifs to define TFs where motif accessibility is important to gene expression prediction. This is measured by the changes in performance of the gene’s RP model to predict expression after computationally masking the binding sites of every TF. In this manner, TFs that strongly regulate a gene’s expression will be prioritised because masking of their binding site will significantly decrease the accuracy of the LITE model prediction. “probabilistic_isd” was run with default parameters across all modelled genes. In order to counteract the inefficiency of noisy TF binding site predictions, co-varying genes associated with individual topics were queried for a shared association across many TFs. The “driver_TF_test” function was utilised to identify potential TFs regulating the expression of branch specific topics. The top 150 topic specific genes were included, and a Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed over the association scores. After identifying TFs regulating topic expression, the top genes being regulated by these TFs were queried using “fetch_ISD_matrix” and selected according to the ranked association score. We additionally performed this procedure across all RNA topics, which we reported in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S39"><title>Divergence in accessibility and expression of HSC multiome using MIRA</title><p id="P91">In order to identify genes where expression cannot be accurately predicted by local chromatin accessibility alone, MIRA NITE modelling was performed. In addition to cis regulation, the NITE model expands upon the scope of the LITE model by incorporating accessibility topics, which are genome wide. The NITE model was initialised using the same parameters, topics, and genes as the LITE model using “spawn_NITE_model.” The model was fit and expression was predicted using default parameters. The difference between LITE and NITE model performance for every gene was calculated using “get_chromatin_differential.” “get_NITE_score_genes” was used to calculate a cumulative metric per gene describing the divergence of local accessibility and expression across all cells. Genes with a high cumulative NITE score indicate genes that are regulated in part by non-local mechanisms. The top 500 genes with the highest NITE score were incorporated into MIRA’s GSEA analysis. To ascertain if Ts21 HSCs expressed genes enriched for non-local regulation, pseudobulk differential expression was performed (DESeq2) between disomic and Ts21 HSCs. The distribution of cumulative gene NITE scores for the top 300 condition specific genes (Log2FC) was compared using Wilcoxon rank sum test with Benjamini Hochberg correction.</p></sec><sec id="S40"><title>Assessing enrichment of GWAS SNPs in single cells using SCAVENGE</title><p id="P92">Trait-relevant individual cells were calculated using SCAVENGE, which combines network propagation and SNP enrichment analysis to map causal variants to their cellular context. First, variants with posterior inclusion probability (PIP) &gt; 0.001 were downloaded in the format used by Yu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>, which were originally processed and described within Vuckovic et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> Second, the full multiome ATAC dataset (including all cell populations) was used as input to downstream tasks. A mutual <italic>k</italic> nearest neighbor graph was computed to represent the relationship between neighbouring single cells, using <italic>k</italic>=30. Next, g-chromVAR was used to calculate bias-corrected Z-scores for each tested trait and each single cell to estimate cell-trait relevance. The top 5% ranked cells served as seed cells for the SCAVENGE network propagation, which were further scaled and normalised to calculate the final SCAVENGE trait relevance score (TRS).</p><p id="P93">SCAVENGE TRS were contrasted between different lineage branches using a pseudobulk approach similar to the one we employed for differential expression analysis. On a per-sample-and-branch level, we pseudobulked the SCAVENGE scores by summing SCAVENGE scores across all cells of the same branch and of the same sample. We then applied three linear models to assess the impact of each of the three branches on SCAVENGE TRS. In each model, we accounted for the number of cells within the pseudobulk as a covariate. We determined significance by multiple test corrections at FDR &lt; 0.1 across the 9 analyses (3 branches (1, 2, 3) and 3 traits (red blood cell, white blood cell, and lymphocyte counts)).</p></sec><sec id="S41"><title>Identification and analysis of peak-gene links using SCENT</title><p id="P94">SCENT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref></sup> was used to identify peak-gene links in disomic HSCs and Ts21 HSCs, by correlating peak accessibility (binarized) and gene expression (raw) counts. SCENT is a Poisson regression model that recomputes the standard errors in the model coefficients by using bootstrapping, which helps maintain false positive rates.</p><p id="P95">We first identified all peak-gene combinations within 500 kb from each other. Separately within disomic and Ts21 HSCs, we retained all peak-gene combinations where &gt;5% cells were accessible and expressed the peak and the gene, retaining a total of 38,478 peak-gene combinations. Due to biological differences between disomic and Ts21, this was an overlapping but not identical peak-gene set tested in disomic and Ts21 HSCs.</p><p id="P96">Next, we applied a SCENT model using binarized peak accessibility, % mitochondrial reads, log(number of UMIs), and sample as the covariates, and expression counts as the dependent variable to each peak-gene combination. Based on the SCENT paper, we set up an iterative bootstrapping scheme to balance runtime and <italic>P</italic>-value accuracy based on the Poisson regression model <italic>P</italic>-values, where <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.1 consisted of 100 bootstraps, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.1 consisted of 1,000 bootstraps, and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 consisted of 10,000 bootstraps. SCENT was performed on a computing cluster using chunks of 100-500 peak-gene sets. We corrected for multiple testing using FDR, and determined significant peak-gene links at <italic>FDR</italic> &lt; 0.2. Finally, we repeated the Ts21 analysis after downsampling the 3,784 Ts21 HSCs to match the sample size of 2,431 disomic HSCs to assess the impact of cell population size.</p><p id="P97">Further, we used SCENT to test whether the effect of peak accessibility on gene expression is modified by trisomy. To do so, we included an interaction term between ATAC peak accessibility and trisomy 21 status in the SCENT model to address whether the effect of accessibility on expression depends on trisomy. We applied the new SCENT interaction model to a combined Ts21 and disomic HSC dataset. The analysis was performed on all significant peak-gene links in the disomic-only or Ts21-only analyses, and significant interaction terms were assessed at FDR &lt; 0.2.</p><p id="P98">One reason why Ts21-only peak-gene links were only identified in Ts21 yet have no significant interaction term would be a lack of gene expression or peak accessibility in disomic cells. To test whether Ts21-only peak-gene links without a significant interaction term were more accessible and expressed in Ts21 HSCs compared to disomic HSCs, we used differential accessibility (from the 10X multiome ATAC) and differential expression results (from the large scRNA-seq analysis). To calculate differential accessibility in the 10X multiome ATAC, we computed pseudobulk profiles and performed limma-voom with trisomy status as the covariate of interest, as similarly described in the large scRNA-seq analysis. We filtered peaks for differentially analysis using the filterByExpr() function in edgeR. We performed two separate binomial tests to assess whether the list of (a) Ts21-only peaks or (b) Ts21-only genes were upregulated in Ts21 compared to all other peaks or genes tested in differential analyses. We defined upregulated in Ts21 as nominal P &lt; 0.05 &amp; logFC &gt; 0 in the limma-voom results.</p><p id="P99">We performed two enrichment tests with regard to our Ts21 peak-gene links and RBC GWAS. We defined SCENT peaks and SCENT genes according to three significance thresholds from the SCENT peak-gene analysis: FDR &lt; 0.1, FDR &lt; 0.2, and nominal P &lt; 0.05, and identified GWAS-related peaks and genes using fine-mapped RBC GWAS SNPs at PIP &gt; 0.2. In the first analysis, we assessed the enrichment of fine-mapped RBC GWAS SNPs (PIP &gt; 0.2) within Ts21 SCENT peaks (also known as active cis-regulatory regions) using a Fisher’s exact test. Here, we are comparing whether peaks with a GWAS variant are more likely to be associated with gene expression compared to a background set of peaks without a GWAS variant, which include peaks accessible (in &gt;5% cells) and close to a gene (&lt; 500 kb) that is expressed (in &gt;5% cells). In the second analysis, we assessed the enrichment of differential expression at target GWAS genes defined by Ts21 SCENT peak-gene links. We defined differential expression as FDR &lt; 0.1 in the differential expression analysis of HSCs using the large scRNA-seq data. We subsetted to significant peak-gene links, and calculated a 2x2 contingency table reflecting (i) whether the peak contained a fine-mapped variant, and (ii) whether the target gene is differentially expressed. A Fisher’s exact test assessed the hypothesis that important enhancers (containing fine-mapped GWAS SNPs) are having a role in differential expression within HSCs (affecting their target genes).</p><p id="P100">Within the Results, we report the enrichment <italic>P</italic>-values within the text when using the set of peak-gene links with nominal <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 (from SCENT).

HSC latent UMAP space characterised by a joint representation of both RNA topic models and ATAC topic models as characterised by MIRA. <bold>d</bold>, UMAP with cells coloured according to pseudotime (dark=early, light=late). Black arrows denote vectors of the directed cell transition matrix. <bold>e</bold>, Representation of three branches of HSC differentiation in UMAP space as identified by MIRA. Cells are coloured according to the probability of each cell belonging to a specific branch (branch 1: left, branch 2: middle, branch 3: right). <bold>f</bold>, Compositional STREAM graph indicating the abundance of either disomic or Ts21 HSCs in each branch along pseudotime. As HSCs progress along MIRA calculated pseudotime, the abundance of each type of HSC (disomic: blue, Ts21: red) was calculated using a sliding window according to the branch identity of the cell. Dotted line indicates half the pseudotime (t=5). <bold>g</bold>, Compositional STREAM graph indicating the proportion of topic abundance within cells ordered along pseudotime according to each of the three branches. Total topic number was automatically optimised by MIRA. Left, 10 RNA expression topics. Right, 11 ATAC accessibility topics. For Ts21 HSCs (bottom row), as pseudotime progresses, both branch 2 and branch 3 become dominated by a few distinct topics. Within disomic HSCs (top row), there remains an even distribution for both RNA and ATAC topics. <bold>h</bold>, Left, scatter plot comparing the transcription factors (TF) regulating the expression of genes turned on specifically in branch 2 and branch 3. TF association scores calculated using MIRA’s probabilistic <italic>in-silico</italic> depletion function. P-values calculated using a Wilcoxon rank sum test over the association scores. Right, top genes regulated by labelled branch 2 TFs. The expression (blue) and accessibility (green) indicate Ts21 HSC specificity. Data is normalised by row to illustrate preference between disomic and Ts21. Analyses were performed using all n=56,890 cells and k=6 foetuses, represented by Ts21 liver (n=35,633 cells, k=3) and disomic liver (n=21,257, k=3), from which n=6,215 cells are HSCs (n=3,784 Ts21 and n=2,431 disomic HSCs).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS188726-f003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Integration of peak-gene links and GWAS SNPs.</title><p><bold>a,</bold> Schematic of the SCENT peak-gene multiome analysis performed in n=6,215 HSCs (n=3,784 Ts21 and n=2,431 disomic HSCs)<bold>. b,</bold> Distribution of significant peak-gene links identified in Ts21 (top) or disomic HSCs (bottom) (FDR &lt; 0.2).

The histogram represents the empirical distribution of this overlap from 10,000 bootstrapped sets of somatic variants found in disomic HSCs. <bold>e,</bold> Top, enrichment of fine-mapped GWAS SNPs from red blood cell counts (RBC) (PIP &gt; 0.2) in SCENT peak-gene links (termed active <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions) as identified in Ts21 HSCs. Bottom, enrichment of target GWAS genes (based on Ts21 SCENT peak-gene links and using fine-mapped RBC SNPs) within differentially expressed genes, as identified in the large scRNA-seq analysis of HSCs (FDR &lt; 0.1). Fisher’s exact test was performed for calculating odds ratios and standard errors. The analysis was repeated using three sets of peak-gene links based on SCENT significance: FDR &lt; 0.1, FDR &lt; 0.2, and nominal P-value &lt; 0.05. <bold>f,</bold> aggregated accessibility and expression of HSCs from disomic and Ts21 HSCs for <italic>TFR2</italic> and <italic>TSPAN32</italic> using 10X multiome data. <bold>g</bold>, Pseudobulk expression within HSC populations using the large scRNA-seq data. Each point represents a different sample. <bold>h-j,</bold> 322 colonies generated by single-cell sorted HSC/MPPs from 3 independent disomic and Ts21 foetal livers. <bold>h,</bold> The total number of cells (live and dead) in Ts21 and disomic HSC-derived colonies. The difference between disomic and Ts21 colonies was determined by a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (<italic>P</italic>=1.3×10<sup>-3</sup>). <bold>i</bold>, The upper bar graph shows proportions of different lineages detected in either uni-, bi-, or multi-lineage colonies. The lower bar graph shows proportions of different lineages detected in uni-lineage colonies. Statistical differences between foetuses with Ts21 and the expected distribution based on disomic foetuses were tested by a chi-squared test (p=0.01148 and p=0.0111, respectively). <bold>j,</bold> The lineage output of “big colonies” and “all” Ts21 HSC/MPPs-derived colonies. Big Ts21 colonies were defined as colonies in which the total number of cells was higher than in 95% of disomic HSC/MPPs colonies, representing 20% of all Ts21 colonies. For comparison, the top 20% disomic colonies (ranked by cell count) were analysed. The main lineage output of each colony was defined by the lineage with the highest cell count, determined by flow cytometry.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS188726-f004"/></fig></floats-group></article>
