Ceramides and dihydroceramides are synthesized by a family of six ceramide synthase enzymes (CerS), each with distinct specificity for the acyl-CoA substrate. Importantly, the acyl chain length plays a key role in determining the physiological function of ceramides, as well as their role in metabolic disease. Ceramide with an acyl chain length of 16 carbons (C16 ceramide) has been implicated in obesity, insulin resistance and liver disease, and the C16 ceramide-synthesizing CerS6 is regarded as an attractive drug target for obesity-associated disease. Despite their importance, the molecular mechanism underlying ceramide synthesis by CerS enzymes remains poorly understood. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human CerS6, capturing covalent intermediate and product-bound states. These structures, together with biochemical characterization using intact protein and small molecule mass spectrometry, reveal that CerS catalysis proceeds via a ping-pong reaction mechanism involving a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate. Notably, the product-bound structure was obtained upon reaction with the mycotoxin fumonisin B<sub>1</sub>, providing new insights into its inhibition of CerS. These results provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms of CerS function, selectivity, and inhibition, and open new directions for future drug discovery targeting the ceramide and sphingolipid pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Ceramides are the precursors for the synthesis of complex sphingolipids and are bioactive lipids with crucial roles in signaling. In particular, ceramides have been proposed to act as key metabolic sensors to promote fatty acid utilization and storage during excessive fatty acid availability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. However, abnormal ceramide accumulation is associated with metabolic dysfunction, and elevated levels of ceramides have been observed in obesity-related metabolic disorders such as diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Ceramides are composed of a sphingosine (d18:1) long-chain base with an N-linked acyl chain, the length of which is critical to the lipids’ biological functions and roles in pathophysiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. For example, C16:0 ceramide is the most common ceramide in adipose tissue and its levels are elevated in this tissue of obese humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In addition, insulin resistance is correlated with plasma C16:0 and C18:0 ceramides, subcutaneous adipose tissue C16:0 ceramides, and hepatic C16:0 and C18:0 ceramides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, the levels of total ceramides and C16:0, C22:0 and C24:1 dihydroceramides were found to be elevated in the liver of insulin-resistant patients with NASH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In mammals, <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of ceramides is preceded by synthesis of dihydroceramides through the N-acylation of the sphingoid long-chain base sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine; d18:0) by one of six ceramide synthases (CerS1-6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The resulting dihydroceramides are subsequently converted into ceramides by one of two dihydroceramide Δ4-desaturases (DES1-2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Alternatively, CerS can directly re-acylate recycled sphingosine, in the salvage pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Of these enzymes, recent observations from human and mouse studies have highlighted CerS6 as an attractive target for treating obesity-associated metabolic disease, including type 2 diabetes and NASH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.

Strikingly, this effect was shown to only occur in CerS6<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice but not in CerS5<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice, though both show a preference for C16-CoA and therefore primarily produce C16 ceramides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and hepatic C16:0 ceramide levels were reduced in both knock-outs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. This surprising effect was found to be a result of the specific interaction of CerS6-derived C16:0 sphingolipids in mitochondria with the mitochondrial fission factor (Mff)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. This revealed that the subcellular localization of ceramide production can lead to drastically different physiological outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In further support of the therapeutic potential of inhibiting CerS6, ablation of the protein’s expression in an obese insulin resistance mouse model led to reduced body fat and improved oral glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Central to its enzymatic function, CerS contain a TRAM-Lag1-CLN8 (TLC) homology domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, which includes a 52-residue Lag1p motif containing conserved histidines and aspartates required for activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. In addition, CerS2-6 contain a non-essential Hox-like domain between TM1-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, flanked by two essential and conserved positively charged residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The activity of each CerS is subject to complex regulation, which includes phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, glycosylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, dimerisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and other protein-protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The six mammalian CerS also have different acyl chain-length specificities and tissue expression patterns, further influencing the tissue-specific distribution of the different ceramides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying synthesis and regulation of ceramides and dihydroceramides remain unclear.</p><p id="P8">Despite the interest in pharmacologically reducing CerS6 activity, at present, no specific inhibitors have been described for this family member. The best characterized CerS inhibitor is fumonisin B<sub>1</sub> (FB<sub>1</sub>), the most prevalent member of the fumonisin family of mycotoxins produced by <italic>Fusarium</italic> species.

The protein was purified in glyco-diosgenin (GDN), yielding a mixture of monomeric and dimeric species on size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1a-d</xref>). While we selected the dimer species for structural studies to maximize particle size and possible symmetry for single-particle cryo-EM, its relatively low molecular weight (84 kDa) is still challenging for current methods. We therefore raised camelid nanobodies against the purified protein and solved the structure of a CerS6 dimer with one nanobody bound per monomer at a nominal resolution of 3.2 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). The CerS6-Nb22 complex was well resolved throughout the membrane-spanning region, but the Hox-like domain was less well-defined. This allowed for unambiguous tracing of CerS6 and Nb22 with the exception of the Hox-like domains, where residues 72-119 were fitted into the envelope of the cryo-EM map as rigid bodies (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The cryo-EM structure reveals a CerS6 homodimer with one nanobody bound per monomer on the luminal face.

The TLC domain (TM2-7) forms a barrel containing two 3-TM units arranged as inverted repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>), while TM1 is attached to the outside of the barrel through contacts with TM2/3. The TM2-7 barrel is assembled around a central cavity, which is open to the cytoplasm and closed to the ER lumen by a loop between TM6-7. This central cavity has a large cytoplasmic opening (approximately 23 x 12 Å), creating a vestibule that funnels towards the midpoint of the membrane, where it forms a ~5 Å wide tunnel that stretches towards the ER side.</p><p id="P12">Interestingly, the fold of the TM2-7 barrel of CerS6 resembles that of the 6-TM barrels found in very-long-chain fatty acid elongase ELOVL7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and TMEM120A/B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, as identified by DALI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.

The observation that different acyl-CoA-modifying enzyme families share a similar 6-TM barrel structure is intriguing, suggesting that this architecture is likely optimized for the specific recognition and reaction with acyl-CoA substrates.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>CerS6 co-purifies with a covalently bound C16:0 acyl chain</title><p id="P13">Surprisingly, the cryo-EM density map revealed the presence of a long density extending from near the membrane mid-point to the occluded ER end of the central cavity, spanning the entire length of the narrow tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). This density was continuous between protein and the unknown molecule, suggesting a covalent modification by a lipid. To probe the presence of covalent adducts, we performed denaturing intact protein mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of purified protein samples, and identified a +238.45 Da mass shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1f,g</xref>). Notably, this adduct mass agrees with a covalently attached C16:0 acyl chain (theoretical: +238.41 Da). Strikingly, the shape and length of the density in the cryo-EM map is also consistent with a bound C16 acyl chain. A covalent bond is seen linking the acyl chain to the imidazole Nε of His211 (TM4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>), an absolutely conserved histidine that is required for CerS activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Thus, based on the extended density in the cryo-EM map and the observed mass adduct, we have modelled a palmitoyl (C16:0) chain covalently attached to His211.</p><p id="P14">The acyl chain is surrounded in the narrow tunnel primarily by hydrophobic side chains from TM4, TM5 and TM7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-e</xref>). The tunnel is sealed at the ER end by the TM6-7 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), revealing how the chain-length preference of CerS6 for C16-CoA is determined by limiting the number of carbons that can fit in the acyl-binding tunnel. This observation is in agreement with earlier reports that this loop determines CerS acyl chain specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Catalysis by CerS6 proceeds via a ping-pong mechanism</title><p id="P15">Acyltransferases catalyze two-substrate, two-product reactions that can proceed via either ternary-complex or double-displacement (ping-pong) mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. In a ternary-complex mechanism, both the acyl donor and acceptor bind simultaneously and the enzyme catalyzes the direct acyl transfer from one substrate to the other. In contrast, a ping-pong mechanism involves two independent steps. Initially, reaction with the first substrate (the acyl donor) results in the transfer of the acyl chain to a nucleophilic residue, forming a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate. This acyl chain is then transferred to the second substrate (the acyl acceptor) in the second step of the reaction.</p><p id="P16">The CerS6 structure reveals that there is not enough space for both substrates to bind in the central cavity and access the active site at the same time, thereby indicating a ternary-complex mechanism is unlikely. Furthermore, the C16:0 chain covalently attached to the conserved His211 fits with CerS6’s selectivity for palmitoyl-CoA and suggests that this species could correspond to the acyl-enzyme intermediate of a ping-pong type reaction mechanism. To investigate whether the acylated enzyme species corresponds to a real catalytic intermediate, we incubated the purified protein with the enzyme’s second substrate, the long-chain base sphinganine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Using denaturing intact protein MS, we observed the complete loss of the C16:0-modified protein after sphinganine addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Furthermore, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) revealed that incubation of the acylated protein with sphinganine led to the production of C16:0 dihydroceramide (observed <italic>m/z</italic>: 540.5380; theoretical <italic>m/z</italic>: 540.5350; mass error: +5.55 ppm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Overall, these results clearly demonstrate that sphinganine reacts with the acyl-enzyme intermediate to de-acylate the enzyme and generate the expected reaction product of dihydroceramide, thus supporting a ping-pong reaction mechanism for CerS6. Taken together with the structural data, this implies that His211 acts as the nucleophile in the first step of the reaction.</p><p id="P17">Notably, the CerS substrate sphinganine and FTY720 are chemically similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), with potential clinical consequences to drug pharmacokinetics as 15% of FTY720 becomes N-acylated in human subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Although the major N-acyl FTY720 metabolites identified were N-stearoyl and N-2-hydroxystearoyl FTY720, there is evidence suggesting that a small amount of N-palmitoyl (C16:0) FTY720 is formed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Which enzyme catalyzes the N-acylation of FTY720 has not been determined, but a putative role for CerS enzymes or the reverse reaction of ceramidases has been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Incubation of acyl-CerS6 with FTY720 results in a small increase in the protein’s thermostability, suggesting it binds to the purified enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). To investigate whether purified CerS6 can N-acylate FTY720 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we incubated the enzyme with this compound, and subsequently identified C16:0 FTY720 in the reaction mixture (observed <italic>m/z</italic>: 546.4869; theoretical <italic>m/z</italic>: 546.4881;mass error: -2.20 ppm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), the expected product of a reaction between FTY720 and the CerS6 bound acyl chain. The proposed structure of this C16:0 FTY720 reaction product was further validated based on the product ion MS/MS spectrum of its [M+H]<sup>+</sup> ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). However, no obvious loss of the acyl-enzyme mass peak was observed when the reaction mixture was analyzed by denaturing intact protein MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>), suggesting that FTY720 is a poor acyl acceptor for acylated CerS6.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Highly conserved residues line the catalytic site</title><p id="P18">CerS6’s Lag1p motif (Arg202-Tyr253) (TM4-5) contains the highly conserved His211/His212 (TM4) and Asp239/Asp242 (L5a-b/TM5), which have been previously suggested to be located in the catalytic site and have been shown to be essential for function in mammalian CerS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Lag1p<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">Examining the CerS6 structure, we noted these residues line the central cavity near the mid point of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).

Although the observation that the mechanism of CerS6 involves a nucleophilic histidine was surprising - as cysteines or serines are more commonly employed as nucleophiles - there are multiple well-documented examples of other enzymes using nucleophilic histidines in their catalytic mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">Histidine nucleophiles are typically oriented and activated by hydrogen-bonding between a proton at Nδ of the imidazole ring and a hydrogen bond acceptor, ensuring that Nε remains unprotonated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Examining our structure, we noted the proximity of His212 to the acylated His211 in CerS6, which immediately suggested this residue is the necessary hydrogen bond acceptor. While the Nδ of His212 is located 3.84 Å away from the Nδ of His211, it is plausible that the two side chains may interact in the acyl-CoA-bound state. Indeed, we found that mutation of His212 to alanine results in the complete loss of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Residues equivalent to His212 of CerS6 are also essential in the homologous mouse and human CerS1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> and yeast Lag1p<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. This demonstrates the second histidine plays a key role in catalysis, and explains the pathogenic effect of mutating the equivalent His of CerS1 to a Gln in patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsy and dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that the reaction of human ELOVL7 with acyl-CoA substrates also involves a double histidine motif, where the first histidine acts as a nucleophile and is activated by hydrogen-bonding to the second<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Strikingly, structural alignment of CerS6 and ELOVL7 places the histidine pairs in equivalent positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>), suggesting that these residues may play similar roles in the first step of their respective reactions.</p><p id="P21">Formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate proceeds via an oxyanion transition state, which is usually stabilized by hydrogen bonding. Within the acyl-CerS6 structure, the carbonyl oxygen of the covalently attached C16:0 chain is within hydrogen-bonding distance (2.8 Å) of the Nδ of Asn315 (TM7). Based on the proximity of these moieties, we hypothesized that this interaction could stabilize the formation of the oxyanion transition state during catalysis. Consistent with this notion, an Asn is present at the equivalent position in CerS1, and CerS2-5, Lag1p and Lac1p have a His at this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>) which may likewise act as a hydrogen-bond donor. Indeed, we found that an Asn315His mutant preserves activity. Surprisingly, however, mutation of Asn315 to either an Ala or an Asp did not result in loss of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). It is unclear if the hydrogen bond in the wild-type structure is not required for function, or if these mutations allow a water molecule to enter the reaction site and act as a substitute hydrogen bond acceptor. Asn315 is involved in a hydrogen-bonding network involving the conserved Arg275 (L6a-b) and Asp242 (TM5b). We found that an Arg275Lys mutant retained only approximately 20 % of wild-type activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>), suggesting that the interactions established by the guanidino group of Arg275 to align neighbouring residues in the active site are important for function.</p><p id="P22">There is a third histidine on TM5a which is conserved in mammalian CerS but is a methionine in yeast Lag1p and Lac1p, and is therefore of ambiguous importance to the enzymes’ reaction cycle. In the CerS6 structure this residue, His238, is located above the acyl-imidazole carbonyl and lays against the hydrocarbon chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). We found that mutation of this His238 to alanine reduced activity by over 50 % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>), and therefore suggest this residue may participate in aligning the acyl chain.</p><p id="P23">Finally, we noticed the presence of a side pocket in the active site of CerS6, adjacent to His211 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>) and lined by Tyr142 (TM2), Tyr189 (TM3), His212 (TM4), Asp239 (L5a-b), Asp242 (TM5b) and Arg275 (L6a-b). The position and chemistry of this pocket relative to the carbonyl of the acyl-enzyme intermediate suggests this is likely to be the site where the amino alcohol moiety of the second (long-chain base) substrate binds. Supporting this notion, the residues of this pocket are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). This pocket therefore likely ensures the primary amine of the long-chain base is ideally located for a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the acyl-imidazole intermediate in the second step of the reaction.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Structure of N-acyl fumonisin B<sub>1</sub>-bound CerS6</title><p id="P24">Having captured the intermediate state of the CerS6 enzyme, we next set out to examine the structural basis of CerS inhibition by FB<sub>1</sub>.

These results indicate FB<sub>1</sub> has reacted with the covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate, releasing His211 and generating the N-acyl FB<sub>1</sub> product. This product remains bound to the enzyme, thus acting as an inhibitor. This finding is consistent with earlier reports that CerS enzymes can N-acylate FB<sub>1</sub> in cultured cells and in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">The N-acyl FB<sub>1</sub> species spans the entire length of the central cavity, with the acyl chain remaining bound in the narrow tunnel at the occluded ER end of the cavity, and the FB<sub>1</sub> portion sitting in the wider cytoplasmic entrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b-c</xref>). The newly formed amide bond sits in the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>), with the carbonyl oxygen forming a hydrogen bond to Tyr189 (TM3), and the amide NH hydrogen bonding to the Nε of His211 (TM4). The 3-hydroxyl group of FB<sub>1</sub>, which is also present in sphingoid base substrates, forms a hydrogen bond with the strictly conserved and catalytically essential Asp242 (TM5b)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Such an interaction with the 3-hydroxyl group of sphingoid base substrates would optimally place the sphingoid primary amine to attack the carbonyl carbon. However, further work is required to investigate this hypothesis.</p><p id="P27">Below the active site, the cytoplasmic vestibule of the central cavity has both polar and non-polar surfaces, where we noted that the hydrocarbon chain of FB<sub>1</sub> interacts with the long hydrophobic face formed by TM5-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b,d</xref>). This hydrocarbon chain lies against the conserved Trp318 of TM7 just beneath the active site. Mutation of the corresponding residue in CerS5 to an alanine has been previously shown to abolish enzymatic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In contrast, introducing a phenylalanine at this position by a W318F mutation in CerS6 retained approximately wild-type levels of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). From these results, we hypothesize the conserved Trp orients the sphingoid base substrate to place its amino alcohol moiety in the side pocket within the active site for the second step of the reaction.</p><p id="P28">The face of the central cavity opposite the FB<sub>1</sub> hydrocarbon binding surface displays a polar character, and is lined by conserved charged residues that may participate in CoA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b,d</xref>). Accordingly, the positive charges provided by Lys125 and Arg131, located at the cytoplasmic entrance to the cavity, adjacent to the Hox-like domain, have been previously demonstrated to be important for the function of CerS5 and CerS6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, mutation of Lys131 in CerS3, equivalent to CerS6’s Arg131, to alanine has been implicated in autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, a disorder of epidermal keratinization which can be caused by loss of ≥ C26 ceramides due to mutations in <italic>CERS3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">The two tricarballylic acid (TCA) groups of FB<sub>1</sub> span the width of the cytoplasmic end of the central cavity, where one of the groups interacts with Arg131 (TM2) and the other with Lys328 (TM7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Thus, through these charge-charge interactions, FB<sub>1</sub>links the first helix of the first 3-TM bundle and the last helix of the second. Supporting the notion that FB<sub>1</sub>acts to restrain the structure, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of covalent intermediate and N-acyl FB1-bound CerS6 monomers indicate that a bound N-palmitoyl FB<sub>1</sub>reduces the overall flexibility of the protein, including TM6, TM7, and the Hox-like domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 9a-c</xref>). Moreover, while Lys125 is not resolved in the cryo-EM maps, in our simulations Lys125 forms a salt bridge with the same TCA group that contacts Arg131 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 9d</xref>). Further, the simulations show that this TCA also contacts Lys249 (TM5b), Tyr253 (TM5b), as well as Arg118 and Arg121 of the last helix of the Hox-like domain. Therefore, FB<sub>1</sub>appears to mimic a number of CoA interactions through the binding of one of its TCA moieties at the polar face of the cytoplasmic cavity. Finally, on the opposite side of the cavity, the other TCA moiety can form salt bridges with Lys328 or Arg332 (TM7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 9d</xref>). Overall, our cryo-EM structure and simulations reveal that FB<sub>1</sub>is anchored by polar interactions at opposite sides of the 6TM barrel, which likely hinder product release, arresting the enzyme in an inhibitory product-bound state.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Bound lipid</title><p id="P30">In examining our CerS6 cryo-EM maps, we noted both conditions clearly contain an ordered non-protein density near the dimer interface, adjacent to the LH-TM1 loop and TM4 and likely corresponding to a bound lipid.

Yet, our limited understanding of their structures and biochemical mechanism has hindered their therapeutic targeting. Here, we provide structural snapshots of CerS6 at two stages of its reaction cycle, revealing its ping-pong (double-displacement) reaction mechanism which uses a histidine nucleophile that attacks the acyl-CoA thioester to form a stable acyl-imidazole intermediate. This intermediate subsequently reacts with the sphingoid long-chain base substrate to yield the final ceramide or dihydroceramide reaction product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Although CoA and the hydrocarbon chain of long-chain bases likely interact at distinct faces of the cytoplasmic vestibule, there is not enough space for the acyl-CoA and long-chain base substrates to bind at the same time. Therefore, upon thioester cleavage and covalent intermediate formation, the CoA product needs to exit the central cavity before the long-chain base substrate can bind. We hypothesize that the amino alcohol group of the long-chain base would bind in a discrete side pocket lined by polar residues conserved across the entire CerS family. This long-chain base is further oriented for the second step of the reaction by hydrophobic residues located at the entrance to this pocket, particularly by the conserved Trp318 (TM7). The primary amine of the long-chain base then attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate to form the final reaction product. Release of this product into the membrane likely occurs between two transmembrane helices, and the two halves of the 6TM barrel immediately suggest an egress route between TM4 and TM7. Indeed, we found that the TCA groups of N-palmitoyl FB<sub>1</sub> attach to both halves of the barrel and restrict the movement of TM7, suggesting these interactions likely prevent that product’s release. Indeed, this proposed role for the TCA groups of FB<sub>1</sub> is consistent with previous reports that the hydrolysed form of FB<sub>1</sub>, lacking the TCA moieties, is a weaker CerS inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. However, FB<sub>1</sub> is competitive towards both substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. This suggests FB<sub>1</sub>’s mode of inhibition of CerS is likely to be multifaceted, sterically blocking substrate binding to the apo state, and locking the protein in a product bound state as shown here.</p><p id="P33">Recently, Zelnik et al. postulated that CerS2, and ceramide synthases more generally, use a ternary complex reaction mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In this model, the substrates bind orthogonally, and the long-chain base would access the active site through a side entrance located near the membrane mid-point, where it would bind parallel to the membrane plane. This proposed substrate-binding arrangement is similar to that of small-molecule membrane-bound O-acyltransferases (MBOATs) and led to the suggestion that CerS may catalyze the direct transfer of the acyl chain from acyl-CoA to the long-chain base in a single step involving the two active site histidines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In addition, while this manuscript was under review, the cryo-EM structure of yeast Lac1p bound to an acyl-CoA was reported. That structure revealed a small lateral opening in Lac1p adjacent to the active site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. This observation led the authors to hypothesize that it could potentially correspond to the entry route for sphingoid base substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. However, this lateral opening is not present in our cryo-EM structures of CerS6 or in our molecular dynamics simulations. Instead, our experimental structures and biochemical studies of CerS6 present several pieces of evidence which support a ping-pong type mechanism, and challenge a ternary complex reaction. First, CerS possess a completely different fold to that of the MBOATs. Indeed, CerS6’s structure is strikingly similar to the fatty acid elongase ELOVL7, forming a 6-TM barrel that encloses a narrow tunnel with an essential and structurally superimposable active site histidine pair, which we have also recently shown to catalyze acyl chain transfer via a ping-pong reaction mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Further, purification of a stable acyl-CerS6 adduct species is incompatible with a ternary complex reaction mechanism. Rather, by incubating acyl-CerS6 with sphinganine, FB<sub>1</sub>or FTY720, we show that this species is a <italic>bona fide</italic> reaction intermediate which results in the expected product upon exposure to the second substrate. Additionally, we captured the product-bound state in the N-acyl FB1-bound structure, where the toxin’s hydrocarbon chain binds perpendicularly to the membrane plane and interacts with the hydrophobic face of the central cavity formed by TM5-7. This binding mode in the N-acyl FB1-bound structure conflicts with a MBOAT-style substrate coordination, but is still consistent with the action of CerS on the fluorescently labelled NBD-sphinganine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> as the bulky NBD moiety would sit near the wide cytoplasmic entrance of the central cavity. Crucially, FB<sub>1</sub>is a structural analog of sphinganine which undergoes N-acylation similarly to sphingoid base substrates, and its mode of inhibition is competitive towards sphinganine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, implying that FB<sub>1</sub>and sphinganine likely bind to CerS in a similar manner. In aggregate, our data do not support a ternary complex reaction mechanism. Rather, an ELOVL-type ping-pong model is consistent with both our newly determined structures and biochemical results, and previously reported CerS mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">Our observation that CerS6 can transfer a C16:0 acyl chain to the primary amine of FTY720 has important consequences for using compounds that mimic sphingoid bases in a clinical setting.
