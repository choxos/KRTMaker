However, germline maintenance in itself can be costly, and the costs can vary between the sexes depending on the number of gametes produced across the lifetime. We tested this directly by germline ablation using glp-1 RNAi in a dioecious nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis remanei</italic>. Germline removal strongly increased heat-shock resistance in both sexes, thus confirming the role of the germline in regulating somatic maintenance. However, germline removal resulted in increased lifespan only in males. High costs of mating strongly reduced lifespan in both sexes and obliterated the survival benefit of germline-less males even though neither sex produced any offspring. Furthermore, germline removal reduced male growth before maturation but not in adulthood, while female growth rate was reduced both before and especially after maturation. Thus, germline removal improves male lifespan without major growth costs, while germline-less females grow slower and do not live longer than reproductively functional counterparts in the absence of environmental stress. Overall, these results suggest that germline maintenance is costlier for males than for females.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Germline</kwd><kwd>glp-</kwd><kwd>Heat-shock</kwd><kwd>Lifespan</kwd><kwd>Sex-specific</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Ageing is the physiological deterioration of organismal function and increases the likelihood of death with age, thus limiting lifespan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Since the strength of selection is reduced with advancing age <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, evolutionary theory of ageing postulates that ageing evolves as a result of selection for genes with beneficial effects early in life, despite late-life costs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and accumulation of mutations with late-life effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Since all cells are subject to wear and tear, long lifespan requires effective repair mechanisms, to perform somatic maintenance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. High levels of maintenance can be costly, and evolution of long life is generally associated with trade-offs such as reduced reproduction, slow early life development and/or growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Perhaps the most well-known trade-off is that between reproduction and lifespan – the so-called ‘cost of reproduction’ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Traditionally, the major cost of reproduction in species without parental care has been seen as the direct cost of producing gametes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, gamete production is not the only costly expenditure associated with the germline. While the soma is disposable, the germline stem cells are essentially immortal and germline is maintained across generations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. This immortality should come with a cost of germline maintenance and repair <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Indeed, several studies suggest that germline maintenance is costly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. For example, in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, there is a trade-off between somatic and germline maintenance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and low-condition (low quality) <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> flies have more germline mutations, potentially because low-condition individuals invest less in high-fidelity repair <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Moreover, not only the germline genome but also its proteome seems to be protected to a higher degree than the somatic proteome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">In theory, if the germline is experimentally removed, resources freed up from germline maintenance, could be used for increased somatic maintenance, and as a result, increased lifespan. In line with this hypothesis, germline removal in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> or <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> hermaphrodites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> is associated with increased lifespan. However, while early studies suggested that lifespan-extending effect of germline removal is evolutionarily conserved, germline ablation is not universally associated with lifespan extension across taxa, and instead can lead to increased growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Similarly, germline removal resulted in increased somatic repair under stress in male zebrafish leading to enhanced re-growth of lost fin tissue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The cost of germline maintenance is however likely to differ between males and females <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The two sexes are often defined by the relative size of their gametes; while females produce fewer and larger gametes, male gametes are small and plentiful. This anisogamy results in different selection pressures for the two sexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and this sex-specific selection often results in differences in lifespan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, the sexes may also differ in the amount of germline maintenance required across life course. Since males produce more gametes than females, they also need to maintain and repair a larger number of germline stem cells throughout their life. Since maintenance of the germline and repair of mutations seems to be expensive <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, males are likely to pay a larger maintenance cost than females. As a consequence, removal of the germline is expected to extend the lifespan of males more than that of females <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">It is important to note that resource allocation is not the only and not necessarily even the main cause of life-history trade-offs. Reproduction and survival are shaped by cellular signalling networks. For example, the reproduction-lifespan trade-off is greatly influenced by the insulin/IGF-1(IIS) and mTOR signalling pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Genetic manipulations of these pathways have revealed that traits normally in trade-offs can be experimentally uncoupled <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Additionally, germline-soma signalling determines the effect of germline removal on lifespan. In particular, the somatic gonad (the non-germline component of the gonad) signalling is key for lifespan-extending effects of germline removal. If the whole gonad (both somatic gonad and germline) is ablated in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, lifespan is unaffected. Only when ablating the germline precursor cells, leaving the somatic gonad intact, is lifespan extended <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. According to one model, the functioning germline blocks the somatic signal, which enables reproduction at the cost of reduced somatic maintenance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Following this logic, the lack of a germline mimics a non-proliferating germline, which enables the soma to carry out maintenance, resulting in extended lifespan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. While this suggests that germline-soma signalling is key for lifespan extension, these experiments do not directly discount the potential for resource allocation trade-offs. It is possible that the presence of functional germline syphons resources into germline maintenance, away from somatic maintenance, as suggested by the ‘expensive germline’ hypothesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">We set out to test the sex-specific effects of germline removal on stress resistance, development time, growth, body size and survival in the dioecious nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis remanei</italic>, a sister species to the well-known model organism <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. Germline-less worms were produced using <italic>glp-1</italic> RNAi. GLP-1 is a receptor in the LIN-12/Notch family which mediates the mitosis/meiosis decision in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> germline, and is therefore vital for germ line proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. GLP-1 is conserved across <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes, including <italic>C</italic>. <italic>remanei</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.

We found that germline removal increases stress resistance in both sexes, but the effects on growth and lifespan were highly sex-specific, suggesting that the germline regulates investment in life-history traits differently in males and females.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="S3"><title>Worm maintenance</title><p id="P8">We used the wild-type SP8 strain of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>remanei</italic>, obtained from N.

For example, in a virus, there is a trade-off between replication fidelity and population growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> high replication fidelity that evolved in a high UV treatment was partly lost under relaxed selection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Moreover, a recent study showed that male zebrafish exposed to radiation increase the repair of their germline at the cost of somatic repair. In contrast, males without a germline instead upregulate their somatic repair, providing compelling evidence for trade-off between somatic maintenance and germline maintenance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. However, little is known about sex-specific effects of germline removal. While females invest relatively more in each gamete, males instead produce a large number of relatively small gametes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Consequently, males need to maintain a larger number of germline stem cells than females do. If maintenance of the germline is costly, males are expected to pay a higher cost of germline maintenance.

The increased proteasome activity in <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants is mediated by DAF-16/FOXO and results in upregulation of <italic>rpn-6.1</italic> (an essential subunit for the 26S/30S proteasome). However, while upregulated <italic>rpn-6.1</italic> activity increases heat stress resistance, it only increases lifespan under stressful conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Thus, lifespan and heat-shock resistance should be seen as related but distinct measures of somatic maintenance, and since germline-less <italic>C</italic>. <italic>remanei</italic> males increase both lifespan and heat-shock resistance, this suggests that germline maintenance may be more costly in males than in females.</p><p id="P27">Furthermore, germline removal reduced male growth before maturation but not in adulthood, while female growth rate was reduced both before and especially after maturation, where most growth occurs in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>remanei</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Thus, germline removal improves male survival without any major growth costs, while germline-less females grow slower and do not live longer than reproductively functional counterparts in the absence of environmental stress. Body size is an important fitness-related trait in female nematodes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> and a reduction in food amount <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> or quality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> results in a reduction in body size. Since life-history traits such as lifespan and growth are often found to be negatively correlated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, one could predict that females, instead of investing the freed up resources from germline removal in lifespan extension, would use if for increased growth. However, we find the opposite. Female <italic>C</italic>. <italic>remanei</italic> neither increase lifespan nor growth when the germline is removed, with the only benefit to somatic maintenance the females enjoy is increased heat-shock resistance. This could be either because fewer resources are being freed up by germline removal in females than in males, or because germline blocks the pro-longevity signalling only in males. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and germline could potentially block pro-longevity signalling in males precisely because germline maintenance is costlier in males, who need to maintain functioning proliferative germline for longer in this species.</p><p id="P28">Interestingly, ablating the germline causes gigantism in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. This process is, unlike lifespan extension, independent of <italic>daf-16</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The gigantism is, however, not caused by increased growth rate but by continued growth after day 4 of adulthood, when <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> hermaphrodites normally cease growth. We did not find that germline-less <italic>C</italic>. <italic>remanei</italic> were larger at day 4 of adulthood, they were instead smaller and therefore showing reduced growth rate. Although we did not measure size in late life, it is possible that they, like germline-less <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> hermaphrodites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, may not cease to grow after day 4.</p><sec id="S11"><title>Resource allocation or signalling trade-offs?</title><p id="P29">The expensive germline hypothesis postulates that the absence of a germline would free up resources from germline maintenance that could instead be used for somatic maintenance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Specifically, this hypothesis predicts that germline removal should extend lifespan in non-reproducing organisms and costs should be more pronounced in males who need to maintain larger number of germline stem cells across life course <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Our results provide at least partial support as germline removal increased heat-shock survival in both sexes compared to virgin controls, but increased lifespan only in males.</p><p id="P30">However, we also documented increased development time to maturity, reduced growth rate and smaller adult body size in females suggesting the germline removal has strong sex-specific effects on the whole organism life-history. This poses the question if the sex-specific lifespan extension following germline removal is a consequence of more resources being freed up for somatic maintenance in germline-less males, or a result of sex-specific regulation of lifespan by the germline signalling? It is likely that resistance to heat-shock is beneficial to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>remanei</italic> in their natural environment, and germline-mediated reduction in resistance could reduce fitness of an adult organism. However, it has been shown in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> that resistance to heat-shock is downregulated in adult organisms following maturation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. While this could be a result of resource allocation trade-off, it can also result from insufficient selection on late-life performance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, especially because downregulation of heat-shock resistance occurs in <italic>ad libitum</italic> food and in a benign environment. Ultimately, future studies should aim to directly test for increased use of resources by somatic tissues following germline removal in both sexes.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Cost of mating</title><p id="P31">Notably, the survival benefit of germline-less males was only present if the worms were virgin. If mated, germline removal did not extend lifespan in any sex, even though neither sex produced any offspring. This suggests that high costs of mating strongly reduce lifespan in both sexes. In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, mating reduces lifespan in germline-less (<italic>glp-1</italic>) hermaphrodites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> and even the presence of males reduces lifespan of hermaphrodites through secreted compounds <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Our findings that the effect of germline removal on lifespan was only detectable in virgin worms mirror a previous finding on the effect of rapamycin in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>remanei</italic>, where its effect on lifespan was stronger in virgin than in mated worms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Summary</title><p id="P32">In summary, we found that germline removal increased heat-shock resistance of both sexes, but lifespan only in males. Moreover, females paid a cost of substantially reduced adult size, while male adult size was not affected. Together, these results suggest that germline differentially regulates male and female life-histories. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that germline maintenance is more costly for males than females, and this may be a substantial, but understudied, cost of reproduction in males <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS192644-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d209aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S14"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Dr. A.
