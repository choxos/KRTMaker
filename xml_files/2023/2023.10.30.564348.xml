inflammatory conditions; however, currently no NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors have been approved for therapeutic use in the clinic. Here we have identified that the natural product brazilin effectively inhibits both priming and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in cultured murine macrophages, a human iPSC microglial cell line and in a mouse model of acute peritoneal inflammation. Through computational modelling, we predict that brazilin can adopt a favourable binding pose within a site of the NLRP3 protein which is essential for its conformational activation. Our results not only encourage further evaluation of brazilin as a therapeutic agent for NLRP3-related inflammatory diseases, but also introduce this small-molecule as a promising scaffold structure for the development of derivative NLRP3 inhibitor compounds.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>S-Brazilin</kwd><kwd>NLRP3</kwd><kwd>Inflammasome</kwd><kwd>NRF2</kwd><kwd>iPSC</kwd><kwd>BMDM</kwd><kwd>Docking</kwd><kwd>MD simulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Inflammasomes are cytosolic, multimeric protein complexes which assemble within cells in response to danger signals evoked by tissue injury and/or infection. Inflammasomes serve a dual purpose of facilitating the maturation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 and initiating a lytic form of cell death known as pyroptosis. Several inflammasomes have been identified, each named after a unique pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) protein which recognises pathological stimuli and initiates inflammasome assembly. Such PRRs include absent-in-melanoma 2 (AIM2), pyrin and members of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD), leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing protein family (‘NLR’); NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP6 and NLRC4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The NLRP3 inflammasome is the most widely characterised of all inflammasomes and has been the focus of our current research.</p><p id="P3">Canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation is governed by a dual signalling mechanism. The first ‘priming’ signal involves extracellular toll-like receptor (TLR) or cytokine receptor activation, which initiates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent transcription of the NLRP3 protein and several pro-inflammatory cytokines including pro-IL-1β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. A second ‘activation’ stimulus is then required to trigger inflammasome assembly. A range of damage- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs/PAMPs, respectively) have been found to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, including crystalline/particulate substances (e.g. uric acid crystals or silica), extracellular ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] and signals associated with viral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], fungal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] and bacterial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] infection. These activating stimuli evoke various cellular stress responses, including K<sup>+</sup> efflux, calcium influx, reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial DNA release, lysosomal destabilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] and a disruption of endosomal trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], which ultimately trigger the oligomerisation of NLRP3 proteins. This provides a platform for the polymerisation of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), creating filament amalgamations known as ASC specks, which are considered a hallmark of inflammasome activation. Inflammasome assembly is complete with the recruitment of pro-caspase-1 enzymes, which undergo proximity-induced autocatalytic activation to form mature caspase-1 proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Caspase-1 then catalyses the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18 cytokines and the cleavage of gasdermin-D (GSDMD) proteins. GSDMD N-terminal fragments insert into the cell membrane and create pores, facilitating the extracellular release of mature cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Finally, an oligomerisation of ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) cell-surface proteins is necessary to drive plasma membrane rupture and death of the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Appropriate inflammasome activation and production of pro-inflammatory IL-1β is an essential part of a protective host immune response, however, dysregulation of such a response can potentiate or even initiate disease pathologies. Aberrant and/or excessive NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been implicated in several conditions, including diabetes, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a promising therapeutic strategy to attenuate inflammation-associated pathogenesis of such life altering and often under-treated conditions. MCC950, otherwise known as CRID3 or CP-456,773, is one of the first known and well-studied small-molecule inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. MCC950 potently and specifically inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome formation by binding to a site within the NLRP3 NACHT domain. This binding stabilises NLRP3 and prevents essential conformational changes required for NLRP3 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. However, concerns surrounding liver toxicity have prevented any clinical application of MCC950 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. As such, the development of new, safe NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors remains an active and evolving area for drug discovery. There is now a growing library of NLRP3 inhibitor compounds which differ in their mechanisms of action and potential clinical applicability, with some currently in or having completed early-phase clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Bioactive compounds from plants present an important avenue for drug discovery, with such natural products potentially carrying a lower risk of severe adverse effects and lower developmental costs relative to synthetic compounds. Brazilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) is a small-molecule isoflavonoid (MW 286.28) which occurs naturally as the (S) stereoisomer (reference to brazilin here refers to this isomer). This compound yields a red coloured brazilein product upon oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Brazilin is highly abundant in the heartwood of several tree species, including brazilwood (<italic>Caesalpinia echinate</italic>), sappan (<italic>Caesalpinia sappan</italic>) and Mexican logwood (<italic>Hematoxilum brasiletto</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Heartwood extracts from these trees have been widely used as colorants in foods, fabrics and cosmetics and have long been used as traditional remedies for a range of conditions, including dermatological problems, diabetes, fever and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Preclinical research has described several pharmacological activities of brazilin, including an ability to attenuate the aggregation and cytotoxicity of amyloid beta protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], limit cancer cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] and reduce inflammation. Brazilin has been shown to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by cultured macrophages in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>] and to exert an anti-inflammatory effect in rodent models of renal injury, significantly decreasing Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) α and IL-1β expression in the tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the specific effect of brazilin on inflammasome responses has not yet been investigated.</p><p id="P6">Here we report that brazilin is an inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Molecular modelling and simulation proposes that brazilin can adopt a favourable pose in the inhibitor binding site of the NLRP3 NACHT domain; the same site to which the selective NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 binds to hold NLRP3 in an inactive conformational state. We show that brazilin can significantly inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome response in primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human microglia. We also report that brazilin treatment can significantly attenuate the NLRP3 inflammasome response <italic>in vivo</italic>, using a mouse model of acute peritoneal inflammation, highlighting the potential effectiveness of using brazilin for the development of new therapeutics targeting NLRP3-dependent disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Molecular modelling and simulation</title><p id="P7">A complete NACHT domain structure of NLRP3 was prepared for computational docking from its X-ray structure (PDB code 7ALV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] using SWISS-MODEL server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://swissmodel.expasy.org">https://swissmodel.expasy.org</ext-link>).

The best 50 poses for each compound were visualized using Vida 4.4.0 and MOE 2022.02 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. This docking protocol was previously validated and reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] by redocking of ADP in the cofactor binding site and NP3-146 (an analogue of MCC950) in the inhibitor site which reproduced the crystal structure pose well in both cases.</p><p id="P8">Nevertheless, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] and experimentally determined structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] of NLRP3 point to the flexibility of the protein. Consequently, we refined our docked poses using MD simulation, following an approach recently applied by us in the analysis of tubulin inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Therefore, MD simulations of NLRP3-ligand complexes were performed for selected docked poses. These calculations employed the AMBER 19 package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>].

The systems were solvated in an octahedral <italic>TIP3P</italic> water box [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] that extends at least 10 Å from the protein-ligand surface. The system was neutralized by addition of 2-5 chloride counterions to the solvated system. This led to ~15,664 water molecules for each simulation system.

The new topology file was designed to use hydrogen mass repartitioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>] in which the time step of the simulation was 4 fs.

The internal and external dielectric constants were set to 1.0 and 80.0, respectively. The ionic strength was set to 0.15 mM. MM/GBSA calculations were performed using 100 snapshots/compound. The electrostatic contribution to binding free energy ΔG<sub>el</sub> was a sum of electrostatic protein-ligand and solvation components; the non-electrostatic contribution ΔG<sub>nonel</sub> was a sum of protein-ligand van der Waals and non-electrostatic solvation terms.

Although brazilin appeared to inhibit IL-1β release in a dose-dependent manner, this was not the case with ASC speck formation, as brazilin concentrations &gt;30 μM did not cause any further reductions in speck numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Brazilin significantly inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome response to acute inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P42">To investigate whether brazilin treatment could inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome response <italic>in vivo</italic>, mice were treated with a single i.p. dose of LPS, immediately followed by a single i.p. dose of brazilin (50 mg/kg), MCC950 (20 mg/kg) or vehicle (1% DMSO in PBS). After 2 hours, mice were stably anaesthetised and either PBS control or ATP was administered i.p. for 15 minutes under terminal anaesthesia, the latter used to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Peritoneal lavage was then performed and the fluid used for cytokine analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). As expected, vehicle pre-treated mice that received both LPS and ATP had elevated IL-1β levels in the peritoneum, compared to vehicle pre-treated mice that received LPS only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating an activated NLRP3 inflammasome response. However, mice pre-treated with either brazilin or MCC950 had significantly lower levels of peritoneal IL-1β in response to LPS and ATP administration, compared to the vehicle-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). This indicated an inhibition of the inflammasome response by both MCC950 and brazilin <italic>in vivo</italic>. Neither brazilin nor MCC950 significantly altered peritoneal levels of TNFα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>) or IL-6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>) evoked by LPS and ATP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S24" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P43">The NLRP3 inflammasome is a cytosolic protein complex that drives pro-inflammatory cytokine production and is an executioner of lytic cell death. Inflammasome responses can serve as a rapid cellular defence mechanism to limit tissue damage and/or spread of infections, however, when dysregulated can become a facilitator or even instigator of disease progression. Molecular inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome has translational relevance for numerous conditions involving acute or chronic inflammation. However, no NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors have yet been approved for therapeutic use in the clinic, with toxicity concerns prohibiting the progression of some compounds through clinical trials. As such, there remains a crucial need to continue developing new, tolerable inhibitors and there has been growing success in identifying lead compounds amongst natural products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>].</p><p id="P44">Here we have identified that the natural product brazilin can significantly inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome response in cultured mouse macrophages and human iPSC-derived microglia. Our experimental data suggest that brazilin exerts a dual inhibitory effect upon the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome, whereby it can inhibit both the priming and activation steps of the pathway. By pre-treating murine BMDMs with brazilin, the expression of pro-IL-1β, IL-6 and NLRP3 was significantly reduced in response to priming with bacterial LPS. These findings are in line with previous studies that report brazilin to supress the pro-inflammatory response of cultured macrophages to LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. However, our data also indicate that brazilin inhibits LPS-induced expression of the NLRP3 protein.</p><p id="P45">Brazilin has been proposed to limit the cellular production of pro-inflammatory mediators through a general suppression of NF-κB signalling, by reducing NF-κB nuclear translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] and/or the binding of NF-κB to DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. However, we found that brazilin treatment did not reduce the secretion of TNFα from macrophages, indicating that there was not global inhibition of NF-κB signalling in brazilin-treated cells. Elevated NRF2 signalling has previously been reported to underpin cardioprotective effects of brazilin against ischaemia-reperfusion injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>]. NRF2 is a transcription factor which is known to inhibit the expression of NF-κB secondary response genes, including IL-1β and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>], without inhibiting the expression of NF-κB primary response genes such as TNFα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. Additionally, brazilin has been shown to induce the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>] which may also be due to brazilin-mediated NRF2 activation, given that HO-1 is a target gene of NRF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the accumulation of NRF2 in BMDMs following LPS stimulation and indeed found that this was enhanced by brazilin treatment. Therefore, we propose that in the context of inflammation, brazilin may inhibit the expression of specific LPS-induced gene subsets by increasing NRF2 signalling, which consequently contributes to an inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome priming. However, the ability of brazilin to reduce NLRP3 expression after LPS priming may be independent of NRF2 signalling, as the NRF2 inducer DMF does not affect LPS-induced NLRP3 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>].</p><p id="P46">Brazilin can also inhibit NLRP3 activation, via a mechanism that is reversible and independent of its influence on inflammasome priming. Treatment of LPS-primed BMDMs with brazilin was sufficient to inhibit processes downstream of NLRP3 activation, namely the maturation of caspase-1, gasdermin-D and IL-1β proteins, without altering the upstream production of pro-IL-1β. Brazilin also significantly reduced the formation of ASC specks and the release of IL-1β from human iPSC-microglia in response to nigericin. MCC950 and the analogue NP3-146 maintain the NLRP3 protein in an inactive conformational state by binding to a specific site within the NLRP3 NACHT domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Our computational modelling predicts that brazilin may also directly interact with this inhibitor binding site. Furthermore, our biological assays showed that brazilin was able to inhibit NLRP3 activation evoked by diverse signalling pathways, dependent or independent of potassium ion efflux, and brazilin had no inhibitory effect upon the activation of the AIM2 or NLRC4 inflammasome. Collectively, these findings support our hypothesis that brazilin may interact directly and selectively with the NLRP3 sensor protein to inhibit inflammasome activation. Through direct binding, brazilin may mediate degradation of the NLRP3 protein, which may explain the inhibition of LPS-induced NLRP3 expression and/or may contribute to the slight reduction in NLRP3 levels and inhibition of the inflammasome activation step that we report. However, further experiments are needed to address these hypotheses.</p><p id="P47">Brazilin has a lower potency to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in BMDMs (IC<sub>50</sub> 1.98 μM) compared to MCC950 (IC<sub>50</sub> 7.5 nM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], which may be partially due to an oxidation of brazilin to form the red-pigmented brazilein product, which our computational modelling predicts to have a much lower binding affinity for NLRP3 than brazilin. The brazilin molecule could serve as a scaffold for the development of novel structural analogues with improved stability and potency to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome. Nevertheless, we have also shown that brazilin treatment can significantly attenuate peritoneal IL-1β release in response to LPS and ATP administration in mice, confirming that brazilin in its current form is sufficiently stable and active to inhibit an acute NLRP3 inflammasome response <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P48">Brazilin is the most abundant constituent of heartwood from the <italic>Haematoxylum brasiletto</italic> and <italic>Caesalpinia sappan</italic> tree species. While there are no commercially licensed products containing purified brazilin, heartwood extracts from these trees have long been used as colouring agents in foods and beverages and as medicinal remedies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. This would suggest that brazilin is likely safe for human consumption; however, thorough preclinical and clinical toxicology investigations are still required. While safety profiling was not an aim for our experiments, we can report that brazilin was not cytotoxic to cultured BMDMs (≤ 30 μM), which is supported by previous <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Brazilin also had no obvious adverse effects on the appearance, behaviour or survival of the mice in our <italic>in vivo</italic> study, although their exposure to the treatment was short (2 hours) and no formal post-mortem analyses of organs were performed. We found that brazilin may enhance TNFα release from LPS-primed BMDMs, which may be a concern as TNFα is itself known to drive a range of inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>]. However, brazilin treatment did not enhance peritoneal TNFα levels beyond that associated with the inflammation itself in our mouse model. It is also worth noting that brazilin had no inhibitory effects on the AIM2 inflammasome response to DNA or the NLRC4 inflammasome response to bacterial flagellin in cultured BMDMs, which may be an important attribute when considering such a compound as a potential immunomodulatory therapeutic. However, further experiments are required to confirm this <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P49">In conclusion, we have identified that the natural product brazilin can exert a dual inhibitory effect over both the priming and activation steps of the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Our results indicate that brazilin can enhance NRF2 signalling, which may contribute to the inhibition of inflammasome priming, while our computational modelling suggests that brazilin may also bind directly to the NLRP3 protein to inhibit inflammasome activation. We have confirmed that brazilin can significantly inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome response in cultured murine macrophages, human microglial cells, and in a mouse model of acute inflammation. Our results encourage further evaluation of brazilin as a promising therapeutic agent for NLRP3-related inflammatory diseases. Moreover, this small-molecule may serve as a scaffold for the development of new selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS190472-supplement-Supplemental_Materials.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d91aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Video S1</label><caption><p id="P50"><bold>Video S1 MD trajectories over 40ns MD simulation of S-brazilin-NACHT</bold>, related to Figure 1.

position="float"><caption><title>Significance</title></caption><p>Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a promising therapeutic strategy for targeting inflammation-associated pathology in a variety of human conditions. With no NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors currently approved for clinical therapeutic use, there remains a great need to identify and develop new inhibitor compounds which have a low risk of adverse effects. In this manuscript, we provide compelling new evidence from <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse experiments that the natural product brazilin is an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor. Brazilin is the major constituent of heartwood from several tree species and may have a favourable safety profile. Extracts from this heartwood have long been used as traditional medicines and we found no indications of brazilin-associated toxicity in our experiments, which is supported by previous publications. Importantly, we also show that brazilin can attenuate the NLRP3 inflammasome response in a human iPSC-microglial cell line, which implicates the translational relevance of our discoveries. We also describe the generation and utilisation of this human iPSC-microglial cell line to perform inflammasome assays in this manuscript, which we believe provides a powerful tool for the field of neuroimmunology research. Despite having a very different molecular structure to MCC950, our computational modelling predicts that brazilin may inhibit NLRP3 activation by binding to the same site of the protein. Therefore, this natural compound may offer a new scaffold for the design of derivative compounds with improved potency to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome whilst evading cellular toxicity.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Predicted NLRP3 binding mode of brazilin from docking and simulation.</title><p>2D and 3D structures of (A) (S)-brazilin in which the grey highlighted OH group represents the hydroxyl group that oxidizes to give (B) (S)-brazilein.
