Through vaccination, natural virus evolution, surveillance, and better treatment protocols, the pandemic has dramatically declined, but there are still hundreds of thousands of reported infections each week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Despite noted successes, drug therapies and available vaccines have only served to mitigate COVID-19. This, coupled with the uncertain evolution of the virus, necessitates a continued search for new and improved therapeutics and vaccines that may be applied to SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses that may arise in the future.</p><p id="P6">A novel approach being pursued by several groups is the development of aptamers that can be employed as therapeutics or in diagnostics. Aptamers are short nucleic acid-based sequences that bind targets with high affinity and are typically produced using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Aptamers have the potential to block virus entry into cells or detect specific viruses in diagnostic assays (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]). Several groups have produced DNA aptamers that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (a subunit of the viral spike protein found on the outer surface of the virus envelope) and block the interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1 and the host cell ACE2 receptor [6–16; Reviewed in: 17,18]. Blocking this interaction prevents virus entry into cells, similar to how current neutralizing antibody therapies block SARS-CoV-2 infection (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]). We previously reported the analysis of aptamer FANA-R8-9, which was made from 2’-fluoro-arabino nucleic acid (FANA) and was able to block the interaction between the viral RBD and ACE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. FANA is a xeno-nucleic acid (XNA), where XNAs are synthetic nucleic acids with altered sugar, base, or phosphate backbones. These alternatives to DNA and RNA aptamers often have advantageous properties as they may accommodate unique structures, have low immunogenicity, and have greater resistance to degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].</p><p id="P7">Still, whether FANA-R8-9 can block spike-ACE2 interaction in the context of a viral particle, and whether FANA-R8-9 – or any spike-targeting aptamer, to our knowledge – can function to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in the native respiratory microenvironment remains unknown. Notably, human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures at air-liquid interface have been established and recapitulate both the morphology and physiology of the airway epithelium <italic>in vivo,</italic> including the establishment of a mucus barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].

Here, we report that FANA-R8-9 not only inhibits the uptake of spike-bearing pseudovirus particles, but also blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in the HAE system, demonstrating the potential utility of XNA aptamers to target respiratory viruses in the mucosal microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Generation of aptamers</title><p id="P8">FANA-R8-9 was previously selected for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (Arg319-Phe541; Wuhan strain) through SELEX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].

Centrifugation was done for 2 hrs at 35,000 rpm using a Beckman SW 55 Ti rotor. The supernatant was carefully removed and the pellet, along with a small amount of remaining sucrose solution, was resuspended in 200 μl of PBS. Aliquots were stored at −80°C.

Thus, to further explore the ability of FANA-R8-9 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, we sought to determine whether FANA-R8-9 could block spike protein-mediated uptake of pseudoviral particles into cells. To do so, we utilized luciferase-expressing, VSV-based pseudovirus particles bearing the spike protein from the Wuhan strain. Pseudovirus particles were mixed with FANA-R8-9, or other aptamer controls, prior to inoculation of Vero-E6 cells, and luciferase expression was measured at 24 hrs post-inoculation as a proxy of successful pseudovirus particle entry. Pseudovirus signal decreased with increasing concentrations of FANA-R8-9, with a near complete block of infection at 50 nM (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Various control aptamers also inhibited the pseudovirus signal, with the FANA-IN-1.1 and Fixed FANA aptamers demonstrating higher levels of inhibition than the Fixed DNA aptamer. Since this assay measures the expression of pseudovirus genomic products, both entry and virus replication are required for a signal. Thus, FANA could possibly affect either or both of these steps in the viral life cycle, leading to the inhibition observed with FANA-IN-1.1 and Fixed FANA controls. A direct block of entry is most easily explained by the binding of the aptamer to the pseudovirus spike protein. To test the binding of FANA-R8-9 and control aptamers to the pseudovirus particles, the assay depicted in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> was used. Concentrated pseudovirus particles were mixed and incubated with radiolabeled aptamer along with excess nonspecific DNA (unlabeled) of the same size. Heparin was then added and incubation continued for 40 min before processing the material for binding to nitrocellulose filters, which would retain the labeled aptamer only if bound to protein. The inclusion of nonspecific DNA and incubation with heparin, a binding competitor for nucleic acid, was required to decrease background binding to material in the pseudovirus preparation. Under these conditions, only nucleic acids that bind with high stability to the protein material in the pseudovirus preparation would be measurable. Results showed that FANA-R8-9 bound in a concentration-dependent manner to pseudovirus material while the controls showed weak binding (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). These data suggest that only FANA-R8-9 interacts strongly with spike protein in the context of a viral particle. The inhibition observed with FANA controls is likely the result of a mechanism that does not involve binding to the pseudovirus spike protein.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>FANA-R8-9 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE cultures</title><p id="P21">Given the ability of FANA-R8-9 to bind pseudovirus particles harboring the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and inhibit their entry, we next asked if this aptamer could block SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in a model of human airway epithelium that recapitulates infection in a more physiologically-relevant setting. Normal human tracheobronchial cells from individual donors were differentiated on Transwell® membrane supports at air-liquid interface and mucus secretions were removed prior to inoculation to facilitate infection. Preliminary tests indicated that FANA-R8-9 concentrations less than 100 nM were associated with stochastic SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in HAE (data not shown); thus, 100 nM aptamer was utilized in all subsequent assays. In initial experiments, 100 nM FANA-R8-9, or water as a vehicle control, was mixed with virus prior to inoculation of the apical culture surface (with an approximate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1). Additional aptamer was added to corresponding cultures at 24 and 48 hpi, and the extent of infection across the epithelium was evaluated at 72 hpi following <italic>en face</italic> staining for viral antigen and fluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). To further assess the ability of the aptamer to inhibit more recent variants, we performed these experiments with both the wild-type strain (hCoV-19/USA/NY-PV08410/2020) and Delta variant (hCoV-19/USA/PHC658/2021(B.1.167.2)). Notably, FANA-R8-9 significantly reduced the nucleocapsid-positive area in HAE following infection with either strain, indicating fewer cells were infected in the presence of the aptamer (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, D</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We next sought to assess the ability of FANA-R8-9 to act in a “therapeutic” setting, by adding the aptamer directly to the apical surface of HAE cultures after virus inoculation. We selected the Delta variant for these assays since FANA-R8-9 was able to completely block infection with this virus in our initial experiments (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Delta was added to the apical surface of HAE and FANA-R8-9 was applied either immediately (0), or 2, or 6 hpi, followed by additional aptamer treatments at 24 and 48 hpi. While infection could be detected at 72 hpi in some FANA-R8-9-treated cultures, the viral nucleoprotein-positive area in FANA-R8-9-treated HAE was still significantly reduced compared to HAE without aptamer treatment (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). These data indicate that FANA-R8-9 can interact with SARS-CoV-2 and limit infection within the airway mucosal environment even several hours after viral infection. The treatment window was not indefinite, however, since adding FANA-R8-9 to Delta-inoculated HAE cultures 24 hpi did not significantly impact the infection (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE is specific to FANA-R8-9</title><p id="P23">In our pseudovirus particle inhibition assays (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), we noted that other aptamers could limit pseudovirus particle uptake and / or luciferase expression in Vero-E6 cells, though not to the same extent as FANA-R8-9. To verify the specificity of Delta variant inhibition by FANA-R8-9 in HAE, we assayed FANA fixed, FANA scramble, and DNA fixed aptamers in parallel with FANA-R8-9 in the <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> workflow. Consistent with our previous results (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), FANA-R8-9 completely blocked Delta variant infection (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) when the viral antigen-positive area was assessed at 72 hpi. In contrast, none of the other control aptamers significantly affected SARS-CoV-2 infection indicating that FANA-R8-9-mediated inhibition is specific to the FANA-R8-9 sequence.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>FANA-R8-9 is stable in apical secretions from HAE cultures and does not induce overt toxicity</title><p id="P24">We previously demonstrated that FANA-R8-9 remained intact for several hrs in serum-containing cell culture media, and had a breakdown rate approximately equal to a similar DNA aptamer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. To assess FANA-R8-9 stability in airway mucus, we harvested apical secretions from HAE cultures and monitored FANA-R8-9 decay over 24 hrs in these secretions, or in DMEM culture media supplemented with 10% FBS for comparison (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The latter condition mimics the previous results noted above and demonstrates modest, though clear decay over 24 hrs. In contrast, FANA-R8-9 was more stable in HAE secretions, showing a very slight breakdown only after 24 hrs. The results indicate that FANA-R8-9 retains potency in HAE cultures from several hrs to days.</p><p id="P25">Given the lack of FANA-R8-9 degradation in HAE secretions, we next sought to determine if FANA-R8-9 demonstrated any overt toxicity in HAE cultures using two types of cell toxicity assays, conducted with 100 and 1000 nM aptamer. The latter concentration is 10X greater than the maximum concentration in virus inhibition assays. HAE cultures were first treated with aptamer using the same timing and conditions employed in infection assays. This was followed by toxicity assays that use lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release as a proxy for cell death and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) as a measure of epithelial barrier integrity. Notably, both LDH release (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) and TEER (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) assays demonstrated no significant toxicity at 100 or 1000 nM aptamer. These results were further supported by a lack of overt cytopathology in histological cross-sections of HAE and are consistent with the low toxicity observed with FANA oligonucleotides in cell culture by others (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, a variety of therapeutics have been utilized to inhibit viral replication and mitigate disease severity including immune modulators, monoclonal antibodies, and antiviral drugs such as remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir with ritonavir. Nonetheless, developing novel strategies to block SARS-CoV-2, as well as other viral infections for which targeted antivirals do not exist, is paramount. Here, we have focused on aptamer technology, which has proven useful in diagnostics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] and demonstrated clinical success with the approval of pegaptinib (Macugen) for treating age-related macular degeneration in 2004. Aptamers specific for viral targets (<italic>e.g.</italic>, polymerases, integrases, helicases) have also been selected, with some demonstraing antiviral activity (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]). However, aptamers do not efficiently enter cells. Therefore, while aptamer uptake into cells can be improved through interaction with cell surface proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] or by coupling to cell-penetrating peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], aptamers that target viral surface proteins are likely more feasible as antivirals.</p><p id="P27">Recently, several aptamers to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been characterized [6–16; Reviewed in: 17,18]. The majority are composed of DNA with the exceptions being a coupled peptide/DNA aptamer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], an RNA/2’-fluoro RNA (F-RNA) mixed aptamer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], and the FANA R8-9 aptamer used in this research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. The XNA composition of the latter two aptamers could confer some advantages over natural nucleic acid aptamers (see Introduction), although this remains to be determined. Notably, our pseudovirus infections in Vero cells indicated that FANA controls (Fixed FANA and FANA-IN-1.1) were more inhibitory than DNA (Fixed DNA), but less inhibitory than FANA-R8-9. However, none of these controls exhibited stable binding to pseudovirus material, or a significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection in our HAE assays. One explanation is that the “weak” binding of FANA to the pseudovirus, that cannot be measured in the assay, is enough to interfere with entry, thus leading to a lower signal. A second possibility is that FANA interferes with replication or transcription of the VSV-derived virus. Remarkably, while studying the ability of HIV genome-targeting FANA antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to block HIV infection, researchers not only observed sequence-specific inhibition of HIV infection, but also a non-specific inhibitory component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, the inhibitory nature of catabolic metabolites of FANA oligonucleotide, including 2’-deoxy-2’-fluoroarabinonucleosides, against some viruses has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Consistent with these previous reports, we have also observed sequence-independent inhibition of HIV by FANA nucleic acids similar in size to FANA-R8-9 and the controls used in the current experiments. Although the cause of the observed non-specific inhibition of pseudovirus infections in Vero cells remains unclear, the potential useful antiviral effects of FANA and other XNAs warrant further analysis.</p><p id="P28">Importantly, beyond potential XNA-mediated effects, SARS-CoV-2 spike aptamers have been shown to block pseudovirus or live virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] infections in cell culture and the respiratory tract of ACE2 transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. However, there is a clear need to examine aptamers in models that more closely mimic human physiology, an approach already being used to test other potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Here, we have extended our previous work and demonstrated FANA-R8-9 is not only capable of blocking spike-bearing pseudovirus particles, but also SARS-CoV-2 infection in a physiologically-relevant model of human airway epithelium. FANA-R8-9 was able to reduce infection when mixed with virus prior to inoculation and several hours after viral infection. To the extent that the HAE model mimics the human airway, this suggests that administering aptamer after infection could prevent virus spread and highlights the potential for using aptamers to treat COVID-19 and other respiratory infections. Notably, we did not observe any cytopathic effects, gross morphological changes, or loss of epithelial barrier integrity after 72 hrs of aptamer treatment. While these data are not surprising since we do not expect FANA-R8-9 to be readily taken up by the epithelial cells in the HAE model, the impacts of FANA or FANA-R8-9 on the mucus barrier and underlying cells remain to be fully characterized.</p><p id="P29">SARS-CoV-2 spike, like other viral glycoproteins, is a primary target of the humoral immune response which can drive glycoprotein sequence evolution over time. As a result, aptamers selected against the glycoprotein (spike) of one virus strain may not inhibit others. Here, FANA-R8-9 was initially selected for binding to the Wuhan virus RBD; however, our data indicate that FANA-R8-9 also effectively inhibits the Delta variant. Indeed, FANA-R8-9 has significantly stronger binding affinity to Delta RBD (23.5 ± 4.6 nM vs. 1.4 ± 0.4 nM, for Wuhan and Delta, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. This enhanced binding may explain why FANA-R8-9 was even more potent against Delta in the HAE assays, although FANA-R8-9 significantly inhibited both strains. Notably, the RBD domains of Wuhan and Delta differ by only 2 amino acids (L452R andT478K) with the changes in Delta resulting in two additional positive charges in the RBD. These additional charges may help enhance the binding of nucleic acid which is strongly negatively charged. In contrast to Delta, Omicron variants typically have a dozen or more amino acid changes in the RBD compared to Wuhan and FANA-R8-9 binds much less strongly to Omicron RBD. We are currently working on producing FANA aptamers to Omicron RBD and S1 domains.</p></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P30">Overall, nucleic acids as therapeutics have been under rapid development with several FDA-approved drugs and more in the pipeline (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]). Most have been small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), ASOs, splice switching RNAs, or mRNAs. To date, siRNA and ASOs directed to respiratory targets have shown some efficacy in animal models. These successes, in conjunction with our current data, promise further development of FANA-R8-9 and other virus-specific aptamers as therapeutics in the near future.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Philipp Holliger (Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK) for the D4K enzyme used to make FANA.
