Genetic or pharmacological PADI4 inhibition is therapeutically efficacious in mice, but no clinically relevant inhibitors currently exist. PADI4 additionally mediates immune responses and cellular reprogramming, although the full extent of its physiological roles is unexplored. Despite detailed molecular knowledge of PADI4 activation <italic>in vitro</italic>, we lack understanding of its regulation within cells, largely due to lack of appropriate systems and tools. Here, we developed and applied a set of potent and selective PADI4 modulators. Using the mRNA-display-based RaPID system, we screened &gt;10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> cyclic peptides for high-affinity, conformation-selective binders. We report PADI4_3, an inhibitor specific for the active conformation of PADI4; PADI4_7, an inert binder, which we functionalised for the isolation and study of cellular PADI4; and PADI4_11, a first-in-class activator. Using a newly developed method for the quantification of cellular PADI4 activity, we show that PADI4_3 and PADI4_11 are effective in cells. Structural studies with PADI4_11 reveal an allosteric binding mode that may reflect the mechanism that promotes cellular PADI4 activation. This work offers new understanding of PADI4 regulation and a toolkit for the study and modulation of PADI4 across physiological and pathophysiological contexts.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The peptidylarginine deiminase (PADI, or PAD) enzymes catalyse the post-translational conversion of protein arginine residues to non-coded citrulline, in a process termed citrullination or deimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In mammals, five PADI isozymes are expressed with varying tissue specificities. PADIs 1-4 target a broad range of substrates, modulating cell and tissue functions including gene expression, chromatin compaction, metabolism, nerve myelination, skin homeostasis, the innate immune response and stem cell function (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P3">Despite their wide range of physiological functions, the mechanisms through which PADIs are regulated within cells are surprisingly poorly understood. It is well-established that PADIs require calcium for catalysis and crystallographic studies have demonstrated that the sequential binding of calcium ions results in a large structural rearrangement that forms the active site cleft <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. However, the calcium concentrations required for full activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (&gt;1 mM), far exceed physiological intracellular concentrations (∼100 nM), even under conditions of calcium influx (up to 10 μM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Whether PADI activation <italic>in vivo</italic> results from localised influx of calcium, or whether allosteric regulation mechanisms render PADIs capable of catalysis at intracellular calcium levels is not known.</p><p id="P4">PADIs are perhaps best known for their role in disease development: aberrant citrullination is associated with a host of pathologies, including autoimmunity (rheumatoid arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, ulcerative colitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, lupus erythematosus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and psoriasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>), neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, age-related tissue fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, the development of cancer of various origins and cancer metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Thus, the last two decades have seen significant efforts to develop PADI inhibitors but, despite significant progress in this area, we still lack compounds of sufficient potency and specificity for clinical use.</p><p id="P5">PADI4 possesses a nuclear localisation signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and targets a variety of nuclear substrates, including core and linker histones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, through which it modulates gene expression and chromatin compaction. More recent evidence suggests that PADI4 also functions in the cytoplasm, can be present on the cell surface and can be extracellular in the context of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. PADI4 activation promotes the innate immune response to infection and pro-inflammatory signalling, and is strongly associated with Neutrophil Extracellular Trap (NET) formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. More recent evidence implicates PADI4 in the regulation of cell reprogramming, where its activation is induced by the introduction of the Yamanaka factors into cells and precedes the establishment of pluripotency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Deregulation of PADI4 is intricately associated with sterile inflammation and the development of autoimmunity. <italic>Padi4</italic> is one of the top susceptibility loci for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and autoantibodies against endogenous citrullinated proteins serve as clinical diagnostic and prognostic RA biomarkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Pharmacological or genetic perturbation of PADI4 in mice alleviates the development of RA and ulcerative colitis, while <italic>Padi4-null</italic> mice are protected against NET-associated tissue destruction in a wide variety of contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Additionally, strong emerging evidence implicates PADI4 and NET-associated citrullinated proteins in cancer metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. There is thus overwhelming evidence for the therapeutic potential of PADI4 inhibition. Consequently, a range of PADI4 inhibitors have been developed in recent years, the majority of which are based around covalent substrate mimics. However, due to high conservation between family members, especially around the active site, it has been difficult to achieve good isozyme selectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. A recently developed non-covalent inhibitor of PADI4, GSK484<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, is significantly more potent and specific than other compounds, but is selective for the calcium-free, inactive form of PADI4. In most disease settings this may not be ideal, given the need to inhibit deregulated, highly active PADI4. An inhibitor against the calcium-bound form would obviate the need to treat cells or tissues pre-emptively, but to date, there is no reversible inhibitor that is potent and selective against the calcium-bound, active form of PADI4.</p><p id="P6">Beyond the obvious need to develop new PADI inhibitors, the development of pharmacological activators is likely to revolutionise our understanding of PADI regulation and function. Currently, pleiotropic stimuli such as calcium ionophores or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are used to stimulate PADI activity in cell-based assays. These stimuli engage a wide range of biological pathways, making it impossible to disentangle the specific mechanistic contributions of PADIs. Specific and selective PADI activators would provide powerful tools for the understanding of PADI-mediated cellular functions and may be used to enhance cellular manipulations such as induced cell reprogramming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Importantly, such compounds may inform our mechanistic understanding of PADI regulation. This may enable rational design of PADI inhibitors that block activation, rather than competing for substrate binding, and which might consequently achieve greater isozyme selectivity by binding to a region of the proteins that is less conserved than the active site. The anti-parasitic and anti-viral compound nitazoxanide (NTZ) and the natural product demethoxycurcumin (DMC) have recently been identified as activators of PADI2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. NTZ increases PADI2-dependent cellular citrullination levels through stabilising PADI2 and thereby increasing total enzyme levels. DMC has been shown to be a direct PADI2 binder, and is proposed to stabilise interactions with PADI2 substrates, although the mechanism of activation is not completely understood. In the case of PADI4, anti-PADI4 autoantibodies found in RA patients have been reported to increase its activity through decreasing its calcium requirement, suggesting it may also be possible to activate PADI4 pharmacologically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. However, no synthetic PADI4 activators exist currently.</p><p id="P7">In recent years, a wide range of chemical modalities have been explored for the modulation of protein targets, including small molecules, peptides and antibodies. Due to their intermediate size and chemical diversity, cyclic peptides are a powerful modality for developing chemical tools with exquisite potency and target selectivity. Such peptides can be identified from enormous libraries of DNA-encoded peptides using approaches such as phage display and mRNA-display. The mRNA-display based RaPID system additionally allows incorporation of non-natural amino acids into the peptide libraries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Recent examples highlight the ability of RaPID-derived cyclic peptides to differentiate between closely related proteins and to induce diverse changes in protein function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Here, we tailored the conditions used in RaPID peptide selections to identify cyclic peptides that selectively bind different conformations of PADI4 and consequently have different biological activities. In order to quantify PADI4 activity in cells, we identified new cellular stimuli that lead to PADI4 activation and developed a high content microscopy-based method for the screening of PADI4 modulators. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> and cell-based assays we identified and optimised both inhibitory and activating peptides, alongside neutral peptide binders. The lead inhibitory peptide, PADI4_3, binds the active form of PADI4 and inhibits activity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells, with higher potency and significantly higher isozyme selectivity than previous compounds. The lead activating peptide, PADI4_11, lowers the calcium requirement for activation <italic>in vitro</italic> and induces activation within cells in the absence of any additional stimuli. Structural and mutagenesis studies reveal that PADI4_11 activates PADI4 through binding to an allosteric site, within a region of PADI4 that rearranges substantially on calcium binding to form the catalytically competent enzyme. Finally, we functionalised PADI4_7, a low-nanomolar but inert PADI4 binder, to generate a biotinylated probe, bio-PADI4_7, able to pull-down PADI4 from cell lysates. Using bio-PADI4_7 we isolated PADI4 from cells under resting or activating conditions and report the proteins associated with PADI4 in these two contexts. This dataset may serve as a primer to understand the co-factors that regulate the activity of cellular PADI4. Overall, this work provides an approach for the screening and optimisation of modulators against cellular PADIs, a comprehensive set of tools for the study of PADI4 and a starting point for the development of new PADI4-targeting therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A strategy for identifying potent and conformation-selective PADI4 binders</title><p id="P9">We set out to identify cyclic peptides that bound to different conformations of PADI4 and might therefore have different effects on its activity. To this end, we performed RaPID selections against recombinant human PADI4 (thereafter labelled PADI4) under three different conditions. To identify peptides that bound preferentially to either the calcium-bound ‘active’ or calcium-free ‘inactive’ form of the enzyme, selections were carried out using buffer containing concentrations of calcium (10 mM) known to achieve full PADI4 activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (Selection 1), or a calcium-free buffer (Selection 2) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). For the final selection we reasoned that mimicking the active, substrate-bound form of PADI4 would select for peptides that stabilised this protein conformation and that might consequently activate PADI4 at lower calcium concentrations. This selection was therefore performed both in the presence of 10 mM CaCl<sup>2</sup> and with the active site occupied by the covalent pan-PADI inhibitor Cl-amidine (200 µM Cl-amidine) (Selection 3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. We used <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of puromycin-ligated mRNA templates to produce libraries of cyclic peptides conjugated to a hybrid of the encoding mRNA/cDNA (&gt;10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> library members). Peptide sequences consisted of a random region of 6-12 amino acids flanked by an <italic>N</italic>-chloroacetyl-D-tyrosine (Selection 1 and 2) or <italic>N</italic>-chloroacetyl-L-tyrosine (Selection 3) initiator and a <italic>C</italic>-terminal cysteine to permit peptide cyclisation. Sheared salmon sperm DNA was included in the selection buffers to reduce high levels of non-specific nucleic acid binding to PADI4 which were observed during initial optimisations. Following incubation of the encoded peptide library with bead-immobilised PADI4, non-binding library members were washed away. Peptide-nucleic acid hybrids bound to the bait were then recovered and amplified by PCR for use as the input library for a repeat round of selection. In total, eight or nine sequential rounds of selection were performed and library DNA recovered from later rounds was sequenced to identify the most enriched sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File 1, Figure S1</xref>). Following sequence deconvolution, twelve of the most enriched peptide sequences were selected for solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and further characterisation (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To validate the enriched sequences, we initially measured their binding affinities to PADI4 using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Affinities were measured both in the presence and absence of calcium (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). We identified two peptides that bound in the low nanomolar range both in the presence and absence of calcium (PADI4_1 and PADI4_7). Four others bound in the low-to-mid nanomolar range to the calcium-bound form of the enzyme but were unable to bind in the absence of calcium (PADI4_2, PADI4_3, PADI4_11 and PADI4_12). Of note, an unusually high proportion of peptides were highly enriched during the RaPID selection but did not appear to bind to PADI4 by SPR (PADI4_5, 6, 8, 9, 10, K<sub>D</sub> &gt; 2 µM). We attribute this to the high background levels of nucleic acid binding, which were only partially reduced in the selections by including sheared salmon sperm DNA in the selection buffer. This may have resulted in retention of peptides that bound primarily through their attached mRNA/DNA hybrid tag. These peptides were removed from subsequent analyses.</p><p id="P11">To further interrogate the mode of binding, we carried out SPR experiments under the conditions used in Selection 3 (10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, PADI4 active site blocked with Cl-amidine). As expected, the two peptides identified from Selection 3 (PADI4_11 and PADI4_12) were unaffected by Cl-amidine occupying the active site (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The peptides that bound to both the calcium-bound and calcium-free form of the enzyme (PADI4_1 and PADI4_7) were also unaffected. By contrast, the two peptides that bound in the low nanomolar range to calcium-bound PADI4 specifically (PADI4_2 and PADI4_3) were unable to bind once the active site was blocked by Cl-amidine. This indicated that PADI4_2 and PADI4_3 likely bind at the active site, whilst the others must bind elsewhere on the enzyme.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>PADI4_3 is a potent and selective cyclic peptide inhibitor of PADI4</title><p id="P12">Having identified several tight-binding cyclic peptides we next asked whether they were able to modulate PADI4 activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. IC<sub>50</sub> values were determined using an established colorimetric activity assay, the Colour Developing Reagent (COLDER) assay, and the model substrate <italic>N</italic><sup>α</sup>-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester (BAEE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Consistent with the binding experiments described above, PADI4_2 and PADI4_3 both inhibited PADI4 activity with IC<sub>50</sub>s of 209 ± 54 nM and 56 ± 7 nM respectively (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). No PADI4 inhibition was observed for the four peptides that were unaffected by blocking of the active site with Cl-amidine (PADI4_1, PADI4_7, PADI4_11 and PADI4_12). Similar inhibition of histone 3 citrullination (H3Cit) was observed with PADI4_2 and PADI4_3 when activity assays were performed in cell lysates containing active cellular PADI4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). In these assays, we also observed that inhibition was achieved without pre-incubating PADI4 with peptide prior to activating the enzyme with calcium, in contrast to the most potent and specific reported PADI4 inhibitor, GSK484, which required pre-incubation to be active<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">Many inhibitors described to date (e.g. Cl-amidine) inhibit PADI family members non-selectively due to the high sequence and structural similarity between PADI isozymes, especially around the active site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Given the propensity of cyclic peptides to exhibit high selectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, we reasoned that our lead peptide, PADI4_3 might be selective for PADI4. To test this, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition assays against the other active members of the PADI family, PADI1-3, and mouse PADI4. No inhibition was observed with up to 100 µM peptide against any other PADIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C, D</xref>). This suggests PADI4_3 is more than 1700-fold selective for human PADI4 over other family members, placing it among the most selective PADI inhibitors identified to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Structural studies reveal PADI4_3 inhibits PADI4 through active site binding</title><p id="P14">Having identified PADI4_3 as a potent and selective inhibitor of PADI4, we aimed to characterise its mode of binding. We determined the structure of PADI4_3-bound PADI4 by cryoEM to an overall resolution of 3.1 Å (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). The protein adopted a similar conformation to previously reported structures (e.g. PDB ID: 1WD9, all atom rmsd: 0.57 Å) with PADI4 adopting a head-to-tail homodimeric structure. Additionally, well-defined density for the whole cyclic peptide was observed in both monomers, allowing us to assign all residues unambiguously. Unusually for peptides derived from RaPID selections, PADI4_3 itself does not adopt any secondary structure elements and relatively few intramolecular hydrogen bonds are observed within PADI4_3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Those that are observed, such as between PADI4_3 H8 and K10 and Y11 and between PADI4_3 H5 and D3, are mainly side chain-to-backbone rather than backbone-to-backbone interactions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The structure confirmed that PADI4_3 is a substrate competitive inhibitor that binds within the active site of PADI4. Although PADI4_3 occupies the substrate binding site, rather than directly mimicking substrate binding by directing an arginine towards the active site, a histidine residue, H4, occupies this position (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). 760 Å<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> of surface area is buried (per monomer) and, in line with its nanomolar binding affinity, there are many specific intermolecular interactions between PADI4 and PADI4_3 across this interface. This includes a bifurcated hydrogen bond between PADI4 R374 and the carbonyls of the PADI4_3 D3 backbone and the N-terminal acetyl group. Hydrogen bonds between the side chains of PADI4_3 R2 and PADI4 D344, PADI4_3 D3 and PADI4 H640, PADI4_3 H4 and PADI4 D350, and PADI4_3 H5 and PADI4 S468 are also observed (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In line with the selectivity observed in COLDER assays, many of these residues are not conserved in other PADI isozymes or mouse PADI4. Most notably H640, which is not conserved in PADI1, PADI2 or mPADI4 and D344, which is not conserved in any of the other human PADIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B-D</xref>).</p><p id="P16">In parallel, we applied a deep mutational scanning approach first reported by Rogers <italic>et al.</italic> to provide an orthogonal view of which PADI4_3 residues were important for binding. We also hoped to understand whether substitutions might improve potency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. A scanning library was designed and synthesised based on the PADI4_3 peptide sequence, in which positions 2-11 in the peptide were individually randomised to every other coded amino acid (except methionine, which was reprogrammed as <italic>N</italic>-methyl-alanine). A single round of selection was performed by panning this displayed library against immobilised PADI4 under conditions in which equilibrium library binding was achieved in each of three wash steps. Next generation sequencing of the input and bound library was performed and an enrichment score (E) for each peptide was calculated based on the ratio of the frequency of the peptide in the bound library relative to the input library. A negative log<sub>2</sub>E value is suggestive of a binder that is weaker than the PADI4_3 parent sequence, whilst a positive value indicates tighter binding.</p><p id="P17">Our analysis of the high-throughput sequencing data suggested that the amino acids in the parent sequence were the optimal binders in many positions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). However, we did observe positive enrichment scores for some modified peptide sequences, indicating potentially favourable amino acid substitutions e.g. R7N (E = 1.37 ± 0.25), K10I (E = 2.8 ± 0.49). These observations correlated well with our cryoEM structure; largely solvent exposed residues in the cryoEM structure, such as P9 and K10, tended to be more tolerant to substitutions (indicated by most amino acid substitutions having only slightly negative E values), whilst those where we observed specific contacts with the protein, such as residues R2-H5, had highly negative enrichment scores for almost all substitutions apart from those most similar to the amino acid in the parent sequence.</p><p id="P18">To test whether these observations correlated with changes in binding affinity, we synthesised and characterised a series of peptide variants that either showed positive log<sub>2</sub>E values or that our structural data suggested would abrogate binding. While most of the peptide variants with positive log<sub>2</sub>E values showed similar binding affinities and IC<sub>50</sub>s to the parent sequence, surprisingly, none were more potent than PADI4_3 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5 and Table S2</xref>). Nonetheless several positions showed significant flexibility, such as R7 which tolerated amino acids with very different chemical properties in this position, including tryptophan, asparagine and alanine (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5 and Table S2</xref>). By contrast, our structure suggested that R2 interacts with D344 on the protein (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), and scanning data suggested that a lysine residue was the only other natural amino acid permitted in this position, suggesting that positive charge is important in position 2. Consistent with this, changing R2 to an alanine had a significant negative effect on binding and inhibition (PADI4_3_R2A: K<sub>D</sub> = 240 ± 97 nM, IC<sub>50</sub> = 9.4 ± 2.1 µM), whilst substitution with lysine substantially recovered binding and inhibition (PADI4_3_R2K: K<sub>D</sub> = 9 ± 2 nM, IC<sub>50</sub> = 213 ± 59 nM). Introducing citrulline at this position also partially recovered activity (PADI4_3_R2Cit: K<sub>D</sub> = 20 ± 11 nM, IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.1 ± 0.24 µM), suggesting that positive charge, though important, is not essential (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5 and Table S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Development of a high content imaging method for the quantification of cellular PADI4 activity</title><p id="P19">We went on to test whether PADI4_3 can inhibit cellular PADI4. To enable comparative and quantitative measurements of peptide activity in cells, we set up a high content microscopy method based upon the quantification of cellular citrullinated histone H3 (H3Cit) levels, as a read-out of cellular PADI4 activity, at single cell resolution by immunofluorescence. To allow for tractable measurements, we aimed to identify a non-transformed, adherent cell type and a stimulus that can achieve PADI4 activation in the absence of calcium ionophores, which can be damaging to cells. Based on previous findings that PADI4 promotes embryonic stem cell pluripotency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that it may be catalytically activated under cell culture conditions that promote the naïve pluripotency state. This can be achieved by switching from primed pluripotency culture conditions (provision of 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), hereafter referred to as “Serum” medium) to naïve pluripotency culture conditions, which involves provision of 10% Knock-out Serum Replacement (KSR), 1% FBS, LIF and inhibitors to kinases MEK and GSK3 (2i) (hereafter referred to as “KSR/2i” medium). As PADI4_3 is highly specific for human PADI4 and shows no efficacy against mouse PADI4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>), for these assays we generated mES cells stably expressing human PADI4 (hPADI4-stable). Quantification of mean H3Cit intensity in these cells shows that transition from Serum to KSR/2i medium for 3 hours is sufficient to induce a measurable induction of intracellular PADI4 activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A</xref>). This method is quantitative, as demonstrated by the dose response read-outs achieved by treatment with increasing doses of Cl-amidine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>PADI4_3 is a cell active PADI4 inhibitor</title><p id="P20">To achieve accurate downstream characterisation of PADI4_3 function, we generated a matched inactive control peptide where the second and third amino acids of the sequence were reversed (PADI4_3i).

To assess the cell permeability of these peptides, we used the established CAPA cell penetration assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. CAPA assays performed with PADI4_3 and PADI4_3i appended with chloroalkane groups showed that both peptides entered cells, with CP<sub>50</sub> values of 1.4 ± 0.1 µM and 2.0 ± 0.8 µM respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7C</xref>).</p><p id="P21">We then employed the high content imaging method described above to quantify the efficacy of cyclic peptides against cellular PADI4. hPADI4-stable mES cells were stimulated with KSR/2i medium for 3 hours, in the absence or presence of a range of PADI4_3 or PADI4_3i peptide concentrations. We found that PADI4_3 inhibits intracellular PADI4 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref>). PADI4_3 inhibited PADI4 activity with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.2 µM.

NETs are released by neutrophils via a programmed cell death called NETosis as part of the innate immune response to infection and act as a defence mechanism for the capture and killing of diverse pathogens. However, NETs also occur during sterile inflammation and are associated with tissue destruction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. A range of reports demonstrate that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PADI4 results in decreased extracellular histone citrullination and is protective against NET-associated tissue damage in a variety of pathological contexts, from rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, to cancer metastasis and age-related tissue fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. It is therefore highly likely that inhibition of PADI4 in clinical settings will be beneficial. To test whether PADI4_3 can inhibit NET-associated citrullination in a physiologically relevant system, we assessed its effect on primary human peripheral neutrophils from healthy donors, treated with cholesterol crystals, a well-established inducer of NETosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. We found that citrullination of histone 3 in NET preparations was abolished by PADI4_3 but not PADI4_3i (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P23">The lack of citrullination resulting from PADI4 inhibition is often interpreted as a disruption in NET formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Conflicting findings, often arising from highly diverse and pleiotropic stimuli used to induce NETosis in different studies, have rendered it unclear whether PADI4 activation is a necessary step in the execution of NETosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. We also exploited the high potency and specificity of PADI4_3 and the availability of its negative control peptide PADI4_3i to assess the role of PADI4 in NETosis induced by different stimuli in primary human peripheral neutrophils. Inhibition of PADI4 with PADI4_3 (50 µM) reduced H3Cit levels and NETosis in human neutrophils treated with calcium ionophore, while neither response was affected by incubation with the control peptide, PADI4_3i (50 µM) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-G</xref>). Other NETosis inducers, such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or cholesterol crystals, have been reported to induce NETosis in a PADI4-independent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.

Together these results confirmed that the requirement for PADI4 activity in the activation of NETosis in human neutrophils is stimulus-dependent. The varying effects of PADI4_3 on NETosis elicited by different stimuli lends support to a mechanism by which inhibition of citrullination is achieved by direct engagement between PADI4_3 and PADI4, rather than a non-specific effect on NETosis, or by cell toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>PADI4_11 is a first-in-class cell permeable PADI4 activator</title><p id="P24">We hypothesised that the peptides that bound away from the active site may activate PADI4. To test this, we performed COLDER activity assays, titrating the calcium concentration at a constant concentration of cyclic peptide (30 µM). In the absence of peptide, PADI4 required 225 ± 10 µM calcium to achieve 50% of maximal activity under saturating calcium concentrations (K<sub>50(Ca2+)</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Whilst little change in K<sub>50(Ca2+)</sub> was observed in the presence of PADI4_1 and PADI4_7, the calcium requirement was reduced 4-fold with PADI4_11 and PADI4_12, the two peptides identified from selection 3 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Additionally, even under saturating calcium concentrations, the presence of PADI4_11 or PADI4_12 increased PADI4 activity 36 ± 9 % or 12 ± 15 % over the dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle control respectively, suggesting a hyper-active conformation of PADI4 in the presence of either of these two peptides. This activation was dependent on the peptide concentration, requiring 1.6 ± 0.6 µM PAD4_11 and 6.5 ± 0.1 µM PAD4_12, to achieve 50% activation (AC<sub>50</sub>) at 0.1 mM calcium (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). As for the inhibitory peptides, we also confirmed the isozyme specificity of both PADI4_11 and PADI4_12 using COLDER activity assays to test all the catalytically active human PADIs and mPADI4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9A-D</xref>). At 30 µM peptide no activation was observed for any other PADI.</p><p id="P25">Given that PADI4_11 was most potent, we took it forward into cell-based assays. We synthesized a negative control, PADI4_11i, which consists of the parental sequence with the second and third amino acids reversed. This showed no binding to PADI4 (K<sub>d</sub> &gt; 5 µM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>). We again assessed the cell permeability of both peptides using the CAPA assay. This demonstrated that both PADI4_11 and PADI4_11i are cell permeable, with CP<sub>50</sub> values of 3.1 ± 1.2 µM and 2.0 ± 0.5 µM respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9E</xref>). Using our high content imaging method for quantification of cellular H3Cit, we found that PADI4_11 can induce PADI4 activation in a dose-dependent manner in PADI4-stable mES cells without any other activating stimulus, while PADI4_11i does not have the same effect (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-E</xref>). Treatment of wild-type mES cells (which do not harbour human PADI4) with PAD4_11 did not induce citrullination at any concentration tested (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Since calcium influx resulting from a compromise to cell membrane integrity might be sufficient to induce intracellular PADI4 activation, we tested whether PADI4_11 results in increased calcium influx, using live cell calcium imaging. We found that neither PADI4_11, nor PADI4_11i, were responsible for increased intracellular calcium levels (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11A</xref>). Similarly, PADI4_11 did not compromise cell membrane integrity, as demonstrated by the fact that treatment with peptide did not make the cells permeable to propidium iodide (PI) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). These results also indicated that PADI4_11 was not toxic to the cells. We confirmed this using live cell imaging of cell death over a period of 48 hours after treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11B</xref>). We therefore conclude that the activating effect of PADI4_11 is specific and on-target.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>The mechanism of action of PADI4_11 provides proof-of-principle for allosteric regulation of PADI4</title><p id="P26">As discussed above, it is currently unclear how PADI4 activation is achieved within cells at physiological calcium concentrations. One hypothesis is that a mode of allosteric regulation, such as a post-translational modification or binding to an interacting protein, elicits a conformational change that allows activation of the enzyme at lower calcium levels. Given that PADI4_11 can induce activation of PADI4 at 4-fold lower calcium, we sought to understand the underlying mechanism. We first excluded direct calcium binding by the peptide itself through isothermal titration calorimetry between PADI4_11 and calcium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S12</xref>).</p><p id="P27">We then used cryoEM to elucidate the mode of binding of PADI4_11 to PADI4 and were able to obtain a structure with an overall resolution of 3.6 Å. As for the structure with the inhibitor PADI4_3 described above, PADI4 adopts a homodimeric structure. In this case, density was observed for all residues of the cyclic peptide except for the thioether cyclisation bridge (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). PADI4_11 adopts an alpha-helical structure with the internal cyclisation bridge between C4 and the N-terminus of the peptide acting like a peptide staple<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. A characteristic pattern of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between backbone N-H groups and backbone carbonyl groups four residues preceding them stabilise this helical structure (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Many intermolecular interactions are also observed between the peptide and PADI4, consistent with its tight binding affinity (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P28">The structure revealed that PADI4_11 binds to a surface of PADI4 distal to the active site, but close to the five calcium ion binding sites. The peptide binds in a cleft formed between two loops in PADI4 (D155-V171 and P371-387). These loops are flexible in the calcium-free form of PADI4 (no density is observed in the crystal structure of apo-PADI4 (PDB ID: 1WD8)) and rigidify upon calcium binding, in a structural rearrangement that forms the catalytically competent active site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S13A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. PADI4_11 binding in this region thus fits well with our observations that PADI4_11 activates PADI4 by reducing its calcium dependency, since peptide binding likely alters the dynamics of this region and may therefore directly reduce calcium binding affinities. In addition, and in line with the selectivity shown in the COLDER assays, these regions are not well conserved in other PADI isozymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S13B-E</xref>).</p><p id="P29">We also performed an alanine scan of PADI4_11, which revealed that residues E2, R5 and R7 were particularly important for binding and activation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Substitution of R5 and R7 with alanine almost abrogated their binding to and activation of PADI4, which was restored by changing either residue to a lysine. This highlighted the necessity of a positively charged amino acid in these positions, potentially to interact with negatively charged amino acids in PADI4. Consistent with these observations, R7 makes direct interactions with PADI4 E167 in the cryoEM structure, though relevant interactions between PADI4 and R5 are less obvious (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). By contrast, substitution of E2 by alanine, aspartic acid or glutamine all resulted in loss of activity, suggesting the importance of the appropriate side chain length, as well as negative charge in position 2 of PADI4_11, in allowing it to form a salt bridge with R394 in PADI4 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Although no individual amino acid in the linear region of PADI4_11 (residues 8-12) appeared critical individually, a truncated 6mer peptide, PADI4_11b, was inactive (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). In addition, we could confirm that cyclisation is necessary for binding, as substitution of C4 to alanine abrogated binding and activity of the peptide.</p><p id="P30">To further verify the allosteric activation mechanism of PADI4_11 predicted by the structure we produced several PADI4 variants, each with a single amino acid substitution, which we hypothesised might alter peptide binding (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S14</xref>). To assess the activity of the different variants we determined their K<sub>50(Ca2+)</sub> values. As described by Arita et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, substitution of N373 for an alanine completely abolished PADI4 activity. Substitution of all other amino acids tested had minimal effects on maximal catalysis rate when saturated with calcium but in most cases increased their K<sub>50(Ca2+)</sub> values (up to 14-fold for PADI4_D165A).</p><p id="P31">We then went on to investigate how well PADI4_11 activated each of these variants. We determined the change in K<sub>50(Ca2+)</sub> for each protein variant on addition of PADI4_11 (30 µM) and compared this with the change in K<sub>50(Ca2+)</sub> for the wild-type PADI4. We also measured the binding affinity of PADI4_11 to each variant. Incubation of the peptide with the catalytically inactive variant (N373A) did not rescue its activity. Consistent with our alanine scan data, substitution of R394 (predicted to form a salt bridge with E2 in PADI4_11) with an alanine produced a PADI4 variant that did not bind to, and consequently was not activated by PADI4_11, confirming that R394 is essential for the activation mechanism.</p><p id="P32">Our final four variants spanned a flexible loop in PADI4 (D165-D168) that rearranges upon calcium binding and appeared from our cryoEM structure to be involved in PADI4_11 binding. The K<sub>50(Ca2+)</sub> value for variant D168A decreased by about 3-fold when incubated with PADI4_11, almost to the same degree as with the wild-type protein (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S14</xref>). Variant E167A also displayed a similar fold change in K<sub>50(Ca2+)</sub> on PADI4_11 binding as the wild-type enzyme. However, the binding affinity of this variant to PADI4_11 was about 10-fold reduced, consistent with the observed interaction between PADI4 E167 and PADI4_11 R7. This data suggested that E167 and D168 are not essential for PADI4 activation by PADI4_11. By contrast, the K<sub>50(Ca2+)</sub> for PADI4_D165A changed very little when incubated with PADI4_11, suggesting D165 is critical for activation by PADI4_11. Substitution of C166 with bulky phenylalanine (as observed in the mouse PADI4 sequence) also completely abolished activation of the variant by PADI4_11. Together, these results reveal that the region from 165-168 is necessary for the activation of PADI4 by PADI4_11, although not all the residues in the loop are essential for this binding. Additionally, these findings point to a critical portion of PADI4, which may be involved in the allosteric regulation of the enzyme by other cellular enzymes or interacting proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>A nanomolar, inert PADI4 binding peptide functionalised as a pull-down reagent</title><p id="P33">In addition to our inhibitory and activating peptides, there remained two potent binders, PAD4_1 and PAD4_7, which neither inhibited nor activated PADI4 catalytic activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

We therefore sought to generate a pull-down probe from PADI4_7 (the tighter binder of the two peptides). We synthesised a biotinylated variant (bio-PADI4_7) and tested its ability to enrich PADI4 from our PADI4-stable mES cells, or control cells which only harbour endogenous mouse PADI4. Immunoblot analysis of pull-down samples demonstrated significant enrichment when bio-PADI4_7 was used as the bait (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Thus, bio-PADI4_7 can be used to enrich for cellular PADI4 and subsequent biochemical analyses. To explore the binding partners of PADI4, we analysed pull-downs of these cells with bio-PADI4_7, or its non-binding scrambled variant bio-PADI4_7scr, by mass spectrometry. PADI4 is highly enriched in bio-PADI4_7 pull-downs as compared with bio-PADI4_7scr (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S15</xref>). In addition to PADI4, we observed a number of other proteins enriched by bio-PADI4_7 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B,C</xref>), which may include PADI4-interacting proteins. To obtain an understanding of the PADI4 interactome under PADI4 resting or activation conditions, we performed bio-PADI4_7 and bio-PADI4_7scr pull-downs from PADI4-stable mES cells stimulated with KSR-containing medium, or grown in fresh serum-containing medium, for 3 hours. After normalising against the minimal background list of proteins enriched in the two bio-PADI4_7scr pull-downs, we observe a different set of PADI4 interacting proteins in Serum or KSR conditions (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Provided that the stimulation of the cells with KSR happened over a 3 hour window, we do not expect the proteome of the cells to be different. It is likely that these two lists of proteins identified by mass spectrometry contain PADI4 activators or inhibitors (enriched in KSR or Serum respectively) and can serve as a primer for characterising PADI4-regulating co-factors or allosteric regulators.

Chemical tools that allow researchers to finely tune or perturb the activity of single PADI isozymes will be invaluable in deciphering the roles of these enzymes in cell physiology and are likely to aid the development of important therapeutic and cell modulatory agents. In this work, we developed three classes of potent and isozyme-selective PADI4-binding cyclic peptides.</p><p id="P35">Firstly, we identified PADI4_3, a highly specific, reversible PADI4 inhibitor that exhibits high potency in cells. Whilst a range of PADI4 inhibitors have been reported previously, very few show a high degree of selectivity for a single PADI isozyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. GSK484<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> is the most potent and selective PADI4 inhibitor reported to date. However, GSK484 binds only to the calcium-free inactive form of PADI4. In disease contexts, such as autoimmunity, cancer, atherosclerosis and fibrosis, where PADI4 expression or activity are aberrantly high, a potent and selective inhibitor, which is specific for the active form, is likely to be highly advantageous. PADI4_3 therefore provides a starting point for the development of clinically relevant compounds with potential efficacy in a variety of pathological contexts.</p><p id="P36">Secondly, we identified PADI4_11, a first-in-class synthetic activator of PADI4, that reduces the requirement of PADI4 for calcium <italic>in vitro</italic> and achieves specific activation of PADI4 in a cellular context. This reagent has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of the cellular consequences of PADI4 activation, which can only be achieved currently using highly pleiotropic stimuli. For example, such a reagent may be applied in contexts where PADI4 activation has a cell modulatory effect, such as stem cell and induced cell reprogramming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, to increase our understanding of the signalling and epigenetic events that mediate changes in cell state. Additionally, as PADI4 activation has been shown to occur during, and to mediate cell reprogramming, PADI4_11 may be developed as a tool to enhance and tightly control the reprogramming process.</p><p id="P37">Importantly, PADI4_11 also informs our molecular understanding of cellular PADI4 activation. The structural and mutagenesis analyses presented here reveal that PADI4_11 binds at an allosteric site on PADI4, in a region of the protein that is disordered in calcium-free crystal structures but becomes structured upon calcium binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Detailed structural analyses of calcium binding to PADI2 by Thompson and co-workers suggest that partial calcium binding (at sites 3, 4 and 5) reorients one of these loops (residues 369-389 in PADI2, corresponding to 368-388 in PADI4) forming the calcium 2 binding site, which once occupied by a calcium ion then allows catalysis. Thus, it is conceivable that, by binding in this same region, PADI4_11 promotes this same rearrangement allowing the catalytically-competent conformation of PADI4 to form at reduced calcium concentrations, either by increasing the calcium binding affinity for one of the binding sites or by removing the requirement for calcium binding in one of these sites. It is worth noting that molecular docking studies suggest that the PADI2 activator DMZ potentiates PADI2 activity by binding at a similar site, though whether it reduces the requirement of PADI2 for calcium is unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Darrah <italic>et al</italic>., also previously reported a class of anti-PADI4 autoantigens from rheumatoid arthritis patients that decreased the concentration of calcium required for PADI4 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Proteolysis experiments suggested these antibodies bind at the same site as PADI4_11. Taken together, these findings point to potential modes of allosteric regulation <italic>in vivo,</italic> whereby PADI4 modifications or protein interactions, which may result from signalling elicited by inflammatory or developmental stimuli, may allow activation at physiological levels of intracellular calcium. Interestingly, recent studies have reported binding of several intracellular proteins in this same region, both on PADI4 and PADI2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. Whilst no functional consequence on PADI activity has been reported for binding of these other proteins, combined with the known auto-antibodies and our new data, this raises the possibility that this region represents a hotspot for protein binding partners, or protein modifying enzymes, that activate PADIs.</p><p id="P38">Finally, we report PADI4_7, an inert but potent PADI4 binder and demonstrate that a functionalised, biotinylated version, bio-PADI4_7, can isolate PADI4 from whole cell extracts. The high specificity and small size of this cyclic peptide reagent may eliminate the non-specific binding that is often unavoidable with the use of antibodies and may be developed further for additional applications, for example for fluorescence-based PADI4 localisation studies. As our understanding of physiologically relevant contexts of PADI4 activation increases, tools based on PADI4_7 may serve as valuable tools for the molecular characterisation of PADI4 regulation. Proteins identified by Mass Spectrometry point to potential regulators or co-factors of PADI4. For example we find that, under activating conditions, PADI4 associates with molecular chaperones such as Hsp90, which maintains the active conformation of client proteins, and subunits of the TCP1 chaperonin-containing complex (Cct3, Cct5 and Cct8), which assists with the folding of a large variety of cellular proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. It is possible that molecular chaperones mediate the conformational change associated with cellular PADI4 activation, or maintain PADI4 in an active conformation, in the context of the intracellular environment. Similarly, association with Cip2a, a mediator of protein homodimerisaton, may mediate activation of PADI4, which functions as a head-to-tail homodimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Of note, also, are Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) and the phosphofructokinase Pfkl, two factors that counteract oxidative damage. PADI4 requires reducing conditions for activation <italic>in vitro,</italic> and these factors may achieve a similar effect within cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. PADI4 is known to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and this may be mediated by a number of nuclear import/export proteins found associated with PADI4 in our experiments, such as exportins Xpo1 and Xpo4, importin Ipo8 and nucleoporins. Finally, key post-translational modification catalysing enzymes found here, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase Map4k4 or the lysine demethylase Kdm3a may target PADI4 directly to induce an activation-associated allosteric change, or may work in conjunction with PADI4 for the coordinated modification of target proteins, such as histones. Future work will determine the functional significance of the identified interactions.</p><p id="P39">The strong selectivity of our cyclic peptides for PADI4 over other PADI isozymes makes them ideal for disentangling the individual effects of these related proteins. One caveat of this selectivity is that they are also highly selective for hPADI4 over mPADI4, precluding their use in functional studies in mouse systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Focussed saturation mutagenesis libraries have previously been used to enhance the cross-species binding of RaPID derived peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. This strategy would likely work well with PADI4_3 where small differences in multiple side chain to side chain interactions appear to be responsible for the selectivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>). Interestingly, however, comparing the PADI4_11 binding site in human and mouse PADI4 reveals that F166 in mPADI4 (C166 in hPADI4) points directly into the binding site and would clash substantially, not only with side chains, but also with the helical backbone of the peptide, suggesting that an alternative scaffold will be required for developing a mouse-targeted PADI4 activator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S13E</xref>).</p><p id="P40">Whilst cyclic peptides are an attractive modality to develop potent and selective binders of challenging drug targets, progression as clinical candidates can be limited by their pharmacological properties, which often include poor metabolic stability, bioavailability and cell permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. In particular, their application to intracellular proteins has been limited. In this regard, PADI4_3 and PADI4_11 show surprisingly high cell permeability, of a level suitable for cellular experiments, demonstrating the potential of cyclic peptides to act as tools for intracellular protein targets. Additional enhancement of their stability and permeability will allow progress further in a translational context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. In the case of PADI4 in particular, a non-cell permeable PADI4 inhibitor may be advantageous in the context of deregulation associated with cancer and inflammatory disease. In these contexts it is proposed that citrullination of extracellular proteins by extracellular PADI4 promotes metastasis, or leads to increased inflammation and generation of autoantigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Indeed, given that the relationship between the physiological and pathological modes of PADI4 activation is not well understood, a non-cell permeable PADI4 inhibitor might be valuable in targeting disease-associated PADI4 activity without disrupting its physiological intracellular roles. Towards this, simple modifications could likely be made to PADI4_3 to prevent its cellular uptake.</p><p id="P41">The work presented here describes the development and characterisation of a comprehensive toolbox of cyclic peptide modulators of human PADI4 and methods for understanding its regulation within cells. The tools and methods developed here can be applied towards the study of the cell biological functions and biochemical mechanisms regulated by PADI4 in different physiological contexts and will therefore be applicable across different areas of cell biology and biomedical science. Importantly, they provide a platform for the development of cell modulatory and therapeutic agents applicable to the broad-ranging contexts of PADI4 deregulation, which include autoimmunity, cancer and age-related pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>General information</title><p id="P42">Unless stated otherwise reagents were purchased from commercial sources including Merck, Nakalai, New England Biolabs (NEB) and Invitrogen.
