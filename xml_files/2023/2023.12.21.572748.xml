Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) models offer a valuable tool to study the effects of IL-6 on features relevant for human neurodevelopment <italic>in vitro</italic>. We previously reported that hiPSC-derived microglia-like cells (MGLs) respond to IL-6, but neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in monoculture do not. Therefore, we investigated whether co-culturing hiPSC-derived MGLs with NPCs would trigger a cellular response to IL-6 stimulation via secreted factors from the MGLs. Using N=4 donor lines without psychiatric diagnosis, we first confirmed that NPCs can respond to IL-6 through trans-signalling when recombinant IL-6Ra is present, and that this response is dose-dependent. MGLs secreted soluble IL-6R, but at lower levels than found <italic>in vivo</italic> and below that needed to activate trans-signalling in NPCs. Whilst transcriptomic and secretome analysis confirmed that MGLs undergo substantial transcriptomic changes after IL-6 exposure and subsequently secrete a cytokine milieu, NPCs in co-culture with MGLs exhibited a minimal transcriptional response. Furthermore, there were no significant cell fate-acquisition changes when differentiated into post-mitotic cultures, nor alterations in synaptic densities in mature neurons. These findings highlight the need to investigate if trans-IL-6 signalling to NPCs is a relevant disease mechanism linking prenatal IL-6 exposure to increased risk for psychiatric disorders. Moreover, our findings underscore the importance of establishing more complex <italic>in vitro</italic> human models with diverse cell types, which may show cell-specific responses to microglia-released cytokines to fully understand how IL-6 exposure may influence human neurodevelopment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>IL-6</kwd><kwd>neurodevelopment</kwd><kwd>human induced-pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>neural progenitor cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Human birth cohort studies have linked elevated maternal interleukin (IL)-6 concentrations across gestation with aberrant structural and functional brain connectivity in the offspring, as measured by MRI, which in turn are associated with abnormal cognitive development and increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as autism spectrum condition (ASC) and schizophrenia (SZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Graham <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Rudolph <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Rasmussen <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Allswede <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Although these cohort studies demonstrate a correlation between elevated prenatal IL-6 and NDD incidence, additional studies at a molecular and cellular level are required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which this risk is conferred. Much of the cellular level research that links prenatal IL-6 insults with adverse neurodevelopmental effects in the offspring has, however, been conducted in rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Samuelsson <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Ozaki <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Mirabella <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), which may have different brain development trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Eze et al., 2021</xref>) For example, transient elevation of IL-6 during a critical period of neurodevelopment can have enduring effects on the formation of glutamatergic synapses in the mouse hippocampus with consequences for mouse brain connectivity as measured by resting state fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Samuelsson <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Mirabella <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Nonetheless, investigating the influence of IL-6 on early neurodevelopmental processes using human-led models is crucial to understand its role in increasing the risk of NDDs in offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bayés <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Südhof, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Kuljis <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P4">As previously reviewed, IL-6 signalling involves both the IL-6 receptor (IL-6Ra) and IL-6 signal transducer (IL-6ST) subunits, with IL-6 binding to IL-6Ra triggering a conformational change that activates the JAK/STAT pathway through either cis-signalling (cell surface IL-6Ra expression) or trans-signalling (via secreted soluble IL-6Ra, sIL-6Ra) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Rose-John, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Wolf, Rose-John and Garbers, 2014</xref>). Trans-signalling via sIL-6Ra enables activation of cells lacking the full receptor and may be implicated in pro-inflammatory effects on non-glial cells, contrasting cis-signalling’s proposed anti-inflammatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Rose-John, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Rose-John <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Scheller <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Campbell <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Wolf, Rose-John and Garbers, 2014</xref>). This mechanism is known to occur in the CNS, demonstrated when blocking trans-signalling with soluble IL-6ST in the CNS of adult rodents, which resulted in reduced astrogliosis and microgliosis, blood-brain barrier leakage, vascular proliferation, neurodegeneration, as well as impaired neurogenesis, caused by overexpression of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Campbell <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). However, the consequences of trans-IL-6 signalling during human development remains unclear.</p><p id="P5">Microglia are central to the developing brain’s response to IL-6. In mid-gestation (GW17-18) human neocortex tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Polioudakis <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), as well as in the developing human telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Florio <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Nowakowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>), microglia are the leading cell type expressing IL-6Ra, with expression levels being higher than in excitatory neurons, intermediate progenitors, interneurons, radial glia, mitotic progenitors, oligodendrocyte precursors, endothelial cells and pericytes. Importantly, initiation of either IL-6 trans- or cis- signalling may be dependent on the expression ratios of the receptor complex’s subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Reeh <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). However, the direct link between sIL-6Ra secretion by microglia and enhanced trans-signalling in non-glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Ferreira <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Campbell <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), as well as its implications in a neurodevelopment system remain uncertain, especially in a human-relevant model. This knowledge gap underscores the value of using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to model human foetal brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Eze <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). In agreement with primary tissue studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Florio <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Nowakowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Polioudakis <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), hiPSC-derived NPCs express IL-6ST, yet they lack IL-6Ra expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Couch <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Sarieva, Hildebrand, <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). This renders them unresponsive to IL-6 in mono-culture without the addition of sIL-6Ra necessary for trans-signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Couch <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Sarieva, Hildebrand, <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). To circumvent this limitation, previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies by using hyper-IL-6, a synthetic construct combining sIL-6Ra and IL-6 linked by a flexible peptide, enabling NPCs to respond to IL-6 through trans-signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Sarieva, Hildebrand, <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Recent investigations using a 3D human forebrain organoid, which lacked microglia, demonstrated that exposure to hyper-IL-6 disproportionately affected radial glia cells, leading to an increased presence of this cell type in the organoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Sarieva, Kagermeier, <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Notably, chronic 5-day hyper-IL-6 exposure also resulted in an increase in upper-layer excitatory neurons and abnormalities in neuronal migration and positioning, suggesting that forced IL-6 trans-signalling can disrupt the standard process of cortical development and organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Sarieva, Kagermeier, <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). These data provide human-relevant evidence that IL-6 signalling in developing forebrain organoids can change typical cellular and molecular phenotypes.</p><p id="P6">Although hyper-IL-6 effectively demonstrates that NPCs are capable of IL-6 trans-signalling, it does not replicate the hypothesised physiological trans-signalling process found <italic>in vivo</italic>. Hyper-IL-6 forces cells to respond via trans-signalling under any condition, despite the fact there could be an upstream signalling regulation mechanism governed by non-NPC cell types. Our previous research indicates that hiPSC-derived microglia-like cells (MGLs) can secrete sIL-6Ra, addressing the absence of this subunit in hiPSC-derived NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Couch <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Consequently, a co-culture system of MGLs and developing cortical NPCs may offer a more physiologically relevant model to study the acute IL-6 responses of both cell types, providing a closer approximation to physiological conditions than hyper-IL-6. In this study, we employ hiPSC-derived MGLs and NPCs from the same donors for co-culture, ensuring a consistent genetic background within each culture, and expose them to acute IL-6 stimulation for 24 hours. Employing a trans-well co-culture system allows for the analysis of soluble factors, minimises potential confounding impact from the experimental handling of microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cadiz <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), and precludes the need for more invasive separation methods like fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Park <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). The overall study aim was to ascertain the cellular and molecular changes of both NPCs and MGLs post-IL-6 exposure. We hypothesised that: (1) co-culturing with MGLs will facilitate acute NPC response to IL-6 via trans-signalling mediated by sIL-6Ra, or additional cytokines secreted by MGLs in response to IL-6; (2) this interaction will modify the transcriptomes of both MGLs and NPCs, as identified through bulk RNAseq, revealing key molecular pathways; (3) early exposure of NPCs to cytokines will influence their cell fate determination and synaptogenesis upon differentiation into post-mitotic cortical neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell Culture</title><sec id="S4"><title>hiPSCs</title><p id="P7">For the derivation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), participants were recruited, and methods carried out in accordance with the ‘Patient iPSCs for Neurodevelopmental Disorders (PiNDs) study’ (REC No 13/LO/1218).

Synaptic puncta sizes were considered to be between 27-170 pixels, which equated to between 0.8-5μm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Glynn and McAllister, 2006</xref>). To calculate the lowest intensity limit, the intensity of each channel’s background fluorescence was taken and averaged from 5 random locations from the primary negative wells.

The dendrite length of MAP2+ cells was measured and averaged per well, to normalise the number of puncta for culture and dendrite outgrowth. This gave two outputs for each puncta channel: intensity and puncta number/dendrite length (density) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Finally, positively identified puncta were masked on top of each other, to count those that co-colocalised (50% positively overlapped).

Each specific test performed is described in the corresponding figure legend and supplementary statistical data table, providing the number of replicate hiPSC lines included in each technical and biological replicate, as specified in the relevant method section above. In general, when discussing co-culture data, the N=4 donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) were considered biological replicates, and when discussing mono-culture data the N=3 donors (3 ♂ only, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) were considered biological replicates. To compare post-mitotic cell marker populations, two-way ANOVA was used with cell type and treatment condition as main factors. When assessing the effect of IL-6 on each synaptic metric measured in post-mitotic neurons, one-sample Welch’s t-test was used due to the unequal variances between each group in the fold-change values from the vehicle-treated condition (all vehicle donor points = 1). To compare the concentrations of cytokines and sIL-6Ra in control and IL-6 treated co-culture media, an unpaired two-tailed t-test was employed. When comparing the mean between two distinct conditions, such as the concentrations of cytokines in control and IL-6 treated monoculture media from NPCs and MGLs, a two-way ANOVA was employed. For each of the cases in which a t-test was used to compare two group means, an unpaired form of t-test was used, given each cell culture sample is unique and does not reflect a paired design. In the cases where significant differences were observed between groups in these models, post-hoc testing was conducted using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% to identify the individual groups with significant differences. Adjusted p-values (q-values) less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and relevant significant q-values are quoted. The BH correction method with a 5% FDR threshold was also employed when deciphering the differentially expressed genes from each transcriptome signature, and during the RNAseq downstream over representation analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S21"><title>Forebrain neural progenitor cells only respond to IL-6 by trans-signalling in the presence of sIL-6Ra in a dose-dependent manner</title><p id="P23">To investigate whether forebrain NPCs can respond to IL-6 via trans-signalling using sIL-6Ra, we introduced recombinant human sIL-6Ra (rIL-6Ra) to forebrain NPC monocultures derived from three male donors without a psychiatric diagnosis (one clone each) at day (D) 18 of differentiation.

Additionally, VEGF was included due to its role in angiogenesis and neurodevelopment, given its observed increased expression in chronic medicated SZ patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Chukaew <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) and in foetal mouse brains from an MIA rodent model (Poly I:C on gestational day 16) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Arrode-Brusés and Brusés, 2012</xref>).

Notably, the only female donor (069_CTF) exhibited distinct separation on the PC1 axis from male donors, but due to inclusion of a single female hiPSC line, further sex-based analysis was not pursued. Subsequent analysis revealed 72 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) post-IL-6 exposure (out of 16820 genes measured) after FDR correction at 5%. As anticipated, similarly to our prior study with IL-6 stimulated MGL mono-cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Couch <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), IL-6 receptor signal transduction genes like <italic>JAK3</italic> and <italic>STAT3</italic> were significantly upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The DESeq2 normalized counts of human microglia and monocyte marker genes were compared between vehicle-treated and IL-6 treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). This comparison was based on a gene list from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Haenseler et al.

Our findings align with the expression profile of microglial marker genes as per the original MGL differentiation protocol, and no significant clustering was observed based on IL-6 treatment, suggesting that IL-6 exposure did not alter MGL cell-specificity at the gene expression level, consistent with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Couch <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P31">To explore the molecular pathways influenced by IL-6 receptor signalling in MGLs in co-culture with NPCs, we conducted a Webgestalt over-representation analysis (ORA) on the up- and down-regulated gene sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Liao <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). The down-regulated gene set showed no significant associations with ORA pathways post-FDR correction (q &gt; 0.05). In contrast, 24 pathways were significantly linked with upregulated genes, including “STAT cascade”, “Interleukin-6 production”, and “acute inflammatory response” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). The pathway “positive regulation of cell motility” was also notably associated, supporting previous findings that IL-6 stimulation enhances microglial motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Ozaki <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Couch <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). These data suggest that the observed terms related to the IL-6 pathway, along with others pertaining to cellular recruitment and cell-to-cell adhesion (such as “leukocyte migration”, “T-cell activation”, and “regulation of cell-cell adhesion”), point towards an acute, pro-inflammatory functional shift by the microglia to an acute 24h stimulation with IL-6 in co-culture with NPCs.</p><p id="P32">To understand if the IL-6-induced transcriptional changes in MGLs after 24 hours mirror those observed in neurodevelopmental disorders, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). The analysis overlapped each signature with gene sets from post-mortem brain tissue of individuals with schizophrenia (SZ), autism spectrum conditions (ASC), and bipolar disorder (BD). Notably, the MGL transcriptome post-IL-6 exposure showed significant enrichment for the up-regulated gene set from SZ patients (list of overlap genes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Webgestalt ORA identified several enriched pathways, including “lymphocyte activation”, “adaptive immune response”, and “T cell activation” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Collectively, these findings imply that the IL-6 response of MGLs in co-culture mirrors that observed in monocultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Couch <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), and that the molecular processes identified in SZ <italic>post-mortem</italic> brain tissue are detectable in our developmental <italic>in vitro</italic> model.</p><p id="P33">Finally, we aimed to delineate the differences between the MGL transcriptomic response to IL-6 in co-culture versus mono-culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Couch et al., 2023</xref>). To achieve this, we utilised the MGEnrichment tool output to qualitatively compare specifically human modules that were enriched by up-regulated genes in both the mono-culture and co-culture MGLs following IL-6 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). The enrichment scores derived from our MGEnrichment analysis demonstrated a robust activation of the ‘SCZ &amp; ASD &amp; BD Gene Modules’ in both the co-culture and mono-culture environments, indicating a highly potentiated upregulation of genes associated with NDDs. Of note, the transcriptomic profiles between mono-culture and co-culture microglia were contrasted, with a more modest NDD-related enrichment score obtained from the mono-culture microglia in comparison to the co-culture (co-culture FE = 12.36, q = 2.14x10<sup>-11</sup>; mono-culture FE = 5.07, q = 1.8x10<sup>-13</sup>). These data suggest that the presence of NPCs in a co-culture can modulate microglial gene regulation across various pathways, particularly those related to NDDs, and may suppress the MGL response to IL-6, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Haenseler <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>The proximal impact of IL-6 on hiPSC-derived forebrain NPC transcriptome in co-culture with MGLs</title><p id="P34">With the knowledge that hiPSC-derived MGLs responded to IL-6 in co-culture with NPCs, we aimed to investigate if NPCs respond to IL-6 via trans-signalling either directly from sIL6Ra secreted by MGLs, or indirectly via other cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-α secreted by MGLs in response to IL-6. Bulk RNAseq was performed on hiPSC-derived NPCs after 24 hours in co-culture with MGLs treated with either IL-6 or vehicle. We first assessed the impact of co-culturing NPCs with MGLs and IL-6 treatment on cell type heterogeneity using the NPC RNAseq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). DESeq2 normalized counts were analysed for markers indicative of neural progenitor, pan-neuronal, dorsal forebrain, ventral forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, upper layer and deep layer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Nehme <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The analysis revealed predominant expression of neural progenitor cell-related genes, consistent with the expected outcome at this differentiation stage. This finding suggests that co-culturing with hiPSC-derived MGLs using trans-well inserts did not alter the anticipated NPC cell type profile, given there was no hierarchical clustering by cell-markers. Clustering was in-fact influenced by donor genotype rather than IL-6 treatment, indicating that the IL-6 exposure did not significantly affect the cell type composition of NPCs at this culture stage.</p><p id="P35">Contrary to our hypothesis however, PCA analysis revealed that the most significant variation in the NPC transcriptome was attributable to donor genotype rather than IL-6 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Out of the 17225 genes measured, only 2 DEGs passed the 5% FDR threshold for increased expression in NPCs in co-cultures treated with IL-6 versus vehicle, thereby exhibiting a minimal transcriptional difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>): TNF-Alpha-Induced Protein 3 (<italic>TNFAIP3</italic>: q = 0.0282, Log2FC = 1.545) and Poly(A) Binding Protein Cytoplasmic 1 (<italic>PABPC1</italic>: q = 0.0282, Log2FC = 0.1874).

Additionally, the expression of four key downstream genes of the Ras-ERK pathway (<italic>PHLDA1, DUSP4, EPHA2</italic>, and <italic>SPRY4</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Chesnokov, Yadav and Chefetz, 2022</xref>), were found unchanged after IL-6 exposure in both MGLs and NPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). On the other hand, the data suggests that the NPCs might have the potential to react to the TNF-α secreted by MGLs cells, as indicated by the observed upregulation of <italic>TNFAIP3</italic>. In summary, under the conditions tested, forebrain cortical NPCs derived from neurotypical control donors exhibit a negligible transcriptional response to 24-hour IL-6 exposure in co-culture with MGLs.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>The long-term impact of acute NPC-stage IL-6 exposure in terminally differentiated forebrain cortical neurons</title><p id="P36">To evaluate whether IL-6 exposure to MGL-NPC co-cultures, either directly via trans-signalling or indirectly via the response secretome by MGLs, influenced the differentiation trajectories of forebrain NPCs at D18 in co-culture with MGLs, we analysed the relative proportions of cell types using cell-specific markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). Cell populations expressing TUBB3, GFAP and Pax6 were quantified as a percentage of total cells in terminally differentiated cortical neuron cultures at day 50 of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). The results showed that across both treatment groups, 96.66% of all cells were TUBB3+, 17.27% were GFAP+, and 6.38% were Pax6+, consistent with a predominance of neurons in the differentiated cultures. The majority of cells in both treatment groups were TUBB3+/GFAP-/Pax6- (73.43 ± 5.37%), indicating a significant proportion of neurons, followed by cells likely representing foetal astrocytes or radial glia (TUBB3+/GFAP+/Pax6-; 16.72 ± 3.04%) (Dráberová <italic>et al</italic>., 2008). A limited population only expressed Pax6 (TUBB3-/GFAP-/Pax6+ = 2.82 ± 1.00 %), and with minimal co-expression with TUBB3 (TUBB3+/GFAP-/Pax6+ = 3.49 ± 1.05 %) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Notably, there were no significant differences in the proportions of cell types between NPCs exposed to IL-6 and those that were not (two-way ANOVA: treatment F(1,42) = 2.25x10<sup>-7</sup>, p = 0.999; cell-type F(6,42) = 88.04, p &lt; 0.0001; interaction F(1=6,42) = 0.38; p = 0.89). In summary, these findings indicate that NPCs in co-culture with MGLs differentiated into a range of cell types, predominantly post-mitotic cortical neurons, and that IL-6 exposure did not significantly alter their differentiation towards various cell fates.</p><p id="P37">The architecture, number, and source of synaptic connections on neurons critically influence neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Kuljis <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, disruptions in these synaptic properties could be central to the pathogenesis of NDDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bayés <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Südhof, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Mirabella <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). We therefore explored whether changes during the NPC stage, either directly by trans-IL-6 signalling or indirectly via cytokines released from IL-6 stimulated MGLs, could induce alterations in synapses. To investigate this, we quantified the density and abundance (by signal intensity) of both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic puncta along MAP2+ neurites, grown until D50 of differentiation. The choice of synaptic markers was informed by their relevance to synaptic transmission and association with neurodevelopmental disorders such as SZ and ASC. Specifically, we focused on PSD95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), GluN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), and vGlut1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) due to their roles in glutamatergic neurotransmission. Dysregulation in this system has been implicated in the onset of SZ and ASC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Oni-Orisan <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bitanihirwe <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Moghaddam and Javitt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Holloway <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">De Bartolomeis <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Grunwald <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Mirabella <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Additionally, SV2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>) was included due to its reported decrease in individuals with an SZ diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Onwordi <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">2023</xref>). We also assessed GAD67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>), known for its consistently decreased expression in the brains of individuals with psychiatric disorders such as SZ, bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Miyata et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Karolewicz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Hashimoto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Guidotti et al., 2000</xref>). Lastly, Gephyrin was examined due to its association with hemizygous microdeletions in the G-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>), which have been observed in unrelated individuals affected by ASC and SZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Lionel <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). However, under the conditions tested, acute 24hr IL-6 exposure at the NPC stage did not significantly affect the densities, nor the abundance of either pre- or post-synaptic protein expression, as measured by the non-parametric Wilcoxon’s test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>). Furthermore, we investigated the co-localization of pre- and post-synaptic proteins: PSD95 with vGlut1, GluN1 with SV2A, and Gephyrin with GAD67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). The extent of puncta co-localization, interpreted as pre- and post-synaptic connectivity, was quantified and compared between vehicle-treated neurons and those exposed to IL-6. Our results indicate that puncta co-localization was not influenced by early acute IL-6 exposure, as evidenced by the absence of significant differences between the treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H-I</xref>). However, there was clearly extensive donor variance in these measures following exposure to IL-6, likely due individual genotype differences. Hence, we cannot conclusively dismiss the possibility of an effect of IL-6.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S26" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P38">Our study aimed to determine the role of prenatal IL-6 signalling and how it might contribute to the risk of psychiatric disorders with a putative neurodevelopmental origin, by particularly focusing on the interactions between forebrain neural progenitor cells and microglia-like cells derived from hiPSCs. Our findings demonstrated that forebrain NPCs in monoculture can respond to IL-6 via trans-signalling in the presence of a recombinant soluble IL-6 receptor by activating the JAK/STAT pathway, and this response is dose-dependent on the soluble receptor concentration. This finding aligns with earlier observation that NPCs do not respond to IL-6 in monoculture in the absence of exogenous IL-6Ra or hyper-IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Couch <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Sarieva, Hildebrand, <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). We further demonstrated that MGLs secrete soluble IL-6R and other cytokines in response to IL-6, including TNF-alpha, which has been previously identified as a key effector molecule in rodent models of maternal immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Potter 2023</xref>). Contrary to our hypothesis, NPCs displayed only a marginal transcriptional response to IL-6 stimulation when in co-culture with MGLs, with only two genes showing differential expression passing the 5% FDR threshold. This finding particularly contrasts the substantial transcriptional changes observed in MGLs, indicating cell-type specific sensitivities to IL-6 signalling, as previously described in mono-culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Couch <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Moreover, concerning the enduring effects of short-term IL-6 exposure during the NPC stage, our findings revealed no marked changes in the differentiation paths of forebrain NPCs into diverse cell types. This contrasts with earlier findings in hiPSC-derived neuronal cultures that cell-fate acquisition is affected by IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Sarieva, Kagermeier, <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), but noting that Sarieva at colleagues (2023) stimulated their cultures with hyper-IL-6, driving trans-IL6 signalling, for five days. Furthermore, IL-6 exposure did not significantly affect synaptic densities or intensities in post-mitotic forebrain cortical neurons. Regional or species differences in the effects of IL-6 on synaptogenesis may explain why these data conflict with previous research that suggest early IL-6 exposure has the potential to alter synaptogenesis in the hippocampus of a rodent model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Samuelsson <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Mirabella <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). It is important to emphasise that the findings of our study are of relevance primarily to dorsal and ventral forebrain NPCs. Although this study observed no specific subpopulation of NPCs to respond to IL-6 via cis-signalling, it is possible that NPCs and subsequently differentiating post-mitotic neurons from brain regions other than the developing cortex might respond differently, such as in the hippocampus or the midbrain. For example, recent evidence suggests the immortalised human dopaminergic neuronal precursor cell line LUHMES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Lotharius <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) expresses low levels of IL6R, albeit very low compared to microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Nishi <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, there are several reports in the literature on the effects of MIA in rodent models using TLR3 agonists on midbrain dopamine neuron development <italic>in vivo</italic>, which are associated with behavioural effects and impaired cortical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Meyer <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Vuillermot <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Luchicchi <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Purves-Tyson <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Perez-Palomar <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Therefore, we suggest our 2D hiPSC-derived forebrain co-culture model offers a simplistic, reproducible and scalable model that we can use to test hypotheses that NPCs with different regional origins, for example forebrain and midbrain, may show differential responses to IL-6 as a result.</p><p id="P39">We observe a lack of substantial transcriptional and cellular effects in NPCs co-cultured with MGLs and stimulated with IL-6, despite MGLs secreting the soluble IL-6R and other cytokines. Notably, the sIL-6Ra concentration secreted by MGLs in our study was low (0.29 ng/ml), falling below the concentration necessary to trigger STAT3 phosphorylation in NPCs in response to IL-6 and recombinant IL-6Ra (more than 1ng/ml required). Furthermore, the concentration of sIL-6Ra in our co-culture system is lower than that reported in human (adult) CSF under both basal and inflammatory disease states, acknowledging that we lack data on sIL-6Ra levels during human development in either state. Hence, there simply may not have been enough sIL-6Ra secreted by the microglia to initiate trans-signalling in the NPCs. These data highlight the importance of considering the overall human-specific cytokine milieu in our <italic>in vitro</italic> model, and while our iterative study initially focuses on IL-6, future research should explore species differences with other cytokines to better understand the MIA impact on foetal cortical development. Whilst mechanistic animal studies confirm that IL-6 is necessary and sufficient for many of the biological effects of maternal immune activation, the involvement of several other cytokines, including IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Allswede <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), IL-17A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Choi <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>), TNF-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Allswede <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Potter <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), and IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Goines <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">Warre-Cornish <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bhat <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), should not be discounted. The co-culture secretome analysis suggested that TNF-α secreted by microglia following stimulation with IL-6 could act as a potential downstream effector in NPCs. This is supported by the knowledge that NPCs possess receptors for TNF-α (<italic>TNFRSS1A/B)</italic> at the relevant differentiation timepoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Couch <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), and can respond to this cytokine <italic>in vivo</italic> following maternal immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Potter <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, the TNF-α family gene <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> was one of only two genes with differentially increased expression in the NPCs after IL-6 exposure and is known for its role in cytokine-mediated immune responses and was previously reported to be upregulated in neural stem cells infected with ZIKA virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">McGrath <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). The other gene with increased expression in NPCs, <italic>PABPC1</italic>, is involved in ribosomal recruitment and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kawahara <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Apart from TNF-α, the cytokines showing the greatest change in profiler signals following IL-6 stimulation in co-culture were MIP-1α/MIP-1β, RANTES, GROα, and PF4. Yet, RNAseq data from the NPCs reveal that this cell type is not likely to be the target for these cytokines, given they exhibit relatively low expression levels of specific cytokine receptors such as CCR1 and CXCR3 (normalized DESeq2 counts: 1.02 ± 0.05 and 1.85 ± 0.4, respectively) and align with those from previous forebrain transcriptomic sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Nowakowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Polioudakis <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Additionally, co-culturing MGLs with NPCs could induce specific cytokine responses absent in mono-cultures, as VEGF levels have been shown to be higher in co-cultures stimulated with LPS and IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Haenseler <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Future studies should investigate the impact of NPC and MGL co-culture on secreted factors from both cell types. Overall, these data highlight the significance of incorporating microglia in <italic>in vitro</italic> NDD models, but also cell types in addition to NPCs that can respond to the microglial secretome for a more accurate representation.</p><p id="P40">Building on this idea, only MGLs and NPCs were used in the study for simplicity, and the mechanism by which IL-6 confers increased risk for NDDs likely requires additional cell types. Consistent with this view, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Campbell et al. (2014)</xref> identified cell types in mouse cerebrum and cerebellum that are responsive to IL-6 via trans-signalling, which included GFAP-positive astrocytes, Bergmann glia, lectin-bound microglia, and vascular endothelial cells, with scarce presence of IL-6 trans-signalling in neurons. Combining these rodent findings with our human cellular data suggests that IL-6 trans-signalling to neural progenitor cells and neurons may not be the direct, central pathogenic mechanism in the developing forebrain, cerebellum, and cerebrum of both species. This highlights the need for a more complex 3D model, incorporating different regional origins and additional relevant cell types, such as astrocytes, to study the effects of IL-6 on developing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Haddick <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Moreover, while hiPSCs provide a valuable model for studying human neurodevelopment within a human-relevant context at a molecular scale, they do not fully capture the complex interactions between additional higher-level systems seen in vivo, such as the peripheral immune system, placenta and blood-brain barrier, which would be relevant in the context of this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">Zaretsky <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Campbell <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Crockett <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bermick <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Species differences are evident in these interactions. Recent data from a mouse MIA model demonstrated that IL-6 does not pass through the placenta from the dams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bermick <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), whereas IL-6 has been shown to transfer through a healthy-term human placental perfusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">Zaretsky <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). It is more likely that increased maternal prenatal IL-6 triggers a larger pro-inflammatory chain reaction involving multiple cytokines, cell types, and tissues, indirectly increasing IL-6 in the foetal brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Schaer <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). This limitation could be addressed by employing a human-relevant, multi-culture configuration, either in microglial-grafted organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Fagerlund <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Pașca <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Schafer <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) or brain-on-a-chip fluidic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Vila Cuenca <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Pașca <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). These would offer viable methods to examine whether the release of sIL-6Ra, or other cytokines and chemokines from microglia in response to IL-6 can indeed have an impact on the NPC response, via additional cell types.</p><p id="P41">Third, after only 24h of IL-6 stimulation in co-culture, cytokine secretion by MGLs in response to IL-6 response might have been either too weak or short to activate relevant pathways in NPCs. In addition, MGLs and NPCs were not in physical contact with each other, therefore precluding conclusions regarding the effects of IL-6 that may occur in a physical co-culture system due to cell-to-cell contact. Our trans-well co-culture model was designed to test hypotheses relating to secreted factors from the MGLs and avoid potential confounds related to cell sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cadiz <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Akhmetzyanova, Rizvanov and Mukhamedshina, 2024</xref>) in identifying transcriptional effects of IL-6 on MGLs and NPCs in this system. The complexity of a chain of signalling pathways from additional cell types or physical cell connections over a more chronic period may be required to provoke an IL-6 effect on NPC development, which our <italic>in vitro</italic> setting may not entirely replicate, but could be addressed with studies using 2D and 3D cultures in combination with single-cell sequencing. Furthermore, NPCs underwent passaging following IL-6 exposure, potentially biasing the sample towards healthier NPCs, leaving behind the ones most affected by IL-6. Therefore, it is important to consider that IL-6 exposure may have long-term effects on developing NPCs when in contact with hiPSC-derived MGLs, and not subjected to post-stimulation passaging. As a result, our study suggests that physical 2D culture and a more prolonged cytokine exposure remains important to test in order to induce substantial changes in NPCs, such as the 5-day exposure to brain organoids by Sarieva and colleagues (2023). Such extended exposure and longer-term culture could more closely mimic the physiological conditions of a long-term prenatal infection, potentially offering a more realistic model for studying the effects of maternal immune activation on foetal brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Sarieva, Kagermeier, <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P42">Fourth, the noticeable presence of variation between different donor lines may mask detectable differences at an averaged donor level. Our sample size of N=4 donor lines, although in line with recommendations for the minimum sample size in such experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Dutan Polit <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), coupled with the variability in responses generated by each individual donor may well constrain our ability to detect group-level differences. Additionally, the diversity among our donor samples may be influenced by sex, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> PCA, where the sole female line (069_CTF) separates from the three male lines along PC1. The inclusion of only one female line however precludes any conclusion with regard to potential differences in the response to IL-6 stimulation as a function of chromosomal sex (XX vs. XY). Future studies using equivalent numbers of XX and XY donor lines or designs incorporating isogenic lines with different sex chromosome content will be required to address this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Waldhorn <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Taken together, these overall sources of variation are consistent with the known heterogeneity of outcomes in response to maternal immune activation in humans and in rodent models, and that in most cases there is no negative outcome in the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Meyer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Mueller <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the interaction between environment and genetic background needs to be considered, as evidenced by our findings of differential transcriptional response of NPCs from individuals with schizophrenia to IFN-γ stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bhat <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Given the polygenic nature of NDDs and psychiatric disorders, we suggest hiPSC models that retain the genetic background of the donor are ideally placed to test this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Jansen <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Singh <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Trubetskoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). When conducting studies to examine the roles of cytokines on human neurodevelopment <italic>in vitro</italic> using healthy donor lines however, either greater statistical power, or stratification to allow selection of specific individuals to study are critical factors to consider when designing future studies. As such our data may be thought of as part of an iterative process to refine the use of hiPSC models to study how cytokines influence neurodevelopment in health and disease states.</p><p id="P43">Despite the minimal impact of IL-6 stimulation on NPCs within our co-culture system there are clear and replicable effects of IL-6 on hiPSC-derived MGLs that are of relevance and open new avenues for research. For example, data from mice suggests that MIA accelerates the developmental programming of microglia, impairing their intended developmental functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Matcovitch-Natan <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Our previous work demonstrated that the “MIA Poly I:C GD14 P0” module from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Matcovitch-Natan et al. (2016)</xref>, a microglial gene set from newborn pups exposed to Poly I:C on gestational day 14, was the most relevant module overlapping with our upregulated gene set in hiPSC-derived MGL monocultures exposed to IL-6 for 3h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Couch <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Additionally, a recent study that analysed transcriptomes and epigenetic profiles at various developmental stages in both foetal and postnatal human microglia has identified IL-6 as ligand of particular significance in predicting the postnatal microglial transcriptome, indicating that IL-6 may play a role in promoting the development of a mature, postnatal microglial phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Han <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). This raises the idea that the primary mechanism by which IL-6 increases NDD risk prenatally in offspring could be via the alteration of typical developmental functions of microglia following IL-6 exposure. This guides several important questions unaddressed by the present study; (1) are the MGLs in this study are responding to IL-6 through cis- or trans-signalling (2) what causes the functional shift between these two signalling states, and (3) whether and how this signalling state transition operates in the CNS, all of which need to be addressed in future studies. Distinguishing these effects can be carried out in specific studies to block the IL-6 trans-signalling pathway in microglia using a soluble IL-6ST compound and compare functional outcomes. Overall, these aspects represent a critical area for further investigation to understand the complex dynamics of neurodevelopmental changes under maternal immune activation and the influence of IL-6 on NDD risk.</p><p id="P44">In conclusion, our findings show that hiPSC-derived NPCs respond by trans-signalling to IL-6 when sIL-6Ra is present, above a concentration of 1ng/ml, a level not met by hiPSC-derived MGLs from healthy donors <italic>in vitro</italic> and unchanged by acute IL-6 stimulation. Although these MGLs secrete a wide range of other cytokines and chemokines including TNF-α in response to IL-6, the proximal transcriptional and longer-term cellular effects on NPCs were minimal to absent. On the other hand, MGLs in co-culture showed robust transcriptional responses to IL-6 consistent with our prior observations and raising interesting new questions. Based on our observations we suggest that future studies seeking to develop <italic>in vitro</italic> hiPSC models to decipher the effects of IL-6 on human neurodevelopment should focus on incorporating microglia into more complex 3D models containing all relevant glial and neuronal cells that may respond to the microglia secretome. Such experiments should ideally be carried out on appropriate genetic risk backgrounds such as high polygenic risk for schizophrenia, which may reveal important disease-relevant mechanisms. Alternatively individual donors could be selected based on multivariate data from deeply-phenotype birth cohorts to identify cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with risk or resilience to IL-6 exposure during neurodevelopment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="EMS193115-supplement-Supplementary_File.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d20aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge use of King’s Computational Research, Engineering and Technology Environment (CREATE) and are grateful to Dr George Chennell of the Wohl Cellular Imaging Centre at King’s College London for technical support during live imaging.
