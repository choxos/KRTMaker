Here, we investigate whether cytokines regulate NMD activity and identify transcript isoforms targeted in β-cells. A luciferase-based NMD reporter transiently expressed in rat INS1(832/13), human-derived EndoC-βH3 or dispersed human islet cells is used to examine the effect of proinflammatory cytokines (Cyt) on NMD activity. Gain- or loss-of function of two key NMD components UPF3B and UPF2 is used to reveal the effect of cytokines on cell viability and function. RNA-sequencing and siRNA-mediated silencing are deployed using standard techniques. Cyt attenuate NMD activity in insulin-producing cell lines and primary human β-cells. These effects are found to involve ER stress and are associated with downregulation of UPF3B. Increases or decreases in NMD activity achieved by UPF3B overexpression (OE) or UPF2 silencing, raises or lowers Cyt-induced cell death, respectively, in EndoC-βH3 cells, and are associated with decreased or increased insulin content, respectively. No effects of these manipulations are observed on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that Cyt increase alternative splicing (AS)-induced exon skipping in the transcript isoforms, and this is potentiated by UPF2 silencing. Gene enrichment analysis identifies transcripts regulated by UPF2 silencing whose proteins are localized and/or functional in extracellular matrix (ECM) including the serine protease inhibitor SERPINA1/α-1-antitrypsin, whose silencing sensitises β-cells to Cyt cytotoxicity. Cytokines suppress NMD activity via UPR signalling, potentially serving as a protective response against Cyt-induced NMD component expression. Our findings highlight the central importance of RNA turnover in β-cell responses to inflammatory stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>β-cells</kwd><kwd>insulin secretion</kwd><kwd>transcript</kwd><kwd>nonsense-mediated decay</kwd><kwd>RNA decay</kwd><kwd>RNA processing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Inflammatory and glucolipotoxic (GLT) stress causing β-cell failure and destruction <italic>in vitro</italic> differentially regulates hundreds of β-cell transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>).

We also showed that the cytokines-mediated decrease of NMD activity was driven by ER stress and downregulation of UPF3B. Loss-/or gain-of function of NMD activity could be elicited by UPF3B over-expression or UPF2 knockdown, which led to increases in, or slight decreases in, cytokines-induced apoptosis associated with decreased and increased insulin contents, respectively, without affecting GSIS index in EndoC-βH3 cells. Transcriptome profiling indicated a potentiating effect of UPF2 knockdown on Cyt, but not GLT-mediated, NMD activity. Interestingly, this approach identified transcript targets encoding proteins belonging to the extracellular matrix such as α-1-antitrypsin.

Recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) support our apparently discrepant finding regarding the effects of UPF3A overexpression by showing redundancy of UPF3A and UPF3B as modular activators of NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). With these two earlier studies in mind, we cannot rule out the interference of endogenous UPF3A in the actions of UPF3B on NMD in β-cells.</p><p id="P44">We investigated the consequences of NMD activity for pancreatic β-cell function and viability. The increase of NMD activity by UPF3B overexpression induced basal and cytokines-induced cell death in EndoC-βH3 cells, highlighting the role of increased UPF3B level in β-cells. This appears to be relevant for β-cell viability in both normal and inflammatory stress conditions. Similarly, UPF3B knockdown also caused basal cell death in INS1 cells. Hence, basal UPF3A/B levels seem to play crucial roles in the cell viability of β-cells and perturbation of such a controlled level implicates in cell death. On the other hand, the slight protection against cytokines-induced cell death conferred by UPF2 knockdown in EndoC-βH3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5A-i and ii</xref>) and by SMG6 knockdown in INS1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) implies a possibly protective mechanism against cytotoxicity of cytokines in β-cells, irrespective to the outcome cytokines-induced cell death.

This, in turn, may contribute to cytotoxic damage. Consistent with this view, GEA revealed that cytokines deregulate transcripts encoding proteins that localise to and/or function in the extracellular matrix Thus, α-1-antitrypsin knockdown increased the detachment of MIN6 cells and exacerbated Thapsigargin-induced cell death as measured by Propidium-Iodide staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) and in this study increased cytokines-induced cell death in INS1(832/13) cells associated with decreased GSIS index.</p><p id="P46">We speculate that the perturbation of NMD by cytokines leads to increased exon skipping and that this may be part of a feedback loop promoting β-cell plasticity and resilience against cytotoxic cytokines. Future studies will be needed to test this possibility.

Moreover, the constant overexpression of UPF3A and UPF3B may result in cell death as β-cells cannot cope with overwhelming level of these proteins above the basal level. This could explain why UPF3B overexpression reduced the basal cell viability. Further studies should: 1) conduct in vivo experiments to validate the findings observed in vitro and determine if the regulation of NMD in pancreatic ß-cells is consistent across different cell types and conditions, 2) investigate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of NMD in pancreatic β-cells, including the role of specific NMD components and the impact of different stressors on NMD activity, 3) explore the potential therapeutic implications of targeting NMD in the treatment of inflammatory stress in β-cells, including the development of novel drugs or therapies that modulate NMD activity.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Translatability of the findings</title><p id="P49">The findings report NMD involvement in the development of islet autoimmunity and the destruction of pancreatic β-cells in type 1 diabetes as well as islet inflammation in type 2 diabetes.
