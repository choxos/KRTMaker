A major QTL for resistance to <italic>Xtg</italic> was previously identified, but the precise location as well as the genetic factors underlying the resistance are yet to be determined. To this end, we applied a bulked segregant analysis (BSA) approach, using whole-genome deep sequencing of pools of the most resistant and most susceptible individuals of a large (n = 7,484) biparental F<sub>2</sub> population segregating for resistance to <italic>Xtg</italic>. Using chromosome-level genome sequences as references, we were able to define a ∼300 kb region highly associated to resistance on pseudo-chromosome 4. Further investigation of this region revealed multiple genes with a known role in disease resistance, including genes encoding for Pik2-like disease resistance proteins, cysteine-rich kinases, and RGA4- and RGA5-like disease resistance proteins. Investigation of allele frequencies in the pools and comparative genome analysis in the grandparents of the F<sub>2</sub> population revealed that some of these genes contain variants with allele frequencies that correspond to the expected heterozygosity in the resistant grandparent. This study emphasizes the efficacy combining BSA studies in very large populations with whole genome deep sequencing and high-quality genome sequences to pinpoint regions associated with a binary trait of interest and accurately define a small set of candidate genes. Furthermore, markers identified in this region hold significant potential for marker-assisted breeding strategies to breed resistance to <italic>Xtg</italic> in Italian ryegrass cultivars more efficiently.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bulked segregant analysis (BSA)</kwd><kwd>disease resistance</kwd><kwd>bacterial wilt</kwd><kwd><italic>Xanthomonas translucens</italic> pv. <italic>graminis</italic></kwd><kwd>Italian ryegrass</kwd><kwd><italic>Lolium multiflorum</italic> Lam</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Italian ryegrass (<italic>Lolium multiflorum</italic> Lam.) is a widely cultivated forage species, known for its high yield and nutritional value as well as its fast ground cover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Frame, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Humphreys et al., 2010</xref>). As such, it provides an important feed source, as hay or silage, for ruminant livestock production in temperate climates. However, it can be affected by diseases, the most important being bacterial wilt caused by <italic>Xanthomonas translucens</italic> pv. <italic>graminis</italic> (<italic>Xtg</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Egli et al., 1975</xref>). The bacteria mainly penetrate through wounds of the plant and spread in the xylem vessels, disrupting the flow of water and nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Rudolph, 1993</xref>). This results in wilting and yellowing of the leaves, stunted growth and eventually the death of the plant, causing serious yield losses. Such losses are reported to reach up to 40% under unfavorable conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Schmidt and Nuesch, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gondran and Betin, 1989</xref>). Moreover, the global impact of the disease may become more severe due to climate change, which could increase the occurrence of conditions that are favorable to the pathogen, expand its geographical range, or impact host-pathogen interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hunjan and Lore, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Currently, the only efficient, durable, and economically feasible way to manage the disease is to breed for resistant cultivars. So far, breeding efforts to develop <italic>Xtg</italic> resistant cultivars have been based on recurrent phenotypic selection of resistant individuals following infection with <italic>Xtg</italic>. This has led to cultivars with an increased resistance to the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Suter et al., 2021</xref>). However, due to the allogamous nature of ryegrasses, these cultivars are genetically heterogeneous, and classical breeding approaches based on phenotypic observation fail to fix dominant alleles, as they can mask susceptibility alleles which are thus maintained in the population. For example, in recurrent selection of <italic>Festuca pratensis</italic>, some level of resistance to <italic>Xtg</italic> was achieved, but quickly stagnated, and complete resistance could not be attained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Boller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Michel, 2001</xref>). In this objective, genomics-assisted breeding would greatly aid in identifying and incorporating resistance alleles into elite Italian ryegrass cultivars by targeting specific genetic markers associated with resistance, making the breeding process more efficient. However, such methods require a thorough understanding of the disease resistance and its genetic control.</p><p id="P4">With the rapid progress in high throughput sequencing technologies in recent years, determining which genetic loci govern a specific phenotype has become increasingly effective and precise. However, such studies, like genome-wide association studies, commonly rely on obtaining both the genotype and phenotype of a large sample of individuals, ranging from hundreds to thousands, which often results in very high costs and efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Uffelmann et al., 2021</xref>). To reduce costs, bulked segregant analysis (BSA) can be used to identify molecular markers associated with a phenotype of interest in a biparental population using pools of the most extreme phenotypes. The method was first proposed in 1991 and has since undergone significant development in particular thanks to the rise of next generation sequencing (NGS), which allows for high marker densities at a low cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Michelmore et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Li and Xu, 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P5">To statistically determine genetic loci linked to a phenotype of interest, BSA studies generally rely on the ΔSNP index or the G statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Magwene et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Takagi et al., 2013</xref>). However, sequencing data introduces noise associated with many factors, including sequencing errors, varying sequencing coverage or uneven marker density. To reduce this noise, many downstream analyses have focused on developing smoothing methods based on sliding windows. The tricube ΔSNP (t-ΔSNP) index and the G’ statistics, smoothed versions of the ΔSNP index and G statistics, respectively, are based on a weighted average computed by the Nadaraya-Watson tricube smoothing kernel across a sliding window of a set base pair length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Nadaraya, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Watson, 1964</xref>). Furthermore, Euclidean distance (ED)-based methods, as well as their smoothed version, ED<sup>4</sup>, have proven to be very powerful at detecting QTL, even outperforming the previous methods (de la Fuente Cantó and Vigouroux, 2022). The implementation of these statistical methods in BSA studies allows to reliably and precisely identify genetic loci associated with a phenotype of interest.</p><p id="P6">To identify sources of resistance to <italic>Xtg</italic> in <italic>L. multiflorum</italic>, a first study used a segregating F<sub>1</sub> population (hereafter referred to as Xtg-ART) resulting from a cross between an individual of the susceptible cultivar ‘Adret’ and a resistant individual, M2289, from advanced breeding germplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Studer et al., 2006</xref>). This study was the first to identify a major QTL explaining 43 to 84% of phenotypic variation for <italic>Xtg</italic> resistance on linkage group (LG) 4. However, further characterization of the QTL was hindered by the predominantly anonymous markers and the lack of genome sequence information for <italic>L. multiflorum</italic> at the time. Later, the assembly of a draft genome sequence of M2289 allowed to apply a BSA approach using shotgun sequencing of pools of the 44 most resistant and the 44 most susceptible individuals within the Xtg-ART population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Knorst et al., 2018a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">2018b</xref>). This study was able to confirm the presence of the QTL on LG 4 and highlighted the efficacy of BSA in fine-mapping the QTL for resistance. However, the small number of individuals available, together with the low depth of the sequencing output and the fragmented nature of the M2289 draft genome sequence prevented further fine-mapping of the QTL region and determination of the underlying genes. Recently the high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of the cultivar ‘Rabiosa’ for <italic>L. multiflorum</italic> was made available, providing a strong basis for further genomics-based analyses in Italian ryegrass (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_030979885.1/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_030979885.1/</ext-link>). Furthermore, the high-throughput sequencing platforms currently available allow for a high coverage of the whole genome sequence, resulting in high marker densities and more accurate allele frequency estimations, improving the effectiveness and accuracy of BSA studies.</p><p id="P7">The goal of this study was to define candidate genes for resistance to <italic>Xtg</italic> by applying a BSA approach based on high coverage whole-genome sequencing of pools of susceptible and resistant individuals in an F<sub>2</sub> population derived from the Xtg-ART population, hereafter referred to as the Xtg-ART-F<sub>2</sub> population. We aimed at fine-mapping the major QTL on LG 4, identifying candidate resistance genes, and defining markers associated with resistance to be used in marker-assisted breeding.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Resistance to bacterial wilt is segregating in the Xtg-ART-F<sub>2</sub> population</title><p id="P8">The disease progress in the 7,484 Xtg-ART-F<sub>2</sub> individuals in the greenhouse followed the expectations, with first symptoms being visible at 14 days post infection (dpi) and becoming more severe over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Since the natural death of older leaves was challenging to distinguish from <italic>Xtg</italic> symptoms, most healthy plants were assigned a score of two at 21 and 28 dpi. Cutting back the plants after the third scoring allowed to make this distinction between natural leaf senescence and <italic>Xtg</italic> symptoms and at 49 dpi 1,165 (15.5%) plants showed no symptoms, while 1,140 (15.2%) had died. From these two sets of plants, the most resistant and the most susceptible individuals were selected, resulting in a total of 750 resistant plants and 761 susceptible plants that were used to form two pools that were sequenced.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Obtaining chromosome-level genome sequences of the Xtg-ART-F<sub>2</sub> grandparents</title><p id="P9">In order to obtain a chromosome-level genome sequence that is representative of the resistant individuals of the Xtg-ART-F<sub>2</sub> population, the draft genome assembly of the resistant grandparent M2289 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Knorst et al., 2018b</xref>), which consists of 129,579 scaffolds, was anchored to the chromosome-level Rabiosa genome sequence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_030979885.1/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_030979885.1/</ext-link>). A total of 78,219 scaffolds were successfully anchored to the seven pseudo-chromosomes of the Rabiosa assembly, and 3,912 scaffolds from the M2289 assembly were anchored to 829 larger scaffolds that are not anchored to pseudo-chromosomes in the Rabiosa assembly. In addition, 47,448 scaffolds from the M2289 assembly could not be anchored and were excluded from further analysis. This chromosome-level genome sequence of M2289 will hereafter be referred to as “M2289_v2”.</p><p id="P10">To compare M2289_v2 with the genome sequence of the susceptible grandparent of the Xtg-ART-F<sub>2</sub> population, a similar approach was applied to the Adret draft genome assembly, which consists of 117,277 scaffolds, to produce the “Adret_v2” genome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Knorst et al., 2018a</xref>). A total of 72,888 scaffolds were anchored to pseudo-chromosomes, 3,596 scaffolds were anchored to 795 larger scaffolds from the Rabiosa assembly, and 40,793 scaffolds were left untouched.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>A 300 kb region of pseudo-chromosome 4 is highly associated with resistance</title><p id="P11">A total of 606,760 Gb of DNA sequence information was obtained by whole-genome sequencing of the two pools (average = 303,378 Gb per pool), corresponding to an average of 120× coverage of the haploid genome per pool, considering an estimated genome size of 2.5 Gb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Copetti et al., 2021</xref>). After trimming and filtering reads, a total of 490,386 Gb remained (average = 245,193 Gb per pool), corresponding to an average of 98.1× coverage of the haploid genome per pool. The mapping of the reads to the M2289_v2 genome sequence resulted in an average alignment rate of 34.13%. The variant calling yielded a total of 7,965,619 biallelic variants, including 7,068,640 SNPs and 896,979 INDELs. After filtering for total depth and quality, a total of 4,239,024 variants remained for the subsequent analysis. Finally, to have a comparison with a better quality and more complete genome sequence, the Rabiosa genome sequence was also used as a reference, which resulted in an average of 87.77% alignment rate, yielding a total of 18,765,678 biallelic variants, including 15,170,193 SNPs and 3,595,485 INDELs. After filtering, 7,525,443 variants remained for the subsequent analysis.</p><p id="P12">All three approaches used to test the association of each variant to resistance, the |ΔSNP| index, the G value and the ED value, showed a clear association on pseudo-chromosome 4, with a high peak spanning most of the pseudo-chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). However, a high level of noise can be seen, with fluctuations attributable to sequencing errors or the stochastic nature of sequencing. This results in many interspersed regions with high association to resistance, that are unexpected in a biparental population, where a broad peak of association to resistance is expected from a segregation distortion. Consequently, these fluctuations hindered the precise identification of the region where association to resistance was the highest on pseudo-chromosome 4.</p><p id="P13">To increase the signal to noise ratio as well as to refine the peak region, smoothing methods based on sliding windows were applied to obtain the t-|ΔSNP| index, the G’ value and the ED<sup>4</sup> value. These methods effectively reduced noise and allowed to distinguish a clear peak on pseudo-chromosome 4, which exceeded the 99% confidence interval for the t-|ΔSNP| index and the 99% false discovery rate threshold for the G’ value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). With all approaches, the strongest association to resistance was found at a similar location on pseudo-chromosome 4, and no association to resistance was found on any other pseudo-chromosome. With the ED<sup>4</sup> approach, a sharp peak could be seen, spanning approximately from 28,800,000 bp to 28,900,000 bp in the M2289_v2 genome sequence, and this region was selected to be further investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 E, F</xref>). In Rabiosa, similar results were observed, and a sharp peak was observed from approximately 163,280,000 bp to 163,400,000 bp with the ED<sup>4</sup> approach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P14">A BLASTn-based comparison of the annotated gene sequences within these two regions was able to determine that the region identified in Rabiosa corresponded to a portion of the region identified in M2289_v2. For a better comparability of the two regions, the larger region in Rabiosa, corresponding to the M2289_v2 region, was defined, spanning from 163,094,000 bp to 163,410,000 bp and selected for further analysis. These regions were investigated in more detail and revealed a cluster of genes that could potentially be linked to disease resistance.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Multiple candidate resistance genes were found in the candidate region</title><p id="P15">A total of twelve and nine annotated genes, found in the candidate regions of M2289_v2 and Rabiosa, respectively, showed similarity to genes involved in disease resistance, and were defined as candidate genes for resistance to <italic>Xtg</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). These included genes showing similarity to Pik-2-like and resistance gene analog (RGA)4-like disease resistance proteins, as well as two cysteine-rich kinases (CRK) that were found in both genome sequences. The candidate region in the M2289_v2 assembly also contained two RGA5-like disease resistance proteins, while in the Rabiosa assembly, four serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) genes were found. Additionally, in Rabiosa, one gene showed homology to a retrotransposon, and one to a histone deacetylase, which could not be linked to disease resistance. Furthermore, eight and four genes, in M2289_v2 and Rabiosa respectively, could not be annotated as no match to any known gene was found. Moreover, in M2289_v2, the region contained 17 gaps and spanned ∼100 kb, whereas the corresponding region in the Rabiosa assembly spanned ∼300 kb without any gaps. This indicates that additional genes could be present in this region but cannot be found in the M2289_v2 assembly.</p><p id="P16">The Pik-2-like disease resistance protein gene evm.TU.chr4.21718 from Rabiosa was homologous to the region in M2289_v2 where seven Pik-2-like genes were found, indicating that they may correspond to a single gene, homologous to the one found in Rabiosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Additionally, regions displaying homology to the two genes that showed similarity to RGA5-like disease resistance proteins in M2289_v2 were found in Rabiosa, although they were not predicted as genes in the Rabiosa annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Overall, the comparison of these candidate genes between M2289_v2 and Rabiosa, as well as with the updated genome sequence of the susceptible grandparent, Adret_v2, showed that most genes are conserved between the three genome sequences. Still, no homology to the evm.TU.chr4.21738 and evm.TU.chr4.21749 genes from Rabiosa was found in M2289_v2 nor Adret_v2, and homology to evm.TU.chr4.21750 was found only in Adret_v2.</p><p id="P17">A total of 3,213 variants were found in the candidate region using M2289_v2 as a reference, and 3,177 with Rabiosa. Of these, 880 and 1,010, respectively, had a variant that was absent or present in very low frequency in the susceptible pool and the Adret susceptible grandparent, corresponding to an absence or low frequency expected of a dominant resistance allele in a susceptible individual or population. Using M2289_v2 as a reference, 101 of these variants were found in coding sequences of 11 genes, and 54 were found to induce a nonsynonymous amino acid change, in a total of eight genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The allele frequencies in XLOC_000927, XLOC_021628 and XLOC_017025 indicate that these three genes are heterozygous at these loci in the M2289 grandparent. The remaining five genes, however, seem to be homozygous in M2289. With the Rabiosa assembly, 74 variants with a resistance allele were found in a coding sequence, in a total of six genes, and 47 would result in a nonsynonymous amino acid change, found in the same six genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Most of these variants were homozygous in the M2289 resistant grandparent, with only eight being heterozygous in evm.TU.chr421718, evm.TU.chr421747 and evm.TU.chr421750.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">We were able to define a ∼300 kb genome region that was highly associated with resistance to bacterial wilt in <italic>L. multiflorum</italic>. This region contained a small number of candidate resistance genes with known roles in disease resistance. Consistent results were found with three different statistics for BSA data analysis, supporting the robustness of the applied methodology. It also demonstrates the efficacy of BSA based on whole genome sequencing of pools of contrasting phenotypes to identify candidate genes associated with a binary trait of interest in a <italic>L. multiflorum</italic> biparental F<sub>2</sub> population.</p><p id="P19">While previous work based on a first draft of the M2289 genome sequence was able to identify genomic regions associated with resistance mapping to chromosome 4, the very fragmented nature of this genome assembly, as well as the lack of reliable information on the position of each scaffold on chromosomes, did not allow for a precise location of the resistance gene in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Knorst et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Goettelmann et al., 2021</xref>). The recent development of a high-quality chromosome-level genome sequence of Rabiosa allowed to produce the updated chromosome-level genome sequence M2289_v2. Though this genome sequence is still fragmented, it allowed to reliably anchor scaffolds on a pseudo-chromosome, which enabled a clear visualization of the association to bacterial wilt resistance across the genome and allowed to narrow down the location of the QTL on pseudo-chromosome 4. Furthermore, the sliding window-based statistical approaches used in this study required highly contiguous genome sequences and could not have been applied with the M2289 draft genome sequence, in which the largest scaffold is 43,903 bp, much smaller than the window size of one million bp we used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Knorst et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p id="P20">The high population size coupled with a whole-genome sequencing approach at high coverage was able to optimize most of the factors on which the success of BSA studies rely, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Magwene et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">de la Fuente Cantó and Vigouroux, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). In BSA studies that have been performed so far, the sizes of the investigated populations were generally small, often around 200 individuals, though they can range from &lt;100 to &gt;10,000 individuals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). Pool sizes were also variable, ranging from only five individuals per pool to more than 400. In our study, the investigation of a total of 7,484 F<sub>2</sub> individuals, and the selection of 750 and 761 individuals for the resistant and susceptible pool, respectively, is thus relatively high and allowed for both a high detection power and mapping resolution. Another crucial factor for BSA studies is the number of recombination events. This is of particular importance as <italic>Lolium</italic> species have been shown to exhibit a low recombination rate, in particular in chromosome 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kopecký et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">King et al., 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, the use of an F<sub>2</sub> population and the high number of individuals per pool allowed to effectively address this factor.</p><p id="P21">Using both the M2289_v2 and the Rabiosa genome sequences as reference showed consistent results, with the highest association to resistance found in a similar location in both genome sequences. The genes found within the two regions were comparable, both in terms of presence of the genes, as well as their order. Still, some genes found in Rabiosa were not found in M2289_v2. While they may be absent from the M2289 genome, this may also be explained by the fragmented nature of this genome sequence, with many gaps present in the candidate region. These genes may either be missing from the assembly or may not have been correctly anchored when producing the M2289_v2 genome sequence. Furthermore, the Rabiosa genotype shows some susceptibility to <italic>Xtg</italic> and may not contain the resistance source (unpublished data). Therefore, the anchoring of the M2289 genome sequence to Rabiosa may not allow to properly access the resistance source in M2289. In human genetics, where one genome sequence is universally used as a reference, many population-specific DNA sequences were missing from this reference, preventing the identification of genes of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Sherman et al., 2019</xref>). This highlights the need for high-quality, complete genome assemblies that are related to the investigated population in association studies. Therefore, obtaining the complete DNA sequence of resistant individuals at the candidate region would be crucial to accurately determine genes that could be responsible for resistance to <italic>Xtg</italic>.</p><p id="P22">Nonetheless, the present study was able to identify multiple genes that are known to be involved in disease resistance. The most interesting candidates within the genome region associated with <italic>Xtg</italic> resistance include XLOC_000927, XLOC_021628 and evm.TU.chr4.21718, annotated as Pik-2-like disease resistance proteins. Pik proteins are nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins that were shown to be involved in resistance to many strains of rice blast (<italic>Magnaporthe grisea</italic>), recognizing the AVR-Pik proteins from the pathogen and triggering a specific defense response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Ashikawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). However, the evm.TU.chr4.21718 gene from Rabiosa showed homology to the M2289_v2 region containing seven genes annotated as Pik-2-like disease resistance proteins, suggesting these seven genes may correspond to a single gene in M2289_v2. The prediction of multiple smaller genes at this locus in M2289_v2 is likely due to the fragmented nature of the genome sequence, since this gene region is found on three separate scaffolds in the original draft assembly, from which the annotation was produced. Another candidate is XLOC_017025, annotated as a cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase (CRK) 6. These proteins are transmembrane proteins involved in the detection of biotic and abiotic stresses, leading to programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chen et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the overexpression of <italic>CRK6</italic> and other <italic>CRK</italic> genes led to an enhanced activation of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity and some CRK have been shown to mediate pattern-triggered immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ederli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Yeh et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, evm.TU.chr4.21747 and evm.TU.chr4.21750, two candidate genes of the serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) superfamily, were found. SERPINs act on many cell processes, and some members of the family have been shown to have a role in disease resistance in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> L.) by inhibiting proteinases from the pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Pekkarinen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Laluk and Mengiste, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Quilis et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, while the allele frequencies of variants found in these genes were not in line with the expected heterozygous frequency in the M2289 parent, the candidate region also contained genes encoding for CRK8, a member of the CRK family like CRK6. Additionally, two other SERPINs in Rabiosa, that could be involved in resistance were also found. Lastly, the candidate region also contained genes of the RGA4- and RGA5-like protein families. These NLR proteins act together in mediating disease resistance to <italic>M. grisea</italic> in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Césari et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P23">The identified candidate region provides valuable insight into the potential loci responsible for resistance to <italic>Xtg</italic>. Interestingly, this region contains mostly genes with known functions in disease resistance. As such genes are often found in clusters containing other resistance genes as well as paralogs resulting from the duplication and divergence of some genes, it is plausible that multiple genes within this region could play a role in resistance to <italic>Xtg</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Michelmore and Meyers, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sekhwal et al., 2015</xref>). This emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive overview of the genes present in the candidate region in resistant individuals to better understand the mechanisms involved in resistance to <italic>Xtg</italic>.</p><p id="P24">Ultimately, this study allowed to identify genetic variants that were highly associated with resistance to <italic>Xtg</italic> and could be used as diagnostic markers for marker-assisted selection. In wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.), markers associated with the <italic>Fhb1</italic> QTL for resistance to <italic>Fusarium</italic> head blight are routinely used in breeding programs, significantly improving resistance to the disease in new cultivars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Anderson et al., 2007</xref>). In rice, marker-assisted selection allowed the introgression of the <italic>Xa38, Xa21</italic> and <italic>xa13</italic> resistance genes against the bacterial blight pathogen <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic>, as well as the <italic>Pi2</italic> and <italic>Pi54</italic> resistance genes against rice blast caused by <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, into elite rice cultivars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Swathi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Yugander et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sagar et al., 2020</xref>). Although further validation is necessary to confirm their effectiveness, the identified variants hold significant potential as molecular markers to be used in marker-assisted breeding applications, laying the foundations for an efficient selection of bacterial wilt resistance in Italian ryegrass cultivars.</p><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="S9"><title>Plant material, bacterial material, inoculation</title><p id="P25">A total of 143 F<sub>1</sub> individuals from the Xtg-ART population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Studer et al., 2006</xref>) were planted in isolation tents for a polycross in late summer of 2017 and an average of 6,000 seeds were harvested from each F1 plant in early summer of 2018.

This showed that the peak region in Rabiosa corresponds to a subset of the region identified in M2289_v2. For a better comparison, the larger region in Rabiosa corresponding to the region in M2289_v2 was selected, and the list of genes appended accordingly.
