Monomeric IgG must oligomerize to activate complement via the hexameric C1q complex, and hexamerizing mutants of IgG appear as promising therapeutic candidates. However, structural data have shown that it is not necessary to bind all six C1q arms to initiate complement, revealing a symmetry mismatch between C1 and the hexameric IgG complex, which has not been adequately explained. Here we use DNA nanotechnology to produce specific nanostructures to template antigens, and thereby control IgG valency. These DNA nano-templated IgG complexes can activate complement on cell-mimetic lipid membranes, which enabled us to determine the effect of IgG valency on complement activation without the requirement to mutate antibodies. We investigated this using biophysical assays together with 3D cryo-electron tomography. Our data revealed that the cleavage of complement component C4 by the C1 complex is proportional to the number of antigens. Increased IgG valency also translated to better terminal pathway activation and membrane attack complex formation. Together, these data provide insights into how nanopatterning antigen-antibody complexes influence the activation of the C1 complex and suggest routes to modulate complement activation by antibody engineering. Furthermore, to our knowledge this is the first time DNA nanotechnology has been used to study the activation of the complement system.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DNA nanotechnology</kwd><kwd>Immunology</kwd><kwd>Complement</kwd><kwd>CryoEM</kwd><kwd>Tomography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Antibodies (Abs) are important effector molecules of the human immune system. Upon binding to antigens, Abs initiate numerous immune responses, ranging from antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, to activation of the classical complement pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Complement forms part of the humoral innate immune response, and is involved with immune defense against invading pathogens, as well as clearance of cellular debris.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> Activation of the classical pathway of complement occurs when the first complement component, the C1 complex, binds to antigen-bound Abs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). The C1 complex comprises C1q, which has the ability to bind Abs via the globular head domain (gC1q), and two serine proteases, C1r and C1s, that form a C1r2s2 heterotetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> Binding of C1q to Abs causes activation of C1r and C1s, which proceeds to cleave soluble C4 to form C4b, an opsonin that covalently associates with nearby molecules and membranes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> Some C4b is bound by C2, which is then also cleaved by C1s to form the C4b2b (formerly C4b2a) complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> C4b2b is a C3 convertase, an enzyme complex that enables complement cascade progression by cleaving C3, resulting in coverage of membranes with multiple covalently-linked opsonins, the release of anaphylatoxins, and formation of the terminal-pathway membrane attack complex (MAC), a pore that perforates the cell membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup></p><p id="P3">The classical pathway can be activated by antigen-bound immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM Abs. IgM circulates in human serum as a pre-formed pentamer or hexamer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> but IgG exists as a monomer and oligomerization of IgG Abs has been shown to be a requisite for complement activation, with two or more Abs required for C1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> More recently, it has been shown that IgG Abs oligomerize via non-covalent interaction between the fragment crystallizable (Fc) regions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and this has been exploited to develop mutants of IgG subclass 1 with enhanced oligomerization potential that are able to activate complement more effectively than wild-type IgG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> This was achieved by forming hexameric Fc-platforms, to which the C1 complex binds. C1q is a disulfide-linked complex with six flexible arms that bind to the hexameric Fc platform. There is therefore a symmetry match between the Ab-binding C1q complex and the Fc platform. However, structural data have shown that not all C1q arms bind to the hexameric Ab complex,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> with four or five arms frequently bound instead of all six (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Furthermore, IgM exists preferentially as a pentamer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> but both pentameric and hexameric IgM can bind and activate C1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> These observations reveal a symmetry mismatch between C1 binding and the activating Ab complex, which has not been adequately explained.</p><p id="P4">Formation of these hexameric platforms is reliant upon the ability of the IgG monomers to bind to antigens at a spacing that provides the means to then form Fc-mediated complexes. This in turn depends on the antigen concentration and proximity, as well as membrane fluidity, epitope location, and IgG subclass. These variables have made it difficult to directly determine the effect of Ab valency on complement activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P5">To explore how Ab binding influences complement activation, we use DNA nanotechnology to control antigen valency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). DNA can be designed to self-assemble into nanoscale shapes that are chemically accessible, which allows nanometer control over the spacing of functional groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> DNA nanostructures have been previously used to template antigens to determine the effect that spacing and valency have on bivalent Ab binding efficiency with respect to Ab affinities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> However, it has not been used to induce, measure, or control complement activation.</p><p id="P6">Here, we use DNA nanostructures to pattern antigens with defined valencies that enable us to template Ab complexes and assess the effect of valency on complement activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d,e</xref>). Biophysical characterization of Ab binding and complement initiation revealed that pre-formed Ab complexes activated complement to a greater extent than the same number of Abs left un-patterned. Applying these to liposomal cell mimetics allowed us to assess the degree of membrane rupture caused by complement-mediated MAC pore formation. Furthermore, we augmented these biophysical assays with cryo-electron tomography visualization of DNA nanostructure-mediated complement activation on lipid bilayers in non-purified human serum. Together, these data provide insights into how the C1 complex is activated by nanopatterned antigen-Ab complexes and suggest routes to modulate complement activation by Ab engineering. Furthermore, this research highlights several important caveats that must be taken into consideration for bio-functional DNA nanostructure design before they can be used to modulate extracellular immune system pathways.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>DNA nanostructure design and characterization</title><p id="P7">DNA nanostructures were designed to display antigens at specific locations. We used the double-decker tile (DDT) lattice design from Majumder <italic>et al.</italic> as inspiration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> which comprises rigid arms formed from four interconnected double-stranded DNA helices placed on a 2 × 2 grid held together at a central hub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2a</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1a</xref>). These arms are symmetric, which helps increase the folding yield.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> The DDT design is low-profile, with only ~4 nm height contributed by the two stacked DNA double helices, and the arms are relatively flexible in-plane, which may aid the formation of Ab complexes. The central hub of the design was modified to generate individual tiles containing one (DDT1), two (DDT2), three (DDT3), four (DDT4), five (DDT5) or six (DDT6) arms each comprised of eight different ssDNA strands (S<sub>1-8</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2b,c</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), with two “core” strands that template the number of arms (S1 and S2), and six “staple” strands, which form the double-decker arms (S<sub>3-8</sub>). The sticky ends of each arm, present in the lattice-forming DDT design,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> were removed to inhibit lattice formation (strands labelled “blunt”; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Hinges connecting each arm to a central hub comprised various lengths of unpaired thymine (T) bases at the bending point of the core strands S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>, which were specific for each design and required by the DNA geometry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> For DDT1 and DDT2 (no bend), no extra Ts were added, whereas three, four, five and seven Ts were added for DDT3 (120° bend), DDT4 (90° bend), DDT5 (72° bend) and DDT6 (60° bend), respectively. To generate DDT1, strands S<sub>3</sub> and S<sub>4</sub> were redesigned to form intra-arm base pairs, instead of mediating inter-arm binding, which required the addition of 9 Ts to these strands to allow the 180° bend required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The antigen, 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP), was incorporated within the S<sub>5</sub> strand during synthesis such that it was exposed on the upper face of the DDT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1a,b</xref>), known as DNP-DDT1-6 henceforth. The S<sub>5</sub> strand is present and sequence-invariant in all DDT designs. The antigen was placed 6 nm along each DDT arm, as measured from the middle of the nanostructure, yielding antigen-antigen distances of 12, 12, 11, 10, and 9 nm for DDT2, DDT3, DDT4, DDT5 and DDT6, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). To activate complement, only one fragment antigen-binding (Fab) domain of the bivalent Ab complex must bind to antigens in order to display the binding site for C1q.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> Here, we use human anti-DNP IgG Abs, which are well known to activate complement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup></p><p id="P9">To bind the DDT1-6 to liposomes, the S<sub>8</sub> strand on the bottom side of the tiles was modified during synthesis to display a 3’ cholesterol group on a tetra-ethylene glycol (TEG) linker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1a,c</xref>); DNA nanostructures containing cholesterol are labelled DDT1-6-Chol. A positive control comprised a single ssDNA strand modified with both DNP and cholesterol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1d Table S1</xref>). This bifunctional strand was synthesized with a 3’ cholesterol group and a 5’ amine group, which was chemically conjugated to a DNP moiety (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref> for details).</p><p id="P10">DNA nanostructures were folded using thermal annealing, which was monitored using agarose gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1e,f</xref>). The gel revealed the presence of clear bands corresponding to the folded structures, with minimal unpaired strands at lower molecular weights. Due to the small size of the antigen compared to the overall size of the DNA nanostructure, there was no apparent shift in gel mobility in the presence of DNP. However, the increasing number of arms in each design resulted in clear shifts in both agarose gel mobility and SEC retention volumes, with the main peak of DDT6 eluting at ~0.95 ml and DDT1 eluting at ~1.25 ml, with the remaining designs eluting in between in the expected order. SEC also confirmed the high purity of the folded nanostructures, with a low proportion of unpaired strands eluting at higher retention volumes (~1.73 ml; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1f</xref>). Consequently, we used the folded DDT nanostructures without further purification. Next, the correct folding of the DDT designs was assessed using negative stain transmission electron microscopy (EM). DDT1-6 were readily identifiable in both electron micrographs and class averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2d</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2a</xref>). These revealed discrete nanostructures with the correct number of arms, and class averages show the limited in-plane flexibility of the rigid arms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Binding antibodies to DNA nanostructures</title><p id="P11">The DDT nanostructures were designed to be used as platforms to bind Abs with distinct valencies.

Agarose gel electrophoresis showed the appearance of bands and smears with lower motility only in the presence of DNP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3a</xref>), indicating Ab binding to DNP-DDTs. To improve our understanding of Ab binding, we performed SEC on DDT nanostructures ± DNP and ± Abs, which revealed Ab binding to all DDT designs only in the presence of all required components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3b</xref>).</p><p id="P12">SEC profiles monitored at 230 nm revealed two prominent peaks, labelled 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>).

In the presence of DNP conjugated to the DNA nanostructures, the intensity of peak 1 increases, whilst that of peak 2 decreases, indicating binding of Abs to DNP-DDT designs (<italic>Ab-DDT</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), and a concomitant reduction in free Abs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Pre-patterning antibody complexes using DNA nanostructures enhances complement initiation</title><p id="P13">To monitor DNA nanostructure mediated C1 binding and activation of the C1r2s2 serine proteases, we followed complement binding and deposition onto liposome surfaces, which act as cell membrane mimetics. Normal human serum (NHS) was used as a source of complement components. To determine the stability of the DDT nanostructures in the presence of NHS, we incubated DDT6 with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 10% NHS over a period of 14 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). No difference between the samples in the presence or absence of NHS was apparent, indicating long-term stability of these nanostructures in NHS.</p><p id="P14">DDT6-Chol ± DNP (100 nM final DNP concentration; 16.6 nM DDT6 concentration), and with an excess of anti-DNP IgG Abs (650 nM final concentration) where indicated, were incubated with liposomes and subsequently cooled to 4°C. Ice-cold NHS (10% v/v final concentration), which contains all of the relevant complement components, was then added where indicated. At 4°C, the C1 complex is able to bind to Abs and cleaves C4, but the pathway does not progress beyond C4b deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> Liposomes, and any bound material, were then isolated from soluble material by centrifugation.</p><p id="P15">Silver-stained polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was used to monitor binding or deposition of proteins and DNA nanostructures onto the liposomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4a</xref>). Gels showed minimal binding of NHS components to liposomes without a source of antigens present (<italic>Lipos + NHS</italic>). This minimal background binding might be caused by incomplete washing of the liposomes after centrifugation. In contrast, extensive protein binding was observed in the presence of the positive control (<italic>+ control</italic>), which comprised a DNA strand modified with both 3’ cholesterol and 5’ DNP. DDT6-Chol was revealed as an isolated band that co-purified with the liposomes, indicating successful binding to the lipid membrane. When incubated with Abs, but without DNP antigens, DDT6-Chol showed minimal background binding of serum proteins. Similarly, as long as Abs were omitted, only a negligible amount of protein bound to the liposome in the presence of NHS, again likely caused by incomplete washing, and compared with positive control the bands are faint. In contrast, DNP-DDT6-Chol (i.e., DDT6 modified with DNP antigens and containing cholesterol) showed co-purification of Abs with the liposomes, indicating DNA-mediated Ab binding to the liposome membrane.</p><p id="P16">In the presence of DNP-DDT6-Chol, Abs and NHS, extensive protein binding was apparent on the liposome surfaces, indicating successful DNA nanostructure mediated complement activation. Some proteins were also present in samples without Abs but in the presence of DNP-DDT6-Chol and NHS. Here, we also presume this is due to incomplete washing of the liposomes after centrifugation. To verify that we are observing the predicted proteins bound to our liposomes, we performed western blotting for the relevant components; IgG Abs, C1q, and C4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). Each time, the blot was stripped before detection of the next target (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4b-d</xref>). Clear anti-DNP IgG Abs binding to the positive control and DNP-DDT6-Chol was visible, confirming that the DNA nanostructure was bound to the liposome and able to bind Abs. A small amount of C1q was detected bound to liposomes without Abs on DDT6-Chol ± DNP, but there was no C4 visible, indicating non-activated C1 presumably associating weakly to the DNP-DNA nanostructures or liposomes alone. Overlaying the detection of Abs, C1q, and C4 revealed binding of all three under only two of the conditions; the positive control (<italic>+ control</italic>) and the final lane containing DNP-DDT6-Chol, Abs and NHS with liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4b-d</xref>).

DDT1-6-Chol ± DNP were bound to liposomes before incubation with Abs and NHS at 4°C and purified as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4d</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4e-h</xref>). Silver-stained gel electrophoresis showed the same result for each DNA nanostructure; proteins bound to the surface of liposomes could only be detected if DDTs contain cholesterol and DNP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4e</xref>). We used western blotting to verify that the detected bands were Abs, C1 and C4, which showed copurification of all three components with liposomes for DDT1-6-Chol only in the presence of DNP antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4e-h</xref>). Densitometry of the bands was used to determine the effect of Abs valency on C4b deposition. Density values were normalized for Ab concentration in order to directly compare the ability of preformed antigens to activate C1 and stimulate deposition of C4b. This revealed that the amount of C4b deposition was clearly affected by pre-patterning the antibodies into complexes, with a clear correlation of increasing C4b deposition with increasing Ab valency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>DNA nanostructure-templated antibody complexes activate complement</title><p id="P18">To enable in situ monitoring of complement activation by DNA nanostructure-mediated Ab complex formation, we bound DDT1-6-Chol to liposome surfaces.

By using differential combinations of mutations, Strasser et al. could modulate IgG mediated complement activation based on oligomeric state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> These data indicated that a minimum of four C1q binding sites were required for complement activation, in contrast to previous data, which showed that two Abs is sufficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> This difference may be due to the extensive mutations required to induce protein oligomeric state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup></p><p id="P24">By using DNA as a nanopatterning scaffold, we were able to template wild-type (non-mutated) IgG Abs on DNA nanostructures with distinct valencies, and then scan valency space with fewer structural perturbations than Abs engineering requires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Our DNA nanostructure design was chosen to be flexible and low-profile to minimize any structural perturbations besides the antigen valency. Previously, antigens have been nanopatterned on rigid DNA nanostructures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> but these, even when placed on an “idealized” hexameric array, were not shown to activate complement. Whether this is due to some inherent flexibility required for C1 activation, or due to the much larger DNA design, is currently not known. Complement activation by the C1 complex is induced upon C1q binding, which leads to the activation of C1r within the heterotetrametric C1r2s2 platform. It is not yet known if C1r activation proceeds via auto-activation (i.e., C1r cleaves the adjacent C1r within the same C1r2s2 platform), or cross-activation (C1r cleaves the C1r of an adjacent C1 complex). By minimizing the size of our DNA nanotemplates, we have allowed either to occur and not inhibited cross-activation; indeed, the DNA nanostructures are able to diffuse along the lipid membrane, and this will allow lateral C1 interactions that have been previously posited to be present during C1 activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, C1 produces multiple copies of C4b, an opsonin that is deposited on the lipid membrane,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> which then binds to C2 before cleavage by C1s to form the C4b2b C3 convertase enzyme. This means that C4b must be able to diffuse away from the C1 complex to both function as an opsonin and to allow binding of C2 before cleavage. Here again, the small size of our DDT nanostructures minimizes steric perturbations to this enzymatic reaction. In contrast, larger DNA nanostructures may limit or even inhibit these requirements, leading to stalled complement progression and no MAC pore formation.</p><p id="P25">Clearly, the impact of the shape and chemistry of DNA nanostructures are important parameters to take into consideration when designing DNA nanotemplates. For use in biological or biophysical assays, the scalability and variability of the DNA design should also be taken into account. The DDTs utilized in this study were designed such that the modifications required to change the antigen valency were minimal. Unlike nanostructures based on DNA origami, DDTs are composed of 8 small single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides and do not require a ssDNA scaffold. They are also based on a symmetric design,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> which greatly reduces the number of strands required. Furthermore, the DNP antigen was incorporated during oligo synthesis specifically at the location required for Ab binding, and this strand was present in all DDT designs. This has two benefits: the financial outlay is reduced, as most of the same strands can be used for each design; and there are minimal differences between the designs (only two of the 8 strands were altered for each design; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), which allowed for more robust comparisons between their complement-activating abilities.</p><p id="P26">Comparing the DDT designs revealed that C4b deposition is proportional to the number of antigenic arms within the DDT designs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), and MAC pore formation increased concurrently with the number of antigenic arms present within the DDT designs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), although this was less apparent than for C4b deposition. DDT1 was the worst construct for both C4b deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and MAC pore formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), presumably due to the requirement of IgG Abs to bind to each DDT1 individually, and then rely on lateral diffusion to form higher order Ab oligomers that are capable of C1 binding and activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> DDT2 was also poor at C4b deposition; indeed, C4b deposition improved with higher valency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>). However, this trend did not translate to MAC pore formation. Between 25–50 nM, DDT2-6 all performed similarly well at membrane lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). This discrepancy may be caused by a reduced ability of C1 to activate on nanopatterns with lower valency, but still produce sufficient C4b to initiate the complement cascade. This proteolytic cascade results in a positive feedback loop that may mask the differences in C4b deposition by amplifying the cascade such that equivalent numbers of MAC pores are formed, leading to equivalent liposome lysis. From 25 nM DNP and above, DDT2-6 were able to lyse liposomes, whereas DDT1 needed at least 50 nM DNP to achieve lysis. Interestingly, at 25 nM as well as 50 nM, all five designs (DDT2-6) were broadly similar in their membrane lysing abilities, indicating that two proximal antigens are indeed sufficient to display Abs in a conformation able to activate complement, which is in agreement with previous data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup></p><p id="P27">Why two antigens are sufficient to activate the classical complement pathway and lyse liposomes is not yet clear. We cannot exclude the possibility that two antibody-bound DNA nanostructures are able to align and enable C1 binding. Indeed, this possibility was included in the design to allow cross-activation of the C1 complexes, as described above. C1 binding to multiple DNA nanostructure-templated Abs complexes is presumably how DNP-DDT1-Chol is able to activate complement above 50 nM concentration. However, below 50 nM, DDT1 is not able to activate complement, indicating that at this concentration the other designs are also sufficiently separated such that only one C1 complex binds per DNA nanostructure. Above 50 nM, DDT6 was superior to DDT5 at liposome lysis, with DDT2-4 achieving similar levels of lysis. Presumably, DDT6-templated hexameric antibody platforms can bind all 6 arms of the C1q complex to achieve maximal C1 activation. Previous models of C1 activation have utilized either a “compaction” of the C1q arms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> or a sliding motion within the C1r2s2 platform upon C1q binding to antibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> To understand the structural biology of DNA nanostructure mediated complement activation we attempted to image the samples using cryo-electron tomography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Tomographic volumes revealed the C1 complexes binding to DNA nanostructure-templated antibody platforms, although we were unable to resolve a 3D map of the entire complex. We posit that this was due to the flexibility of the system; previous maps have been hampered by flexibility and therefore only partially resolved,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and we have added a layer of complexity with the addition of flexible DNA nanostructures. Nevertheless, we were able to image stepwise reconstitution of liposome-bound DDT6-chol, Abs binding to DNP-DDT6-chol, and C1 complex association to the DNA nanostructure-templated Ab complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Our work represents the first time that DNA nanostructure-templated antibodies have been used to activate the complement system. By varying the valency of the nanotemplates, we could control the geometric parameters of complement activation. Recent work has shown that higher Fc platforms behave differently,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> with taller IgG3 complexes better able to activate complement than shorter IgG. The work described herein shows a route to explore this further, by systematically varying the height of the initiating complex via the use of DNA templates of a defined height. This may lead to a greater understanding of how the epitope location relates to complement activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup></p><p id="P29">We also discovered a correlation between antibody valency and C4b deposition, which implies a potential mechanism to switch complement from an inflammatory response to silent clearance.
