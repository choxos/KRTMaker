While spatial encoding has been extensively investigated, how the vH activity is tuned to emotional states, e.g. to different anxiety levels, is not well understood. We developed an adjustable linear track maze (aLTM) for mice with which we could induce a scaling of behavioral anxiety levels within the same spatial environment. Using <italic>in vivo</italic> single-unit recordings, optogenetic manipulations and the application of a convolutional classifier, we examined the changes and causal effects of vH activity at different anxiety levels. We found that anxiogenic experiences activated the vH and that this activity scaled with increasing anxiety levels. We identified two processes that contributed to this scaling of anxiety-related activity: increased tuning and successive remapping of neurons to the anxiogenic compartment. Moreover, optogenetic inhibition of the vH reduced anxiety across different levels, while anxiety-related activity scaling could be decoded using a convolutional classifier. Collectively, our findings position the vH as a critical limbic region that functions as an ‘anxiometer’ by scaling its activity based on perceived anxiety levels. Our discoveries go beyond the traditional theory of cognitive maps in the hippocampus underlying spatial navigation and memory, by identifying hippocampal mechanisms selectively regulating anxiety.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ventral hippocampus</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>anxiety levels</kwd><kwd>scaling of neural activity</kwd><kwd>rate remapping</kwd><kwd>recruitment of neurons</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Anxiety is an evolutionary conserved mental and emotional state, underscoring its crucial role in the survival of organisms facing perilous situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Anxiety is characterized by the anticipation of potentially harmful events leading to an attentional bias towards threatening stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). As anxiety prepares an animal or human to face environmental challenges, the level of threat has to be carefully interpreted to support adaptive behavior. An altered perception of negative emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) might contribute to persistent fear and/or chronic anxiety disorders which pose significant personal and societal burdens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) affecting more than 300 million people worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). As treatments are available but generic and partially ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), there is an urgent need to understand the neurobiological basis of anxiety in more details. Previous studies have implicated areas of the limbic system including the amygdala, prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus in the generation of emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). But the precise brain region where variations in anxiety levels, and not just anxiety <italic>per se</italic>, are represented and computed remains elusive. We hypothesized that the hippocampus could play an important role in processing different anxiety levels as it is a key structure involved in learning and compares previously stored information (memories) with the current contextual information to generate cognitive maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Along the septotemporal or long axis of the hippocampus, differences in synaptic connectivity and molecular expression have been found, inferring functional subdivisions within the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Studies investigating neural activity patterns and selective lesions of the vH provide evidence, from rodents to its homologue in humans (i.e. the anterior hippocampus), on the role of the vH in the processing of threatening stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). In rodents, anxiety has been frequently studied in mazes such as the elevated plus maze (EPM) which elicit innate anxiety of height and openness as the animals explore the open compartments of the mazes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). vH anxiety neurons, i.e. pyramidal neurons that are activated in the open arms of the EPM, have been linked to anxiety-related behavior through the routing of anxiety-related information to the prefrontal cortex or the lateral hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). If and how the activity level of vH neurons relates to the level of perceived anxiety on the EPM is unclear as the precise quantification of emotional states and incentives of animals on an EPM is difficult to assess due to the free exploration and trial-free nature of the task. Furthermore, the specific spatial compartments are inherently linked to the emotional states. Because of such spatial embedding of non-spatial information in many such tasks, there is an ongoing discussion on how much non-spatial information, such as emotions, are actually defined by a spatial framework or can be encoded independently in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>).</p><p id="P3">To address the nature of anxiety coding in the vH, we developed a linear track maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) that could be gradually adjusted to elicit different anxiety levels to an open and elevated compartment within the same spatial environment. With this fully automated adjustable linear track maze (aLTM), we could overcome some of the rigidities and difficulties of the EPM allowing us to define trials and achieve a scaling of anxiety levels while recording and manipulating the activity of neurons in the vH.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p id="P4">Male C57BL6/J mice (N = 28) aged 4-6 months (Janvier Labs, France) were group housed with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water in a temperature-controlled room on a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Following surgery, mice recovered for at least 21 days. Behavioral experiments were conducted in the light phase and mice were food deprived to reach 90% and not less than 85% of the baseline weight (= average weight of 3 consecutive days prior to the experiment day). All experimental protocols adhered to the guidelines set forth by the Animal Welfare Office at the University of Bern and received approval from the Veterinary Office of the Canton of Bern.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Surgical procedures</title><p id="P5">18 mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Attane, Provet, induction 4% in oxygen at a flow rate of 1L/min in anesthetic box, maintenance of the anesthesia based on 1.5-2% of isoflurane in oxygen at a flow rate of 0.8 L/min during the entire surgery) and body temperature was maintained at 37°C with a temperature controller (Harvard Apparatus). Analgesia was administered upon induction and if needed for 3 days post-operation (Carprofen, 2-5 mg/kg subcutaneous). The incision site was infiltrated with lidocaine (2%, Sintetica). Implants were secured to the skull using light-cured dental adhesive (Kerr, OptiBond Universal) and dental cement (Ivoclar, Tetric EvoFlow).

Bilateral infusion of either ssAAV5-CamKIIα-eArchT3.0-EYFP or ssAAV5-CamKIIα-EYFP (ETH Zurich Viral Vector Facility) was immediately followed by optic fibers implantation (200 μm core, 0.37 numerical aperture, Thorlabs) above the vH at the following coordinates: AP: -3.08 mm, ML: ±3 mm, DV: -3.75 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The optic fiber implants were fixed to the skull with stainless steel screws, resin-based dental cement (A1 Tetric EvoFlow, Ivoclar Vivadent) and light-cured dental adhesive (Kerr, OptiBond Universal).

The laser was triggered automatically when the mouse’s body center was detected inside the second half of the transition and was turned off as the mouse’s body center was detected in the openable compartment using the ANY-maze animal tracking software.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Surgery for <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiological recordings</title><p id="P8">6 mice were implanted with a custom-made microdrive (Axona Ltd.) containing 8 independently moveable tetrodes made of four gold-plated (NanoZ, Multi Channel Systems) twisted tungsten microwires (12.7 μm inner diameter, California Fine Wire Company, impedances &lt; 150 kΩ). Microdrives were lowered to the vH.

A custom made automatic door (Stepper driver ROB-12859, SparkFun Electronics; Cypress Semiconductor Corp; Switch snap, C&amp;K) in the closed part was built in order to break stereotypic behaviors and create a safe environment for resting in-between sessions without any interference from the experimenter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Each different anxiety configuration was presented twice with more anxiogenic or less anxiogenic configuration orders at 50 Lux lighting conditions. Scrambled configuration experiments were performed in the following order: LA-VLA-HA-NA-VHA-MA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Figure 2</xref>). For each experiment the mouse was first placed into the closed compartment with the door closed for 300 seconds for habituation and rest. Then the door was opened and the mouse was free to initiate a trial or not. A trial is considered for every trajectory that the mouse performed going from the first half of the maze to the second half and came back to the first half. If the mouse explored the second half of the maze (the openable compartment) and returned to the closed part, the door would be closed for a random time of 10-40 seconds to break stereotypic locomotion and allow the experimenter to place the reward in the random spot in the second anxiogenic part of the maze. For each configuration, the duration that the mouse could run trials lasted 500 seconds. In a 2-minute break between each configuration, the mice rested in the closed compartment with the door closed. In the novel configuration, a control NA session would be compared to a ‘novel’ configuration (300s rest + 500s with trials) where the walls in the openable part would be replaced by walls decorated with stripes of a different color (yellow stripes) and different texture (tape) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> right).</p><p id="P11">For anxiety testing, every mouse had been challenged up to 4 times with an interval of at least 5 days between each experiment.

For electrophysiology experiments, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane (as stated above) prior to perfusion and electrolytic lesions were made at the tip of each recording tetrode by applying 5 times 30 μA for 2 seconds. Brains were kept in 4% PFA for 24 hours post-fixation. After a rinse in PBS for at least 24 hours at 4°C, brains were sectioned coronally at a thickness of 50 μm using a vibratome (VT1000 S, Leica Microsystems) and preserved in 0.5% sodium azide PBS at 4°C.

Additionally, at the height of 120 cm, the floor width of the aLTM’s open part could be adjusted from 10 cm to 7 cm, resulting in two different configurations (i.e., MA and HA) while it remained with a 7 cm floor width at 170 cm height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Materials and Methods</xref>). To ensure a comparable motivation and prevent habituation behavior to the aLTM’s open part across anxiety configurations, mice were food restricted and received small rewards (i.e., sugar pellets) in the aLTM’s openable/open part. At the behavioral level, we observed that the trials taken and the time spent by mice (N = 16) in the openable part (including successive higher or lower anxiety configurations) linearly correlated with the 6 anxiety configurations (simple linear regression: number of trials: <italic>F</italic> = 66.3, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.164, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; percentage of time <italic>F</italic> = 38.3, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.102, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; Spearman correlation: number of trials: <italic>r</italic> = -0.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; percentage of time <italic>r</italic> = -0.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and consequently resulted in 6 behaviorally scaling anxiety levels: NA – VLA – LA – MA – HA – VHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Figure 1</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the vH exhibits increased activity in open anxiogenic compartments of mazes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Here, we show that individual neurons and vH population activity not only increased their activity in the open anxiogenic compartments, overrepresenting the anxiogenic part of the maze, but that the activity progressively increased from low to high anxiety configurations in the openable/open part of the maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). We analyzed vH activity across NA to HA configurations (VHA was not included due to insufficient open part exploration needed for reliable activity analysis) whereby each level was represented by activity originating from increasing and decreasing anxiety level presentations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Materials and Methods</xref>). Simple linear regression analysis showed that the activity progressively increased from the NA to HA configuration in the openable/open part but not in the closed part in two single neuron examples [F = 29.39, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.406, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> left) and F = 64.80, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.601, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> right) for the openable/open part; <italic>F</italic> = 0.64, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.027, <italic>p</italic> = 0.432 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> left) and F = 0.53, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.023, <italic>p</italic> = 0.474 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> right) for the closed part] and the same observation could be made in the entire recorded vH population correlation values of: <italic>F</italic> = 43.00, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.040, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 and <italic>F</italic> = 0.49, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.001, <italic>p</italic> = 0.485 for openable and closed part, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, the scaling of vH activity was not predominantly dependent on locomotion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Tuning and reorganization of vH neuronal activity underlies scaling during anxiety</title><p id="P25">We hypothesized that two phenomena at the single neuron level could contribute to the increased and scaled neuronal activity that we observed in the aLTM’s open/openable part: first, a scaled activity tuning in which neurons could increase their activity with increasing anxiety levels and second, a neuronal recruitment to the open part of the aLTM driven by different anxiety levels. To reveal if such a process might be contributing to the scaled representation of anxiogenic information in the vH population activity, we selected neurons that increased their activity linearly (significant Spearman correlation, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Materials and Methods</xref>) across each anxiety configuration, i.e. from NA to VLA, from VLA to LA, from LA to MA and from MA to HA, in the open part of the maze. We found 30 neurons (14.5% of the total population) whose firing rates increased consecutively across the anxiety levels in the aLTM’s open but not the closed part and thereby showed increased tuning with increasing anxiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, simple linear regression values: <italic>F</italic> = 52.60, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.150, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for openable, <italic>F</italic> = 0.51, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.002, <italic>p</italic> = 0.478 for closed).</p><p id="P26">To investigate if changes in neuronal recruitment took place at any specific anxiety configurations, we quantified the neuronal activity based on the earliest significant increase in firing in the aLTM’s open part compared to the closed part. Our results suggest that at each anxiety level, new neurons were recruited and maintained their activation to subsequent higher anxiety levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-E</xref>). Although major reorganization occurred at the first exposure to the aLTM’s open part (in VLA), sequential recruitment occurred at any anxiety levels. This suggests that both enhanced tuning of neuronal responses and increased neuronal recruitment contribute to the scaling of neuronal activity in response to rising anxiety levels.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Novelty does not change vH population activity</title><p id="P27">To discern changes induced by novelty from the changes related to anxiety configurations, we replaced the openable compartment with a novel compartment where the sidewalls had a clearly different visual appearance and a different texture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, right). During the exploration in the novel configuration, mice demonstrated a preference for the novel section of the maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, left), but showed no difference in trials taken compared to the control configuration (corresponding to a NA configuration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, right). This shows that mice expressed a similar motivation to run trials and were able to detect and engage with the novel part of the maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Novelty can induce a spatial remapping of activity in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), but we observed that the novelty in the openable compartment, at least at the overall population level, did not lead to an increased vH activity compared to the control configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that changes in vH activity during aLTM navigation were mainly due to anxiety processing.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Decoding of anxiety levels by a convolutional classifier confirms the scaling of anxiety-related information</title><p id="P29">Finally, to further verify that vH population activity encodes anxiety-related information, and that this encoding scales with the actual perceived anxiety level, we measured the performance of a non-linear classifier trained to decode anxiety levels from recorded firing rates. The test accuracy on held-out data is above chance level for all configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), which is a telltale sign that vH population activity encodes information about anxiety levels. Next, to verify that this encoding scales continuously with each anxiety level, we leveraged the performance of the classifier on unseen data. For a classifier trained solely on normalized firing rate data from the two extreme conditions (i.e. NA and HA), the proportion of unseen data that are classified as NA (respectively as HA) can be interpreted as a measure of their similarity with the NA (respectively HA) configuration. For the vH to function as an anxiometer, we would thus expect the proportion of data being classified as NA to be the highest for actual NA data, and to continuously decrease as the actual anxiety level goes to VLA, LA, MA, and ultimately HA. This is indeed what we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), where the classifier was trained to solely discriminate NA and HA samples with its validation accuracy was assessed on held-out data. The leftmost value indicated the proportion of NA samples which were correctly classified as NA configurations. Similarly, the rightmost value indicates the proportion of HA samples which were classified as NA configuration. Expectedly, the proportion of samples classified as NA is decreasing when the ground truth anxiety level increases. Then, we assessed how unseen VLA, LA and MA samples would be sorted by the classifier only trained on NA and HA samples (second, third and fourth values). Overall, VLA samples have a higher probability of being classified as NA as compared to LA samples, which highlights a closer proximity between the VLA and NA configurations than between LA and NA. MA samples have a higher probability of being classified as HA as compared to LA samples, which highlights a closer proximity between the MA and HA configurations than between LA and HA. The proportion of unseen data that are classified as NA decreases with increasing anxiety level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, x-axis), which defines a continuously scaling ‘anxiety axis’ in the vH population activity. Simple linear regression analyses confirmed the observed scaling phenomenon with <italic>F</italic> = 31.72, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.227, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Collectively, the decoding of anxiety levels confirms the scaling of anxiety-related information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S24" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">Humans and animals must strike a balance between minimizing exposure to possibly harmful events and exploring the environment to find rewards. Anxiety has been suggested to bias decision-making by increasing the prediction of negative future outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). However, how anxiety coding in the brain is involved in risk assessment to guide behavior is not yet well understood. In our study, we investigated how anxiety representations in the vH of mice are tuned to different levels of anxiety and might thereby provide a basis for decisions under negative emotional conflict. To do so, we developed a maze, the aLTM, on which mice could be exposed to 6 different anxiety configurations during navigation in the same spatial environment while we recorded the activity of vH neurons.</p><p id="P31">We found that we could successfully induce different anxiety levels in mice and that anxiety-related activity in the vH progressively scaled with the different anxiety levels. Human neuroimaging studies have shown that greater hippocampal BOLD signals in the anterior hippocampus are associated with a greater probability of threat and higher anxiety during emotional conflicts and safety learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). In rats, vH activity in the closed arm has been shown to be related to the extent to which animals explore the open part of a linear maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) and vCA1 activity has been shown to further increase with anxiety-associated head-dipping behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). With our results, we provide evidence that behavioral scaling of anxiety within the same spatial and behavioral framework is supported by fine tuning and scaling of vH activity, suggesting that the vH might act as an ‘anxiometer’ in the brain. In contrast, previous work has shown that the basal amygdala encodes behavioral states such as freezing, head dips, entries and exits to anxiogenic compartments, but does not represent the level of absolute perceived anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Rather, our findings position the vH as a critical limbic region that functions as an ‘anxiometer’ by scaling its activity based on perceived anxiety levels. To test the causal relationship between the scaling vH activity and anxiety experienced by the animals, we applied ArchT-mediated optogenetic intervention during the approach of the open compartment of the maze. In a study in humans, the decision to approach a reward relied on the hippocampus and not on the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). In line with this finding, when we inhibited the vH during the approach of the open anxiogenic environment, the mice expressed reduced anxiety and a disruption in the scaling anxiety behavior in the open part of the maze. Hence, we posit that vH activity plays a crucial role not only in the generation of anxiety representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), but our findings further substantiate that activity associated with anxiety, when facing anxiogenic situations, may instruct downstream areas to support executive function.</p><p id="P32">Tuning of neuronal activity has been extensively described in sensory areas, for example, in orientation-tuned neurons in the primary visual cortex that exhibit highest firing rates in response to specific orientation of a visual stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Responses of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain have been also described to scale to error prediction depending on reward size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). The integration of sensory stimuli such as odors, tones or speed of the animal have been shown in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex to drive neural activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). How might individual neurons and population codes in higher cognitive areas such as the hippocampus achieve a tuning to internally generated emotional states such as anxiety? We described two processes that contributed to the scaling of anxiety-related activity in the vH, i.e. an enhanced tuning of neuronal responses and a neuronal recruitment to the open part of the aLTM driven by different anxiety levels. We hypothesize that these processes might be similar to the well described concepts of remapping in the hippocampus and rely on a spatial framework whereby neurons can either change their firing rates within the same location referred to as rate remapping or in a new environment randomly reconfiguring spatial codes during global remapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). We argue that these processes might not be restricted to the encoding of space but to any information that is predominantly processed by the underlying hippocampal subregion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). The recruitment of new vH neurons that were activated at higher anxiety levels might reflect a process similar to global remapping whereby neurons that were not responding in previous anxiety encounters were engaged and recruited at a specific anxiety ‘threshold’, not to a new environment as during global remapping, but to a different anxiety level. vH circuits integrate a multiplicity of synaptic inputs: e.g., visual-spatial contexts and object information from the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex and anxiety-related information from the basolateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). We speculate that convergence of synaptic inputs and possibly inhibitory microcircuits might tune the scaling of rate remapping and gate the switching of newly recruited neurons during different anxiety encounters.</p><p id="P33">All changes of the anxiety configurations occurred within the same spatial environment, however the configurational changes, even minor, were of physical nature (e.g. distance to the ground or removal of part of the maze floor). To exclude that the mice might perceive these as novel aspects of the environment, we introduced a novel configuration of the maze. Based on our results, we conclude that even if a remapping had occurred, it did not result in such prominent dynamic increases of neuronal activity as observed across anxiety configurations and, therefore, novelty is unlikely to have driven the observed changes. The spatially independent tuning of activity supports the concept that the hippocampus integrates and represents emotional information based on perceived anxiety levels. To further support the notion of the vH acting as an ‘anxiometer’ at the populational level, we implemented a non-linear method for anxiety-scaling classification. After training a convolutional classifier on the two extreme anxiety configurations (no anxiety ‘NA’ and high anxiety ‘HA’), the probability of test data to be classified as NA can be interpreted as a measure of their similarity with the NA condition or HA condition respectively, and thus defines a linear “anxiety axis” going from NA to HA.</p><p id="P34">Anxiety disorders in humans are characterized by an elevated perception of potential threats leading to excessive uncontrollable worries that patients overcome with difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). In patients with obsessive-compulsive disorders (a form of generalized anxiety) and schizophrenia (with frequent emotional disturbances), hyperactivity of the vH has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). Also, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and hyperexcitability of the vH can experience anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). We hypothesize that in some of these patients, the mechanisms to control and adjust the scaling of vH activity may be dysfunctional, possibly either shifted to more elevated levels or instead of gradually scaling rather jump to higher levels, maladaptively influencing their decisions and behavior. Collectively, our findings provide insight into how the hippocampus could allow for a dynamic and flexible adjustment of anxiety responses according to accumulated experience and prevailing environmental conditions. Adaptive anxiety scaling, when disrupted, may contribute to the manifestation of anxiety disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Suppl. video 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS193096-supplement-Suppl__video_1.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d28aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS193096-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d28aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the following grants: an ERC starting grant (716761) to S.C., a Swiss National Science Foundation professorship grant (170654) to S.C., a Swiss National Science Foundation grant (31003A_175644) to J.P.P and C.G, and a Swiss National Science Foundation grant (P500PM_210800) to C.G..
