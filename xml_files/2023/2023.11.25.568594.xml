Yet, the fundamental question of how collective tissue behavior emerges from heterogeneous and noisy information processing and transfer at the single-cell level remains unknown. Here, we reveal that tissue scale signaling regulation can arise from local gap-junction mediated cell-cell signaling through the spatiotemporal establishment of an intermediate-scale of transient multicellular communication communities over the course of tissue development. We demonstrated this intermediate scale of emergent signaling using Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the intact, ex vivo cultured, live developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoietic organ, the Lymph Gland (LG). Recurrent activation of these transient signaling communities defined self-organized signaling “hotspots” that receive and transmit information to facilitate repetitive interactions with non-hotspot neighbors, transfer information across cells, and regulate the developmental progression of hotspots. Overall, this work bridges the scales between single-cell and emergent group behavior providing key mechanistic insight into how cells establish tissue-scale communication networks.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The emergence of collective cell behavior is an essential component of many basic biological phenomena such as tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), or bacterial quorum sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Key to understanding collective cell decision-making is elucidating how local information transfer between cells is integrated in space and time. This spatial and temporal integration of information is essential for regulating the emergence of collective behavior at the multicellular scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoietic organ, the Lymph Gland (LG), is a powerful, genetically tractable, model to study how information is integrated in space and time to facilitate collective cell behavior. The LG contains dozens of stem cell-like blood progenitors that are largely quiescent but can be collectively activated in certain conditions, such as in response to pathogenic infection, to rapidly produce hundreds of highly differentiated blood cells with infection-fighting characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Long-term culture and live imaging of the intact LG showed that Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling, which is transmitted between blood progenitor cells through gap-junctions, mediated essential information transfer across large distances in the LG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels serve a key function in controlling blood progenitor fate as the activity of multiple pathways that regulate progenitor behavior, including JAK/STAT and CaMKII signaling, is modulated by the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the cell at a specific time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Gap junctions, intracellular channels that directly link adjacent cells to allow them to exchange ions and other small molecules, can help cells form signaling networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In characterizing, at the population scale, the gap-junctions based, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated, multicellular signaling network in the LG we observed synchronized cell pairs that were located up to 38 cell diameters (∼190 µm) from one another. Importantly, functional studies illustrated that the gap-junction mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling network was required for proper regulation and function of the LG by coordinating fate decisions at the population scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). A key question that emerged from our previous results was how the local information transfer between adjacent cell pairs formed a global multicellular network. Specifically, we wanted to characterize and understand the intermediate stages that allowed cell-cell signaling exchanged between individual cells to become collective signaling.</p><p id="P3">Here we identified, using spatiotemporal analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling in live intact LGs, the gradual formation of communicating communities of 3-14 progenitor cells over the course of development, through intercellular gap junction-mediated signaling. Recurrent signaling activity of these communities formed hotspots of local information transmission highlighting heterogeneity in intercellular information transfer as a potential contributor to collective decision making. Taken together, our results explain how the exchange of information between individual cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> LG becomes an emergent behavior involving multiple cells. This provides insight into the bridging of the scales between single-cell and emergent group behavior.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Propagating intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling forms communicating communities in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lymph gland</title><p id="P4">We investigated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in individual blood progenitors using live imaging of intact, <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultured, LGs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). By manual qualitative selection of adjacent blood progenitor pairs, we previously showed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals propagate between neighboring blood progenitor pairs and this propagation is mediated by gap junctions (Video S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). To systematically and quantitatively characterize the patterns of signal synchronization across scales in-depth, we measured the temporal correlation between Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in all blood progenitor pairs in the LG. This analysis identified a negative correlation between the distance between blood progenitor pairs (termed <italic>cell pair distance</italic>) and the level of coordination in their Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (termed <italic>cell pair correlation</italic>). This means that, on average, closer blood progenitor pairs were more synchronized in terms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling than distant pairs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). These data identified a sub-population of highly synchronized cell pairs, where cells were located within a distance of approximately 14 µm from one another, about two cell diameters apart. Indeed, partitioning the data to close (≤ 14 µm) versus far (≥ 14 µm) cell pairs showed that close pairs were more likely to be in a higher level of synchronization (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). This subpopulation of highly synchronized close-cell pairs highlighted the heterogeneity in cell-cell information transfer. However, it was still unclear how this local cell-cell synchronization propagates from the scale of cell pairs to the multicellular scale.</p><p id="P5">To detect and quantify collective spatiotemporal signaling events, i.e., signaling events that involve more than two cells, we applied a computational method known as the “Automatic Recognition of COllective Signaling” (ARCOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). ARCOS binarizes the single blood progenitor Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, according to its magnitude, to “active” (Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak) or “inactive”, followed by spatiotemporal clustering of cells that are synchronously active (peaks ≤ 15 seconds apart) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). This analysis defines “collective signaling events” that we refer to as local transient <italic>communities</italic> of blood progenitor signaling (Video S2). Every community consists of a minimum of three cells that were active simultaneously or within a 15-second delay. Using ARCOS, we were able to monitor the formation and disintegration of a community (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, Video S3): following an initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike, subsequent activation of adjacent blood progenitors, as marked by red dots connected by a white arrow, initiated a 3-cell community (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, 0-7 seconds). The community gradually grew, which was observed as Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation in adjacent cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, red dots and white arrows, 11-23 seconds) and shrunk by deactivation of cells in the community (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, yellow arrowheads, 18-25 seconds). Throughout its evolution, this community involved 6 cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, marked by a white dashed polygon, 25 seconds) with a maximum of 5 cells being active simultaneously (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, 16 seconds). Our analysis identified communities of local intercellular transfer of signaling information involving 3-14 blood progenitors per community, with a median community size of 4 cells and 30% of communities having at least 5 participating cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>, example in Video S3). Two potential confounders of this analysis were the stochastic co-incidence of activation events and the presence of areas with higher local cell densities, both of which may lead to the detection of spurious collective signaling events by ARCOS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). To mitigate these potentially confounding factors, we spatially shuffled the cells (i.e., randomized their location), applied ARCOS to identify collective signaling events in the spatially permuted experiment, and recorded the <underline>m</underline>ean number of collective signaling <underline>e</underline>vents per <underline>c</underline>ell (mean events per cell, MEC) across the entire population. We repeated the sequence of random shuffling and ARCOS analysis 1,000 times (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) and recorded: (A) the statistical significance - the fraction of times that the MEC of these <italic>in silico</italic> spatially permuted experiments were equal or exceeded the MEC of the observed (un-permuted) experiment, and (B) the magnitude - the mean ratio between the experimentally observed MEC and each of the <italic>in silico</italic> spatially permuted MEC. All replicates, but one (11/12), showed significant elevation in magnitude of MEC, by a factor of 1.2-3.3 fold in respect to the <italic>in silico</italic> permuted experiments, indicating that the collective signaling events were a local property of this multicellular system (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Altogether, our data suggests that local cell-cell information transfer integrates in space and time to form multicellular communities of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal propagating blood progenitors in live intact <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultured LGs.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Gap junctions mediate the propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in blood progenitor communities</title><p id="P6">We previously demonstrated that gap junctions were required for cell-to-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation between the blood progenitors in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> LG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). To assess the role of gap junctions in the formation of intercellular communities, we analyzed <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultured LGs using live imaging under different conditions where gap junctions were perturbed. Specifically, we used both a genetic and a pharmaceutical-based approach to disrupt gap junction-mediated communication between blood progenitors. First, we used an RNA interference (RNAi) approach to knock down the expression of the gap junction protein Innexin 4, known by its gene name <italic>zero population growth,</italic> or <italic>zpg</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). We have previously shown that Zpg is the main gap junction channel mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling between blood progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Second, we used the gap-junction blocker known as carbenoxolone (CBX). We performed RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>zpg</italic> (N = 8), a low dose CBX treatment (3.125 µM; N = 3), a high dose CBX treatment (12.5 µM, N = 4), or a control where we first treated with 100 µM CBX and then washed it out (N = 4). Analysis of these different treatment groups showed that gap-junction inhibition led to a drastic decrease in the fraction of experiments with significant local communities (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), the magnitude of collective signaling communities (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>), and the intercellular signaling propagation speed between adjacent cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). Intriguingly, washout experiments that were previously shown to rescue the network properties and cell-cell propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), did not rescue the fraction of collective signaling-event communities (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), but did rescue the magnitude of communities (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>) and the intercellular signaling propagation speed between adjacent cells in a transient community (termed <italic>intercellular signaling propagation speed</italic>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). This suggests that perturbation of gap junction-mediated communication may have a long-lasting effect on the signaling community that persists even after CBX is removed. The association between the LG’s mean cell activation rate (i.e., frequency of cell activation), mean local cell density, and the MEC rate, meaning the mean frequency that a cell participates in a transient community, were maintained for most gap junction inhibition perturbations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A-C</xref>). However, Zpg depletion (using RNAi) or inhibition (using CBX) led to increased cell activation, i.e., higher frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, but reduced MEC rate for the same activation level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4D</xref>), suggesting a compensation mechanism where Zpg-depleted or inhibited cells try to compensate for reduced cell-cell communication capacity by increasing their activity. These results validate the critical role of gap junctions in the formation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-based intercellular communities.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Recurrent activation of communication communities forms hotspots of local information processing hubs</title><p id="P7">We next asked whether the same cells participate in multiple (transient) signaling communities, which, if true, could suggest that these communities act as signaling communication “hubs” that repeatedly receive and spread information to synchronize the multicellular network. To quantitatively assess this possibility in wild-type LGs, we recorded for each cell the number of times it participated in signaling communities. Visualization of the number of times each cell participated in a community revealed spatial heterogeneity with recurrent activation of specific communities, that we call “<italic>hotspots</italic>”, involving groups of spatially adjacent cells with enriched participation in signaling communities with respect to the population (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A-E</xref>, criteria for hotspot identification are detailed in the Methods). We identified hotspots that met these criteria in 9 out of the 12 wild-type (non-treated) LGs. The number of hotspots per LG ranged between 1 to 3 with each containing between 3 to 15 cells. To verify that hotspots were not a mere consequence of increased cell activation we devised a bootstrapping-based statistical test (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref>). First, we matched and replaced at least 50% of the cells in the hotspot with other cells in the same experiment that did not take part in the hotspot and had, at minimum, the same amount of activations. Second, we switched the Ca<sup>2+</sup> time series for each pair of matched hotspot and non-hotspot cells, and then detected collective signaling events in this <italic>in silico,</italic> spatially permuted, experiment (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Third, we recorded the MECs for cells participating in the hotspot of the <italic>in silico</italic> permuted experiment. We repeated these steps of switching “hotspot” with non-hotspot cells with at least the same number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, up to 1,000 times for each hotspot, recorded the difference between experimentally observed hotspots and their <italic>in silico</italic> permuted versions, and determined the statistical significance. Statistical significance was determined by calculating the fraction of permutations where the hotspot MEC values in the <italic>in silico</italic> experiments were equal to or exceeded the MEC values of the observed (wild-type, non-permuted) experiment. This analysis showed a dramatic decrease in the MEC following spatial permutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>), statistically validating 8 of 14 hotspots, spread over 5 of the 12 live intact <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultured LGs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Qualitative observation of the validated hotspots locations did not identify a typical spatial pattern in respect to the LGs. Gap-junction perturbations, even after washout, showed reduced numbers of validated hotspots (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Our findings raised two important questions regarding the interaction of hotspots with their environment. First, do hotspots function as self-contained groups of cells, interacting predominantly within their enclosed local surroundings? Second, do hotspots initiate the spread of information, or are they more responsive to incoming non-hotspots external signals? Following the evolution of a transient community showed alternating interactions between cells inside and outside a hotspot (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). To systematically decipher the interactions between hotspots and their surrounding environment we analyzed the spatiotemporal communication patterns of all the validated hotspots that were pooled across the wild-type LGs (N = 8 hotspot). To quantify the interactions of hotspots with their surrounding cells, we calculated each hotspot its probability of engaging with cells outside the hotspot through common transient communities (Methods). The majority of hotspots (7 out of 8) interacted with non-hotspot cells in more than half of their transient communities, this interaction was independent of the size of a hotspot (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>), and was dominated by communities that involved 2-4 cells within the hotspot and 1-2 cells external to the hotspot (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Specifically, 70% of hotspot communities had at least one non-hotspot cell involved, and 76% of these communities involved more hotspot cells than non-hotspot cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). These interactions of a hotspot with its surrounding cells did not have a systematic direction, starting from hotspot cells outwards or initiating externally from adjacent non-hotspot cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>, Methods). Furthermore, we did not identify cells that repeatedly initiated a hotspot’s transient communities, suggesting stochasticity in hotspot initiation. These observations established the existence of gap-junction-mediated communication “hotspots”, where recurrent Ca<sup>2+</sup> communities coalesce into larger communication hubs that repeatedly spread and retrieve information throughout the blood progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Gradual formation of communication communities and their recurrent activation during LG development</title><p id="P9">In flies, hematopoiesis is subject to developmental regulation, with blood progenitors exhibiting distinct behaviors at different larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Specifically, cell proliferation and differentiation show distinct patterns at different points along the developmental timeline (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). For example, the differentiation of mature blood cells starts around the mid- to late-second instar transition and peaks around the mid-second to mid-third instar larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). The level of mature blood cell differentiation gradually declines as the LG develops and becomes significantly attenuated upon entry into the mid-third instar stage (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). In contrast, cell proliferation in the blood progenitors peaks earlier, during the first- to second-instar stages, when the progenitor repertoire rapidly expands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Shortly after the onset of differentiation, the rate of cell proliferation slows down but remains active until the mid-third instar stage (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We previously showed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling appeared to evolve over larval development, correlating with the differentiation activity of progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Specifically, we observed lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling propagation between neighboring cells and a reduced connectivity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling network during early larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). To understand how Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling communities develop during hematopoiesis when progenitors show distinct proliferation and differentiation patterns (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), we expanded our analysis to the earlier stages of the late-second and early-third larval stages. Our analysis characterized a gradual build-up of signaling communities, in terms of both quantity and complexity, over the course of blood progenitor development. Specifically, both the fraction of experiments with significant local communities (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) and the magnitude of MEC (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) increased across the three stages in wild-type LGs. In contrast, RNAi-mediated <italic>zpg</italic> knockdown induced a decrease in both parameters of signaling communities (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-F</xref>), suggesting that the emergence of signaling communities was perturbed. Hotspots analysis showed a similar trend of gradual emergence of recurrent Ca<sup>2+</sup> communities along the developmental trajectory with 0/4 statistically validated hotspots in the late-second, 3/6 in the early-third, and 8/14 in the mid-third stage(<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). In contrast, no (0) hotspots were validated across all developmental stages of the Zpg-depleted LGs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Taken together, our data suggests that signaling communities and their recurrent activation (i.e., hotspots) emerge during, and evolve over, the course of larval development and that gap junctions are required for the developmental progression of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling communities in blood progenitors. This is also consistent with our previous observation showing that Zpg depletion increases blood cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), supporting a model where signaling communities coordinate blood progenitor behavior to maintain LG homeostasis during development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P11">There are numerous examples in the literature reporting synchronization and collective events in the context of cell signaling and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). A critical question that has remained underexplored is how does global, tissue-scale synchronization emerge from local cell-cell communication? More specifically, what are the intermediary steps involved in reaching the final synchronization state? In an attempt to provide some insight into the answers to these questions, we have previously described how endothelial monolayers synchronize Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling by gradually transitioning from local to global information spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Other studies reported signaling waves propagating across long distances in a variety of systems and in the context of diverse functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). However, these studies did not pinpoint a specific intermediate spatial scale between single-cell and collective signaling. Here, using <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis as our model system, we were able to identify such an intermediate spatial scale. Our work elaborates on our previous findings that described the important role played by gap junctions in coordinating cellular signals in the LG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). We now show that an intermediate spatial scale exists, involving transient gap junction-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the form of multicellular communities. Similar scale collective events were previously reported in the context of Erk signaling in epithelial cells, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) suggesting that this could be a universal way to collectively organize the signaling activity of individual cells in a multicellular system.</p><p id="P12">A key feature in some of these transient communities was recurrent activation events that formed larger communication processing hubs that we call signaling hotspots. These hotspots had several important functional characteristics: 1) Their formation required the activity of Zpg-based gap junctions. 2) They acted as information hubs that were able to induce (i.e., transmit) and process (i.e., receive) collective signaling using mechanisms that operated both within (intrinsically) and outside (extrinsically) of the hotspot. 3) They exhibited repetitive interactions with their environment and were spatially heterogeneous. 4) There was an increased incidence of hotspots as the LG evolved and developed consistent with a role in the emergence of collective cell behavior. Each of these characteristics of the hotspots played an important functional role in shaping the signaling landscape within the LG. Overall, these findings reveal a novel mechanism whereby local cell-cell signaling propagation, through gap junctions, progresses into intermediate multicellular communities that integrate local information to achieve global population-wide synchronization during fly hematopoiesis.</p><p id="P13">Our observation that hotspots self-organize as information processing hubs in the blood progenitor population suggests that the hotspots perform a function that bears general resemblance to that performed by pacemaker cells, at the multicellular scale. A characteristic of pacemaker cells is their ability to coordinate the electrical or Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling activity of individual cells to guide collective decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Multicellular structures that are functionally and morphologically similar to pacemaker cells appear across diverse tissues, including Cajal interstitial cells in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), a sinoatrial node in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), and preBötC cells in the brain stem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), indicating that it is a conserved module in living systems to regulate systemic homeostasis. We note three features of blood progenitor hotspots that resemble those found in pacemaking cells. First, as we previously proposed, blood progenitors form a small-world Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), where most cells are separated from each other by a small number of cell-to-cell transmission events thanks to a small subgroup of cells with high connectivity compared to other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Here, using ARCOS and <italic>in silico</italic> spatial permutation analysis, we directly demonstrated the existence of such hub-like network structures, or hotspots, within the blood progenitor population. Second, a well-known feature of pacemaker cells is their ability to integrate and segregate information between cells that are either external or internal to their signaling hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Our study quantitatively illustrates that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in blood progenitors is organized into hotspots that are able to both receive and send information. Third, there are several functional analogies between the hotspots found in blood progenitors and cardiac pacemaker cells found in sinoatrial nodes. These include: (A) transfer of information across large distances and the ability to fine-tune the activities of a large group of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), (B) highly synchronized multicellular activity that is often tied to function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), (C) coordinated cell behavior that is dependent on gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), (D) self-organization and synchronization of local heterogeneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), and (E) intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in both systems are controlled by the same molecular machinery including gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), SERCA pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), and ryanodine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). These observations highlight similar design principles, both conceptual and functional, that allow LG blood progenitor hotspots and cardiac pacemaker cells to coordinate cells within a population.</p><p id="P14">Signaling hotspots highlight the spatial heterogeneity in intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> information processing in the developing LG. How such heterogeneity develops in seemingly homogenous blood progenitors remains unknown. Heterogeneity in intercellular communication, even in the same cell population, can originate from intrinsic cell-to-cell variation in gene expression levels or protein modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Indeed, single-cell transcriptomic analysis on LGs showed that blood progenitors, which were previously considered as a homogenous population, exhibited a large variability in their gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). The differences in their gene enrichment were used to classify progenitors into 6 main sub-clusters that showed distinct spatial distribution and gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), suggesting that the difference in gene expression could contribute to the heterogeneity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Beyond gene expression or protein modifications, the positioning of the cells within the LG and in relation to other organs may lead to spatial heterogeneity between hotspots, by supporting different modes of cell-cell interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). However, we were not able to identify a stereotypic spatial pattern in the hotspot location.</p><p id="P15">The emergence of hotspots from oscillating blood progenitors required a mechanism that coordinates their individual activities. Although we demonstrated that the function of Zpg-based gap junctions was indispensable in this process, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We can envision several possible routes for the emergence of collective Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling hotspots in the blood progenitor population. According to theoretical, physics, and neural-based studies, routes giving rise to collective behaviors can be classified into four main categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>): (A) Pacemaker cells, in this context cells that fire rhythmic signals, entraining other cells to oscillate or behave in a synchronized fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). (B) Phase and/or frequency locking, where cells that naturally oscillate at different frequencies synchronize their behaviors by adjusting their phases and/or frequencies when coupled with other cells, a representative example being circadian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). (C) Oscillator death, where mathematical approaches and synthetic genetic clocks show that cells stop oscillating when coupled with other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Therefore, decreasing the coupling strength permits the emergence of synchronized behavior. (D) Dynamic quorum sensing, where non-oscillatory cells start oscillating when a signaling molecule they secrete exceeds a critical concentration threshold in their environment, an example being yeast glycolytic oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Comparing our data with the above four categories, we proposed that hotspot emergence likely involves a hybrid mechanism with both pacemaker-like and phase/frequency locking properties. First, we noticed that some progenitors were still able to produce Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes even in the presence of a high concentration of CBX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), indicating that these cells spontaneously produce spikes without the need of neighbor connections. As discussed in the previous section (Hotspots act as information hubs), the progenitor hotspots show characteristics consistent with having pacemaker-like properties. Second, for the phase/frequency locking property, we found that the complexity and incidence rate of hotspots increased concomitant with animal development. This showed that hotspots are able to accommodate or incorporate new cells in a developing progenitor population. Our previous observations show that the number of gap junctions increased and the spiking frequency of blood progenitors was modulated during LG development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). These two lines of evidence suggest that the newly incorporated cells, once coupled with other cells, changed their spiking frequency over time, consistent with the phase/frequency locking phenomenon. Overall, we suggested that the progenitor hotspots emerge by simultaneously utilizing the pacemaker-like and phase/frequency docking mechanisms. Taken together, our findings align with other recent studies that reported collective signaling in the spatial scale of multiple cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), suggesting a universal mechanism to collectively organize the signaling activity of individual cells in a multicellular system.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S9"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics, stocks, and maintenance</title><p id="P16">All <italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks and crosses were maintained regularly on a standard cornmeal medium (recipe from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center) in vials or bottles at 25℃.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance statement</title></caption><p>Cells coordinate their internal state and behavior by exchanging information with other cells in their vicinity. These local interactions are integrated across space and time to enable synchronized function at the tissue scale. Using live microscopy imaging of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Lymph Gland, and by applying computational analyses, we identified and characterized a new mode of cellular communication through self-organized recurring coordinated short-term activation at the intermediate scale of 3-8 cells, which we call “hotspots”. We reveal that hotspots form over the course of tissue development, and are dependent on specific proteins, called gap-junctions, that enable communication between adjacent cells. Hotspots repeatedly transmit and retrieve information to and from their non-hotspot neighbors to spread information throughout the tissue to regulate and coordinate tissue function.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Blood progenitor cell-cell communication forms communities of propagative Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Representative confocal image showing Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling activities in blood progenitors of a LG visualized using GCaMP6f (in green).

Orange polygons visualize the cell centers transiently participating in a community in each frame. White arrows indicate the inclusion of new activated cells in the community, yellow arrowheads indicate the deactivation and exclusion of cells from the community.
