These cells are removed by phagocytic cells, namely macrophages through a process known as efferocytosis, which triggers a cascade of reprogramming events in the cell, with a shift towards a pro-resolving or ‘wound healing’ phenotype. To date, no study has attempted to investigate these phenotypic changes from a proteomic perspective. Here, we present a novel and robust workflow for the investigation of proteome and secretome changes in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) following efferocytosis using stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) combined with data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry. We show that using this workflow we can dissect the mixed proteomes of BMDMs and apoptotic cells to specifically map the reprogramming events occurring in macrophages in the later stages of efferocytosis. Specifically, we find that efferocytic macrophages adopt an alternatively activated phenotype underpinned by an increase in efferocytic and anti-inflammatory markers. We also show that the secretome contains factors that can reprogram naïve BMDMs towards an efferocytosis-like, pro-resolving, phenotype. Our results provide an unprecedented view of the efferocytic landscape of macrophages and will aid in further understanding this important immunological process in the larger context of immune homeostasis and inflammatory disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Efferocytosis</kwd><kwd>Macrophage</kwd><kwd>SILAC</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Data-independent acquisition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The clearance of dying cells by professional and non-professional phagocytic cells plays a fundamental role in tissue homeostasis and resolution of inflammation. This process, known as efferocytosis, is critical for maintaining immune tolerance and prevents the release of autoantigens from apoptotic cells that could trigger autoimmune responses. Consequently, dysregulation of efferocytosis has been implicated in various diseases, including autoimmune and inflammatory respiratory disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Macrophages, one of the principal efferocytic cell types, express various pattern recognition receptors that are specialised in recognising antigens on dying cells, triggering phagocytosis. As key immune regulators, macrophages can modulate the immune response via their ability to shift between pro (M1)- and anti (M2)-inflammatory states and upon efferocytosis, they acquire an M2-like or pro-resolving phenotype in order to dampen the immune response and promote resolution of inflammation. Despite the importance of macrophage efferocytosis in health and disease, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this reprogramming process is limited. While studies have investigated transcriptomic changes in macrophages following the early stages of efferocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, no study has investigated changes in the proteome in order to specifically map the phenotype of efferocytic cells. Notably, it has been shown that metabolites secreted by apoptotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and extracellular vesicles produced by efferocytic macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> can induce a pro-resolving phenotype in neighbouring cells and promote efferocytosis.</p><p id="P3">In this study, we sought to address this knowledge gap by employing a proteomic approach to investigate changes in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) following phagocytosis of apoptotic Jurkat cells. Our aim was to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the events following macrophage efferocytosis, which could elucidate novel targets for therapeutic intervention. By using stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), we were able to separate the proteomes of BMDMs and Jurkat cells, and by combining this with data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry, we achieved a deep level of proteome coverage. Our data show that, as expected, macrophages undergo extensive reprogramming following efferocytosis, shifting towards a unique phenotype that is, for the first time, mapped on the proteome level. Our data also profiles the secretome of efferocytic BMDMs, containing a mixture of macrophage- and apoptotic cell-derived proteins, that when added to naïve BMDMs, alters their phenotype to one resembling efferocytic BMDMs. This robust methodology has widespread applications for profiling efferocytic macrophages from different biological or disease contexts, such as those from inflammatory disorders, and thus, can be used to better understand how defective efferocytosis may contribute to disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>BMDMs undergo extensive proteome changes following efferocytosis</title><p id="P4">While the advent of label-free quantitative mass spectrometry has revolutionised the proteomics field, some limitations exist, such as being able to distinguish between mixed proteomes from closely related species. This has made the examination of proteome changes in macrophages following the phagocytosis of same- or similar species particularly challenging. To achieve this, we have implemented a novel approach by employing stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and combining this with data-independent mass spectrometry to improve quantification. We initially sought to establish an easy-to-reproduce model of efferocytosis using murine bone marrow-derived (BMDMs) and apoptotic Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Firstly, we were able to induce early apoptosis in ~80% of Jurkat cells after 3 h treatment with the kinase inhibitor staurosporine, based on the percentage of Annexin V/7-AAD double positive events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Using confocal microscopy, we could show that after ‘pulsing’ BMDMs with apoptotic Jurkat cells and ‘chasing’ for 30 min we could observe that apoptotic cells were fully engulfed within BMDMs and not merely stuck to them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We then employed flow cytometry to quantify the level of efferocytosis in BMDMs, demonstrating that ~60% of BMDMs contained apoptotic cells, after a 30 min chase, which reduced to ~40% after 3 h, likely due to dye quenching/degradation in the lysosomal compartment following phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p id="P5">For our proteomics-based efferocytosis assay, we incubated BMDMs with apoptotic Jurkat cells for chase times of 30 min or 18 h, where 30 min was treated as the control/baseline and 18 h as our efferocytosis condition, followed by lysis, trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry. Our initial observation of the non-normalised log2 transformed data showed that the mixture of light and heavy channels did not skew the light-channel across control and efferocytosis conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). Post-filtering, we identified 6513 proteins that matched to <italic>Mus musculus</italic> in the light channel, and 4646 proteins that matched to <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> in the heavy channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>). This indicates we could successfully differentiate between proteins from the light and heavy channels. Correlation matrices showed that inter-sample variance within each experimental condition was minimal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4C</xref>), and a principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that replicates clustered together while experimental conditions had a good level of separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Following limma analysis of the murine proteins from the light channel, when comparing our 18 h efferocytosis condition to 30 min, we found 294 proteins with a fold-change &gt; 1.5, and 152 proteins with a fold-change &lt; -1.5 with an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis by KEGG of proteins with increased abundances showed enrichment of pathways associated with extracellular matrix, complement, cell adhesion, cytokines, and the PI3K-Akt pathway, indicating a unique phenotype in BMDMs after undergoing efferocytosis, that has not been previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Further investigation into proteins that had the largest abundance changes following efferocytosis highlighted numerous proteins of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). This included Adgre5, also known as CD97, which has been shown to antagonise pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and Arginase 2, which like Arginase 1, promotes an anti-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F-G</xref>). Notably, we also identified numerous efferocytosis-related proteins, such as thrombospondin 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, CD14<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, Edil3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and Mfge8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). We also identified solute carrier transporters that have been previously described to play a role in macrophage polarisation as well as efferocytosis, such as Slc7a11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and Slc2a1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. While Slc16a1/MCT1, a lactate transporter previously shown to be upregulated following efferocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, was not found in our analysis, a closely related member of the monocarboxylate transporter family, Slc16a3/MCT4, was found to increase following efferocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). We also observed numerous proteins unique (and present in at least 3 of 4 replicates) to the efferocytosis conditions but not in any replicates of control conditions (and vice-versa) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Despite not being able to calculate fold changes for these proteins, they may be playing a role in macrophage reprogramming following efferocytosis.</p><p id="P7">While gene ontology (GO) enrichment could not highlight any specific pathways or processes in proteins with decreased abundances, there were specific proteins of interest identified, such as Clec12a, a pro-inflammatory C-type lectin receptor whose expression on myeloid cells has been shown to correlate with disease activity in those with rheumatoid arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and Mmp12, a matrix metalloproteinase typically associated with pro-inflammatory macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Notably, the vast majority of decreased proteins (as well as those absent following efferocytosis, highlighted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) have roles associated with DNA-binding and cell cycle, suggesting that efferocytic BMDMs begin to resemble terminally differentiated, tissue resident macrophages, lacking the ability to proliferate.</p><p id="P8">Taken together, our data indicates that our SILAC workflow can successfully map reprogramming events in macrophages following efferocytosis. This has provided novel insights into this important immunological process, and highlights that macrophages shift to an alternative activated state upon apoptotic cell clearance.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The efferocytic supernatant can alter the phenotype of naïve BMDMs</title><p id="P9">It has been shown that both macrophages and apoptotic cells secrete factors that promote a wound-healing phenotype in neighbouring cells to resolve inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In order to investigate this concept further using our SILAC workflow, we collected the supernatants from the BMDMs 6 h and 18 h following efferocytosis for mass spectrometry analysis. While PCA showed differences in how the same conditions clustered at the two timepoints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A-B</xref>), correlation plots demonstrated that samples were not largely different between the timepoints, and that intra-sample variability was low (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C</xref>). In total, we identified 4355 light-labelled murine proteins across both timepoints and conditions, and after performing limma analysis found 145 and 1029 proteins with increased abundances at 6 and 18 h, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>). Of those proteins that are shared between the timepoints ~20% related to protein phosphorylation, based on GO enrichment of biological process (BP) terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B-D</xref>). Notably, the same analysis of proteins with decreased abundance in the supernatants following efferocytosis at both timepoints highlighted proteins associated with cell adhesion and inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6E-F</xref>). Thrombospondin-1 and Il1r2 had some of the most pronounced changes in their secreted abundance following 18 h efferocytosis, which is in agreeance with their putative roles as pro-resolving factors during apoptotic cell clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and inflammatory conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">Surprisingly, when analysing proteins from the heavy channel, i.e., from apoptotic Jurkat cells, we identified 3321 and 2794 proteins in the secretomes at 6 h and 18 h, respectively. However, due to the experimental design, fold-changes could not be calculated, and so protein intensities were log<sub>10</sub> transformed and ranked. In the apoptotic cell secretome at both timepoints, largely the same proteins were ranked highest, including apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a known factor secreted by apoptotic cells that promotes their clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and MIF, which is known to be packaged in apoptotic cell extracellular vesicles (EVs), and promotes macrophage proliferation during tissue maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). While it cannot be discounted that these proteins are being secreted from non-phagocytosed apoptotic cells, rigorous washing steps were performed during our pulse-chase assay which should have removed the majority of these cells. Therefore, we can hypothesise that these proteins arise from digested apoptotic cells that are exported from BMDMs via exocytosis. When further interrogating the human component of our secretome dataset, it was noted that GO analysis by cellular compartment showed a strong enrichment of EVs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A</xref>). While it was not within the scope of this study to characterise EVs following efferocytosis, it is interesting to speculate that this may be the case, as it has been recently shown that efferocytic macrophages secrete EVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of cleared supernatants following ultracentrifugation did indeed show the presence of EVs in both control and efferocytosis conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7C-D</xref>). Using our SILAC workflow, it will be pertinent to investigate the protein cargo of these EVs and their potential pro-resolving capabilities.</p><p id="P11">We then sought to investigate whether or not these supernatants could alter the phenotype of naïve BMDMs. To do so, we incubated BMDMs with cleared, 18 h control (c) or efferocytic (e) supernatants, hereon referred to as conditioned medium (CM) for 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). PCA demonstrated that cells treated with eCM clustered separately from those treated with cCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), and we identified 275 and 556 proteins with increased and decreased abundances after eCM treatment, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Gene ontology enrichment analysis of proteins with increased abundance identified pathways associated with the immune response, lipid metabolic process, and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Additionally, GO analysis by cell compartment (CC) showed an enrichment of ‘lysosome’ and ‘extracellular space’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref>), further supporting the hypothesis that these cells are engulfing and digesting EVs. Notably, ~30% of proteins with increased abundance in eCM-treated BMDMs were shared with those from the original efferocytic BMDM dataset of proteins with increased abundance, such as Adgre5, Clec4d, Edil3, Thbs1, ApoE and Fn1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8A</xref>). As expected, GO analysis of these shared proteins showed an enrichment of immune and inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8B-C</xref>), highlighting the ability of efferocytic BMDMs to signal and cause phenotypic changes in neighbouring cells.</p><p id="P12">When further investigating these proteins with increased abundance, some of the most pronounced changes were from those associated with coagulation and complement, extracellular matrix, and platelet activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>), indicative of a tissue remodelling phenotype. These processes have diverse yet intertwined functions, and importantly directly impact the innate immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Platelet factor 4 (Pf4/Cxcl4), for example, is known to promote monocyte differentiation into macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and also decreases T cell proliferation and IFN-γ release in co-culture experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>; here it was found to markedly increase in both efferocytic and eCM-treated BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Notably, it has previously been shown that activated platelets have an anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, demonstrative of the positive pro-resolutive feedback loop that may be induced by efferocytic macrophages. While it is a well-known marker of macrophages, CD11b is also a complement receptor that, in conjunction with FcγRs, plays a role in the clearance of necrotic cell debris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Collectively, these data provide a novel insight to macrophage reprogramming events that occur after apoptotic cell clearance and how efferocytic macrophages can secrete factors that signal neighbouring cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">Our study has been the first to successfully map global proteome and secretome changes in macrophages following efferocytosis. Using SILAC, we can effectively and efficiently separate the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> proteomes of macrophages and Jurkat cells, respectively. By combining this with DIA mass spectrometry, we have developed an easy-to-use assay that can provide deep proteome coverage. Importantly, our approach is compatible with various enrichment strategies to study post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, glycosylation and ubiquitylation.</p><p id="P14">In support of our methodology, we identified several proteins that have previously been shown to play a positive role in efferocytosis, such as CD14<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, thrombospondin 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, Mfge8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, Slc7a11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and Edil3/Del1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Among the proteins found to increase in abundance, were proteins associated with M2 macrophage polarisation (Arg2) and macrophage recruitment (Adgre5/CD97), consistent with a shift towards a pro-resolving phenotype. Additionally, in support of the shift away from a pro-inflammatory phenotype, proteins found to have decreased abundance were pro-inflammatory molecules, such as MMP12, Clec12a, S100a9 and S100a6e. In our study, we have identified a plethora of putatively important proteins in processes of wound healing and inflammation, ideally, the resources provided here will be of great value to other researchers working in these fields. One such example is Notch2, whose abundance increased in efferocytic, as well as eCM-treated, BMDMs and has been shown to some degree to play a role in promoting diabetic wound healing when expressed on macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">The secretion of pro-resolving factors by both immune cells and apoptotic cells is an emerging theme in innate immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Here, we applied our SILAC approach to study these secreted factors, in addition to their effect on naïve BMDMs. We also hypothesise that the secretome contains extracellular vesicles (EVs) that we speculate may contain both macrophage- and apoptotic cell-derived cargo. Future applications of our SILAC workflow will be used to elucidate the proteome of these EVs as well as those from apoptotic Jurkat cells only. While the efferocytic secretome is complex and contains proteins from both macrophage and apoptotic origin, we have shown that they are rich in pro-resolving molecules such as thrombospondin 1, Il1r2, and ApoE. Supportive of these findings is our observation that naïve BMDMs shift towards an efferocytic phenotype following 48 h incubation with efferocytosis conditioned medium. This unique phenotype is characterised by an increased abundance of proteins associated with extracellular matrix (ECM), complement and coagulation and platelet activation. While destruction of the ECM is detrimental to the 3D microenvironment, the dysregulation of ECM accumulation can lead to fibrosis. Therefore, the maintenance and fine-tuning of the ECM following inflammation is a crucial aspect of wound healing and the subsequent resolution of this inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Macrophage interactions with the ECM as well as cells such as fibroblasts are also an important aspect of this process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. It is possible that the increased abundance of specific proteins in eCM-treated BMDMs, such as Platelet factor 4/Cxcl4, a chemokine known to promote macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk, tissue remodelling and profibrotic phenotype in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, is driving them towards a tissue remodelling phenotype. Increased abundance of Fn1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, collagens and proteolgycans, and decreased abundance of MMP12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> in our datasets, further support this notion. Given the importance of balancing tissue-remodelling signals in order to prevent fibrosis, it is tempting to speculate that excessive efferocytosis, leading to an overactive feedback loop, may in fact contribute to a profibrotic phenotype. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments whereby macrophages are overloaded with apoptotic cells and our SILAC workflow is applied, will help to further investigate this hypothesis.</p><p id="P16">Our data provides a comprehensive proteomic examination into the phenotype of BMDMs following the clearance apoptotic cells, as well as the proteins secreted by these cells that can exert an additional pro-resolutive effect on naïve cells, reminiscent of an alternative activation state.

One hour prior to the assay, BMDM medium was replaced with serum-free IMDM to equilibrate them, and all subsequent steps were performed in serum-free IMDM. Additionally, controls did not receive any apoptotic Jurkat cells but were otherwise treated exactly the same as efferocytosis conditions. Supernatants were collected 6 h and 18 h following the ‘chase’ step. Once collected, supernatants were centrifuged at 1,000 xg for 10 minutes to remove cells and debris. Proteins were then precipitated using the methanol/chloroform method. Briefly, methanol was added to supernatants, followed by chloroform and vortexing to mix. H2O was added, samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 4,000 xg for 15 min at 4°C. The upper layer was discarded, and methanol added to the sample (bottom phase plus protein interphase containing protein).
