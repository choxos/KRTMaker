Whether these distinct cell populations display different mechanical properties, and how these properties might contribute to metastasis is unknown. Using CRC patient derived organoids (PDOs), we found that compared to LGR5- cells, LGR5+ cancer stem cells are stiffer, adhere better to the extracellular matrix (ECM), move slower both as single cells and clusters, display higher nuclear YAP, show a higher survival rate in response to mechanical confinement, and form larger transendothelial gaps. These differences are largely explained by the downregulation of the membrane to cortex attachment proteins Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (ERMs) in the LGR5+ cells. By analyzing scRNA-seq expression patterns from a patient cohort, we show that this downregulation is a robust signature of colorectal tumors. Our results show that LGR5- cells display a mechanically dynamic phenotype suitable for dissemination from the primary tumor whereas LGR5+ cells display a mechanically stable and resilient phenotype suitable for extravasation and metastatic growth.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The intestinal epithelium is the fastest self-renewing tissue in our body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Intestinal stem cells (ISC) fuel this renewal by dividing into transient amplifying cells which in turn differentiate into multiple lineages of short-lived specialized cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In colorectal cancer (CRC), essential features of this hierarchical structure are maintained, resulting in intratumor heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Among the heterogeneous cell populations composing colorectal adenomas and carcinomas, a subset of cells called cancer stem cells (CSC) has a high tumor-initiating ability and expresses a genetic signature similar to the ISCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor (LGR5) is a reliable marker for adult ISCs and was proven to mark functional CSCs in CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Recent lineage tracing and selective cell ablation experiments have confirmed the essential role of LGR5+ CSCs in tumor and metastatic growth. Nevertheless, they also revealed the importance of transitions between differentiation states as an adaptive mechanism to ensure cancer progression and endure changing microenvironmental pressures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In mouse CRC models, genetic ablation of LGR5+ CSCs that had colonized the liver inhibited metastasis formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, it was found that most metastases were initially seeded by LGR5- cells; only after metastatic colonization, conversion of LGR5-to LGR5+ enabled metastatic growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Further reinforcing this model, we recently showed that a subset of LGR5-tumor cells (named high relapse cells - HRCs) that remain hidden in foreign organs after surgical removal of the primary CRC are responsible for metastatic relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Altogether, these studies highlight the importance of microenvironmental stimuli in shaping the role of CSCs in tumor growth and progression.</p><p id="P3">Metastasis formation is a sequential process involving multiple steps including cancer cell dissemination, intravasation, survival in the bloodstream, adhesion to the vessel wall, extravasation, and colonization of distant organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In every step of this cascade, distinct mechanical properties may contribute to the survival and metastatic potential of cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. For instance, reduced cell stiffness contributes to the ability of cancer cells to migrate through confining microenvironments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, while it can be detrimental for the survival of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) against hemodynamic stresses in the blood stream<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Another mechanical property that affects cell metastatic potential is adhesion. Fine-tuning the balance between cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions is required all throughout the metastatic cascade and enables motility, cell-cell interactions, and integration of mechanical stimuli from the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Several studies have related malignant transformation to changes in mechanical phenotypes including decreased cell stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, as well as changes in cell shape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, cell-cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and cell-ECM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> adhesions. Nevertheless, the role of cellular mechanical properties in intra-tumor heterogeneity and its functional implications in CRC metastasis remains largely unexplored. In this study, we show that LGR5+ and LGR5- cells from patient-derived CRC organoids exhibit distinct mechanical phenotypes in terms of stiffness, adhesion, migration, YAP localization, response to confinement, and transendothelial migration. We show that these responses are mediated by differential expression of Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (ERM) proteins, responsible for tethering the plasma membrane to the underlying actin cytoskeleton. The distinct mechanical phenotypes of LGR5+ and LGR5- cells are suitable for different functions during CRC metastasis formation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>LGR5+ and LGR5- cells display differences in morphology, adhesion, stiffness and YAP localization</title><p id="P4">Patient-derived Organoids (PDOs) are 3D structures, derived from biopsies, which self-organize and retain essential features of the <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor in terms of architecture, heterogeneity and gene expression profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. To mechanically characterize LGR5+ and LGR5- cells we used a previously established PDO model that carries genetic alterations in four main pathways driving colorectal carcinogenesis (WNT, EGFR, TGF-Beta and p53, see methods)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The PDOs were engineered by knock-in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination where an IRES-TdTomato-BGHpA cassette was inserted after the stop codon of the <italic>Lgr5</italic> gene, thereby fluorescently labelling the LGR5+ cells using the LGR5 endogenous promoter as a driver of TdTomato expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The organoids were able to differentiate <italic>in vitro</italic> under normal culture conditions giving rise to heterogeneous populations expressing the stem-cell marker LGR5 and the differentiation marker cytokeratin 20 (CK20), mainly in a mutually exclusive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary movie 1</xref>). We sorted the cells based on LGR5 expression into 3 groups expressing high (LGR5+), medium (LGR5<sup>med</sup>), or low (LGR5-) levels of Tdtomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a, b</xref>) and characterized them through bulk RNAseq. Differential expression analysis revealed that the LGR5+ population was enriched in gene signatures corresponding to ISCs, proliferation, biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> and resistance to chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 1d</xref>). Conversely LGR5- cells showed enrichment in gene signatures associated to intestinal differentiation (enterocyte, goblet, tuft and mucus-secreting cells) as well as fetal state signatures. LGR5- cells also showed an upregulation of markers for high relapse cells (HRCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, including the expression of <italic>Emp1</italic> (encoding epithelial membrane protein 1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d, f</xref>). We further investigated the differential expression of Gene Ontology Biological Process (GOBP) gene sets related to cell shape, migration and structural changes in the three populations. In the LGR5+ cells we found enrichment in genes associated with adhesion-dependent cell spreading and EMT. Conversely, in LGR5- cells we found enrichment in genes associated with epithelial migration, cytoskeleton and plasma membrane organization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P5">This transcriptomic analysis suggests that single cells within the organoids might display differences in mechanical phenotype as a function of their LGR5 expression. To test this possibility, we dissociated single cells from the organoids and seeded them on collagen I-coated polyacrylamide (PAA) gels with a stiffness spanning the physiological and pathological range for colon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The three groups showed clear differences in cell shape. LGR5- cells were rounder and less adhesive whereas LGR5+ spread on the substrate and adopted an elongated morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). These differences were conserved across the probed stiffness range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Over the course of 100h in culture medium promoting stemness, sorted single cells from both LGR5- and LGR5+ populations displayed an increase in Tdtomato fluorescence. This expected increase was paralleled by the acquisition of a more elongated morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2g-i</xref>), further supporting a coupling between cell shape and LGR5 expression.</p><p id="P6">To explore whether differences in roundness coincided with changes in mechanotransduction, we stained for the nuclear effector of the Hippo pathway Yes-associated protein (YAP), which not only regulates intestinal development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, but is also a well-established mechano-sensor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Consistent with the trends of cell spreading, YAP nuclear localization was highest in the LGR5+ cells, decreased in the intermediate group, and was lowest in the LGR5- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e, f</xref>). This localization pattern was maintained in all tested rigidities from soft (0.5kPa) to stiff (30kPa), revealing a lack of response to stiffness in YAP localization of both LGR5+ and LGR5- cells.</p><p id="P7">To determine whether the differences in shape and spreading were coupled to distinct migratory behaviors we tracked the cell movement on the PAA gel substrates. No differences in velocities of LGR5- and LGR5+ single cells were found in all tested stiffnesses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Next, we used traction force microscopy (TFM) to investigate the relation between CRC differentiation states and the ability to generate traction forces. We found no differences in the mean traction exerted by LGR5-, LGR5<sup>med</sup> and LGR5+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Nevertheless, the morphological differences observed indicated a possible difference in the force spatial pattern. To explore this, we decomposed the traction stress field into a simpler quantity called the dipole moment. This quantity represents the rotational asymmetry of the stress field and defines the major and minor axis of elongation of the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Thus, we used the ratio between the major and minor dipole (Mδ) to quantitatively assess the asymmetry of force distribution in the LGR5-, LGR5<sup>med</sup> and LGR5+ cells. Compared to the LGR5- cells, the two positive groups displayed higher Mδ, indicating a more anisotropic mechanical state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i, j</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We next investigated cell stiffness as a function of their stemness. To do so, we used real time deformability cytometry (RT-DC), a high-throughput microfluidic technique where cells suspended in a highly viscous medium are flowed through a narrow channel and deformed by shear stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We found that, compared to the LGR5<sup>med</sup> and LGR5- cells, LGR5+ cells were less deformed upon application of this shear stress, indicative of a higher stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, c</xref>). Accordingly, they displayed a higher apparent elastic modulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>LGR5+ cells respond to confinement with higher survival and slower ameboid migration</title><p id="P9">Throughout the various steps of the metastatic cascade, cancer cells can encounter confining microenvironments including heterogeneous ECM geometries, 3D longitudinal tracks formed from aligned collagen bundles, porous matrices and narrow inter-endothelial spaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Physical confinement and low adhesion have been shown to promote a fast bleb-based amoeboid-like migration in mesenchymal cells and immune cells, as well as in transformed cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Having observed stemness dependent variations in cell spreading, force generation and stiffness, we hypothesized that LGR5+ cells may respond differently to confinement compared to LGR5- cells. To test this hypothesis, we used a dynamic cell confiner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Single cells (LGR5- and LGR5+ cells mixed at 1:1 ratio) were confined to a precise height between two low-adhesion parallel surfaces. In the absence of confinement and adhesion (suspended cells), the vast majority of PDO cells displayed a round morphology with no blebs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1k</xref>) and an average diameter of 9.3 ± 1.2 μm. As we increased the levels of confinement (7 and 4.5 μm pillar height), the fraction of blebbing cells grew and we identified four distinct response categories: no blebbing, round non-polarized blebs, elongated polarized blebs and cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1k</xref>). Analysis of the distribution of the cell responses at 4.5 μm confinement revealed a higher tendency of the LGR5+ cells to adopt an amoeboid-like blebbing behavior compared to LGR5- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movies 2, 3</xref>). Notably, the LGR5- cells showed a substantial increase in cell death in response to confinement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Next, we investigated whether the response to confinement also involved changes in cell migration in each of the four categories. LGR5- cells displaying polarized blebs moved significantly faster than LGR5+ cells in the same response category, while no significant differences were observed in the migration speed of other categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>, i, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 1l</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movies 4, 5</xref>). These experiments show that LGR5- cells are more fragile under confinement (higher death rate), but those that survive migrate faster.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>LGR5-clusters are rounder, migrate faster and exert less traction</title><p id="P10">Metastases can be seeded not only by single cells but also by highly cohesive epithelial cell groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. We thus explored whether multicellular clusters displayed a mechanical phenotype similar to single cells. To study the mechanics of CRC clusters we extracted self-assembled PDOs from 3D matrix gels and seeded them on gel substrates coated with collagen I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We then studied the mechanical properties of cell clusters dividing them into 3 groups based on LGR5 expression (high, medium and low TdTomato cell clusters), in analogy with our single cell analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, c</xref>). Similarly to single cells, clusters expressing low levels of LGR5 displayed higher roundness on collagen I substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-d</xref>). However, unlike single cells, their migration speed was higher and their mean traction forces were lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e, f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movies 6, 7</xref>). The same trend in cluster speed was observed on a stiffer substrate (Supplementary Fig. d, e). Quantification of myosin light chain phosphorylation (pMLC) of the cluster’s most basal plane indicated higher levels of acto-myosin contractility in the LGR5<sup>high</sup> clusters compared to LGR5<sup>low</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a-c</xref>).</p><p id="P11">These results suggest that cluster spreading and migration can be understood within the biophysical framework of active wetting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Inspired by how a fluid droplet wets a surface, this framework provides a biophysical understanding of how an active contractile cell aggregate spreads and moves on a substrate in terms of a balance between in-plane cell-substrate traction, out-of-plane surface tension and tissue contractility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. A feature of active wetting is that cluster migration is a non-monotonic function of the cell-substrate contact angle; for either high or low spreading (low and high contact angles, respectively) clusters move slowly, but at intermediate spreading (neutral wetting, ~90º contact angles) clusters move rapidly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. To test whether the active wetting framework captures our experiments, we measured the contact angle of LGR5<sup>high</sup>, LGR5<sup>med</sup> and LGR5<sup>low</sup> populations. We found that contact angles decreased with LGR5 expression and, remarkably, that the fastest population (LGR5<sup>low</sup>) displayed contact angles close to neutral wetting regime, where velocity is predicted to be maximal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g-i</xref>). These data support that cluster migration can be explained in terms of active wetting. They highlight, further, that multicellular clusters retain features of single cell behavior but also display emergent mechanical properties which are absent at the single cell level.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>LGR5+ clusters adhere better to the endothelium and form transendothelial gaps</title><p id="P12">One of the fundamental steps in the metastatic cascade is cancer cell extravasation. Circulating tumor cells are found both as single cells and clusters, the latter being less frequent but with higher metastatic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Given the differences in cluster morphology and spreading observed on collagen substrates, we investigated whether clusters with distinct levels of stemness displayed different capacities to adhere to and breach endothelial monolayers. We thus grew cohesive human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) monolayers on collagen-I substrates and confirmed the presence of stable and mature cell-cell junctions through immunostaining for VE-Cadherin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). We then seeded PDOs on top of the monolayer and started imaging one hour after seeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>).

This line displayed an efficient silencing of Radixin and Moesin and mild downregulation of Ezrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>).

For each patient dataset, we divided the cells into two groups based on LGR5 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>) and the mean expression of the ERM proteins was calculated for each group.

Although the degree of upregulation showed considerable variability between patients, it was consistent across almost all patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>).

LGR5+ cells are stiffer, adhere better to the ECM, move slower both as single cells and clusters, display nuclear YAP, and show a high survival rate in response to mechanical confinement. These traits together define a phenotype of mechanical stability and resilience. Conversely, LGR5- cells are softer, less adhesive, and faster, thus displaying a mechanical phenotype corresponding to a more dynamic state. These distinct mechanical features may favor different functions for LGR5+ and LGR5-in the metastatic cascade. The faster, softer, and less adhesive LGR5- cells likely have an advantage to escape the primary tumor and squeeze through the stroma to reach the vasculature. This can explain observations in mice showing that the majority of disseminating cells are LGR5- and that genetic ablation of a subpopulation of LGR5- cells prevents metastatic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. By contrast, the higher adhesion, stiffness, resilience, and nuclear YAP displayed by LGR5+ cells are all suitable mechanobiological features to potentially promote growth at a metastatic site, consistent with studies showing that long term metastatic growth is provided by LGR5+ cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. We also observed that clusters of LGR5+ cells display higher adhesion to the endothelial surface and form transendothelial gaps with higher efficiency than LGR5- cells, suggesting that LGR5+ cells have an increase ability to extravasate. This feature of LGR5+ cells may explain that when LGR5+ and LGR5- are injected in equal amounts into mice, LGR5+ cells are more efficient at seeding metastases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Taken together, our results indicate that differences in mechanical phenotype may provide LGR5+ and LGR5- with differential roles in metastasis; the mechanical features of LGR5- cells are suitable for dissemination from the primary tumor, whereas those of LGR5+ are suitable for extravasation and growth at secondary sites.</p><p id="P22">We show that these differences in mechanical phenotype can be explained by the upregulation of ERM proteins in LGR5- cells. ERMs are highly conserved, homologous proteins that function as linkers between the plasma membrane and the actin cortex. During homeostasis of the healthy intestinal epithelium, Ezrin expression increases as intestinal stem cells differentiate into enterocytes or colonocytes, promoting epithelial polarity and the formation of microvilli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. Our analysis of transcriptomic data from a patient cohort and PDOs showed that the inverse correlation between LGR5 and ERMs expression characteristic of development and homeostasis is retained in tumors. To study whether ERMs expression could explain the observed differences in mechanical phenotypes, we expressed a synthetic linker in LGR5+ cells that mimics the ERM tethering activity in LGR5- cells. Upon doing so, LGR5+ and LGR5- became mechanically indistinguishable, indicating that the ERMs are mainly responsible for the mechanical differences between LGR5+ and LGR5- cells. Conversely, mechanical differences were also reduced when ERM proteins were downregulated in LGR5- cells. From a mechanistic perspective, ERMs have been shown to impair both blebbing and protrusion-based spreading by preventing membrane to cortex separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. Moreover, membrane-cortex tethering has recently been shown to soften the cell cortex by downregulating formin activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>. How ERMs may promote cell death in response to mechanical confinement is less explored, but we speculate that higher tethering increases membrane tension and favors its fracture in response to large deformations. Our study uncovers a previously unexplored link between colorectal cancer stemness and cell surface mechanics.</p><p id="P23">Cancer cell invasion has been attributed to the migration of both individual cells and cell groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>. Here we found that single cells and multicellular clusters share some common mechanical traits dependent on their expression of LGR5. Both single cells and clusters expressing low levels of LGR5 are less adherent to collagen-I substrates and adopt a rounder morphology. However, clusters with different levels of LGR5 expression showed mechanical differences that were absent at the single cell level. Unlike single cells, clusters with lower LGR5 content exerted lower forces on the substrate and moved faster, two features that may provide them with an advantage in invasion. From a physical perspective, the differences in mechanical phenotypes can be interpreted in terms of the theory of active wetting, which was recently shown to explain a coupling between cluster spreading and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Owing to their lower surface tension, which likely originates from lower MCA, LGR5+ cells and clusters are able to wet the surfaces such as collagen-I coated substrates or endothelial monolayers. By contrast, LGR5- cells and clusters are close to a neutral wetting regime, which favors their migration and may render them more sensitive to microenvironmental gradients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P24">Along the metastatic cascade, cancer cells encounter mechanically heterogeneous microenvironments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>. To survive and successfully metastasize, they need to fine-tune their mechanical properties, adapting to the dynamic physical forces they are subjected to. Each one of the mechanical states uncovered by our data, the stable and resilient LGR5+ state in contrast to the dynamic and fragile LGR5- state, may offer an advantage in certain steps of the metastatic cascade but may be detrimental in others. As cancer differentiation is plastic and dependent on microenvironmental stimuli, transition between mechanical states may provide an adaptive mechanism to cope with changing microenvironments throughout the metastatic journey. Hence, we propose that mechanical adaptability coupled with cancer cell plasticity may be a crucial mechanism for metastatic progression.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient derived organoids culture</title><p id="P25">The PDO model used in most of the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments has been previously described and referred to as PDO7 in ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.

To allow higher resolution of traction force distribution, multipole analysis was performed using an inverted Nikon microscope with a spinning disk confocal unit (CSU-WD, Yokogawa) and a Zyla sCMOS camera (Andor, image size 2,048 × 2,048 pixels). The same microscope was used for multidimensional acquisitions of confined sorted PDO single cells, cluster mobility on 2D gel substrates, cluster attachment to an endothelial monolayer. A Nikon ×40 × 0.75 NA air lens objective was used for multipole experiments and clusters experiments. Time-lapses of confined cells were acquired using a ×60 objective (plan apo; NA, 1.2; water immersion). High resolution images of cell clusters, either with live labelling or immunostained were acquired using a ×60 objective (plan apo; NA, 1.2; water immersion) with a z step of 0.25 or 1 μm.
