effector S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) extends lifespan and improves healthspan in mice. However, the underlying mechanisms contributing to the broad range of age-related benefits observed with loss of S6K1 signalling are unclear. Cellular senescence is a stable growth arrest accompanied by an inflammatory phenotype (termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, or SASP). While both cellular senescence and SASP-mediated chronic inflammation contribute to age-related pathology, the specific role of S6K1 signalling in these processes has not been determined. Here, focussing on mouse liver, a key target tissue for the beneficial metabolic effects of loss of S6K1 signalling, we show that S6K1 deletion does not reduce senescence but ameliorates inflammation and immune cell infiltration in aged livers. Using human and mouse models of senescence, we demonstrated that reduced inflammation is a liver-intrinsic effect associated with S6K deletion. Furthermore, gene expression analysis suggested that downregulated cGAS/STING and IRF3 activation might mediate the impaired SASP observed upon S6K deletion. Using a hepatic oncogene induced senescence model, we showed <italic>in vivo</italic> that <italic>S6K1</italic> deletion results in reduced IRF3 activation, impaired production of cytokines such as IL1β and reduced immune infiltration. Overall, deletion of S6K reduces inflammation in the liver suggesting that suppression of the inflammatory SASP by loss of S6K could contribute to explain the beneficial effects of inhibiting this pathway on healthspan and lifespan.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a key role in integrating hormone and nutrient signalling and stress responses with both cellular and organismal growth and metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Furthermore, mTOR signalling plays an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating longevity and healthspan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.

A key effector of mTOR signalling is ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), which plays several roles regulating the translational machinery, cellular energy levels and has feedback effects on insulin signalling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.

Different molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain these effects. For example, loss of S6K1 leads to upregulation of the activity of AMP kinase a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, thus mimicking the effects of CR and motivating the use of metformin as a potential geroprotective drug <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. S6K1 also phosphorylates the glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), which in turn is involved in regulating adiposity and adipose tissue metabolism and this may underlie the beneficial metabolic phenotypes observed in S6K1 null mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.

In these studies, we find that loss of S6K1 attenuates age-related liver pathology, does not influence senescence but reduced liver inflammation via effects on the proinflammatory SASP and immune surveillance. Thus, S6K signalling plays a key role in age-related inflammation (inflammaging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>) and targeting this pathway may be a strategy for treating the diseases of ageing.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>S6K1</italic> deletion attenuates age-related liver pathology</title><p id="P7">To investigate the role of S6K1 in age-related liver pathology, particularly in the regulation of senescence and the SASP, we compared the livers of old (600 day old) <italic>S6K1</italic> WT and KO female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-b</xref>).

Given that the livers of old <italic>S6K1</italic> WT mice displayed lower expression of inflammatory, immunomodulatory cytokines, we speculated that this might result in decreased levels of chronic immune infiltration in old mice. GSEA showed that an immune response signature was significantly upregulated in livers of old <italic>S6K1</italic> WT mice when compared to either young mice or old <italic>S6K1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>).

To study this in more detail, we used quantitative immunohistochemistry on whole liver sections for various immune cell markers. We have previously observed an increase in myeloid and lymphoid infiltrates in the liver of aged mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

These results suggest that the lower infiltration of specific immune cell types observed in livers of old <italic>S6K1</italic> KO mice was due to a specific effect on recruitment into the liver, rather than an alteration in populations or numbers in peripheral blood. Overall, the above results suggest that while S6K1 loss does not result in reduced numbers of senescent cells in liver of old wild-type mice, livers of old <italic>S6K1</italic> KO mice showed less chronic inflammation and immune infiltration than old <italic>S6K1</italic> WT controls.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>S6K regulates the inflammatory SASP in MEFs</title><p id="P14">A possible explanation for the phenotypes observed in the livers of <italic>S6K1</italic> KO mice is that <italic>S6K1</italic> loss results in a selective inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines without affecting other senescence phenotypes.

Image acquisition was set up so that at least 1000 cells/well from multiple fields were detected. The InCell Analyzer 2000 captured images in 4 different wavelengths (DAPI, FITC – 488, Texas Red – 594 and PE-Cy5 – DDAOG). Experiments were performed in either duplicate or triplicate wells. The InCell Investigator software 2.7.3 (GE Healthcare, UK) was used for image processing and quantification. Nuclei segmentation and cell identification was performed using DAPI staining. Nuclei were segmented using a top hat segmentation approach (a minimum area of 120 μm<sup>2</sup>). The cell area was defined using either a collar segmentation approach that placed a border of 2 μm around the DAPI staining or alternatively using cytoplasmic intensity by a multiscale top-hat approach. The cellular expression (nuclear or cytoplasmic) of the protein of interest was calculated by quantifying the mean intensity of pixels in the desired reference channel (FITC 488 or Texas Red 594). A histogram was generated that assigned intensity values for all of the cells in a given sample. Then a threshold filter to define the number of positive and negative cells for the given protein or signal of interest was set up by assigning a nuclear or cytoplasmic intensity value to each cell that correlates to the specific expression. Alternatively, normalized intensity values for a given staining was calculated by measuring the difference between the raw intensity and intensity of the background (secondary antibody alone). The relative fold change to a specified condition <italic>(e.g</italic>., cells treated with 4OHT) was then calculated using the normalised intensity values.
