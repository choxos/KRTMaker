As a natural compound antiviral candidate, we focused on α-dystroglycan, a highly glycosylated basement membrane protein that links the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton. Here we show that the N-terminal fragment of α-dystroglycan (α-DGN), as produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> in the absence of post-translational modifications, blocks infection of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture, human primary gut organoids and the lungs of transgenic mice expressing the human receptor angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Prophylactic and therapeutic administration of α-DGN reduced SARS-CoV-2 lung titres and protected the mice from respiratory symptoms and death. Recombinant α-DGN also blocked infection of a wide range of enveloped viruses including the four Dengue virus serotypes, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, but not human adenovirus, a non-enveloped virus <italic>in vitro</italic>. This study establishes soluble recombinant α-DGN as a broad-band, natural compound candidate therapeutic against enveloped viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>α-dystroglycan</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>coronaviruses</kwd><kwd>enveloped viruses</kwd><kwd>broad-range antiviral</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Dystroglycan (DG) is an adhesion complex expressed in developing and adult tissues, where its main function is to anchor elements of the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the actin cytoskeleton and increase their stability. DG is present as part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <bold>left</bold>) in a variety of tissues and cell types, including skeletal and cardiac muscle, epithelial cells, neurons and glia in the central and peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Dystroglycan is composed of two subunits: the highly glycosylated extracellular α-subunit (α-DG) and the transmembrane β-subunit (β-DG), that interact non-covalently to form a bridge between the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <bold>left</bold>). α-DG is a receptor for ECM proteins such as laminins, perlecan, neurexins and agrin. It is composed of a N- and a C-terminal globular domain, separated by an elongated, extensively glycosylated mucin-like region, a domain arrangement evolutionarily remarkably conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <bold>left</bold>). α-DG acts as the cell receptor for some arenaviruses such as Lassa fever virus (LFV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), that specifically interact with the glycans decorating the mucin-like region of α-DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The proprotein convertase furin cleaves α-DG during maturation in the Golgi apparatus, liberating its N-terminal domain called α-DG N-terminus (α-DGN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, dubbed α-Nt in the dotted circle and zoomed on the right), during maturation in the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Contrary to the rest of the protein, α-DGN is scarcely glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) and it is an autonomous folding unit that constitutes itself of an N-terminal Ig-like domain connected by a flexible loop to a ribosomal RNA binding protein S6-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <bold>right</bold>). Whilst the α-DGN domain harboured by α-DG has been shown to be important for α-DG decoration with glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), the physiological function of the α-DGN is unknown, despite its detection in trace amounts in plasma and cerebrospinal fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). It was recently reported that α-DGN exerts antiviral activity against Influenza A virus in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Here, we show that α-DGN is a broad range antiviral protein that blocks infection by a wide range of enveloped viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and dengue virus.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>α-DGN and its S6-like domain block pseudotyped human coronavirus infection</title><p id="P3">We used <italic>E. coli</italic> to produce recombinant α-DGN from <italic>M. musculus</italic> (<italic>m</italic>α-DGN, residues 50-313) and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> (<italic>h</italic>α-DGN, residues 52-315) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) in the pHis-Trx expression vector <italic>14</italic> either in its original form or modified as described in the Materials and Methods.

Both <italic>m</italic>α-DGN and <italic>h</italic>α-DGN had potent antiviral activity against all pseudoviruses tested. The IC<sub>50</sub> values for SARS-CoV-2-S, SARS-CoV-S, MERS-CoV-S and HCoV-229E-S were 1.99, 4.58, 2.74, and 1.85 μM for <italic>m</italic>α-DGN, and 2.18, 3.86, 3.69, and 2.76 μM for <italic>h</italic>α-DGN, respectively <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>-H and I)</bold>. The ECM protein agrin, recombinantly expressed from <italic>E. coli</italic>, was used as a non-specific protein control. These results established that α-DGN has broad antiviral activity against VSV pseudotyped with different coronavirus spikes.</p><p id="P5">Based on our previous experience in producing shortened versions of <italic>m</italic>α-DGN [8], we then dissected it into its two main domains, the Ig-like and the S6-like domains, to analyse their possible inhibitory potency. We cloned them separately into the pHisTrx(TEV) vector and produced each as described for the full-length protein. The Ig-like domain could not be purified efficiently due its low stability. However, the purified S6-like domain (hereafter <italic>m</italic>S6) was stable in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) as a ∼15 KDa protein and was further tested for its antiviral activity as described above. <italic>m</italic>S6 inhibited infection of VSV pseudotyped with CoV-S proteins from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.64, 2.54, 1.15 and 1.49 μM respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E-H</xref>).

Here, <italic>m</italic>α-DGN blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose-dependent manner, with a 87.2 % infection reduction compared to the buffer control (20mM TrisHCl, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.5) at the highest concentration tested (10 μM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). We further tested the inhibitory activity of <italic>m</italic>α-DGN against infection of VeroE6-TMPRSS2 (VTN) cells with different SARS-CoV-2 variants. The tested variants included the ancestral strain and four variants of concern (VOCs) including Gamma, Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.4 that evolved during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Pre-treatment of cells with 10 μM <italic>m</italic>α-DGN blocked infection of VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells with SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain, Gamma, Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.4 by 80.4, 61.7, 86.4, 84.3 and 82.7 % respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). These data further support the broad-band antiviral activity of α-DGN against authentic SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>α-DGN acts at the early stages of viral infection</title><p id="P7">To test what stage of viral infection is targeted by <italic>m</italic>α-DGN, we analysed its inhibitory activity on the virus as a function of time of administration.

In contrast, addition of <italic>m</italic>α-DGN 2 h after SARS-CoV-2 inoculation resulted in little or no reduction of infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). We tested whether <italic>m</italic>α-DGN affects intracellular SARS-CoV-2 replication using the pSC2-Rep-Wu-Gp-RL replicon that lacks the S and M gene coding sequences (preventing viral assembly and egress) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). RNA replication of the replicon can be measured by the encoded Renilla luciferase (RLuc). Immediately after electroporation with the replicon RNA transcripts, VTN cells were treated with 10 μM <italic>m</italic>α-DGN, buffer control, or remdesivir, a known inhibitor of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase synthesis. Upon incubation for 18 h, we observed no difference in RLuc activity between the mα-DGN- and buffer control-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>) or the immunofluorescence staining of the dsRNA (a marker for viral/replicon RNA replication) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D and E</xref>).

Incubation of AAT or Caco-2-ACE2 cells with 4 μM Alexa Fluor-648 labelled <italic>m</italic>α-DGN in the cold for 30 min revealed that α-DGN binds to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A and B</xref>). α-DGN binding was observed in both AAT and Caco-2-ACE2 cells, suggesting that α-DGN cell binding is not cell-type specific.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>α-DGN blocks SARS-CoV-2 in human primary gut organoids</title><p id="P9">Organoids are miniaturized three-dimensional organs assembled <italic>in vitro</italic> with stem cells or adult cells from specific tissue types. In COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 infects the digestive tract and has been detected in the small intestine, in the colon and in the ileum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Therefore, human primary gut organoids are employed as a model system in SARS-CoV-2 studies for their superior capacity to mimic the complexity of human tissue and organs in physiological as well as pathological conditions, as compared to 2D cell culture models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). To analyse the antiviral activity of <italic>m</italic>α-DGN in these organoids, we first amplified duodenum tissue explants of human donors <italic>in vitro</italic> as three-dimensional multi-crestal organoids. After mechanical disruption to expose the cellular apical surface, the gut organoids were used for inhibition studies. Pre-treatment of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Finland/1/2020 with 10 μM <italic>m</italic>α-DGN decreased the number of infected organoids by 74.9 % (from 20.7 % in the vehicle control to 5.2 % in <italic>m</italic>α-DGN-treated organoids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E and F</xref>).

First, mice were treated with a single dose of 7.5 or 0.75 μg of <italic>m</italic>α-DGN per mouse via the intranasal (IN) route immediately followed by an IN lethal dose (5x10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>) of SARS-CoV-2 (SG12-B strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>)). All animals were monitored daily for weight loss and survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We observed that after one IN administration of α-DGN, mice were protected from a lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a survival rate increase of 20 % and delayed weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B and C</xref>). Moreover, treated mice had significantly reduced endpoint viral loads in their lungs compared to animals receiving only a buffer control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).

Specifically, we further tested <italic>m</italic>α-DGN for its antiviral activity against other enveloped viruses: influenza A virus (IAV) X-31 (H3N2), respiratory syncytia virus (RSV), Semliki Forest virus (SFV), tick-borne encephalitis virus Kuutsalo-14 isolate (TBEV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Dengue virus (DENV), and the non-enveloped human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAdV5). Infection assays were performed in a multiplexed format and automated confocal fluorescence microscopy followed by image analysis was used to determine the fraction of infected cells. Infected cells were identified by immunostaining using antibodies specific for the IAV viral nucleoprotein, TBEV membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) or by detecting the green or red fluorescence of fluorescent reporter genes inserted in the genome of each virus by reverse genetic engineering, specifically: GFP for SFV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), RSV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) and VSV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), and RFP for hAd5, the latter kindly provided by Dr Vincenzo Cerullo, University of Helsinki. <italic>m</italic>α-DGN (10 μM) reduced infection of all enveloped viruses i.e., IAV by 80 %, RSV by 91 %, SFV by 57 %, TBEV by 90 %, VSV by 99 % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-E</xref>). <italic>m</italic>α-DGN reduced the replication of Dengue virus (DENV) serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 by 57, 58, 50 and 42.5 %, respectively, as detected by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G-J</xref>). <italic>m</italic>α-DGN also blocked DENV4 infection of human primary monocytes by 91.3 % (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). <italic>m</italic>α-DGN did not inhibit the non-enveloped virus hAdV5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>).

More than 700 cells (100-250 cells per well) were analysed for each condition.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Infection inhibition assay using DENV</title><sec id="S26"><title>Infection inhibition in Huh7 cells</title><p id="P40">Huh7 cells were pre-treated with <italic>m</italic>α-DGN or an unrelated protein control for 2 h before each of the four DENVs were inoculated at MOI 1 and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. The virus inoculum was then removed, and the cells were maintained in DMEM containing 9% FBS for a further 5 days. Cells and supernatants were collected at the specified time point and stored at -80°C before DENV infection levels were measured by real time-PCR. RNA extraction of cell lysates and supernatant were done using the RNeasy Mini Kit and QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, respectively (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer”s instructions. Next, cDNA synthesis was performed using the qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quantas Biosciences). Viral replication was measured by RT-qPCR using the SYBR Green Supermix Kit (Roche) with primers for pan-serotype DENV and for the TATA box binding protein as a reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).

representation of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). This multiprotein complex, of which dystroglycan (DG) is a central element, anchors the extracellular matrix (ECM) to actin and other components of the cytoskeleton. Extracellular α-DG binds different ECM proteins, such as laminin, while transmembrane β-DG binds the actin cytoskeleton <italic>via</italic> direct interaction with dystrophin. Also depicted are other intracellular molecules associated with the DGC. The N-terminal of α-DG (α-DGN), highlighted in the dashed circle, is liberated in circulation following cleavage by furin. α-Ct: α-DG C-terminal, α-Nt: α-DG N-terminal. <bold>Right</bold>: cartoon representation of the 3D-structure of α-DGN (PDB: 1U2C). Shown are the two domains (N-term Ig-like, in cyan and C-term S6-like, in magenta and enclosed into the full circle) and the position of the flexible undefined loop (FUL) connecting them is indicated. (<bold>B</bold>) Alignment of the amino acid sequences of <italic>m</italic>α-DGN (Uniprot: Q62165, top) and <italic>h</italic>α-DGN (Uniprot: Q14118, bottom), showing a degree of identity of ∼93 % (∼97 % similarity). The sequences of the Ig-like and S6-like domains are highlighted in cyan and magenta boxes, respectively. Amino acid conservation code: (*) identity, (:) strong similarity, (.) weak similarity. (<bold>C</bold>) SDS-PAGE of the recombinant α-DGN proteins (indicated over each lane) used in this study, as final products of the purification procedure.
