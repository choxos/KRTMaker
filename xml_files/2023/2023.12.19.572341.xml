We have previously shown that exosomes are not only made in late endosomes, but also in recycling endosomes marked by the monomeric G-protein Rab11a. These vesicles, termed Rab11a-exosomes, are preferentially secreted under nutrient stress from several cancer cell types, including HCT116 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. HCT116 Rab11a-exosomes have particularly potent signalling activities, some mediated by the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) ligand, Amphiregulin (AREG). Mutant activating forms of KRAS, a downstream target of EGFR, are often found in advanced CRC. When absent, monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, which target the EGFR and block the effects of EGFR ligands, such as AREG, can be administered. Patients, however, inevitably develop resistance to cetuximab, either by acquiring KRAS mutations or via non-genetic microenvironmental changes. Here we show that nutrient stress in several CRC cell lines causes the release of AREG-carrying Rab11a-exosomes. We demonstrate that while soluble AREG has no effect, much lower levels of AREG bound to Rab11a-exosomes from cetuximab-resistant KRAS-mutant HCT116 cells, can suppress the effects of cetuximab on KRAS-wild type Caco-2 CRC cells. Using neutralising anti-AREG antibodies and an intracellular EGFR kinase inhibitor, we show that this effect is mediated via AREG activation of EGFR, and not transfer of activated KRAS. Therefore, presentation of AREG on Rab11a-exosomes affects its ability to compete with cetuximab. We propose that this Rab11a-exosome-mediated mechanism contributes to the establishment of resistance in cetuximab-sensitive cells and may explain why in cetuximab-resistant tumours only some cells carry mutant KRAS.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P3"><fig id="F5" position="anchor"><label>Graphical Abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS192940-f005"/></fig>
</p><p id="P4">This study highlights a clinically relevant mechanism in which stress-induced Rab11a-exosomes carrying the EGFR ligand, Amphiregulin (AREG) transfer drug resistance between genetically distinct colorectal cancer cells. Resistance to cetuximab, an anti-EGFR therapy, can be passed via Rab11a-exosomes from drug-resistant KRAS-mutant cells to previously drug-responsive KRAS-wild type cells. Unlike soluble AREG, Rab11a-exosome-associated AREG competes with cetuximab to activate EGFR signalling and promote EGFR-dependent outcomes, such as growth. This mechanism may support the co-operative evolution of clonal heterogeneity during tumour progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>extracellular vesicle</kwd><kwd>Rab11a-exosome</kwd><kwd>AREG</kwd><kwd>cetuximab</kwd><kwd>EGFR</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Abbreviations</title><glossary><def-list><def-item><term>AG1478</term><def><p id="P5">EGFR kinase domain inhibitor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AREG</term><def><p id="P6">Amphiregulin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p id="P7">Analysis of Variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSA</term><def><p id="P8">Bovine Serum Albumin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Cav-1</term><def><p id="P9">Caveolin-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMS</term><def><p id="P10">Consensus Molecular Subtype</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRC</term><def><p id="P11">Colorectal Cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTX</term><def><p id="P12">Cetuximab</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>dUC</term><def><p id="P13">Differential Centrifugation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMSO</term><def><p id="P14">Dimethyl Sulfoxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EGFR</term><def><p id="P15">Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ERK</term><def><p id="P16">Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESCRT</term><def><p id="P17">Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EV</term><def><p id="P18">Extracellular Vesicle</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FBS</term><def><p id="P19">Foetal Bovine Serum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Gln</term><def><p id="P20">L-glutamine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HER1</term><def><p id="P21">Human EGFR Related 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRP</term><def><p id="P22">Horse Radish Peroxidase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IgG</term><def><p id="P23">Immunoglobulin G</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ILVs</term><def><p id="P24">Intraluminal Vesicles</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITH</term><def><p id="P25">Intratumoral Heterogeneity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITS</term><def><p id="P26">Insulin, Selenium and Transferrin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mTORC1</term><def><p id="P27">mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAPK</term><def><p id="P28">Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mCRC</term><def><p id="P29">metastatic CRC</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSI</term><def><p id="P30">Microsatellite Instability</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSS</term><def><p id="P31">Microsatellite Stability</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NTA</term><def><p id="P32">Nanosight Tracker Analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>n/a</term><def><p id="P33">not applicable</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBS</term><def><p id="P34">Phosphate Buffered Saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="P35">Standard Deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>sEV</term><def><p id="P36">small EV</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEC</term><def><p id="P37">Size-Exclusion Chromatography Syn-1 Syntenin-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TBS</term><def><p id="P38">Tris-Buffered Saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TBST</term><def><p id="P39">TBS with 1% Tween-20</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TEM</term><def><p id="P40">Transmission Electron Microscopy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UCA-1</term><def><p id="P41">Uroepithelial Carcinoma-Associated-1</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P42">Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound structures that appear to be secreted by all cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">van Niel et al., 2022</xref>), and which deliver cargos to recipient cells that play important roles in both physiology and pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Yates et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cheng and Hill., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lucotti et al., 2022</xref>). EVs can be produced by outward protrusion and detachment from the plasma membrane, forming so-called ectosomes, or by inward budding of endosomal membranes to produce vesicles, which are secreted as exosomes, when these endosomes fuse with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dixson et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P43">EVs can be separated and concentrated from conditioned medium or biofluids by methodologies based on physical properties, such as size and density, but the resulting preparations contain heterogenous mixtures of exosomes and ectosomes, as well as aggregated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jeppesen et al., 2019</xref>). For example, small EVs (sEVs) separated and concentrated by differential centrifugation (dUC) or size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) typically contain exosomes, which have a size range of 30-150 nm in diameter, but also include ectosomes of similar size. Consequently, although sEV preparations can be shown to have functional activities in target cells, it is difficult to determine whether they are mediated by the mixed preparation or a specific EV subtype with specialised activities.</p><p id="P44">Microenvironmental stress suppresses signalling by nutrient-sensitive mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Goberdhan et al., 2016</xref>). We have identified a specific subtype of exosome that is preferentially secreted under such stress conditions by colorectal, prostate and cervical cancer cell lines. This stress-induced change is characterised by a switch in exosome biogenesis and secretion, involving reduction in classical CD63-positive exosomes generated in late endosomal compartments and an increase in those formed in Rab11a-labelled recycling endosomes, termed Rab11a-exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fan et al., 2020</xref>). These exosomes are also made under normal physiological conditions, and in some cases constitute a key high proportion of secreted EVs, for example, in the prostate-like secondary cells of the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, where they mediate reproductive signalling between males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Corrigan et al., 2014</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P45">One major exosome biogenesis mechanism involves the endosomal complexes required for transport (ESCRT) proteins, which load exosome cargos, distort the endosomal compartment membrane during inward budding and ultimately pinch off intraluminal vesicles (ILVs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Vietri et al., 2019</xref>). We have recently shown that Rab11a-, but not late endosomal, exosome formation can be blocked by knockdown of several accessory ESCRT-III proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Marie et al., 2023</xref>). These experiments have revealed that Rab11a-exosomes have unique activities in physiology and disease, for example, promoting growth in the colorectal cancer (CRC) HCT116 cell line via a membrane-bound form of Amphiregulin (AREG), the ligand for the EGF receptor (EGFR, otherwise known as human EGFR-related 1, HER1) ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Marie et al., 2023</xref>). This exosome-associated AREG activates the EGFR at concentrations much lower than soluble AREG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P46">In the UK, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer, with an incidence of approximately 42,000 new cases and 16,000 mortalities per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cancer Research UK 2023</xref>). Survival is closely related to disease stage at diagnosis, ranging from 95% five-year survival for stage I to below 10% for stage IV. Surgical resection with or without neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (or chemoradiotherapy) forms the basis of treatment with curative intent.</p><p id="P47">One important form of chemotherapy involves cetuximab, and related chimeric monoclonal antibodies, which target the EGFR and block its signalling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fornasier et al., 2018</xref>). Approximately 40% of CRC patients carry KRAS mutations, and 3% have NRAS mutations, rendering anti-EGFR therapies ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bando et al., 2023</xref>). Cetuximab can, however, be used in combination treatment of metastatic CRC in patients lacking such downstream mutations, but even in these cases, it is not always effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Allegra et al., 2016</xref>). Eventually all patients develop cetuximab resistance. In some cases, the clonal amplification of rare cells carrying activating KRAS mutations may be responsible or <italic>de novo</italic> KRAS mutations may emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Misale et al., 2012</xref>). In others, non-genetic changes in the tumour microenvironment and intercellular communication are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Woolston et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, even when KRAS-mutant cells are present, they often represent a small proportion of the tumour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Misale et al., 2012</xref>). It has been proposed that they may release increased levels of EGFR ligands, such as AREG and TGF-α, which promote resistance in neighbouring KRAS-wild type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hobor et al., 2014</xref>). There has only been limited progress in developing alternative drugs that can improve the survival of patients with advanced CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bando et al., 2023</xref>), so a better understanding of these complex resistance mechanisms to improve patient outcome is an area of particular interest.</p><p id="P48">Here we investigate stress-induced Rab11a-exosome secretion from several different CRC cell lines and test whether this exosome sub-type can mediate cetuximab resistance. We show that membrane-bound AREG located on Rab11a-exosomes from nutrient-stressed, KRAS-mutant HCT116 cells can compete with cetuximab and induce resistance in cells that do not carry KRAS mutations, even when much higher concentrations of soluble AREG have no effect. Our work suggests a novel mechanism by which resistance to anti-EGFR therapy can be established, producing the heterogeneous clonal populations that are frequently observed in drug-resistant patients.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S4"><title>Rab11a-exosome secretion from a range of CRC cell lines is increased in response to mTORC1 inhibition</title><p id="P49">A panel of four cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) representing some of the molecular, cellular and genetic heterogeneity observed in CRC, namely microsatellite instability (MSI)/stability (MSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Flecchia et al., 2022</xref>); consensus molecular subtype (CMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Guinney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Sveen et al., 2018</xref>); proteomic signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Wang et al., 2017</xref>); and oncogene/tumour suppressor status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ahmed et al., 2013</xref>), was investigated to determine whether these cells all secrete more Rab11a-exosomes under nutrient stress. Cells were cultured in serum-free conditions, but the medium was supplemented with insulin, selenium and transferrin (ITS) to maintain growth factor signalling. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was employed to separate the secreted sEVs.</p><p id="P50">In HCT116 cells, downregulation of the mTORC1 signalling pathway in response to glutamine depletion, confirmed by western blot analysis of mTORC1 targets, 4E-BP1 and S6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a, b</xref>), led to a switch to increased secretion of Rab11a-exosomes carrying membrane-bound AREG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Marie et al., 2023</xref>). As previously shown, there was also an increase in sEV-associated levels of the scaffolding protein Caveolin-1 (Cav-1). Experiments using immuno-affinity-separation of sEVs and selective inhibition of Rab11a-exosome secretion suggest that Cav-1, unlike AREG, is associated with alternative stress-induced vesicles that co-separate with Rab11a-exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Marie et al., 2023</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, glutamine depletion did not affect the expression levels of other exosome and EV proteins in cells, except for CD63, which was reduced under stress conditions in both sEVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b</xref>). Furthermore, there was no detectable change in the total number or the size range of these sEVs, as determined by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Analysis of SEC-separated sEVs by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the standard cup-like morphology typically associated with sEV preparations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1g</xref>).</p><p id="P51">We also found that hypoxia, a common microenvironmental stress in fast-growing tumours, previously shown to alter sEV cargos in glioblastoma cells (Kurcharzewska et al., 2013), inhibited mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c</xref>) and increased Rab11a-exosome secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In contrast to glutamine depletion, the levels of sEV-associated CD63 were not reduced under hypoxia, suggesting that secretion of late endosomal exosomes was not reduced by this treatment. Hypoxia-induced vesicles preferentially promoted growth of HCT116 cells under serum-depleted conditions, an activity that could be blocked by adding neutralising anti-AREG antibodies to the sEV preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). A similar inhibitory effect was previously observed on Rab11a-exosome-enriched sEV preparations from glutamine-depleted HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fan et al., 2020</xref>) and suggests that the enhanced growth-promoting effects are mediated by membrane-associated AREG loaded on to hypoxia-induced Rab11a-exosomes.</p><p id="P52">For Caco-2, SW480 and SW620 CRC cell lines, glutamine depletion did not affect mTORC1 activity in a dose-response experiment, as determined by the phosphorylation state of downstream target 4E-BP1, and only variably reduced S6 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a-d</xref>). Each of these cell lines was, however, sensitive to the mTORC1 inhibitor Torin1 in the dose range of between 100-150 nM, which affected both S6 and 4E-BP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2e-g</xref>). Under these conditions, Torin1 treatment induced an increase in sEV-associated Rab11a and Cav-1 (although not for SW620 cells, which lack Cav-1), and a decrease in the tetraspanin CD63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d-f</xref>), but without a change in levels of these proteins in cell lysates (except for reduced CD63 levels in Caco-2 cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1d-f</xref>). Only sEVs from Caco-2 cells contained detectable levels of AREG, but as with HCT116 cells, these levels were strongly increased following mTORC1 inhibition. In Caco-2 cells, however, cellular levels of AREG were not affected by this treatment. Other EV markers, such as Alix, Tsg101, Syn-1 and CD81, were unchanged in sEV preparations from all three cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d-f</xref>) and also in the secreting cells (Fig S1d-f). For all three cell lines, Torin1 treatment did not significantly alter the size of vesicles in sEV preparations: Caco-2, 139 ± 58 nm diameter (control) versus 143 ± 57 nm (Torin1); SW480, 149 ± 55 nm (control) versus 150 ± 49 nm (Torin1); SW620, 111 ± 54 nm (control) versus 109 ± 54 (Torin1). sEV secretion, however, was reduced by about 25% for each of these cell lines, as determined by NTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d-f</xref>). EVs from each cell line produced cup-like particles typical of sEV morphology in TEM studies (Fig S1h-j).</p><p id="P53">In summary, CRC cell lines with different molecular, cellular and genetic properties can be induced to release increased levels of Rab11a-exosomes by reducing cellular mTORC1 signalling, suggesting that secretion of these alternative sEVs is a typical response to stresses that suppress this nutrient sensor. Furthermore, for CRC cells in which exosomal AREG can be detected, namely HCT116 and Caco-2, a membrane-associated form of AREG is also preferentially secreted under these stress conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>HCT116- and Caco-2-derived Rab11a-exosome preparations can induce AREG-dependent growth in Caco-2 cells</title><p id="P54">Rab11a-exosome preparations isolated from HCT116 cells under glutamine-depleted conditions can selectively induce AREG-dependent growth of naïve HCT116 cells cultured in low (1%) serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Marie et al., 2023</xref>). We confirmed these findings using a range of sEV concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). As previously found, sEVs isolated from glutamine-replete cells had no detectable growth-promoting activity. The Rab11a-exosome preparations stimulated growth in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3a, b</xref>), again consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P55">HCT116 cells carry activating mutations in KRAS and PI3KCA, which regulate two major signalling pathways downstream of the EGFR, making them resistant to EGFR inhibition. Nevertheless, CRC tumours are typically heterogenous, consisting of multiple genetically different clones, some of which carry wild type forms of these oncogenes, even within tumours that are resistant to EGFR-targeting chemotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Misale et al., 2012</xref>). We tested whether the growth-promoting activity of HCT116 Rab11a-exosome preparations could also stimulate the growth of cells that did not carry these mutations. Indeed, these preparations selectively promoted the growth of Caco-2 cells, which lack these mutations, under reduced (0.25%) serum conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). These cells were relatively sensitive to Rab11a-exosome preparations; adding 16 x 10<sup>3</sup> versus 4 x 10<sup>3</sup> sEVs per target cell produced a small, but non-significant, increase in growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3c</xref>). Consistent with previous experiments using HCT116 target cells, this effect was blocked by a neutralising anti-AREG antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), which suppressed the sEV-induced activation via phosphorylation of the downstream signalling target ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e, g</xref>).</p><p id="P56">Since mTORC1-inhibited Caco-2 cells also secrete increased levels of Rab11a-exosomes and AREG, when compared to control Caco-2 cells with uninhibited mTORC1 signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), we tested whether sEV preparations from these former cells might also stimulate Caco-2 cell growth in an AREG-dependent fashion. Indeed, Rab11a-exosome-enriched sEVs secreted from Torin1-treated Caco-2 cells produced mild growth-promoting effects on Caco-2 cells cultured in low serum and these effects were selectively inhibited following incubation with an anti-AREG antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f, g</xref>), suggesting that AREG associated with stress-induced Rab11a-exosomes from multiple CRC cell lines can promote growth.</p><p id="P57">Overall, we conclude that under stress conditions, CRC cells secrete increased levels of Rab11a-exosomes, which can stimulate the growth of their neighbours through paracrine signalling involving exosome-associated AREG.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Rab11a-exosomes can induce resistance to cetuximab through an AREG-dependent mechanism</title><p id="P58">EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, are used to treat KRAS-wild type metastatic colorectal cancer, but eventually, resistance to this therapy emerges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Sforza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bhattacharya 2023</xref>). Since sEVs from CRC cells have previously been reported to induce cetuximab resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), we set out to test whether HCT116 sEVs, and in particular Rab11a-exosomes, might mediate such effects.</p><p id="P59">Treatment of KRAS-mutant HCT116 cells and KRAS-wild type Caco-2 cells with cetuximab under serum-replete and -depleted conditions confirmed that while there was no effect on HCT116 cell growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4a, b</xref>), Caco-2 cell growth was sensitive to this drug under both conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4c</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of the phosphorylation state of both the EGFR and downstream ERK in these two cell lines under reduced serum conditions demonstrated that cetuximab selectively inhibited EGFR signalling in Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4d</xref>).</p><p id="P60">In cases where clones of cells carrying activating KRAS mutations emerge in tumours that are resistant to anti-EGFR therapies, it is notable that most of the cells in the tumour do not carry this mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Misale et al., 2012</xref>). We hypothesised that sEVs, and in particular Rab11a-exosomes, released from small numbers of cetuximab-resistant CRC cells under cellular stress, might transfer resistance to cetuximab-sensitive cells, permitting the survival and growth of these cells through paracrine signalling. We therefore undertook growth assays, incubating recipient Caco-2 cells in serum-replete and -depleted conditions with or without stress-induced sEVs from HCT116 cells, and in the presence or absence of cetuximab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P61">In low (0.25%) serum conditions, addition of stress-induced sEVs from glutamine-depleted HCT116 cells significantly stimulated the growth of Caco-2 cells, relative to addition of PBS alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). We have previously shown that these sEV preparations from HCT116 cells carry pg/ml concentrations of sEV-associated AREG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fan et al., 2020</xref>). Reproducing these growth-promoting effects with recombinant AREG required ng/ml concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5a, b</xref>), confirming our previous finding that Rab11a-exosomes induce growth at much lower concentrations of AREG than soluble ligand.</p><p id="P62">Cetuximab reduced the growth of control (PBS) cells, suggesting that part of the growth observed in low serum conditions is stimulated by EGFR ligands. Cetuximab also reduced the growth induced by Rab11a-exosomes, but only to levels observed in control cells that were not treated with cetuximab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Growth was significantly enhanced compared to cells treated with PBS and cetuximab, indicating that stress-induced sEVs induce cetuximab resistance. Importantly, although adding an anti-AREG antibody had no additional growth-inhibitory effect on cells treated with PBS and cetuximab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3ci</xref>), it further suppressed growth in the presence of HCT116 Rab11a-exosomes and cetuximab to the same levels as cetuximab-treated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3cii</xref>). This suggests that the cetuximab resistance mediated by these vesicles is AREG-dependent and therefore associated with Rab11a-exosomes.</p><p id="P63">In high (20%) serum conditions, addition of HCT116 Rab11a-exosome preparations had no significant effect on the growth of Caco-2 cells relative to PBS addition, presumably because growth was already maximally stimulated by growth factors in 20% serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Cetuximab, however, had a completely different effect on cell growth in these two conditions. While it strongly suppressed growth in control (PBS) Caco-2 cells, it had no significant effect on growth in the presence of stress-induced HCT116 sEVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). As in low serum conditions, addition of an anti-AREG antibody had no further growth-inhibitory effect on control (PBS) Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3ei</xref>), but it reduced the growth of Caco-2 cells in the presence of HCT116 sEVs to the levels observed in cetuximab-treated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3eii</xref>).</p><p id="P64">Taken together, these data indicate that HCT116 stress-induced sEV preparations containing Rab11a-exosomes confer cetuximab resistance to KRAS-wild type Caco-2 cells by competing with cetuximab at the EGFR (summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). There are, however, other interpretations. In particular, AREG on Rab11a-exosomes could be acting via a receptor other than the EGFR, or the anti-AREG antibody could indirectly block another signalling activity on Rab11a-exosomes when it binds at the surface of these vesicles. We reasoned that in either of these scenarios, the HCT116 Rab11a-exosome preparations would drive cell growth, even if the EGFR was blocked in a way that did not directly compete with AREG. To test this, we added the EGFR kinase inhibitor, AG1478 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bishop et al., 2002</xref>), to Caco-2 cells treated with PBS or HCT116 Rab11a-exosomes. In this case, growth was similarly inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f, g</xref>), demonstrating that the effects of Rab11a-exosomes on growth are being mediated through the EGFR, even though they are cetuximab-resistant. The pan-HER receptor kinase inhibitor BMS-599626 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Wong et al., 2006</xref>) also completely blocked the growth-promoting effects of HCT116 Rab11a-exosome preparations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5c, d</xref>), consistent with this interpretation.</p><p id="P65">The emergence of cetuximab resistance is an inevitable outcome of cetuximab treatment of KRAS-wild type tumours in metastatic CRC patients. It either involves the amplification of CRC cells carrying an activated KRAS mutation, which constitute a minority clone within a heterogeneous group of wild type KRAS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Misale et al., 2012</xref>), or the development of cetuximab resistance through microenvironmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Woolston et al., 2019</xref>). Whatever the explanation, clonal heterogeneity and paracrine signalling appear to play a key role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chan and Buczaki, 2021</xref>). Indeed, Hodor et al. (2014) have reported an important function for EGFR ligands like AREG in mediating the communication between KRAS-mutant and KRAS-wild type cells in heterogeneous cetuximab-resistant CRC tumours.</p><p id="P66">We have shown that this resistance can be mediated by AREG-loaded, Rab11a-exosomes produced by CRC cells under nutrient or hypoxic stresses, which are commonly experienced by growing tumours. We have previously demonstrated that AREG on these vesicles can enhance CRC growth at concentrations of approximately 1 pg/ml under conditions where soluble AREG requires concentration three orders of magnitude higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fan et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we find that even under serum-replete conditions, where addition of Rab11a-exosomes from mutant KRAS HCT116 cells has no additional growth-promoting effect on KRAS-wild type Caco-2 cells, these exosomes, but not soluble AREG, can compete with cetuximab for EGFR binding and activation. We suggest that the mechanism by which membrane-bound AREG is presented to the EGFR, which may involve AREG clustering or association with other surface proteins, allows this ligand to circumvent the cetuximab blockade, which is normally mediated by high affinity monoclonal antibody binding. Delivery of AREG to target cells in Rab11a-exosome or soluble forms may explain why high levels of AREG have been associated both with improved and poorer outcomes in response to cetuximab treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Williams et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Randon and Pietrantonio, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hong et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P67">Previous studies have suggested that CRC exosomes can promote cetuximab resistance via the PTEN/Akt pathway, another target of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), or via the transfer of the long non-coding RNA uroepithelial carcinoma-associated-1 (UCA-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Our data suggest an alternative mechanism that may explain how KRAS-mutant cells could promote survival of KRAS-wild type cells in a heterogeneous tumour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). These findings suggest that treatments that either block Rab11a-exosome biogenesis or suppress the active cargos on these exosomes might act synergistically with anti-EGFR therapies to inhibit tumour growth and either slow or halt recurrence. In this regard, it is interesting to note that other forms of drug resistance have been attributed to exosome-associated ligands, such a resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors that re-activate the patient’s anti-tumour response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Poggio et al., 2019</xref>). It will be interesting to explore whether stress-induced Rab11a-exosomes are involved in this resistance mechanism and whether selectively suppressing the production of these vesicles might provide a new therapeutic strategy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P68">The CRC cell lines were purchased from ATCC to ensure authenticity.

NTA analysis reveals that the total number and size distribution of secreted particles is unchanged by this treatment. (c) Western blot of sEV proteins isolated from HCT116 cells cultured in hypoxic (1% O<sub>2</sub>) versus normoxic conditions also reveals an increase in markers of Rab11a-exosomes (Rab11a and AREG) and other stress-induced sEVs (Cav-1).
