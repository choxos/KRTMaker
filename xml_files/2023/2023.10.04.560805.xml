We hypothesized that the high rate of comorbidity developing after a stroke might have a shared immunological cause, however, the chronic effects of brain injury on systemic immunity have so far been barely investigated. Here, we identified myeloid innate immune memory as a cause of remote organ dysfunction after stroke. Using single-cell sequencing, we identified persistent pro-inflammatory transcriptomic changes in resident monocytes/macrophages in multiple organs one month after experimental ischemic brain injury, which was particularly abundant in the heart and associated with the development of cardiac fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction. A similar phenotype was seen in myocardial autopsy samples from stroke versus control patients. We observed chronic functional changes in myeloid hematopoiesis driven by post-stroke IL-1β-mediated epigenetic changes. These alterations could be transplanted to naïve recipient mice and were sufficient to induce cardiac dysfunction. By effectively blocking the trafficking of pro-inflammatory monocytes from the bone marrow to the heart using a dual CCR2/5 inhibitor, we successfully prevented post-stroke cardiac dysfunction. This approach holds promising potential as a novel immune-targeted secondary prevention therapy. We anticipate that the epigenetic immune reprogramming mechanisms detailed here for the brain-heart axis could be generalized to provide a novel framework for explaining the development of various comorbidities after acute tissue injury in remote organs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">We and others have previously shown that acute brain injuries induce a sterile, systemic inflammatory response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> The inflammatory response to sterile injury is rapidly initiated by the release of immunogenic alarmins, such as nuclear proteins or DNA from necrotic cells to the blood circulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> It is further characterized by an increase in blood cytokine levels, the mobilization of immune cells and profound changes in immune cell composition and function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> In contrast to the acute inflammatory response within hours to few days, the chronic effects of brain injury on systemic immunity are largely unknown. Few studies mainly investigating blood biomarkers have suggested chronic changes in the concentrations of circulating cytokines and other inflammatory markers, such as Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, C-reactive protein (CRP), Interferon (IFN)-γ and High-Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> However, a detailed analysis of the chronically compromised systemic immune compartment after brain injury is still missing and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Acute brain injuries due to ischemic stroke are a leading cause of mortality and long-term disabilities in adults. Besides the early mortality and morbidity due to the ischemic brain injury itself, long-term morbidity after stroke is also due to the high prevalence of secondary comorbidities and complications, such as cognitive impairment and dementia, post-stroke depression, cardiac events, persistent vascular inflammation and stroke-induced metabolic disturbances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> Yet, the exact cause of this increased risk of long-term secondary comorbidities after stroke remains elusive.</p><p id="P3">Recent studies have demonstrated long-term changes in the function of innate immune cells after bacterial infections or vaccination. This phenomenon has been termed innate immune memory or ‘trained immunity’ in contrast to antigen-specific adaptions in long-lived lymphocytes (T and B cells).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Innate immune memory has been demonstrated in proof-of-concept infection studies to alter the responsiveness to pathogens after re-infection. This represents a beneficial evolutionary mechanism for the clearance of infectious pathogens, but can also result in potentially pathological functions during aging and autoimmunity due to aberrant inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> While the concept of trained immunity has been developed for innate immune memory after infection, barely any information is available for similar mechanisms after sterile tissue injuries. Epigenetic changes in myeloid cells have been reported in models of organ transplantation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> experimental arthritis and in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> Moreover, alarmin mediators released after sterile tissue injury utilize the same pattern recognition receptors as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and therefore might instigate similar downstream effects on innate immunity. Therefore, we hypothesized that sterile tissue injuries such as stroke might result in similar long-term innate immune memory as observed after infections, and that these long-term immunological consequences after stroke might drive secondary comorbidities.</p><p id="P4">Using single-cell sequencing of tissue-resident macrophages and circulating monocytes, we observed substantial transcriptomic changes to a pro-inflammatory phenotype one month after experimental stroke. These changes were present across all peripheral organs. Cardiac monocytes/macrophages showed the most pronounced long-term transcriptomic changes, which were associated with the development of cardiac dysfunction due to fibrosis and increased cardiac inflammation after brain ischemia both in experimental mice and in stroke patients. We identified IL-1β-driven epigenetic changes in the myeloid compartment, which in transplantation experiments was proven to be causative of the long-term cardiac phenotype after stroke. Finally, blocking the recruitment of monocytes after stroke to remote organs prevented secondary cardiomyopathy.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Stroke induces long-term inflammatory changes in systemic monocytes/macrophages</title><p id="P5">To test a potential effect of stroke on long-term systemic inflammation, we performed a comprehensive single-cell mRNA sequencing analysis of CD45+CD11b+ myeloid cells from blood and multiple peripheral organs 1 month after experimental ischemic stroke, which have previously been associated with inflammatory consequences of brain injury in the acute phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> After performing unsupervised clustering, we projected a total of 29,124 myeloid cells and identified 20 independent clusters based on the most variable genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A-C</xref>). We observed a large number of genes still being differentially regulated at this late chronic time point after stroke particularly within the population of monocytes/macrophages, while other cell populations including neutrophils or dendritic cells were less affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>). Transcriptomic changes in monocytes/macrophages after stroke were associated with a pro-inflammatory phenotype, characterized by significant upregulation of various biologically relevant inflammatory signaling pathways of circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages, including increased expression of genes involved in chemotaxis and cell adhesion (e.g. Cx3cr1, Lyz2, Icam1 and Itga4), cytokine- and interferon (IFN)-mediated signaling pathways (e.g. Csf1r, Cebpa, Itgb2, Il10ra, Aim2, Irf8 and Irf5) and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (e.g. Irak2 and Tab2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, through a biological network analysis, we confirmed the involvement of other pro-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-12, IL-1 and IFN-α and -β, and the downstream NF-kb and Akt signaling pathways in the activated phenotype of resident monocytes/macrophages in peripheral organs one month after stroke (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1F</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Across organs, changes in the monocyte/macrophage population where particularly pronounced in the heart and liver. Principal component analysis based on a total of 18.835 genes showed that changes in blood, spleen, and lung were more subtle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1G</xref>). Specifically, we detected the selective expansion of a Ly6C<sup>high</sup>-expressing monocyte population in hearts 1 month after stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1H</xref>), which changed the differentiation trajectories of monocytes to cardiac macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). In addition, cardiac Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes after stroke showed increased expression of genes related to tissue residency when compared to circulating monocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1I</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that stroke chronically promotes the recruitment of circulating Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes to the heart, which might further differentiate into tissue-resident macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Stroke results in chronic cardiac diastolic dysfunction</title><p id="P7">To assess the functional consequences of changes in the cardiac monocyte/macrophage population during the chronic phase following stroke, we investigated cardiac function using Doppler echocardiography. We observed a persistent reduction in end-diastolic left ventricle (LV) volume, while the systolic function, measured by the ejection fraction and fractional shortening, was only transiently affected by stroke in the acute phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). These findings suggest the selective development of chronic diastolic dysfunction, which was further confirmed using pulse wave doppler of the apical four-chamber-window demonstrating compromised left ventricular compliance by decreased mitral valve E wave deceleration time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). Heart failure in patients with preserved ejection fraction but diastolic dysfunction is commonly associated with cardiac fibrosis, which impairs the rapid LV filling due to increased myocardial stiffness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> Hence, we evaluated the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in hearts one month after stroke or in control mice and observed significantly increased LV fibrosis mainly due to increased deposition of Type I collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C,D</xref>). Further analysis of collagen orientation in the LV myocardium by second harmonic generation microscopy revealed increased fiber disorganization after stroke, suggesting ECM remodeling in addition to increased deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed cardiac matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity—key effector enzymes in ECM remodeling—in stroke and control mice and observed significantly increased MMP9 activity by gel zymography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>) as well as total pro-MMP9 protein content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E</xref>). More specifically, we detected by smFISH significantly increased <italic>Mmp9</italic> transcripts in cardiac macrophages, as the most likely source of increased cardiac MMP9 expression, which was confirmed by rt-PCR of sorted cardiac monocytes/macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F</xref>). Corresponding to results of the single-cell sequencing analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F,G</xref>), we also observed by flow cytometry an increased number of CCR2<sup>+</sup> cardiac macrophages in post-stroke hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2G</xref>), suggesting a higher infiltration of circulating monocytes and an enhanced monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation chronically after stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> In addition, we observed that circulating monocytes after stroke also have a significantly increased expression of <italic>Mmp9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>), which suggests a causative role of infiltrating monocytes on the enhanced MMP9 activity in the post-stroke heart.</p><p id="P8">We next aimed to validate the translational relevance of these observations. For this, we obtained myocardial autopsy samples from patients that had died 1-3 months after stroke or from age-matched control subjects that had died without cardiac or brain disorder (confirmed by autopsy, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We observed significantly increased ECM deposition in the left ventricular wall of stroke patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B,C</xref>) and detected a significant increase in CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocyte counts in post-stroke hearts, which correlated with cardiac collagen content, while total monocyte and macrophage counts did not differ between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D-F</xref>). Consistent with our experimental results, human cardiac macrophages also expressed significantly more <italic>MMP9</italic> transcripts after stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Finally, we performed bulk mRNA sequencing on adjacent tissue sections used for the histological analyses above and found significant transcriptional differences between control subjects and after stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H,I</xref>). Interestingly, several of the upregulated genes in stroke patients were associated with extracellular matrix remodeling including <italic>PON1</italic> (paraoxonase 1) and <italic>KRTCAP2</italic> (Keratinocyte-associated protein 2). Taken together, we observed marked cardiac fibrosis and ECM remodeling in both experimental mice and stroke patients, which was further associated with diastolic dysfunction after experimental stroke. A hallmark of this secondary cardiac pathology after stroke is the increased recruitment and proinflammatory profile of cardiac monocytes/macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Bone marrow cellularity and function is chronically altered after stroke</title><p id="P9">To explore the potential mechanisms of post-stroke immune mediated cardiac dysfunction, we performed an in-depth analysis of the myeloid compartment in the chronic phase after stroke. This was motivated by the finding that, based on in vivo EdU-labeling experiments, more than 95% of cardiac myeloid cells will have been replaced within one month after stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Indeed, using an inducible myeloid progenitor reporter mouse strain (Ms4a3<sup>creERT2</sup>xAi14; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A-C</xref>), we observed substantial cellular recruitment of cardiac monocytes/macrophages with turn-over of approx. 20% of cardiac monocytes/macrophages within 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed long-term effects of stroke on the bone marrow by single cell sequencing, identifying 21 cell clusters and the respective differentiation trajectories from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to all other mature myeloid populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D,E</xref>). Subsequently, we computed the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between stroke and control conditions for each of these populations, revealing a distinct transcriptomic signature in Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes chronically after stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Additionally, we observed a substantial number of DEGs in HSPCs, suggesting that not only mature monocytes but also progenitor populations exhibited persistent transcriptional alterations during the chronic stage after stroke. To validate these findings, flow cytometry analyses were conducted, confirming altered bone marrow cellularity characterized by increased numbers of mature monocytes and neutrophils, as well as significantly increased myeloid progenitor populations after stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3F</xref>). Labeling of proliferating cells with a single intraperitoneal EdU injection one month after stroke indicated significantly increased proliferation rates of myeloid progenitor cell populations as the most likely cause of the chronically altered BM cellularity after stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Stroke induces persistent innate immune memory</title><p id="P10">To test the persistence and potentially causal role of the observed myeloid changes chronically after stroke, we transplanted enriched progenitor and stem cells from bone marrows one month after stroke or control mice into naïve recipients, using a genetic BM depletion model (poly(I:C) administration to Mx1<sup>Cre</sup>:c-myb<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice) in order to avoid confounding effects by irradiation or chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). One month after transplantation, we isolated eGFP-positive transplanted myeloid cells for single-cell mRNA sequencing and confirmed successful BM repopulation for all analyzed animals, without differences in the BM repopulation potential between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A-F</xref>). Differential gene expression between stroke and control transplanted BM cells showed substantial transcriptomic differences one month after transplantation in the naïve recipient mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4G,H</xref>). Interestingly, comparing the most significantly regulated transcriptomic pathways between the transplanted groups to the original difference one month after stroke and control revealed a highly conserved phenotype in the transplanted cells after stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Both BM cells from stroke mice and BM cells from recipient mice transplanted with stroke BM cells retained a pro-inflammatory activated phenotype and showed sustained high expression of genes involved in chemotaxis and cell adhesion, monocyte activation, and cytokine- and interferon (IFN)-mediated signaling pathways. Projecting all individual samples into a PCA bidimensional space, we found that cells from mice transplanted with stroke BM showed spatial proximity to cells from stroke mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4I</xref>), confirming that myeloid cells acquire a distinct pro-inflammatory phenotype after stroke that is transmissible by BM transplantation.</p><p id="P11">Next, we analyzed the hearts of BM recipient mice for hallmarks of ECM remodeling observed after stroke. We found significantly increased <italic>Mmp9</italic> expression in cardiac macrophages of mice receiving BM from stroke donors in comparison to control donors and more specifically, an increase of <italic>Mmp9</italic> expression particularly in transplanted GFP-positive cardiac monocytes/macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 D,E</xref>). Moreover, we observed significantly increased cardiac fibrosis in animals receiving the stroke BM transplant in comparison to control BM recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate that myeloid function is not only stably altered after stroke but that these changes in the myeloid compartment are sufficient to drive secondary cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Innate immune memory is mediated by early post-stroke Interleukin-1β secretion</title><p id="P12">We have previously identified systemic inflammasome activation and subsequent secretion of Interleukin (IL)-1β as a hallmark of the acute inflammatory response to tissue injury including stroke, with serum IL-1β concentrations peaking within the first hours after injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> Studies in experimental infection models have suggested IL-1β-mediated effects to be involved in epigenetic reprogramming and innate immune memory following infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> Therefore, we tested the effect of neutralizing the early secretion of IL-1β in response to stroke by systemic administration of IL-1β-specific monoclonal antibodies on bone marrow composition and transcriptomic features one month later. By flow cytometry, we observed efficient normalization of bone marrow cellularity to levels of control mice in animals receiving IL-1β neutralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A,B</xref>). To further test the hypothesis of potential epigenetic changes in myeloid cells by the acute IL-1β secretion after stroke, we performed single-cell ATAC sequencing for analysis of open chromatin accessibility in control mice and in animals one month after stroke which either received IL-1β neutralizing antibodies or vehicle control 1h before and after stroke induction. We obtained a total of 13,520 nuclei from Lin<sup>-</sup> CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> BM cells, and identified a total of 11 clusters which were superimposed on the BM mRNA sequencing UMAP plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), confirming coverage of the complete BM cell heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C-E</xref>). We identified in the HSPC as well as in the mature Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte clusters distinct differences in chromatin accessibility one month after stroke in comparison to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Next, we particularly focused on potentially important cell-type-specific differentially-active regulatory sequences,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and identified significant changes in DNA transcription factor (TF) motifs between stroke and control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). This analysis revealed that stroke induced a pronounced alteration in the activity of several TF in HSPC, including CTCF, ETV4 and RUNX2, which have been previously described to regulate HSPC function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> Similarly, stroke also changed the epigenetic landscape of mature Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes, by changing the motif accessibility associated with TF involved in stress and immune responses, such as CTCF, NRF1 (also known as NFE2) and FOS:JUND(AP1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> Importantly, we observed that post-stroke IL-1β neutralization prevented most of the stroke-induced changes in chromatin accessibility and attenuated post-stroke differential TF motif activities in both, HSPC and mature Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes. To explore the functional relevance of the stroke-regulated TFs, we identified genes differentially expressed between control and stroke conditions that were significantly associated with DNA sequences regulated by these transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). These genes were associated with a number of functional pathways in inflammation and cytokine signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). Finally, we observed that neutralization of the early IL-1β release was sufficient to prevent the long-term cardiac phenotype by significantly reducing <italic>Mmp9</italic> expression of cardiac monocytes/macrophages and cardiac fibrosis to levels of control mice without a stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G,H</xref>). These findings confirm the hypothesis that IL-1β-driven epigenetic changes leading to innate immune memory can be causally involved in mediating remote organ dysfunction after stroke.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Blocking BM-to-heart trafficking of monocytes prevents post-stroke cardiac dysfunction</title><p id="P13">Despite its striking efficacy on innate immune memory and cardiac secondary comorbidities, the translational use of neutralizing IL-1β in stroke patients is limited by an increased risk of infections as revealed by recent clinical trials using IL-1β-neutralizing strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> Therefore, we sought for alternative options that could limit secondary remote organ pathologies due to innate immune memory. To block the migration of pro-inflammatory reprogrammed myeloid cells to secondary organs such as the heart after stroke we tested the dual C-C chemokine receptors type 2 and 5 antagonist Cenicriviroc (CVC), which has been developed and proven safe for HIV infections and for steatohepatitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> We found that daily treatment with CVC after experimental stroke substantially reduced monocyte recruitment to the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A,B</xref>). This effect is likely attributable to blocking the chemokine-dependent invasion of monocytes to secondary organs because CVC increased circulating Ly-6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte counts and had no direct cytotoxic effect on monocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6C,D</xref>). Consequently, CVC treatment significantly reduced <italic>Mmp9</italic> expression by cardiac monocytes/macrophages and reduced cardiac fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C,D</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6E</xref>). Importantly, this therapeutic reduction in inflammatory cardiac ECM remodeling by CVC also significantly improved diastolic cardiac function in the chronic phase after stroke to comparable levels of control mice without a stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E</xref>). In summary, these results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of blocking the BM-to-heart migration of pro-inflammatory programmed monocytes as a means to prevent secondary cardiac comorbidity and alleviate inflammatory cardiac fibrosis following stroke.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">Systemic inflammation following a stroke has been identified as a critical factor affecting the short- and long-term prognosis of stroke patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> Interestingly, many of the pre-existing or acquired health conditions that arise after a stroke share common inflammatory mechanisms. These mechanisms can potentially exacerbate the development of other medical complications, leading to a worsened long-term outcome. Consequently, addressing systemic inflammation has emerged as a novel focus for translational research, with initial clinical trials already conducted to minimize functional disabilities in patients and prevent secondary complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> Our study reveals that stroke triggers persistent inflammation in multiple organs by inducing innate immune memory. Specifically, we discovered that IL-1β-mediated epigenetic changes in the myeloid compartment play an unrecognized role in cardiac fibrosis, leading to diastolic dysfunction following ischemic brain injury.</p><p id="P15">Cardiovascular diseases, such as atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, and congestive heart failure, are well-known risk factors for ischemic stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> However, this relationship is bidirectional, as the incidence of cardiovascular disorders also increases after an initial stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> After a stroke, more than 60% of patients experience electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> 25% are diagnosed with serious arrhythmias,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> and approximately 19% develop at least one significant cardiac adverse event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> Previous studies in mice have demonstrated that stroke results in chronic systolic dysfunction lasting up to 8 weeks after the brain injury, leading to a delayed reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and an increase in left ventricular volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> The SICFAIL study, a prospective clinical study involving 696 stroke patients, demonstrated a surprisingly high incidence of cardiac dysfunction after stroke. Diastolic dysfunction was found to be the most prevalent type of cardiac dysfunction, affecting 23% of patients without signs of systolic dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> This study clearly highlights the previously unrecognized burden of secondary cardiac dysfunction following ischemic stroke.</p><p id="P16">Although diastolic dysfunction is highly prevalent not only after stroke but also in other comorbidities within the same population (such as smoking, diabetes, and hypertension), it lacks well-defined diagnostic criteria and is not routinely assessed in stroke patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> Recognizing diastolic dysfunction as a pre-symptomatic stage leading to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction could provide an opportunity for targeted secondary prevention if it is identified early.</p><p id="P17">Patients with chronic systemic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, or psoriatic arthritis, are known to have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. For example, a recent population-based cohort study described an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease even in the absence of common risk factors like obesity, lipid disturbances, or hypertension, suggesting that inflammation may be a key factor underlying the development of these cardiovascular complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that the systemic inflammatory response triggered by the ischemic brain lesion itself may further predispose stroke patients to secondary (inflammatory) vascular events.</p><p id="P18">Here, we confirmed this hypothesis by identifying that persistent pro-inflammatory changes in myeloid cells after stroke are a causal factor for the development of cardiac fibrosis independent of other predisposing factor for cardiovascular disorders. Innate immune memory—defined as long-term changes in the innate immune cell compartment that alters its responsiveness to a second stimulation—has so far been described in infection models and in vaccination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Importantly, innate (trained) immunity to a pathogen not only heightened innate immune responsiveness to the same pathogen but was demonstrated to also affect unrelated inflammatory processes, as for example the disease-modifying effect of periodontitis for atherosclerosis progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> In this study, we make the novel observation of innate immune memory in response to a sterile tissue injury, which links this acute event to the development of a chronic, secondary pathology at a remote organ site.</p><p id="P19">Our study highlights IL-1β-mediated epigenetic changes and the recruitment of reprogrammed cells to the healthy heart as critical events in the development of chronic secondary organ dysfunction after a stroke. Based on our findings, targeting IL-1β systemically can potentially prevent post-stroke epigenetic changes and the resulting pro-inflammatory effects on remote organ homeostasis. This aligns well with previous research demonstrating IL-1β’s ability to induce innate immune memory and the cardiovascular benefits observed in the CANTOS trial using anti-IL-1β therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> However, the trial also revealed significant risks of increased infection rates associated with this non-specific approach that targets a key pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in pathogen clearance. This limitation poses a challenge for the further development of this approach in translational research.</p><p id="P20">Therefore, in our study, we explored an alternative strategy to limit the recruitment of monocytes from the bone marrow and circulation to remote organs by using a dual chemokine inhibitor targeting CCR2/5 (Cenicriviroc).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> Notably, genetic studies have provided evidence of the involvement of CCL2-CCR2 signaling in various cardiovascular disorders, suggesting that targeting this signaling pathway could have beneficial effects on monocyte recruitment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> Moreover, Cenicriviroc has demonstrated safety and efficacy in other conditions, including HIV and hepatosteatosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> Considering our findings regarding the beneficial effects of this approach in limiting secondary organ dysfunction caused by pro-inflammatory reprogrammed circulating monocytes, further clinical evaluation of this therapy in stroke and other sterile tissue injuries seems warranted.</p><p id="P21">In conclusion, our study provides mechanistic insights into immune-mediated secondary comorbidities following stroke, such as cardiac dysfunction and potentially others. We have identified myeloid innate immune memory as a causal mechanism underlying chronic changes in resident innate immune cells across multiple organs, which contribute to the development or progression of secondary organ dysfunction. Our findings confirm the efficacy of therapeutically targeting this cascade in mice by either preventing epigenetic reprogramming through IL-1β neutralization or by inhibiting the circulation of reprogrammed monocytes to secondary target organs like the heart using CCR2/5 inhibitors. These discoveries offer a novel therapeutic rationale for the secondary prevention of post-stroke comorbidities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental material</label><media xlink:href="EMS189383-supplement-Supplemental_material.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d91aAdDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S10"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Christina Fürle and Kerstin Thuß-Silczak for excellent technical support.
