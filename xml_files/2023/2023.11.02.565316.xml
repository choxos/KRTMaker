Spontaneously occurring synaptic events carry fundamental information about synaptic function and plasticity. However, their stochastic nature and low signal-to-noise ratio present major challenges for the reliable and consistent analysis. Here, we introduce miniML, a supervised deep learningbased method for accurate classification and automated detection of spontaneous synaptic events. Comparative analysis using simulated ground-truth data shows that miniML outperforms existing event analysis methods in terms of both precision and recall. miniML enables precise detection and quantification of synaptic events in electrophysiological recordings. We demonstrate that the deep learning approach generalizes easily to diverse synaptic preparations, different electrophysiological and optical recording techniques, and across animal species. miniML provides not only a comprehensive and robust framework for automated, reliable, and standardized analysis of synaptic events, but also opens new avenues for high-throughput investigations of neural function and dysfunction.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>Machine learning</kwd><kwd>Data analysis</kwd><kwd>Neurons</kwd><kwd>Electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>Imaging</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Synaptic communication serves as the fundamental basis for a wide spectrum of brain functions, from computation and sensory integration to learning and memory. Synaptic transmission either arises from spontaneous or action potential-evoked fusion of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kaeser and Regehr, 2014</xref>) resulting in an electrical response in the postsynaptic cell. Such synaptic events are a salient feature of all neural circuits and can be recorded using electrophysiological or imaging techniques.</p><p id="P3">Random fluctuations in the release machinery or intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration cause spontaneous fusions of single vesicles (’miniature events’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kavalali, 2015</xref>), which play an important role in synaptic development and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Banerjee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kaeser and Regehr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kavalali, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">McKinney et al., 1999</xref>). Measurements of amplitude, kinetics, and timing of these events provide essential information about the function of individual synapses and neural circuits. Miniature events are therefore key to our understanding of fundamental processes, such as synaptic plasticity or synaptic computation that support neural function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abbott and Regehr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Holler et al., 2021</xref>). For example, amplitude changes of miniature events are a proxy of neurotransmitter receptor modulation, which is thought to be the predominant mechanism driving activity-dependent long-term alterations in synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Huganir and Nicoll, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Malinow and Malenka, 2002</xref>) and homeostatic synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">O’Brien et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>). In addition to spontaneous vesicle fusions, synaptic events can also result from presynaptic action potentials in neural networks. Alterations in spontaneous neurotransmission have been observed in models of different neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Alten et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Ardiles et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Miller et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, a comprehensive analysis of synaptic events is paramount for studying synaptic function and understanding neural diseases. However, the detection and quantification of synaptic events in electrophysiological or fluorescence recordings remains a major challenge. Synaptic events are often small in size, resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and their stochastic occurrence further complicates reliable detection and evaluation.</p><p id="P4">Several techniques have been developed for synaptic event detection: Finite-difference approaches use crossings of a predefined threshold, typically in either raw data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kim et al., 2021</xref>), baseline-normalized data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kudoh and Taguchi, 2002</xref>), or their derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Ankri et al., 1994</xref>). Template-based methods use a predefined template and generate a matched filter via a scaling factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Clements and Bekkers, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Jonas et al., 1993</xref>), deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Pernía-Andrade et al., 2012</xref>) or an optimal filtering approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Shi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Zhang, Schlögl, et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, Bayesian inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Merel et al., 2016</xref>), machine learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Wang, Marino, et al., 2024</xref>), and peak finding routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Mori et al., 2024</xref>) can be used to detect synaptic events. These techniques have facilitated the analysis of synaptic events. However, they also have several relevant limitations, such as a strong dependence of detection performance on a threshold and other decisive hyperparameters, or the need for visual inspection of results by an experienced investigator to avoid false positives. The widespread use of synaptic event recordings and the difficulty in obtaining results that are reliable across investigators and laboratories highlight the need for an automated, accurate, efficient, and reproducible synaptic event analysis method.</p><p id="P5">Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as deep learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">LeCun et al., 2015</xref>) can significantly enhance biological data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Richards et al., 2022</xref>) and thus contribute to a better understanding of neural function. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are especially effective for image classification, but can also be used for one-dimensional data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Fawaz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Wang, Yan, et al., 2016</xref>). CNNs have been successfully applied in neuroscience to segment brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Iqbal et al., 2019</xref>), detect synaptic vesicles in electron microscopy images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Imbrosci et al., 2022</xref>), identify spikes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Rupprecht, Carta, et al., 2021</xref>), and localize neurons in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Yip et al., 2021</xref>), or neurons with fluorescence signals in time-series data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Denis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Sitá et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Here, we present <italic>miniML</italic>, a novel approach for detecting and analyzing spontaneous synaptic events using supervised deep learning. The miniML model is an end-to-end classifier trained on an extensive dataset of annotated synaptic events. When applied to time-series data, miniML provides high-performance event detection with negligible false-positive rates, outperforming existing methods. The method is fast, robust to threshold choice, and generalizable across diverse data types, allowing for efficient and reproducible analysis, even for large datasets. We anticipate that AI-based synaptic event analysis will greatly enhance the investigation of synaptic function, plasticity, and computation from the individual synapse to the network level.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>miniML enables highly accurate classification of synaptic events</title><p id="P7">To investigate whether an AI model can detect stochastic synaptic events in noisy single-trial time-series data, we designed a deep neural network consisting of CNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and fully connected dense layers (’miniML’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The CNN-LSTM model takes a section of a univariate time-series recording as input and outputs a label for that section of data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The miniML model is trained to classify short segments of electrophysiological data as either positive or negative for a synaptic event using supervised learning. The trained classifier can then be applied to unseen time-series data to localize events.</p><p id="P8">To train the miniML model, we first extracted a large number of synaptic events and corresponding event-free sections from previous voltage-clamp recordings of cerebellar mossy fiber to granule cell (MF–GC) miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Delvendahl et al., 2019</xref>). All samples were then visually inspected and labeled to generate the training dataset. We applied data augmentation techniques to include examples of typical false positives in the training data (Materials and Methods). In total, the training data comprised ~30,000 samples that were split into training and validation sets (0.75/0.25). Across training epochs, loss decreased and accuracy increased, stabilizing after ~30 epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The model with the highest validation accuracy was selected for further use, achieving 98.4% (SD 0.1, fivefold cross-validation). Saliency map analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Simonyan et al., 2013</xref>) indicated that the AI model mainly relied on the data sections around the peak of synaptic events to discriminate with respect to the labels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The trained miniML model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve close to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating almost perfect separability of the classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Deep learning typically requires large datasets for training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">van der Ploeg et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate how miniML’s classification performance depended on the dataset size, we systematically varied the number of training samples. As expected, the accuracy increased with larger datasets. However, the performance gain was marginal when exceeding 5,000 samples (&lt;0.2%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that relatively small datasets suffice for effective model training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bailly et al., 2022</xref>). These results demonstrate the efficacy of supervised deep learning in accurately classifying segments of neurophysiological data containing synaptic events.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The miniML model robustly detects synaptic events in electrophysiological recordings</title><p id="P9">Synaptic events are typically recorded as continuous time-series data of either membrane voltage or current. To apply the trained classifier to detect events in arbitrarily long data, we used a sliding window approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Time-series data are divided into overlapping sections that correspond to the input shape of the CNN-LSTM classifier. We used a stride for the sliding window, which reduces the number of inferences needed and speeds up the computation time while maintaining high detection performance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). By reshaping the data into short sections, model inference can be run in batches and employ parallel processing techniques, including graphics processing unit (GPU) computing, resulting in analysis times of a few seconds for minute-long recordings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The miniML detection method is thus time-efficient and can be easily integrated into (high-throughput) data analysis pipelines. To facilitate the use of the method, miniML also includes a graphical user interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The output of the miniML model predicts the label—no event or event—for each time step (i.e., stride) with a numerical value ranging from zero to one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). These output values can be interpreted as the confidence that the corresponding data segment contains a synaptic event. Model inference thus outputs a prediction trace that has a slightly lower temporal resolution compared to the original input according to the stride of the sliding window. Using peak finding on the prediction trace allows extracting data segments with individual events from a recording. While 0.5 represents a reasonable minimum peak value, the exact choice is not critical to detection performance (see below). To quantify events, extracted sections are checked for overlapping events, and detected events are aligned by the steepest slope, allowing calculation of individual event statistics. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> illustrates the sliding window approach to detect spontaneous events in time-series data, such as a continuous voltage-clamp recording of spontaneous mEPSCs in a cerebellar GC. miniML provided a clear peak for all synaptic events present, without false positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), allowing fast and reliable event quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). These data demonstrate that a deep learning model can be applied to detect synaptic events in electrophysiological time-series data.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>AI-based event detection is superior to previous methods</title><p id="P11">To benchmark the AI model’s event detection performance, we compared it with commonly used template-based approaches (template-matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Clements and Bekkers, 1997</xref>) and deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Pernía-Andrade et al., 2012</xref>)), and a finite-threshold-based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kudoh and Taguchi, 2002</xref>). Some of these—or similar—algorithms are implemented in proprietary software solutions to record and analyze electrophysiological data. We also included a Bayesian event detection approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Merel et al., 2016</xref>), SimplyFire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Mori et al., 2024</xref>), and the automated event detection routine of MiniAnalysis software (Synaptosoft Inc.). To compare synaptic event detection methods, we developed a standardized benchmarking pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We first performed event-free voltage-clamp recordings from mouse cerebellar GCs (in the presence of blockers of inhibitory and excitatory transmission; see Materials and Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We then generated synthetic events with a two-exponential time course and superimposed these on the raw recording to produce ground-truth data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B–C</xref>). Event amplitudes were drawn from a log-normal distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) with varying means to cover the range of SNRs typically observed in recordings of miniature events (2–15 dB, data from n = 170 GC recordings, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). We generated events with kinetics that closely matched the template used for the matched-filtering approaches, thus ensuring a conservative comparison of miniML with other methods applied under optimal conditions (i.e., using the exact average event shape as template). To measure detection performance, we calculated recall (i.e., sensitivity), precision (fraction of correct identifications) and the F1 score. Recall depended on SNR for all methods, with miniML and deconvolution showing the highest values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). The precision was highest for miniML, which detected no false positives at any SNR, in contrast to all other methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). When assessing overall performance, miniML provided the highest F1 scores across SNRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). In addition, miniML showed superior results when changing event kinetics, indicating higher robustness to variable event shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which may be particularly important in neurons with diverse synaptic inputs due to mixed receptor populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Lesperance et al., 2020</xref>), or during pharmacological experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ishii et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Conventional event detection methods typically produce a detection trace with a shape identical to the input data and values in an arbitrary range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, miniML generates output in the interval [0, 1], which can be interpreted as the confidence of event occurrence. The output of event detection methods—the detection trace—significantly increases the SNR with respect to the original data. In our benchmark scenario, miniML and the Bayesian method provided the greatest discrimination from background noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). To locate the actual event positions, a threshold must be applied to the detection trace, which can drastically affect the results, as peaks in the detection trace may depend on the event amplitude. Intriguingly, miniMLs detection trace peaks did not depend on event amplitudes, setting it apart from other methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For template-based methods, recommendations on threshold selection are provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Clements and Bekkers, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Pernía-Andrade et al., 2012</xref>), but users usually need to adjust this parameter according to their specific data. The choice of the threshold strongly influences the detection performance, as even small changes can lead to marked increases in false positives or false negatives. To investigate the threshold dependence of different methods, we systematically varied the threshold and analyzed the number of detected events and the F1 score. Notably, miniML’s detection performance remained consistent over a wide range (5–195%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), with false positives occurring only at the lower threshold limit (5%, corresponding to a cutoff value of 0.025 in the detection trace). Conversely, the other detection methods were very sensitive to threshold changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) due to the comparatively low SNR ratio of the output traces (but note that the Bayesian method is only slightly threshold dependent). In addition, the miniML threshold (i.e., minimum peak) value is bounded with an intuitive meaning. These comparisons underscore that miniML requires no prior knowledge of the exact event shape and is virtually threshold independent, thus enabling reliable event detection.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>miniML reliably detects spontaneous synaptic events in out-of-sample data</title><p id="P13">We trained the miniML model using data from cerebellar MF–GC synapses, which enabled reliable analysis of mEPSC recordings from this preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Comparison with several previous detection methods revealed that miniML detected more events with a waveform that is consistent with mEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Synaptic event properties, such as kinetics, SNR, or frequency, are variable between preparations. This heterogeneity is caused by, for example, differences in the number and type of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors, the number of synaptic inputs, postsynaptic membrane properties, or presynaptic release properties. To test miniML’s generalizability, we evaluated the detection performance on out-of-sample data. We recorded and analyzed data from the mouse calyx of Held synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>), a large axosomatic synapse in the auditory brainstem that relays rate-coded information over a large bandwidth and with high temporal precision. Due to the large number of active zones, synaptic events are quite frequent. Despite being trained on cerebellar MF–GC data, miniML accurately detected mEPSCs in these recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F–H</xref>). This result may be facilitated by the fast event kinetics at the calyx of Held, which approach those of MF–GC mEPSCs. To test whether miniML could also detect events with slower kinetics, we applied it to recordings from cerebellar Golgi cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kita et al., 2021</xref>). These interneurons in the cerebellar cortex provide surround inhibition to GCs and receive input from parallel fiber and MF synapses. miniML reliably detected synaptic events in these recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J–L</xref>), although event decay kinetics were slower compared to the training data (Golgi cell, 1.83 ms (SD 0.44 ms, n = 10 neurons), GC training data, 0.9 ms). Synaptic events are also commonly recorded from neuronal culture preparations. We determined whether miniML could be applied to recordings from cultured human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. We patch-clamped neurons in eight-week-old cultures of predominantly cortical glutamatergic identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Asadollahi et al., 2023</xref>) and recorded spontaneous synaptic events in voltage-clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4M</xref>). Using miniML on these human iPSC-derived neuron data showed robust detection of synaptic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4N–P</xref>), which had an average frequency of 0.15 Hz (SD 0.24 Hz, n = 56 neurons). Taken together, the consistent performance across different synaptic preparations indicates that the miniML model can be directly applied to out-of-sample data with similar kinetics. miniML also provided higher event detection accuracy than template-based or finite-threshold-based detection methods, which are prone to false positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D,H,L,P</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Generalization of miniML to diverse event and data types via transfer learning</title><p id="P14">While applicable to out of sample data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), simulations indicated that larger differences in event kinetics and waveform may ultimately hinder detection when using the MF–GC mEPSC model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Not only distinct event waveforms, but also different hardware and recording conditions may affect the characteristics of the recorded data. Scalability and generalizability are important for robust event detection. To facilitate the application of miniML to different preparations, recording conditions, and data types, we employed a transfer learning (TL) strategy. TL is a powerful technique in machine learning that allows for the transfer of knowledge learned from one task or domain to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Caruana, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Yosinski et al., 2014</xref>). TL is widely used with CNNs to take advantage of large pre-trained models and repurpose them to solve new, unseen tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Theodoris et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, only a part of the network needs to be trained for the novel task, which significantly reduces the number of training samples needed and speeds up training while avoiding overfitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Yosinski et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore reasoned that TL based on freezing the convolutional layers during training of our pre-trained network could be used to train a new model to detect events with different shapes and/or kinetics, using a lower number of training samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We tested the use of TL for miniML with recordings of miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials (mEPSPs) in mouse cerebellar GCs. These events have opposite polarity and slower kinetics compared to the original mEPSC training data. We compared TL-based model training to full training (with all layers trainable and reinitialized weights), varying the training sample size. Whereas accuracy increased and loss decreased with the number of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), TL models performed well with as few as 400 samples. Under these conditions, accuracy was only slightly lower than for full training with almost ten times the sample size (median accuracy, 95.4 versus 96.1%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). This suggests that TL can significantly reduce the sample size needed for training, minimizing the time-consuming process of event extraction and labeling. Across different datasets, TL-trained models performed comparably to those trained from scratch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that TL allows model training with an order of magnitude smaller amount of training data, making miniML easily transferable to new datasets with diverse characteristics.</p><p id="P16">To investigate how a TL-trained model performs in event detection, we analyzed data in different recording modes (voltage-clamp vs. current-clamp). The different noise conditions typically encountered in current-clamp and the difference between EPSP and EPSC waveforms necessitate distinct detection schemes for common detection methods. Recording miniature EPSPs and EPSCs in the same cerebellar GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D–E</xref>) enabled us to compare detection performance via event frequency. mEPSPs could be approximated by a two-exponential time course, similar to postsynaptic currents. However, their kinetics were considerably slower due to the charging of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). We used a TL-trained model for mEPSP detection and the standard miniML model for mEPSCs. Remarkably, the average event frequencies were very similar in the two different recording modes (voltage-clamp: 0.49 Hz, SD 0.53 Hz, current-clamp: 0.54 Hz, SD 0.6 Hz, n = 15 for both) and highly correlated across neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). This highlights the reliability of TL with small training sets for the consistent detection of synaptic events in datasets with varying characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>miniML reveals diversity of synaptic event kinetics in an <italic>ex vivo</italic> whole brain preparation</title><p id="P17">The presence of overlapping and highly variable event shapes pose additional challenges for event detection methods. To evaluate miniML’s performance in such complex scenarios, we analyzed a dataset recorded from principal neurons of the adult zebrafish telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018</xref>). We focused on spontaneous excitatory inputs to these neurons, characterized by diverse event shapes and frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018</xref>). Training via TL (see Materials and Methods) yielded a model that enabled the reliable detection of spontaneous excitatory currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Analysis of event properties across cells revealed broad distributions of event statistics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), including a large diversity of event rise and decay kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). Notably, miniML consistently identified synaptic events with diverse kinetics and shapes.</p><p id="P18">We next used the extracted event kinetics features of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D–H</xref>) to demonstrate miniML’s utility in better understanding the diversity of an existing dataset. First, we explored whether the anatomical location of each neuron could predict event decay times. We mapped the recorded neurons to an anatomical reference and plotted decay times as a function of their position but did not find a strong relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I</xref>; correlation with position p&gt;0.05 in all 3 dimensions). Second, we tested the hypothesis that slower event kinetics are associated with larger cells. In large cells, EPSCs may undergo stronger filtering as they propagate from synaptic sites to the soma. Consistent with this idea, we observed correlations between decay and rise times across neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6J</xref>). Furthermore, the distribution of decay times (examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>) was broader for neurons with longer decay times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6K</xref>), suggesting a broader distribution of distances from synapses to the cell body. Finally, for a subset of neurons, we recorded input resistance, which approximates the cell membrane resistance and is therefore a proxy for cell size. Input resistance was negatively correlated with decay times across neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6L</xref>), consistent with the hypothesis that diverse event kinetics across neurons are determined by the conditions of synaptic event propagation to the soma and, more specifically, cell size. Taken together, this analysis underscores the versatility of miniML, as it can be successfully applied to new datasets with varying recording conditions. miniML consistently extracted synaptic events across a spectrum of event kinetics, enabling the identification and investigation of key factors determining event kinetics and other event-related properties across neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>miniML robustly detects mEPSC differences upon genetic receptor perturbation</title><p id="P19">We next applied miniML to analyze data obtained from the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Baccino-Calace et al., 2022</xref>). This synapse is characterized by a higher frequency of spontaneous synaptic events with a slower time course compared with typical brain slice recordings. In addition, mEPSC recordings are performed using two-electrode voltage-clamp, which can be associated with large leak currents and rather low SNR. Because of the different event shapes in these data, we used a small dataset of manually extracted NMJ events to train a TL model. The TL model was able to reliably detect synaptic events in wild-type (WT) NMJ recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). We next assessed event detection upon deletion of the non-essential glutamate receptor subunit <italic>GluRIIA</italic>, which causes a strong reduction in mEPSC amplitude and faster kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">DiAntonio et al., 1999</xref>).

Recent developments of highly sensitive fluorescent probes have enabled the recording of synaptic events using various imaging techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Abdelfattah et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aggarwal et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hao et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Ralowicz et al., 2024</xref>). These technological advances offer exciting new possibilities in the study of synaptic function, but also generate novel challenges for the detection and analysis of synaptic events. Live imaging datasets typically feature a lower sampling rate, lower SNR, and distinct noise profile compared with electrophysiological recordings. Nevertheless, the waveforms of imaged synaptic release events, voltage changes, or Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients closely resemble those used to train miniML. Thus, we hypothesized that miniML could also be employed for event detection in fluorescence imaging data.</p><p id="P21">We first used miniML to analyze a previously published dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aggarwal et al., 2023</xref>) from rat neuronal cultures expressing the glutamate sensor iGluSnFR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A–B</xref>). These data, recorded in the presence of TTX, contain spontaneous transient increases in fluorescence intensity representing individual release events (’optical minis’). Initially, we selected a small subset of events from the data to train a TL model. Given the low sampling rate of the imaging (100 Hz), we upsampled the data by a factor of 10 to match the model’s input shape. The TL model was subsequently applied to all detected sites (n = 1524) within the widefield recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aggarwal et al., 2023</xref>). A qualitative assessment of the imaging traces showed excellent event detection, with miniML consistently localizing the iGluSnFR3 fluorescence transients at varying SNRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>). The detected optical minis had similar kinetics to those reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aggarwal et al., 2023</xref>) (10–90% rise time, median 21.8 ms; half decay time, median 48.7 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>). In addition, analysis of event frequencies across sites revealed a power-law distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8E</xref>), consistent with fractal behavior of glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Lowen et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, miniML can reliably detect synaptic release events in time-series data from iGluSnFR3 recordings.</p><p id="P22">To further investigate miniML’s performance in imaging data, we performed simultaneous electrophysiological and fluorescence recordings of mEPSPs in cultured rat hippocampal neurons expressing ASAP5-Kv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hao et al., 2024</xref>) at physiological temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A–B</xref>). ASAP5 allows resolving small voltage changes in the mV-range, as illustrated by the close correlation of optical and current-clamp signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C</xref>). However, event detection is more challenging in voltage imaging data due to the lower SNR compared to electrophysiological recordings (ASAP5: 2.26, SD 0.46; electrophysiology: 4.79, SD 0.74; n = 5 neurons; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Photon shot noise and other sources of noise in the imaging setup not only limit the SNR, but can also lead to spurious event detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Sjulson and Miesenböck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Wilt et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P23">We trained separate miniML TL models to detect mEPSPs in optical and current-clamp data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C–D</xref>).

To provide a more quantitative assessment of detection performance, we compared miniML to established template-based analysis methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9F</xref>). The simultaneous recording of membrane voltage through both optical and electrophysiological means allowed us to establish ground truth data for evaluating detection performance. We quantified the detection of events by different methods in imaging data relative to electrophysiology, with threshold settings of the matched-filtering approaches adjusted to achieve ~90% precision. High precision of event detection is crucial for robust data analysis. At comparable levels of precision, miniML demonstrated superior recall of mEPSPs compared with template matching or deconvolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9G–H</xref>).

Data with event waveforms that are similar to the original miniML training data (i.e., mouse cerebellar GC recordings) can be analyzed immediately. For more distinct event waveforms or data properties, data resampling and/or retraining of a classifier via TL enables event detection optimized for the respective recording conditions. Importantly, TL requires only a few hundred labeled events for training, facilitating its application to novel datasets. For example, an existing miniML model can be easily retrained to eliminate potential false positives, e.g., due to sudden changes in noise characteristics. This scalability is a key advantage of the miniML approach over traditional methods.</p><p id="P28">Event detection with miniML is not restricted to electrophysiological data, but can also be applied to optical time-series data derived from live imaging experiments using, e.g., reporters of glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aggarwal et al., 2023</xref>), Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Tran and Stricker, 2021</xref>), or membrane voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Li et al., 2020</xref>).

Based on empirical observations of model performance, we included relatively small amplitude events that are often missed by other methods. Similarly, including negative examples that are commonly picked up as false positives, resulted in more accurate prediction traces. We used data augmentation techniques to further improve model discrimination. We simulated waveforms of non-synaptic origin, which are occasionally encountered during recordings, and superimposed them onto noise recordings.

The final training dataset contained 30,140 samples (21,140 from recorded traces and 9,000 simulated samples).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Deep learning model architecture</title><p id="P38">We built a discriminative end-to-end deep learning model for one-dimensional time-series classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Fawaz et al., 2019</xref>). The neural network architecture comprised multiple convolutional layers, an LSTM layer, and a fully connected layer. The approach is related to networks designed for event detection in audio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Passricha and Aggarwal, 2019</xref>) and image data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Donahue et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Islam et al., 2020</xref>), or classification of genomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Tasdelen and Sen, 2021</xref>). The combination of convolutional and recurrent neural network layers helps to improve the classification performance for time-series data. In particular, LSTM layers allow learning temporal features. An initial comparison of different types of network architectures showed superior performance of a CNN-LSTM model over CNN-Dense, Residual Neural Network (ResNet), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architectures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p id="P39">The miniML model was built using TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning library for Python (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Martín Abadi et al., 2015</xref>). To optimize the model architecture, we performed a Bayesian optimization of hyperparameters. Hyperparameter ranges were chosen for the free parameters of all layers. Optimization was then performed with a maximum number of trials of 50. Models were evaluated using the validation dataset. Because a higher number of free parameters tended to increase inference times, we then empirically tuned the chosen hyperparameter combination to achieve a trade-off between number of free parameters and accuracy.</p><p id="P40">The deep learning network takes batches of one-dimensional (1D) univariate time-series data as input, which are converted into a tensor of shape (batch size, data length, 1). The data is passed to three convolutional blocks. Each block consists of a 1D convolutional layer with a leaky Rectified Linear Unit (leaky ReLU) activation function followed by an average pooling layer. To avoid overfitting, each convolutional block uses batch normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015</xref>). Batch normalization reduced training time by about two times and improved the accuracy of the resulting model. We added a fourth convolutional block that includes a convolutional layer, batch normalization and a leaky ReLU activation function, but no average pooling layer. The output of the final convolutional layer passes through a bidirectional recurrent layer of LSTM units. The final layers consist of a fully connected dense unit layer and a dropout layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>), followed by a single unit with sigmoid activation. The output of the neural network is a scalar between [0, 1]. The layers and parameters used, including output shape and number of trainable parameters, are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.

We trained the classifier using a learning rate <italic>η</italic> = 2E–5 and batch size of 128 on the training data. Training was run for maximum 100 epochs with early stopping to avoid overfitting. Validation data was used to evaluate training performance. Early stopping was applied when the validation loss did not improve for eight consecutive epochs. Typically, training lasted for 20–40 epochs. We used binary cross-entropy loss and binary accuracy as measures of performance during training. The best performing model was selected from a training run, and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) was calculated. We used accuracy and area under the ROC curve to evaluate training performance. To accelerate training, we used a GPU; training time for the neural network was ∼8 minutes on a workstation with NVIDIA Tesla P100 16 GB GPU (Intel Xeon 2.2 GHz CPU, 16 GB RAM).</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Model and training visualization</title><p id="P42">To analyze the discriminative data segments, we calculated per-sample saliency maps with SmoothGrad using the Python package <italic>tf-keras-viz</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Simonyan et al., 2013</xref>). Saliency maps were smoothed with a 10-point running average filter for display purposes.

To detect events in arbitrarily long recordings, a sliding window procedure is used. Time-series data from voltage-clamp or current-clamp recordings is segmented using a sliding window with stride. The resulting 2D-tensor is min-max scaled and then used as model input for inference. To overcome the potential limitation of long computation times, we used a sliding window with stride procedure. Using a stride &gt; 1 significantly reduces the inference time of the model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), especially for data with high sampling rates or long recording times. This approach results in a prediction trace with data being spaced at <italic>samplinginterval</italic> * <italic>stride</italic>.

To maintain temporal precision, the prediction trace is resampled to the sampling frequency of the raw data.</p><p id="P44">Events in the input data trace result in distinct peaks in the prediction trace. We applied a maximum filter to enhance post-processing of the data. Thus, by applying a threshold to the prediction trace, synaptic event positions can be detected. Our analyses indicate that the absolute threshold value is not important in the [0.05, 0.95] range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Data following a threshold crossing in the prediction trace are cut from the raw data and aligned by steepest rise. To find the point of steepest rise, a peak-search is performed in the first derivative of the short data segment. If multiple peaks are detected, any peak that has a prominence ⩾ 0.25 relative to the largest detected prominence is treated as an additional event that is in close proximity or overlapping. The resulting 2D-array with aligned events can be further analyzed to obtain descriptive statistics on, e.g., amplitude, charge, or rise and decay kinetics of individual events.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Benchmarking detection methods</title><p id="P45">We compared the deep learning-based miniML with the following previously described detection methods: template-matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Clements and Bekkers, 1997</xref>), deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Pernía-Andrade et al., 2012</xref>), a finite threshold-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kudoh and Taguchi, 2002</xref>), the commercial MiniAnalysis software (version 6.0.7, Synaptosoft), SimplyFire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Mori et al., 2024</xref>), and a Bayesian inference procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Merel et al., 2016</xref>).
