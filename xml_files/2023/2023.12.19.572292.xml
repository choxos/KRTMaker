These pathological deposits comprise aggregates of proteins that adopt distinct structures named strains. However, the molecular factors responsible for the formation of distinct aggregate strains are unknown. Here we show that the serine/threonine kinase GSK3β catalyzes the aggregation of the protein tau into an Alzheimer’s disease-like amyloid strain. We demonstrate that phosphorylation by GSK3β, but not by several other kinases, promotes the aggregation of full-length tau through enhanced phase separation into gel-like condensate structures. Cryo-electron microscopy further reveals that the amyloid fibrils formed by GSK3β-phosphorylated tau adopt a fold comparable to that of paired helical filaments isolated from the brains of AD patients. Our results elucidate the intricate relationship between post-translational modification and the formation of tau strains in neurodegenerative diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">More than 30 neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the pathological aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau into insoluble deposits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), tau deposition correlates with disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Tau deposits in AD are composed of amyloid fibrils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Tau is hyperphosphorylated in the diseased brain of AD and other tauopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Phosphorylation has thus been suggested to modulate the formation of pathological tau aggregates and subsequent neuronal dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Additionally, post-translational modifications, potentially together with so-far unknown co-factors, were suggested to drive the tau protein into distinct amyloid fibril structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. These distinct tau fibril structures are named strains and are associated with different tauopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.

Many serine/threonine kinases phosphorylate tau in the brain, including glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARK), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, tyrosine kinases, such as FYN, SYK, and ABL, can phosphorylate tau’s tyrosine residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Phosphorylation of tau inside the microtubule-binding domain reduces its affinity towards the negatively charged microtubules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Under pathological conditions, approximately 40-50 out of 85 potential phosphorylation sites in tau have been identified to undergo phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">A growing number of studies suggest that biomolecular condensation may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases by acting as an intermediate or transition state between the monomeric protein and its pathological aggregated state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.

For the phosphorylation reactions, we selected the six serine/threonine kinases GSK3β, CDK5, ERK2, MARK2cat, PKA and CaMKII, as well as the tyrosine kinase C-Abl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To assess primed phosphorylation, we also phosphorylated tau with two or three kinases in a step-wise manner: CDK5 followed by GSK3β, PKA followed by GSK3β, CDK5 followed by GSK3β and MARK2cat, as well as PKA followed by GSK3β and subsequently MARK2cat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To determine the phosphorylation patterns of tau, the phosphorylated samples were loaded in an SDS-PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Subsequently, the tau bands observed in the SDS-PAGE gel were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The extent of phosphorylation for each residue was determined by the ratio between the number of detected peptides containing a particular phosphorylated residue and the total number of peptides detected containing the same residue.</p><p id="P6">The analysis provided insights into the specific tau phosphorylation patterns of the seven kinases. In the case of GSK3β, we detected phosphorylation of S404, as well as phosphorylation of some residues in the proline-rich domain (T175, T181, T205, T231) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). However, detection of a very small number of peptides from tau’s C-terminus precluded confirmation of phosphorylation of S396 and S400, the two other serine residues in the C-terminus of tau that were previously shown to be also phosphorylated by GSK3β<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In the case of CDK5, we detected phosphorylation of the C-terminal site S404, as well as phosphorylation of T175, T181, S202, T205, T212, S214, T217, T220, T231and S235 in the proline-rich domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The kinase ERK2 phosphorylated S396, T403 and S404 in the C-terminus of tau, as well as other sites, including T175, T181, S202, T205, S210, T212, S214, T217, S235 and T245.</p><p id="P7">The other three tested kinases (PKA, MARK2cat and CaMKII) also phosphorylated residues in the aggregation-prone repeat-domain of tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), but the sites differed from the specific sites phosphorylated by GSK3β, CDK5 and ERK2. For example, a phosphorylation reaction of 15 minutes in the presence of PKA results in the phosphorylation of S305 and S356 in repeat 2 and 4, respectively, together with phosphorylation of S214. Similarly, the catalytic domain of the kinase MARK2 (MARK2cat) phosphorylated S262 and S356. The phosphorylation at S324 by MARK2cat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> was not detected because of the absence of peptides from that region. In agreement with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, CaMKII phosphorylated S214, T263, and S356 of tau. A small number of peptides with phosphorylated Y310 and Y394 were also detected after CaMKII phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The tyrosine kinase C-Abl phosphorylated Y197, Y310, and Y394 (phosphorylation of Y18 and Y29 was not observed due to the detection of few peptides from the N-terminus of tau). Sequential phosphorylation of tau by two or three kinases lead to an abundant phosphorylation in both the proline-rich domain and the repeat domain, with most peptides detected for phosphorylated S324 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>GSK3β most efficiently phosphorylates tau’s PHF-1 epitope</title><p id="P8">To gain further insights into the sites and degree of phosphorylation catalyzed by the serine/threonine kinases GSK3β, CDK5 and ERK2, we used NMR spectroscopy. We phosphorylated <sup>15</sup>N-labeled 2N4R tau in the presence of either kinase and recorded two-dimensional (2D) <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR spectra of the phosphorylated proteins. Comparison of the cross-peaks intensities in the phosphorylated samples to the unmodified sample revealed that the three kinases efficiently phosphorylated residues in the C-terminal domain of tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-d</xref>). The detection of newly appearing cross-peaks of the phosphorylated residues confirmed that GSK3β efficiently phosphorylates S396 and S404, i.e. the two residues that comprise the PHF-1 epitope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, as well as S400 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). The extent of phosphorylation of S404 (~75 %) and S400 (~57 %) by GSK3β was calculated by comparing the intensity of the phosphorylated cross-peak to the unmodified cross-peak. On the other hand, we were unable to calculate the extent of phosphorylation of S396 due to signal overlap of unmodified S396 with T231. Notably, the NMR-based intensity analysis also shows that the other sites (T175, T181, T205, T231) in the proline-rich domain of tau, for which phosphorylation was detected by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), are only very weakly phosphorylated by GSK3β. As these sites are weakly phosphorylated by GSK3β, we also did not detect signals of the phosphorylated peaks of these residues. GSK3β thus most efficiently phosphorylates the PHF-1 epitope in the C-terminus of tau.</p><p id="P9">We further confirmed phosphorylation of S396, S400 and S404 by GSK3β-catalyzed phosphorylation of a C-terminal fragment of tau comprising residues 369 to 441 (referred to as K26) and subsequent analysis by NMR. The analysis revealed that GSK3β indeed phosphorylates S396, S400 and S404 in the C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h,i</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), where the extent of phosphorylation were determined to be 56 %, 59 %, and 81 % respectively.</p><p id="P10">The NMR analysis also showed that ERK2 phosphorylated both S404 and S396 but not S400 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Notably, the cross-peak of phosphorylated S396 was weaker than in case of GSK3β phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), suggesting that ERK2 is less efficient in phosphorylating S396 when compared to GSK3β. In the case of CDK5 phosphorylation, we did not detect a cross-peak of phosphorylated S396, indicating that CDK5 only phosphorylates S404 in the C-terminal domain of tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Besides phosphorylation at the C-terminus, CDK5 and ERK2 (GSK3β to a lesser degree) effectively phosphorylated residues in the proline-rich domain of tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-d</xref>), broadly in agreement with the results from mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The ERK2 kinase also phosphorylated some residues (most likely T50<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>) in the N-terminal regions between residue 40 and 80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). The phosphorylation of these residues were not detected by mass spectrometry, because of the detection of very few peptides from the N-terminus of tau. The combined data show that GSK3β and ERK2, but not the other tested kinases, phosphorylate the tau epitope (pS396 &amp; pS404) that is recognized by the monoclonal antibody PHF-1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>GSK3β phosphorylation accelerates tau amyloid formation</title><p id="P12">We next asked whether the distinct phosphorylation patterns imprinted by different kinases differentially modulate the aggregation of tau into insoluble deposits. To gain insight into this question, we aggregated the unmodified and phosphorylated tau proteins using our previously developed co-factor-free <italic>in vitro</italic> aggregation assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. We discovered distinct phosphorylation-specific changes in tau amyloid formation: only GSK3β-phosphorylated tau aggregated faster than the unmodified protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Other tau proteins phosphorylated by a single kinase displayed slower aggregation when compared to unmodified tau. ERK2-phosphorylated tau was most similar to unmodified tau in its aggregation kinetics, followed by PKA-, CDK5- and CamKII-phosphorylated tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). C-Abl-phosphorylated tau displayed even slower aggregation kinetics, but tau aggregation was most impaired when phosphorylated by the catalytic domain of MARK2. Interestingly, stepwise phosphorylation by two kinases delayed tau aggregation when compared to phosphorylation by the respective individual kinases. Phosphorylation by two kinases and additionally by MARK2 largely blocked tau fibrillization during the time of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, GSK3β phosphorylation selectively accelerates tau amyloid formation.</p><p id="P13">In addition to phosphorylation-induced changes in the aggregation kinetics, we observed different final fluorescence intensities of the amyloid-specific dye thioflavin-T (ThT) for tau proteins phosphorylated by different kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Most of the phosphorylated tau proteins displayed higher ThT intensity at the end of aggregation when compared to the unmodified protein, apart from tau proteins that were phosphorylated by multiple kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To evaluate whether the higher ThT intensity is caused by an increased amount of aggregated protein, we centrifuged the aggregated samples at the end of the incubation period. Subsequently, the amount of residual protein was analyzed by loading the supernatants into an SDS-PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Comparison of the band intensity of the supernatants with the unmodified monomeric protein revealed that a similar amount of protein was aggregated for unmodified tau and tau phosphorylated by the kinases GSK3β, ERK2 and PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Approximately 80-90% of the monomeric proteins were aggregated into insoluble deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In contrast, phosphorylation of tau by CDK5, C-Abl, and MARK2cat decreased the amount of aggregated protein to ~60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The amount of aggregated protein further decreased when tau was phosphorylated by CamKII or in the case of sequential phosphorylation with two kinases. Finally, the sequential phosphorylation of tau in the presence of three kinases, either PKA or CDK5 followed by GSK3β and MARK2cat, abolished tau fibrillization. Thus, the higher ThT intensity observed for most of the fibrils formed by phosphorylated tau proteins is likely caused by differences in ThT binding, indicating the formation of distinct amyloid fibril structures by phosphorylated tau proteins when compared to unmodified tau.</p><p id="P15">To gain insight into the impact of GSK3β-phosphorylation - the only phosphorylation that accelerated tau amyloid formation when compared to the unmodified protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-c</xref>) - on tau amyloid structure, we recorded circular dichroism (CD) and negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). The CD spectrum confirmed the presence of β-structure, which is characteristic of disease-associated amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In the EM images, we observed separated fibrils with a pronounced twist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). These twisted fibrils differ from the fibrils formed by unmodified tau which were mostly straight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Phosphorylation at PHF-1 epitope catalyzes the condensation of tau</title><p id="P16">To understand whether the accelerated aggregation of GSK3β-phosphorylated tau is linked to the formation of condensates, we imaged the GSK3β-phosphorylated tau samples by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy prior to starting the aggregation assay. Under this condition, i.e., after incubation for ten minutes at room temperature in the aggregation assay buffer, we observed the formation of condensates in the GSK3β-phosphorylated tau sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that these condensates are indeed formed by GSK3β-phosphorylated tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In contrast, the unmodified tau did not form visible condensates in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Closer inspection of the DIC images showed that the condensates formed by GSK3β-phosphorylated tau did not possess the typical spherical shape of liquid droplets, but displayed a more “squeezed” appearance. These condensates were also stained by the amyloid-binding dye Thioflavin-T (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). To gain insight into the diffusive properties of these condensates, we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Although part of the fluorescence recovered rapidly in a few seconds, an immobile fraction of 50-80 % remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). This suggests that the material properties inside the GSK3β-phosphorylated tau condensates differ from liquid droplets and contain both more diffusive and gel-like tau protein.</p><p id="P18">The major GSK3β-induced phosphorylation sites in tau are located at the C-terminus (S396, S400, and S404) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Similar to GSK3β, ERK2 (S396, S404), and CDK5 (S404) also phosphorylate tau at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d,f,g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). To elucidate the relationship between phosphorylation site and condensate formation, we imaged ERK2-phosphorylated as well as CDK5-phosphorylated tau with DIC microscopy prior to starting the aggregation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>). In the aggregation assay buffer, we observed that ERK2-phosphorylated tau forms condensates similar to that of GSK3β-phosphorylated tau, but not CDK5-phosphorylated tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>). As an additional control, we asked whether other types of phosphorylation may promote condensate formation. However, tau phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase C-Abl, which phosphorylates multiple of the tyrosine residues of tau including Y394 at the C-terminus, did not form condensates under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). This suggests that phosphorylation at only S404 is not sufficient, but it requires phosphorylation of both S396 and S404, that is the PHF-1 epitope, to promote tau condensation.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Tau droplets mature into gel-like structures upon GSK3β-phosphorylation</title><p id="P19">Crowding agents promote the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of unmodified tau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In agreement with these reports, we observed the formation of spherical, highly mobile droplets of unmodified tau in the presence of 10 % dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We then added fluorescently labeled GSK3β to the pre-formed tau droplets and observed that the kinase rapidly enters the droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). GSK3β thus concentrates inside the tau droplets where it might phosphorylate tau.</p><p id="P20">To assess whether GSK3β phosphorylates tau and changes the morphology of tau droplets, we repeated the experiment but now added unlabeled GSK3β as well as ATP to the pre-formed tau droplets.

They were morphologically similar to the condensates formed by the GSK3β-phosphorylated tau in absence of a crowding agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In contrast, we did not observe such gel-like condensates upon the incubation of tau droplets only in the presence of GSK3β, i.e. under non-phosphorylating conditions without ATP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Mass spectrometry confirmed that the tau sample was indeed phosphorylated under the condition of LLPS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).

To characterize the stable core region of the fibrils formed by GSK3β-phosphorylated tau, we combined pronase digestion with mass spectrometry.

Using a combination of mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, we linked the accelerated aggregation of GSK3β-phosphorylated tau to the ability of GSK3β to efficiently phosphorylate S396 and S404 of tau, which are recognized by the monoclonal antibody PHF-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). While the kinase ERK2 also phosphorylates both S396 and S404, the degree of S396 phosphorylation was lower when compared to GSK3β-phosphorylation. The efficient phosphorylation of S396 and the additional phosphorylation of S400, which is only phosphorylated by GSK3β, may contribute to the GSK3β-specific acceleration of tau aggregation. The three serine residues at the C-terminus (S396, S400, S404) that are phosphorylated by GSK3β, are also abnormally hyperphosphorylated in the brain of Alzheimer’s disease patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Notably, phosphorylation at the N-terminus and in particular in the repeat domain delayed tau aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Our study also shows that GSK3β without priming by another kinase only weakly phosphorylates residues T181 and T231, sites in the proline-rich domain that are likely phosphorylated early in the disease process.

Additionally, we found that phosphorylation by GSK3β is stronger in conditions of phase separation when compared to the dispersed phase.

The connection between tau condensation and accelerated aggregation was further supported by our observation that other types of phosphorylated tau protein exhibit delayed aggregation when compared to unmodified tau and do not form condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e,f,g</xref>). Phosphorylation of tau by ERK2 elicited condensate formation without enhanced aggregation, which contrasts with observations for the other kinase/tau pairings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

The compactness of the AD PHF isolated from the extracellular vesicles is due to the presence of an additional co-factor between two positively-charged residues (R349 and K375).

For an initial 2D classification, we extracted particle segments using a box size of 1536 pixels downscaled to 192 pixels. Best classes with a visible twist were selected and used to estimate a crossover of around 1550 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>), which is equivalent to a twist of around -0.55° for a 4.75 Å rise. For 3D classification, the segments after 2D classification were re-extracted without downscaling using a box size of 400 pixels. We performed several rounds of 3D classification starting from a 290 Å low-pass-filtered featureless cylinder and subsequent 3D refinements to optimize the helical parameters (rise of 4.77 Å and twist of -0.58°, reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and applying C2 symmetry. Next, standard RELION post-processing with a soft-edged solvent mask that includes the central 20 % of the box height yielded the final post-processed map (sharpening B-factor of -26.43 Å<sup>2</sup>). The resolution (3.85 Å) was estimated from the value of the FSC curve for two independently refined half-maps at 0.143. The estimated resolution is overestimated because of the high resolution in the Z axis and the approximated real resolution is around 5 Å (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10a,b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary information</label><media xlink:href="EMS192914-supplement-Supplementary_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the mass spectrometry facility of the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences (MPI-NAT, Göttingen) for mass spectrometry and the EM facility of MPI-NAT for electron micrographs.
