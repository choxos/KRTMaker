Links between bacterial and viral infection and AD/PD has been suggested in several studies, however, few have attempted to establish a link between fungal infection and AD/PD. In this study we develop and describe a nanopore-based sequencing approach to characterise the presence or absence of fungi in both human brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This approach detects fungal DNA in human brain and CSF samples even at low levels, whereas our quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay (FungiQuant) was unable to detect fungal DNA in the same samples. Comparison against kit-controls showed ubiquitous low-level fungal contamination that we observed in healthy human brains and CSF as well AD/PD brains and CSF. We use this technique to demonstrate the presence of fungal DNA in healthy human brains as well as AD/PD brains, with <italic>Alternaria spp</italic>., <italic>Colletotrichum graminicola</italic>, and <italic>Filobasidium floriforme</italic> as the most prominent species. In addition, antibiotic resistant <italic>Pseudomonas spp</italic>. was identified within the brain of an AD patient.

Patients with AD or PD display a loss of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), however, the mechanism by which this occurs has yet to be fully understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. AD is the leading cause of dementia, characterised by progressive cognitive impairment, memory deficits, and loss of independence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, with over 520,000 people in the UK being affected by dementia caused by AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Parkinsonism is a clinical syndrome characterized by slowness of movement, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Causes of Parkinsonism may include idiopathic PD and Lewy body dementia (LBD), with PD being the most common form of Parkinsonism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and the second most common type of degenerative dementia in patients aged over 65 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Prevalence of AD, PD, and dementia is increasing steadily, and identified risk factors include age, diabetes, hypertension, head injury, chronic kidney disease, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, genetic susceptibility, and environmental factors, with further risk underpinning the aetiology of these diseases remaining largely unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Recently, the potential role of microbial infection as an AD/PD risk factor or mediator of progression has been gaining attention due to the recognition of inflammation as a prominent feature of AD/PD, alongside associative evidence for elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in AD and PD patients and increased AD or PD risk conferred by variants in numerous immune-related genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Population-level evidence for microbial risk factors has been observed, with tuberculosis patients in Taiwan showing a 1.38-fold increased risk of developing PD compared to non-tuberculosis controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. In addition, it has been hypothesised that bacteria such as <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic> may cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and reach the CNS where it might cause neurological damage by inducing neuroinflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, a study conducted by Bu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, found that the infectious burden (IB) consisting of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> have the capability of causing cognitive decline and that such infections are linked with AD.</p><p id="P4">However, in contrast to viruses and bacteria, the role of fungi in AD/PD and dementia has received less attention. The potential involvement of fungi should not be overlooked as many species are capable of infecting the CNS and neuropathology may be mediated by subsequent inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. More direct evidence supporting the potential role of fungal infection in AD/PD originates from a series of studies identifying fungal proteins and DNA in AD/PD patients’ brains and CSF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Although these findings appear promising, the presence of fungal proteins and DNA in AD/PD brains and CSF is insufficient for establishing the role of infection in the cause or progression of AD/PD as it is unknown whether the fungi were viable and actively contributing to disease pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, fungal material was also detected in some control individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, which may be expected as increased BBB permeability is also associated with normal healthy ageing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and there is the possibility of brain microbiomes being present<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. For these reasons, it is necessary to develop methods to further establish the potential involvement of fungi in the CNS of AD/PD patients and to establish whether the fungi are potentially pathogenic as well as contributing to neurodegeneration via inflammatory pathways. This study aims to develop and validate methods to investigate the above hypotheses using the MinION platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies to identify the species present.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mice tissue</title><p id="P5">Mice brains (Cftrtm1Unc CF mice) were obtained from the Darius Armstrong James laboratory (Department of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London).

Their almost ubiquitous detection could indicate these species as laboratory contaminants, however the possibility of their presence in some samples cannot be eliminated as samples 5 (AD brain), 6 (control brain with extensive amyloid angiopathy), and 8 (AD brain) had high numbers of total classified reads (21,373, 10,207, and 21,741 reads respectively) and <italic>Alternaria</italic> reads constitute significant proportions of these reads, ranging from approximately 14% to over 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Samples 5, 6, and 8 also contain reads from <italic>Colletotrichum graminicola</italic>, at approximately 6%, 16%, and 2% of all classified reads. <italic>Filobasidium floriforme</italic> appears to be present at relatively high proportions in samples 1, 5, and 8, constituting approximately 47%, 57%, and 13% of all classified reads respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The species makeup of sample 9, CSF obtained from the same patient as sample 8, differs from its brain counterpart, containing higher proportions of reads from <italic>Malassezia spp</italic>. Samples 12 to 16 contained high proportions of reads from <italic>C. auris, Cryptococcus spp</italic>., and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> (with the exception of sample 12), likely due to contamination during DNA handling or problems during demultiplexing, as these samples were sequenced in the same run with the mock community containing the above species, and the species makeup of these samples is similar to that of BSA 2 (sample 17), which was also sequenced in the same run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>α-diversity and β-diversity</title><p id="P30">No significant differences in within sample species diversity were found across control, disease, mock community, and ‘DNA free’ sample groups using different α-diversity measures such as Berger Parker’s, Fisher’s, Simpson’s, and Shannon’s index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P31">β-diversity based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix was visualised using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).

Control brains and disease brains form distinct clusters with the exception of some samples clustering with the opposite group. Mock community samples cluster closely and there is greater variation in ‘DNA free’ controls potentially due to different levels of contamination. Control and disease CSF samples are also clearly separated, however there is overlap with the control brain cluster as well as a disease brain sample. Of note, there is significant divergence between samples 4 and 5, corresponding to the cerebellum and frontal cortex from the same AD patient, as well as samples 6 and 7, corresponding to the frontal cortex and CSF from a control patient.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S26" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P32">AD and PD are both neurodegenerative diseases associated with the abnormal aggregation of proteins in the CNS such as amyloid-β, tau and α-synuclein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Despite the fact that both AD/PD have been studied for over a century, the exact causes of these neurodegenerative diseases are still far from being understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Several studies have been able to establish a link between bacterial or viral infection and AD/PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, however, few have attempted to establish a connection between fungal infection and AD/PD. Studies conducted by Pisa and Alonso <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> have detected fungal DNA in AD/PD brains belonging to species in the <italic>Alternaria, Botrytis, Candida, Cladosporium, Malassezia, Saccharomyces, and Cryptococcus genera</italic>, with <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> being the most commonly found genus. <italic>Alternaria, Candida, Cladosporium, Malassezia</italic>, and <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> species have been found to be capable of infecting the CNS and are capable of causing fungal menigitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. In fact, there have been reports of Cryptococcal meningitis misdiagnosed as AD due to its cause of dementia-like symptoms in patients, who demonstrated loss of memory and independence in performing certain activities as well as slight behavioural changes, with these cognitive deficits reversed following antifungal treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P33">Here, we used standard PCR-based methods alongside nanopore sequencing on the MinION platform to profile the microbial content of healthy and AD/PD brains and CSF. First, we developed and validated a method allowing the detection of fungal DNA in mammalian brain tissue. Primers targeting the fungal ribosomal operon with an amplicon size of 3.5 kb were used, followed by nanopore sequencing, as well as qPCR and RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). qPCR and RT-qPCR did not detect fungal DNA in any human brain/CSF samples. Secondly, we used MinION sequencing to detect and quantify fungal species present in brain tissue samples. We found evidence of fungal DNA in both healthy and AD/PD human brain samples attributed to <italic>Alternaria spp</italic>., <italic>C. graminicola</italic>, and <italic>F. floriforme</italic>. Our findings are in line with previous studies conducted by Alonso <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, where they also reported the presence of fungal DNA on healthy human brains as well AD/PD brains. This finding further supports the usage of third generation technologies such as nanopore sequencing as a very valuable tool for detecting low levels of fungal DNA in human brain samples over traditional methods such as (q)PCR.</p><p id="P34">Nanopore sequencing proves more sensitive to the detection of fungal DNA in brain samples even at low levels, whilst FungiQuant failed to detect any DNA; this may be explained by the variation of LOD (which varied between 100-1000 spores). Therefore, if the brain sample had less than 100 fungal genomes present the FungiQuant assay would not be able detect it. To our knowledge, this is a novel application of the MinION sequencer, allowing rapid characterisation of microbial content in CNS tissue samples.</p><p id="P35">Long-read sequencing provided by the MinION platform enabled improved taxonomic classification. This in turn provided species-level information despite the slightly higher error rate compared to short-read sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. However, sequencing errors generated in barcode sequences may affect accurate demultiplexing, demonstrated by the contamination of human samples by mock community species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Additionally, though the <italic>k</italic>-mer based classification employed by Kraken2 is highly efficient, the increased error rate of long reads may result in misclassification of closely related species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Kraken2 also relies on a well-curated taxonomy tree from the National Center for Biotechnology Information for classification, which may not contain nodes for newly discovered species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P36">Highly abundant fungal species identified across multiple patient samples included <italic>Alternaria spp</italic>., <italic>C. graminicola</italic>, and <italic>F. floriforme. Alternaria</italic> is known to be able to infect the CNS and is also a part of the human microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. <italic>C. graminicola</italic> has been reported as a human pathogen in rare cases, causing ocular infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. <italic>F. floriforme</italic> itself has not been reported as a human pathogen, but closely related species such as <italic>Filobasidium uniguttulatum</italic> have been shown to cause meningitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Identification of these species could suggest their presence in patient brains as a part of the microbiome or as a result of infection, however links to neurodegenerative diseases remain unclear since these species were found in both control and disease patient samples and differences in abundances cannot be evaluated accurately due to different PCR or barcoding efficiencies. Our analysis of α-diversity did not reveal significant differences in species richness or evenness across different sample groups, which could be attributed to our relatively small sample size as well as high levels of contamination in one of the sequencing runs. β-diversity analysis, on the other hand, revealed differences between sample groups and within some patients in terms of the number of species present and their abundance, however, this can also be affected by contamination caused by DNA handling or demultiplexing. Furthermore, Bracken’s abundance estimation may not translate well into Nanopore sequencing data generated with the use of PCR and results from diversity analysis must be interpreted with caution. Future studies should endeavour to employ PCR-free sequencing methods for more accurate abundance estimations and biodiversity analysis.</p><p id="P37">Although the initial focus of this study was to investigate the presence of fungi in human brain tissue and CSF, an antibiotic resistant bacterium was also detected when assessing brain AD2_1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Assigned IN1, after Sanger sequencing we identified the resistant bacterium as a member of the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genus. It has been reported that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> may increase tau hyperphosphorylation, which is a hallmark of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Hence, it is possible that IN1 could have contributed to the development of AD within this patient. However, further studies are needed to strengthen our confidence in this relationship. It is challenging to determine whether IN1 was the result of a brain infection or the consequence of physical contamination during initial dissection of the neurological tissue or during its handling in the laboratory.</p><p id="P38">To improve sensitivity and confidence of species identification in metabarcoding studies, multiple pipelines and databases may need to be used, and newer machine learning-based classification systems may also be considered to enable the identification of novel species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Use of fungi-specific primers for PCR also reduces the need for depletion of background or host DNA and can increase detection of species with lower abundances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. This is however accompanied by the drawback of PCR artefacts and biases which affect the estimation of species abundance as the use of universal primers produces different amplification efficiencies in different species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Varying copy numbers of the ribosomal operon across species may also affect the number of reads obtained from each species and skew abundance estimations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P39">In conclusion, this study observed the presence of fungal DNA in healthy human brains, as well as AD/PD brains. The protocol developed to detect low levels of fungal DNA in CNS tissue will be of use for further exploring the microbial aetiology hypothesis for AD and PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary File S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS190274-supplement-Supplementary_File_S1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d105aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This paper presents independent research funded by a Wellcome Trust Institutional Strategic Support Fund’s Springboard Fellowship Scheme (Imperial College London) awarded to JR (WPIA_PSN105).
