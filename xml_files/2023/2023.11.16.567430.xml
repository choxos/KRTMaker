The role of NK cells has mainly been attributed to the elimination phase. Here we show that NK cells play a role in all three phases of cancer immunoediting. Extended co-culturing of DNA barcoded mouse BCR/ABL<sup>p185+</sup> B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) cells with NK cells allowed for a quantitative measure of NK cell-mediated immunoediting. Whereas most tumour cell clones were efficiently eliminated by NK cells, a certain fraction of tumour cells harboured an intrinsic primary resistance. Furthermore, DNA barcoding revealed tumour cell clones with secondary resistance, which stochastically acquired resistance to NK cells. NK cell cytotoxicity put a selective pressure on B-ALL cells, which led to an outgrowth of primary and secondary resistant tumour cell clones, which were characterised by an IFN-γ signature. Besides well-known regulators of immune evasion, our analysis of NK cell resistant tumour cells revealed the upregulation of genes, including <italic>Ly6a</italic>, which we found to promote NK cell resistance in leukaemic cells. Translation of our findings to the human system showed that high expression of <italic>LY6E</italic> on tumour cells impaired the physical interaction with NK cells and led to worse prognosis in leukaemia patients. Our results demonstrate that tumour cells are actively edited by NK cells during the equilibrium phase and use different avenues to escape NK cell-mediated eradication.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cancer immunoediting</kwd><kwd>natural killer cells</kwd><kwd>tumour evolution</kwd><kwd>DNA barcoding</kwd><kwd>cytotoxicity</kwd><kwd>effector function</kwd><kwd>interferon-γ</kwd><kwd>perforin</kwd><kwd>Ly6A</kwd><kwd>LY6E</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cancer immunoediting refers to the dynamic interaction between immune and cancer cells during tumour development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). The immune system can have both tumour-promoting and -suppressive effects. This process occurs in three phases: elimination, equilibrium, and escape. In the elimination phase, adaptive and innate immune cells, particularly cytotoxic T and natural killer (NK) cells, recognise and eliminate cancer cells. The equilibrium phase involves the coexistence of tumour cells and the immune system, leading to sculpting of the tumour under constant immune pressure, ultimately resulting in immune escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>).</p><p id="P3">NK cells are innate lymphoid cells with the ability of recognising and eliminating damaged, stressed, and infected cells including cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). NK cell activation relies on a balance of activating and inhibitory signals from receptors on their surface during the interaction with potential target cells. On the one hand, NK cells kill target cells through exocytosis of cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), induction of death receptor-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). On the other hand, NK cells secrete cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which activate other immune cells in their vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). In the context of cancer immunoediting, NK cells play a crucial role in eliminating tumour cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) and limiting their metastatic spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). NK cells spare healthy tissue and represent a safe treatment option with minimal risk of causing adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). As a result, there is growing interest in using NK cells for immunotherapies, which will benefit from a better understanding of how tumour cells evade NK cell attacks. Most studies to date have focused on the interaction between human NK cells and tumour cell lines obtained from patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). These tumour cells have already successfully evaded from the patient’s immune system and may thus not represent suitable models to study immunoediting.</p><p id="P4">Here, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture model based on non-edited NK cell-naïve mouse BCR/ABL<sup>p185+</sup> B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) cells to investigate the primary interaction of tumour and NK cells. NK cell resistant tumour cells that emerged during the co-culture showed an upregulation of many IFN-γ-dependent genes, such as lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus A (<italic>Ly6a</italic>). This study identified Ly6A as novel driver of NK cell-mediated immune evasion of mouse leukaemia and extended our knowledge about the role of LY6E in limiting NK cell anti-tumour activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Moreover, we established a model to quantify NK cell effector functions and their ability to edit tumour cells by cellular DNA barcoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). In summary, this study shows that NK cells play a role in all three phases of cancer immunoediting and contribute to the active sculpting of tumour cells, ultimately driving tumour evasion.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mice</title><p id="P5">C57BL/6JRj wild-type mice (RRID:MGI:2670020) were obtained from the Janvier labs and C57BL/6-Prf1<sup>tm1Sdz</sup>/J (<italic>Prf1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) (Strain #002407, RRID:IMSR_JAX:002407) and B6.129S7-Ifng<sup>tm1Ts</sup>/J (<italic>Ifng</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) mice (Strain #002287, RRID:IMSR_JAX:002287) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory.

While the tumour cells initially showed significantly slower proliferation in the presence of NK cells during the first two rounds of co-culture, this difference became marginal in the third round.

After bulk DNA sequencing of the barcodes, we designed a decision tree to discriminate these four categories algorithmically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Primary resistance, also known as intrinsic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), is defined as <italic>a priori</italic> resistance towards therapy. In our study, primary resistance was characterised by a reproducible and significant accumulation of a clone despite the presence of NK cells in co-culture. In comparison, secondary resistance describes the phenomenon of acquired resistance, represented by a situation in which a tumour can initially respond effectively to therapy but relapse or progress after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). We hypothesised that secondary resistance was not a general tumour-intrinsic property but acquired only by a subfraction of sibling cells and would therefore be observed only in isolated wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Indeed, clustering of the barcoded leukaemic cells according to the pre-defined categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C&amp;D</xref>), showed that the majority of clones was efficiently eliminated (58.5±4.8%, n=2-3 independent experiments, n=2-4 B-ALL cell lines, mean±SD). A smaller number of cell clones showed an NK cell resistant phenotype (14.3±4%) or remained static (23.9±4.4%) despite the presence of NK cells. As hypothesised, we also observed secondary resistance, characterised by the presence of a cell clone in only one of the three replicate wells (3.3±2.5%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). In line with the paradigm that the acquisition of a resistant phenotype in tumour cells takes time, we observed the emergence of secondary resistance primarily at the later of the two sampling timepoints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2A</xref>). To be able to draw conclusions about the pre-existing fate of the tumour cell clones, we compared two independent experiments with the same barcoded cell lines.

In contrast, the pool of secondary resistant tumour cell clones was distinctive for independent experiments. In summary, whereas primary resistant and eliminated cells harboured tumour-intrinsic properties <italic>a priori</italic> that determined their destiny, the fate of secondary resistant tumour cell clones was stochastic. This underscored our hypothesis that secondary resistant tumour cells acquired their resistant phenotype during NK cell co-culture. Our data clearly showed that apart from direct killing, NK cells participated in immunoediting by actively shaping the tumourigenicity of individual tumour cells.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Molecular changes observed in NK cell resistant B-ALL cells</title><p id="P41">To identify novel drivers of NK cell resistance we investigated changes in the transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiles of NK cell resistant B-ALL cells generated during the long-term <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture.

However, a total of 129 genes were up- and 27 were downregulated in all four cell lines and may be universally associated with or driving NK cell escape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).

In summary, multiomics analyses revealed that the B-ALL cells, which were not <italic>a priori</italic> sensitive and eliminated by NK cells, showed a highly NK cell resistant phenotype characterised by a strong IFN-γ signature and the upregulation of <italic>Ly6a</italic> and <italic>Plaat3</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Relative contribution of NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production in cancer immunoediting</title><p id="P42">The two main functions of NK cells are the direct lysis of tumour cells and the production of pro-apoptotic and -inflammatory cytokines, most importantly IFN-γ. To discriminate the relative contributions of killing and cytokine production to cancer immunoediting, we performed two independent long-term co-culture experiments with NK cells deficient in perforin (<italic>Prf1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>), which renders them unable to kill their target cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), or deficient in IFN-γ production (<italic>Ifng</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">S6</xref>).

Co-culture with <italic>Prf1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> NK cells only led to a minor growth impairment of the tumour cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The presence of <italic>Ifng</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> NK cells diminished the number of B-ALL cells in the beginning of the co-culture, but the tumour cells became resistant sooner than B-ALL cells co-cultured with WT NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Five days after B-ALL cells outcompeted NK cells, we measured their NK cell resistance. A cytotoxicity assay using WT NK cells was performed and showed that in both experiments, B-ALL cells that had been co-cultured with WT NK cells showed the highest NK cell resistance. <italic>Prf1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> as well as <italic>Ifng</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> NK cell co-cultured B-ALL cells were more resistant compared to B-ALL cells cultured alone, however the resistance was lower than in WT NK co-cultured B-ALL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B&amp;D</xref>).</p><p id="P43">To study the clonal behaviour of the tumour cells, the B-ALL cells were analysed for their barcode diversity on day 4 and 14/17. In line with our previous experiments, the barcode diversity of the B-ALL + WT NK cell condition dropped significantly in both experiments by approx. 58%. The Shannon diversity of B-ALL cells was decreased by 20% and 40% after co-culture with <italic>Prf1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> or <italic>Ifng</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> NK cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4E&amp;G</xref>).

This suggested that the strong immunological pressure of NK cells leading to the emergence of primary or secondary resistance was driven by cytotoxicity rather than IFN-γ production.</p><p id="P44">To define the molecular changes driving NK cell resistance, we compared the transcriptomic profiles of B-ALL cells after co-culture with WT and <italic>Prf1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> (day 14, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4I&amp;J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">S6A&amp;B</xref>) or <italic>Ifng</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> NK cells (day 17, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4K&amp;L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">S6C&amp;D</xref> and day 32, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figures S6E-H</xref>).

We demonstrated in multiple experiments that <italic>Plaat3</italic> and <italic>Ly6a</italic> belonged to the most significantly upregulated genes in NK cell resistant B-ALL cell lines. Therefore, we followed up on these genes and studied their role in immune evasion. We performed a co-culture experiment as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and analysed the B-ALL cells on day 14 by mass spectrometry to confirm the upregulation of PLAAT3 and Ly6A on the protein level. Indeed, PLAAT3 and Ly6A were increased after WT or <italic>Prf1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> NK cell co-culture and even more upon recombinant IFN-γ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S7A</xref>). We confirmed that the IFN-γ-dependent upregulation of Ly6A in B-ALL cells in NK cell co-culture was stable, as it persisted several days after the NK cells were gone from the co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P47">To study the role of PLAAT3 in more detail, we generated <italic>Plaat3</italic> KO B-ALL clones and verified the lack of <italic>Plaat3</italic> mRNA by qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7B</xref>). <italic>Plaat3</italic> KO cells did not show any difference in proliferation and viability, IFN-γ production by NK cells and NK cell receptor ligand expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figures S7C-F</xref>). Moreover, loss of <italic>Plaat3</italic> did not affect direct NK cell-mediated killing of mouse B-ALL cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7G</xref>). To test the relevance of the human orthologue <italic>PLAAT3</italic> in leukaemia, we analysed the <italic>PLAAT3</italic> expression of ALL patients and observed an insignificant trend of worse overall survival in patients with increased <italic>PLAAT3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7H</xref>). These results suggested that while PLAAT3 expression was upregulated by IFN-γ and correlated with NK cell resistance, it does not constitute a driver of NK cell resistance.</p><p id="P48">Likewise, we deleted <italic>Ly6a</italic> in B-ALL cells and verified the lack of Ly6A surface protein expression by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Ly6A deficiency had no impact on B-ALL cell proliferation or survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5D&amp;E</xref>). To investigate the impact of Ly6A on the transcriptomic level, we performed RNA sequencing of <italic>Ly6a</italic> WT and KO B-ALL cells and found 127 up- and 80 downregulated genes mainly related to metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5F&amp;G</xref>). In line with these results, we observed an increased mitochondrial and glycolytic ATP production in <italic>Ly6a</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). Increased tumour metabolism may induce stress ligand expression and consequently lead to better activation of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). While the majority of classical NK cell receptor ligands showed unaltered expression, we observed a slightly higher expression of Rae1 (<italic>p=0.08</italic>, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test) and lower expression of CD112 (<italic>p=0.04</italic>) in B-ALL cells lacking Ly6A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>). Further, CD244 was upregulated in <italic>Ly6a</italic> KO cells on RNA and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5F&amp;J</xref>), a marker known to be present on NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), but only basally expressed in mouse marginal-zone B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>) with a reported function in B cell differentiation and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). We tested the functional consequences of <italic>Ly6a</italic> deficiency for the interaction of B-ALL and NK cells. We detected unaltered IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5K</xref>) and granzyme B production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5L</xref>) upon co-culture with B-ALL cells and similar numbers of tumour-NK conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5M</xref>) irrespective of the presence or absence of <italic>Ly6a</italic>. However, <italic>Ly6a</italic> KO B-ALL cells were more susceptible to NK cells compared to WT cells in cytotoxicity assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5N</xref>).

To further study the human relevance of our findings, we generated <italic>LY6E</italic>-deficient BCR/ABL1<sup>+</sup> K562 cells and verified the lack of LY6E protein expression by immunoblotting. Notwithstanding that others have seen an IFN-β and IFN-γ-dependent induction of LY6E expression in hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>), we only detected an upregulation of LY6E using IFN-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Nonetheless, they can fail controlling cancer cells which successfully evaded from the immune surveillance. The presented study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms employed by tumour cells to escape NK cells. Our study is based on heterogeneous, non-edited and immune-naïve mouse BCR/ABL<sup>p185+</sup> B-ALL tumour cell lines, which were co-cultured for several weeks with mouse NK cells. This unique model enables to explore the primary interplay between tumour cells and the immune system. Furthermore, the B-ALL tumour cells were DNA barcoded, a technique that allows for the quantification of tumour cell clonal dynamics and a better understanding of NK cell effector functions. To the best of our knowledge, this particular aspect has not been demonstrated in previous studies. The determination of tumour cell fate during the co-culture revealed that most tumour cell clones possessed inherent sensitivity or resistance to NK cells. This technique has already been used by many others to quantify tumour cell susceptibility towards immune cells, drug- or antibody-based immunotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Similar to our research, these studies observed that the majority of tumour cells is predestined for being sensitive or resistant to treatment. Our study highlighted tumour cell clones beyond those two fundamental fates of life and death, which acquired secondary resistance in the presence of NK cells. Secondary resistance, defined as the occurrence of resistance in one of three replicate wells after two weeks of co-culture, was only observed in a small subset of tumour cell clones. Similarly, using DNA barcoding to investigate the clonal evolution of drug-treated lung cancer cells, Acar <italic>et al</italic>. recently described the emergence of “<italic>de novo</italic> resistant lineages” in one replicate only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Interestingly, we found that secondary resistant tumour cells were highly distinctive for each independently performed experiment, suggesting that a stochastic event causes the resistance. However, due to the necessity of expanding the barcoded cell lines before the experiments (to ensure reproducible representation of all barcodes in every well), we cannot formally exclude the possibility of pre-existing heterogeneity within a cell clone. Furthermore, the barcode sequence of the LG2.1 library was found to be located approximately 900 bps upstream of the polyA tail and could thus not be detected using single-cell RNA sequencing. It would certainly be interesting to delve deeper into secondary resistance mechanisms and to compare the transcriptomic profiles of primary and secondary resistant tumour cell clones in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>).</p><p id="P52">In summary, the DNA barcode analysis demonstrated that NK cells can shape tumour cells and contribute to immunoediting of tumour cell clones. To dissect the two main functions of NK cells, namely killing tumour cells and producing IFN-γ, we analysed the clonal evolution of B-ALL cells co-cultured with <italic>Prf1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Ifng</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> NK cells, respectively. It is widely acknowledged that IFN-γ is a major player in cancer immunoediting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). In our experiments, tumour cells responded to the NK cell co-culture with an upregulation of many IFN-γ inducible genes, such as MHC-I molecules, thereby inhibiting NK cells and inducing resistance. Interestingly, and against our expectations, we observed a similar number of primary and secondary resistant B-ALL cell clones upon co-culture with WT or <italic>Ifng</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> NK cells. On the contrary, co-culture with <italic>Prf1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> NK cells led to fewer primary and secondary resistant B-ALL cell clones. This clearly suggested that the selection of <italic>a priori</italic> resistant tumour cell clones and the acquisition of secondary resistance was mainly mediated by NK cell killing rather than IFN-γ production. However, the transcriptomic changes observed in long-term co-cultured B-ALL cells were only partially affected by loss of NK killing capacity, but completely absent in B-ALL cells cultured with <italic>Ifng</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> NK cells. This data argues against a major contribution of other NK cell-derived cytokines such as TNF-α on the tumour immunoediting process. We thus concluded that while IFN-γ plays only a minor role in tumour cell elimination, it enhances NK cell resistance of the remaining tumour cells by upregulating IFN-γ dependent genes, such as genes involved in MHC-I presentation and <italic>Ly6a</italic>.</p><p id="P53">Amongst others, previously described NK cell tumour evasion mechanisms include the upregulation of proteins involved in antigen presentation and MHC-I and -II molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>), the loss or shedding of NKG2D ligands such as MHC class I chain-related molecule A and B (MICA/B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>) and secretion of TGF-β and IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Notably, we here describe <italic>Ly6a</italic> overexpression as emerging novel driver of tumour evasion by impairing NK cell-mediated killing. Ly6A, also called stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1), is an 18-kDa mouse glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface protein. It plays an important role in haematopoietic progenitor/stem cell lineage fate, brain blood barrier transport and cancer stem cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). Ly6A was shown to be upregulated in cancer stem cells and many tumour entities and is induced by Wnt/β-Catenin signalling and TGF-β deregulation. This promotes cell adhesion and migration <italic>in vitro</italic>, increased tumourigenicity and resistance to chemotherapy <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>). The human LY6 gene family comprises several members, but the direct orthologue of mouse <italic>Ly6a</italic> has been under debate for a long time. <italic>LY6A/LY6S</italic> was just recently discovered probably due to its genomic localisation on the opposite strand of and highly overlapping with <italic>C8orf3/LINC02904</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>). The expression of <italic>LY6A/LY6S</italic> seems to be restricted to pituitary tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>) and a subset of non-classical lymphoid cells of the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>), and it could not be detected in hematopoietic cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>) or cancer patients. Besides <italic>LY6A/LY6S</italic>, other <italic>LY6</italic> family members were suggested as close homologues of the murine <italic>Ly6a</italic> gene, such as <italic>LY6D, LY6E, LY6H</italic> and <italic>LY6K</italic>, which were implicated as novel biomarkers for poor cancer prognosis and are frequently amplified in human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). Al Hossiny <italic>et al</italic>. showed that human LY6E promotes breast cancer <italic>in vivo</italic> and drives drug sensitivity and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, they observed that LY6E is required for TGF-β signalling and facilitates immune evasion by upregulating PD-L1 on cancer cells, by recruiting T-regulatory cells and dampening NK cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). In line, our survival analysis of a paediatric ALL-patient cohort confirmed the cancer driving feature of LY6E also in leukaemia. Our data clearly shows that NK cells are less likely to form conjugates with human leukemic cells in the presence of LY6E, which ultimately resulted in a minor increase in NK cell susceptibility. In summary, this substantiates the reported oncogenic and immune suppressive properties of human LY6E and murine Ly6A, but the exact mechanism remains unknown. Although Ly6A has not been directly associated with cell metabolism, our data indicates that <italic>Ly6a</italic> KO B-ALL cells produce more ATP through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Increased metabolism is generally associated with immune suppression and NK cell inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>), which is contradictory to our observed phenotype. However, it was also shown that increased glycolysis can enhance the expression of NK cell activating NKG2D ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). We only observed a slight and insignificant increase of Rae1 on <italic>Ly6a</italic> KO B-ALL cells, besides differences in CD112 and CD244 expression. It has been suggested that Ly6A regulates the clustering of receptors or ligands within lipid rafts on the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>). We thus hypothesise that potential differences in local concentrations of NK cell receptor ligands may contribute to the lower susceptibility of Ly6A-expressing B-ALL cells to NK cell-mediated killing, but this notion needs further evaluation.</p><p id="P54">Considering the association of <italic>Ly6a</italic> with cancer stemness, our findings align with the concept that immunoedited and thus more aggressive tumour cells may harbour cancer stem cell (CSC) features. CSCs are considered responsible for metastasis and therapy resistance, as they are characterised by deregulated differentiation, self-renewal, drug resistance, and amongst others evasion of immunosurveillance. Unlike other immune cells, NK cells are believed to show direct cytotoxicity against CSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>). On the other hand, as CSCs frequently upregulate classical and non-classical MHC-I molecules while losing NK cell activating ligands, it is still a matter of debate if and how NK cells are able to detect and kill CSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>).</p><p id="P55">In conclusion, our work sheds light on the intricate interplay between NK and leukaemic cells during initial encounters. This study shows that leukaemic cells are actively shaped by NK cells and unravels novel cancer evasion strategies by identifying potential driver genes in mice (<italic>Ly6a</italic>) and men (<italic>LY6E</italic>). Further research, especially <italic>in vivo</italic> and with single cell resolution, is required to delve deeper into primary and secondary resistance mechanisms and the general role of Ly6A and LY6E in NK cell-mediated tumour surveillance. These findings ultimately deepen our understanding of the initial interaction between tumour and NK cells and of cancer immune evasion in general.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS191290-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_1.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d38aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figure 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS191290-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d38aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Figure 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS191290-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d38aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Figure 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS191290-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d38aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Figure 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS191290-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_5.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d38aAcEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Figure 6</label><media xlink:href="EMS191290-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_6.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d38aAcEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplementary Figure 7</label><media xlink:href="EMS191290-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_7.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d38aAcEhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Supplementary Figure 8</label><media xlink:href="EMS191290-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_8.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d38aAcEiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD9"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS191290-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAcEjB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD10"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS191290-supplement-Supplementary_Table_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAcEkB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S37"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Veronika Sexl (VetMedUni Vienna, Austria) for providing the BCR/ABL<sup>p185</sup> construct, Thomas Kolbe (VetMedUni Vienna, Austria) for providing the <italic>B2m</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice and Sabine Strehl and Klaus Fortschegger (CCRI, Austria) for discussions and sharing information.

Variability is defined as <italic>v</italic> = <italic>log</italic>2(<italic>max</italic>(<italic>x</italic> + 1)/<italic>min</italic>(<italic>x</italic> + 1)), where <italic>x</italic> is a vector of normalised counts across samples. A rule-based decision tree was designed to discriminate the four categories depicted in (A). <bold>(C)</bold> The percentage of the cell clones in each group on day 14 is depicted for cell lines A, B, C and D. Each data point represents the mean value (n=3 wells, sequenced in duplicates) of n=2-3 independent experiments. <bold>(D)</bold> The heatmap shows the normalised abundance of barcodes (norm. BC abundance) of cell line A from one representative experiment. Each subcolumn (n=3) in the figure represents a sample (well), and each row represents a barcode. The barcodes were divided into the four pre-defined groups according to the criteria defined in (B). The Shannon diversity index (shown above the heatmap) serves as measure of barcode diversity and drops significantly after 14 days of NK co-culture. The histogram on the left shows the average abundance of the barcoded cell clone in the B-ALL only samples on day 4. <bold>(E)</bold> The bubble plot depicts the normalised abundance of secondary resistant clones in B-ALL samples (day 4) compared to B-ALL + NK samples (day 14). The x-axis shows the three individual wells of each condition, while each row on the y-axis shows an individual tumour cell clone. The size and colour of the bubbles indicate the normalised barcode abundance. Shown is the same cell line and experiment as in (D). <bold>(F)</bold> Comparing two independent experiments in cell line A as shown in (D&amp;E), the Euler diagrams highlight a high overlap of eliminated, primary resistant, and static cell clones.
