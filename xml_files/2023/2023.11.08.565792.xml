Although the obligate parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> requires iron, how it responds when iron becomes limiting has not been investigated. Here, we show that iron depletion triggers significant transcriptional changes in the parasite, including in pathways that require iron. Interestingly, we find that a subset of <italic>T. gondii</italic> transcripts contain stem-loop structures which have been associated with post-transcriptional iron-mediated regulation in other cellular systems. We validate one of these (found in the 3’ UTR of TGME49_261720) using a reporter cell line. We show that the presence of the stem-loop containing UTR is sufficient to confer accumulation at the transcript and protein levels under low iron. We show that this response is dose and time-dependent and is specific for iron. Using immunoprecipitation, we show that the metabolic enzyme aconitase is capable of binding to mRNA, including <italic>fit</italic>, and that the presence of the <italic>fit</italic> UTR leads to stabilisation of the transcript under low iron conditions. These results demonstrate the existence of iron-mediated post-transcriptional regulation in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> for the first time, and show that the metabolic enzyme aconitase may have an additional role as an RNA-binding protein.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2"><italic>Toxoplasma</italic> is a highly successful obligate intracellular parasite with a broad host range. Infection in humans is typically asymptomatic, although in pregnant or immunocompromised people infection can have severe consequences. During infection, <italic>T. gondii</italic> invades and replicates within multiple cell types–exposing the parasite to rapidly changing levels of the key nutrients required to support replication. One of these essential nutrients is iron, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> requires iron to power cellular metabolism and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bergmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Pamukcu <italic>et al</italic>., 2021a</xref>). We have found that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> can detoxify excess iron by storing it within a membrane-bound compartment through the action of the vacuolar iron transporter (VIT), and that this storage is required to protect cells from excess iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Sloan, Aghabi and Harding, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aghabi <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) However, the parasite is likely to be exposed to limiting iron levels during infection as some tissues have low levels of available iron, and mammalian hosts restrict iron availability during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Reinert <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Morel <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). This means the parasite must sense and respond to changing levels of iron to maintain pathogenesis, however the mechanisms underlying this remain unknown.</p><p id="P3">Due to the importance of iron across kingdoms of life, regulation of iron uptake, usage and storage is highly conserved, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Wang and Pantopoulos, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Martínez-Pastor and Puig, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gao and Dubos, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Fontenot and Ding, 2023</xref>). However, mechanisms used to respond to iron stress are frequently distinct between organisms and range from control at the transcriptional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Fontenot and Ding, 2023</xref>), post-transcriptional and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Shin <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>) levels. These pathways allow cells to regulate key proteins in response to low iron to promote survival.</p><p id="P4">One of the best studied mechanisms for iron-mediated regulation in mammalian cells is the post-transcriptional IRE/IRP system. Transcripts of genes involved in cellular iron homeostasis (such as the transferrin receptor, TfR, the main pathway of cellular iron uptake) contain short stem-loop regions (SLRs), called iron-response elements (IREs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Campillos <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Sanchez <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). In low iron conditions, the metabolic enzyme aconitase (also called iron-regulatory protein 1, IRP1) loses its iron-sulphur (FeS) cluster cofactor. This abrogates its enzyme activity, and instead aconitase moonlights as a RNA-binding protein where it binds to the IREs present in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hentze <italic>et al</italic>., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">D. M. Koeller <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Philpott, Klausner and Rouault, 1994</xref>). Crucially, the location of the IRE within the transcript determines whether aconitase binding results in repression or promotion of translation. Aconitase binding in the 3’ UTR of genes acts to stabilise transcripts and promotes protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">D M Koeller <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Erlitzki, Long and Theil, 2002</xref>). Whereas binding in the 5’ UTR, found in transcript of the iron storage protein ferritin, is thought to block access of the translation apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hentze <italic>et al</italic>., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sanchez <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Garza <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), inhibiting translation. This system allows cells to respond to iron stress by upregulating iron import (via TfR) and downregulating storage, leading to greater iron availability for cellular processes.</p><p id="P5">The aconitase/IRE system has been reported to regulate iron response in several organisms beyond mammals, including invertebrates and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alén and Sonenshein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Tang and Guest, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lind <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). In plants, the role of aconitase in iron-response remains unclear; in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> aconitases can bind RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Marondedze <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>), however this did not appear to directly modulate ferritin abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Arnaud <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), possibly explained by functional redundancy between the three aconitases. Iron-mediated regulation beyond model organisms is less well understood. In the kinetoplast <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, an RNA binding protein binds and stabilises the transcript of the parasite transferrin receptor under low iron to promote iron uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Carbajo <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Similar systems have been proposed in the protozoan parasites <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Calla-Choque <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">León-Sicairos <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) and <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Plata-Guzmán <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Within the apicomplexan family, there is some evidence of a functional IRE system. In <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the causative agent of malaria, IRE-like structures have been identified and shown to interact with parasite aconitase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Loyevsky <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">2003</xref>). However, these experiments were performed <italic>in vitro</italic> using bacterially purified proteins, and the existence of a functional system in cells was not established.</p><p id="P6">Here we perform RNAseq on iron-deprived parasites and find global transcriptional changes, including alterations in iron-dependent pathways. To identify possible mechanisms for parasites responses to low iron, we identify <italic>in silico</italic> IRE-like sequences in the <italic>T. gondii</italic> transcriptome. Selecting a predicted IRE from the 3’ UTR of a predicted, but unstudied iron transporter, TGME49_261720, which we name here FIT. We show that this IRE-like sequence is required and sufficient to confer iron-responsivity to a reporter gene. Interestingly, we further show that this IRE-structure binds to parasite aconitase, and that the transcript is stabilised under low iron conditions. This is the first example of a functional IRE-like sequence in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, and provides evidence for a role of post-translational gene expression regulation in <italic>T. gondii</italic> iron homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The transcriptional response to iron deprivation</title><p id="P7">Transcriptional responses to iron deprivation are common across organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Andrews, Robinson and Rodríguez-Quiñones, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gao and Dubos, 2021</xref>). To determine how iron deprivation impacts the transcriptome of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, we deprived parasites of iron by infecting primary human cells (HFF), pretreated for 24 h with the iron chelator Deferoxamine (DFO). After 24 h, parasites were mechanically released, filtered to remove host debris and bulk RNA-sequencing performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We observed 1197 transcripts with higher abundance in parasites cultured in low iron conditions compared to untreated parasites, whilst just 44 were downregulated (log<sub>2</sub>fold change £-2, adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value (padj) &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S1</xref>). This bias towards upregulation of transcripts was unexpected and was not seen upon oxidative stress induction (Augusto, 2021) or upon downregulation of an essential metabolic regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We next examined if iron deprivation impacted transcript abundance of genes whose protein products are predicted to contain iron sulphur (FeS) clusters, using the <italic>in silico</italic> prediction tool MetalPredator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Valasatava <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>).

The largest affect was seen in the mitochondrial FeS synthesis pathway, with 8/12 genes in the ISC pathway differentially regulated including downregulation of the FeS scaffold ISCU1 (TGME49_237560) and the proposed FeS carrier NFU4 (TGME49_212930). The FeS co-chaperone MGE1 (TGME49_265220) and ferredoxin MFdx1 (TGME49_236000) also down regulated, though fold changes were modest. However, ISD11 and NFS1, which provide sulphur to clusters, were upregulated. Supporting this, many of the downregulated FeS-containing genes are predicted to be mitochondrially localised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Barylyuk <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Of the upregulated transcripts, we saw bradyzoite stage specific genes including: BAG1 (log<sub>2</sub> fold change 3.2, p-adj = 1.94E-10), ENO1 (log<sub>2</sub> fold change 5.1, p-adj = 6.3E-18) and LDH2 (log<sub>2</sub> fold change 6.4, p-adj = 6.87E-29), supporting a recent observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>),.

The algorithm identified 3638 sequences of interest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S4</xref>), based on homology to known IREs. Many were assigned a ‘Low’ quality score and were not considered further, leaving a total of 1102 genes with IRE-like sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S5</xref>). Most functionally validated IRE elements in other systems are present in the untranslated regions of transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Sanchez <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).

At 24 hours post infection we collected cells and quantified mNeonGreen and tdTomato fluorescence by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). DFO treatment did not significantly affect mNeonGreen fluorescence in either line, and, in the tdTomato<sub><italic>dhfr</italic></sub> line, iron deprivation had no effect on tdTomato fluorescence. However, DFO treatment led to an approximately 2-3 fold increase in tdTomato fluorescence in the tdTomato<sub><italic>fit</italic></sub> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). We quantified the ratio of tdTomato/mNeonGreen fluorescence and normalised to the untreated lines, this showed a significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, one way ANOVA) increase in the ratio in DFO treated parasites, compared to the tdTomato<sub><italic>dhfr</italic></sub> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).

For this we chose another gene involved in parasite iron metabolism ISCU (TGME49_237560) the mitochondrial FeS pathway scaffold protein. <italic>iscu</italic> is predicted by SIREs to have a medium quality, class 13, IRE-like sequence in the 3’ UTR (5’-catgctgaatgcatgccatgtaccatgaacat -3’).

We then quantified the ratio of tdTomato fluorescence in untreated and DFO treated tdTomato<sub><italic>iscu</italic></sub> parasites as above. While we saw a slight increase in tdTomato fluorescence upon DFO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>) this change was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). As such this IRE-like sequence is not likely to be functional. Other than a difference in the nucleotide sequence between the <italic>fit</italic> and <italic>iscu</italic> IRE-like sequences, we also noted that they occupy different positions in the respective 3’ UTRs. The <italic>fit</italic> IRE-like sequence is relatively central in the UTR (position 1016/2144 bp), whereas the <italic>iscu</italic> sequence starts closer to the 3’ end of the UTR (position 1149/1278 bp). To examine whether IRE position may be important for function, and therefore offer a hypothesis as to the difference in responsiveness between the <italic>fit</italic> and <italic>iscu</italic> reporters, we plotted the distance from the stop codon of predicted IRE-like sequences in 3’ UTRs against whether that transcript was differentially abundant in our RNAseq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). From this we observed that transcripts with IRE-like sequences between 600-1400 bp from the stop codon were more likely to be differentially abundant in iron deprived parasites compared to the control.

To determine the timing of the response at the transcript level, we performed qRT-PCR on reverse transcribed RNA taken from the parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). We saw no significant change in the tdTomato transcript abundance (relative to actin) in the tdTomato<sub><italic>dhfr</italic></sub> cells. However, in the tdTomato<sub><italic>fit</italic></sub> line there was an increase in transcripts detectable from 9 hours (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0849, mixed effects test with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test), which then was significantly increased at 18 hours of treatment (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0169). However, by 24 h (the peak of tdTomato protein abundance) mRNA levels had fallen back to untreated levels. This pattern in regulation was similar to that of the endogenous <italic>fit</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), though the magnitude of the increasing transcript abundance was more modest – possibly reflecting the difference in promoter strength. We also examined protein expression over the same time course using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). As at the transcript level, there was no significant change in tdTomato fluorescence was observed in the tdTomato<sub><italic>dhfr</italic></sub> cells at any timepoint. However, in the tdTomato<sub><italic>fit</italic></sub> line, we saw a gradual increase in tdTomato signal, starting at 18 h post infection with a further increase at 24 h. Interestingly, the peak of increased transcript level was seen earlier than the peak of protein expression. These results show that mRNA levels peak prior to protein, as would be expected. It also suggests that this response to iron deprivation relies on new protein synthesis, rather than a reduction in the degradation at the protein level in the cell.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Removal of the IRE-like element from the <italic>fit</italic> 3’ UTR reduces iron responsiveness</title><p id="P22">As described above, we found a predicted IRE-like element in the <italic>fit</italic> 3’ UTR.

To investigate the role of aconitase in the response to iron, we made use of a parasite line with aconitase tagged with a Ty epitope (ACN-Ty) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>).

We believe that this stabilisation leads to the increased mRNA abundance we observed, and later to an increase in protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Given the binding of aconitase to specific transcripts and the role of the IRE sequence, this work provides evidence for the presence of a post-transcriptional iron-response pathway in <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">Here we show for the first time the existence of iron-mediated post-transcriptional responses in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. The ability of cells to respond to iron availability is conserved across the tree of life, however the mechanistic details of regulation are often species-specific. In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, iron deprivation leads to a substantial upregulation of transcripts, with over 13% of the genome significantly upregulated (log<sub>2</sub> fold change &gt;2), and few genes downregulated. Along with changes in genes predicted to encode iron-bound proteins and their synthesis pathways, we see evidence that iron deprivation leads to an upregulation of genes associated with the in bradyzoite stage (e.g., BAG1, LDH2 and ENO1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Waldman <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Iron deprivation now joins an extensive list of cellular stresses able to trigger stage conversion in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. Recent work is now uncovering the upstream molecular pathways involved in mediating stage conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Licon <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), however the pathway of how loss of iron directly triggers the stage conversion remains unknown.</p><p id="P27">The lack of apparent specificity in the transcriptional response led us to believe there were further, post-transcriptional layers of regulation to ensure that <italic>T. gondii</italic> could respond to iron deprivation. Using a sequence-based search algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Campillos <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), we were able to identify genes containing iron response element-like sequences. One limitation of this approach is that these predictions are made based on data from human and mouse cells; <italic>T. gondii</italic> are highly divergent from model opisthokonts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">White and Suvorova, 2018</xref>) and so while these predictions are likely to be an overestimate, we cannot exclude that functional but divergent IREs are also present. Additionally, the short sequence-based search algorithm utilised cannot consider the full context of transcripts (e.g. folding or secondary structures) and may also return ‘false positive’ sequences. Our data suggests that beyond these limitations, both the IRE class, and its positioning within the UTR, may be important in responsiveness, and future work will seek to more precisely understand which features are required.</p><p id="P28">The iron response seen here was dynamic, mRNA accumulation was detected between 9-18 h post treatment, while protein levels increased between 18-24 h post treatment. We did not extend treatment beyond 24 h, as between 24-48 h we saw a sharp drop in parasite viability (results not shown). However, mRNA accumulation was transient, with levels returning to below the untreated by 24 h. While this explains the otherwise surprising finding that <italic>fit</italic> is significantly downregulated in our 24 h-treated RNAseq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>), we do not yet know the mechanisms underlying this repression. We found that removal of 18 nucleotides from the <italic>fit</italic> 3’ UTR mostly abrogated the iron-responsiveness, suggesting that this motif plays a key role. Whilst it is possible that removal of these nucleotides altered the mRNA folding, we confirmed that removal of the predicted IRE did not affect transcript stability or eventual protein abundance under normal growth conditions. Although not statistically significant, the <italic>fit</italic>ΔIRE UTR did show generally greater iron-responsivity than the control, suggesting that other mRNA-structures may contribute, although the IRE appears essential for the magnitude of the response.</p><p id="P29">We then sought to determine whether, as established in other systems, aconitase can bind the <italic>T. gondii</italic> IRE-like sequences and impact gene expression. <italic>T. gondii</italic> encodes a single aconitase gene required for the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">MacRae <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Harding <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) which conserves all the predicted RNA-binding residues. By immunoprecipitating aconitase from <italic>T. gondii</italic> in low iron conditions, we were reproducibly able to amplify <italic>fit</italic> mRNA, occasionally the highly abundant <italic>actin</italic>, but not the control <italic>rng2</italic> bound to the protein. This provides the first evidence that <italic>T. gondii</italic> aconitase shares a role as an RNA-binding protein, with a potential role in the post-transcriptional response to low iron. We further show that upon iron deprivation, the presence of the <italic>fit</italic> 3’ UTR acts to prevent degradation of the transcript. We believe it is likely this increased stability which leads to the accumulation of transcript, followed by protein levels. In mammalian systems, aconitase binding to IRE-sequences has been shown to stabilise the TfR transcript, leading to protein upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">DeRusso <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kato <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).

Protein content of lysates was quantified by Bradford assay (ThermoScientific, B6916) following manufacturer’s instructions. 10 mg of parasite lysate was combined with 0.2 mM NADP and 0.004 U of isocitrate dehydrogenase (Sigma, <underline>I2002</underline>) in a total volume of 100 ml. In each assay, 10 μl of disrupted and filtered host cell debris was included to ensure no contamination by host cell enzymes present. The absorbance was read at 340 nm at 25°C every 5 mins for 1 h on a PheraStar plate reader. After normalization to blanks, the slope was calculated from the linear section of the curve and protein activity (c) calculated using c = slope<sub>final</sub>/ε · b with ε of NADP = 6.22 mM<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> and path length (b) set to 1.
