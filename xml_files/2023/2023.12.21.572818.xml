directions and increases contrast in both fixed and live specimens. However, 3D-SIM has so far not been widely applied to imaging deep in thick tissues due to its sensitivity to specimen-induced aberrations, making the method difficult to apply beyond 10 μm in depth. Furthermore, 3D-SIM has not been available in an upright configuration, limiting its use for live imaging while manipulating the specimen, for example with electrophysiology. Here, we have overcome these barriers by developing a novel upright 3D-SIM system (termed Deep3DSIM) that incorporates adaptive optics (AO) for aberration correction and remote focusing, reducing artefacts, and removing the need to move the specimen or objective. Both these advantages are equally applicable to inverted 3D-SIM microscopes. We demonstrate high-quality 3D-SIM imaging up to 130 μm into complex tissue and live sample manipulation, including human cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brains and embryos.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Super-resolution microscopy (SRM)</kwd><kwd>3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM)</kwd><kwd>aberration correction</kwd><kwd>deep imaging</kwd><kwd>adaptive optics (AO)</kwd><kwd>deformable mirror (DM)</kwd><kwd>remote focusing</kwd><kwd>spatial light modulator (SLM)</kwd><kwd>neuroscience</kwd><kwd>nervous system</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>live cell imaging</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Fluorescence microscopy has greatly advanced with the development of super-resolution microscopy techniques that enable biological imaging with spatial resolutions well below the optical diffraction limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Sahl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Schermelleh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schermelleh et al., 2010</xref>). One of these approaches is 3D structured Illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) which features two-fold increased resolution in each spatial direction and enables fast optical sectioning with strongly enhanced imaging contrast. This approach recovers missing high spatial frequency information by illuminating the specimen with finely patterned illumination across the specimen and computational reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Gustafsson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Schermelleh et al., 2008</xref>). 3D-SIM has become increasingly popular amongst cell biologists, as it is compatible with standard fluorophores and labelling protocols commonly used in widefield or confocal microscopy.</p><p id="P5">Over the past decade, several off-the-shelf 3D-SIM instruments have become commercially available and have been successfully used for various biological applications. However, all share certain limitations that restrict their usage to thin specimens on inverted setups. Optical aberrations are a main contributor to common reconstruction artefacts in 3D-SIM imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Demmerle et al., 2017</xref>). These include (1) spherical aberration induced by refractive index (RI) mismatches between the immersion media, mounting media, and sample, and (2) sample-induced aberrations caused by RI inhomogeneities within the specimen. As their deteriorating effects increase with imaging depth, it is currently difficult to obtain artefact-free 3D-SIM images at a depth greater than around 10 μm and over larger z-ranges in most specimens when using high numerical aperture (NA) oil-immersion objectives. Effective imaging depth may be increased to some extent using silicon-immersion objectives, which are designed for use with an immersion fluid with an RI closer to that of tissue, thus reducing spherical aberration. Currently, no upright, off-the-shelf SIM microscope systems exist that use water-dipping objectives, e.g. to carry out live neuroscience experiments with electrophysiology or other workflows involving imaging without a coverslip and providing access to the specimen and its manipulation while imaging. There are two reasons for this limitation. First, water-dipping objectives are more sensitive to aberrations than, for example, silicon immersion objectives due to RI mismatch and movement induced by living specimens. Second, the optical pathways of upright microscopes present technical challenges to the accommodation of 3D-SIM functionality, together with the ergonomic constraints required to allow access to the specimen for manipulation. Due to its rigid requirement of an optimal point spread function (PSF), 3D-SIM requires high mechanical stability, which potentially conflicts with the need for specimen manipulation for neuroscience experiments that require a large working distance and involve movement of the sample platform or instrument. Therefore, the benefits of 3D-SIM have not been utilised in large areas of biology such as, for example, live cell imaging of nervous system preparations while manipulating the specimen.</p><p id="P6">An obvious solution to the above limitation is to incorporate adaptive optics (AO) using a deformable mirror (DM) in the optical path of a 3D-SIM microscope. AO would not only enable the correction of spherical and specimen-induced aberrations, but it would also allow remote focusing without the need to move the specimen or objective. These functionalities have been described as prototype methods for widefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Kam et al., 2007</xref>), and 3D-SIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Turcotte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Žurauskas et al., 2019</xref>) as well as for remote focusing for multiphoton imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Žurauskas et al., 2017</xref>). However, none of the off-the-shelf 3D-SIM instruments are designed to allow the inclusion of AO. Moreover, AO hardware and software controls are currently not available as simple modules that can be added to the optical path of commercial systems. While some exciting bespoke-built AO-SIM systems have previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Turcotte et al., 2019</xref>), these proof-of-principle prototypes use AO for aberration correction only and are not suitable for general biological applications and certainly not for applications requiring an upright optical configuration with multiple channels. To our knowledge, DM-driven remote focusing, although well studied in both simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Kner et al., 2011</xref>) and experiments, for example, in confocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Poland et al., 2008</xref>) and multiphoton imaging, has not been implemented on any 3D-SIM systems.</p><p id="P7">Here, we describe our bespoke upright 3D-SIM prototype microscope system with integrated AO, enabling deep imaging in live wholemount biological specimens with access to manipulating the specimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The system is based around a 60x/1.1 NA water-dipping objective for which we demonstrate high-quality 3D-SIM with nearly two-fold spatial resolution extension in three dimensions at depths from a few μm up to 130 μm deep. We use AO not only for sample-induced aberration correction in deep tissue imaging but also for remote focusing, which enables fast transitions of the imaging plane and prevents pressure waves caused by the motion along the optical axis of the specimen or the objective lens. Our novel approach and instrument design enables simultaneous multichannel imaging in conventional and super-resolution modes, with acquisitions of fast Z-stacks and timelapse, deep in live specimens while keeping them accessible to experimental manipulation. The modular design and user-friendly open-source Python software of Deep3DSIM (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4">Methods and Materials</xref>) allow for convenient sample navigation and a simple workflow for routine biological experiments. We first verify the system performance using beads and cells in culture. We then apply the full range of novel imaging modalities available on Deep3DSIM to a wide range of specimen types, from mammalian tissue culture cells to <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brains and embryos. Finally, although our use of AO for aberration correction and remote focusing is demonstrated on an upright microscope with water-dipping objectives, the principles we have established could be applied equally to an inverted 3D-SIM system to extend the depth of imaging considerably and to allow more rapid acquisition of 3D stacks without the need to move the specimen or the objective.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P8">To initially assess the baseline performance of Deep3DSIM in applications where there are minimal aberrations, we imaged 100 nm diameter green-fluorescent beads. We used 3D images of beads to estimate the PSF in all imaging modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). We first compared the performance in widefield in two configurations – standard microscope optics without AO correction by using a DM-bypass (BP) optical path (labelled as BP WF) and then with AO correction for system aberrations (labelled as AO WF). We expected minimal aberrations to affect images of beads mounted under a coverslip following careful adjustment of the collar of the objective designed for correcting spherical aberration. Correspondingly, we found that in the widefield (WF) mode, using AO to correct system aberrations led to a small improvement in the overall shape of the PSF compared with the standard WF using BP. This improvement was evident when measuring the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the PSF in the X and Z direction, which changed from 286 nm and 970 nm, respectively, in BP WF to 281 nm and 901 nm in AO WF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Next, we acquired equivalent results using the DM to change the microscope’s plane of focus, which we refer to as remote focusing (RF) and compared these measurements to those from conventional acquisition of a z-stack with a piezo Z stage. Widefield RF imaging results in PSFs with an FWHM resolution that is very close to that using AO system correction or DM-bypass, namely 282 nm and 848 nm respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref> as RF WF). When acquiring images of the same beads using 3D-SIM with AO (AO SIM), we measured an FWHM of 176 nm laterally and 566 nm axially, equivalent to an ~5-fold volumetric resolution improvement over uncorrected BP WF. It is worth noting that the resolution improvement is close to but not quite reaching the expected half of the calculated widefield diffraction limit in each axis, that is, 281 nm (in XY) and 851 nm (in Z) for the 1.1 NA of the water-dipping objective used. One reason for this is that we opted for a conservative linewidth of the structured illumination pattern to be 310 nm, which is larger than the theoretical optimal value of 285 nm to prevent accidental clipping on the DM (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref> for details).</p><p id="P9">3D-SIM, like other super-resolution methods, is sensitive to low levels of system and specimen-induced aberrations, even at a depth typical of single cells in culture. Such minor aberrations tend to be insignificant in conventional microscopy modalities such as widefield and confocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Wang and Zhang, 2021</xref>). Therefore, we first verified the degree of resolution enhancement by 3D-SIM in mammalian tissue culture COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, left) with microtubules immunofluorescently labelled using Alexa Fluor (AF) 488 conjugated antibodies and, in another example, endoplasmic reticulum labelled with antibodies against Rtn4 and conjugated to AF555 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, right). Compared to the corresponding widefield images, the optical sectioning capability of 3D-SIM is easily noticeable by the large difference in out-of-focus signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, especially in the XZ cross-section view displayed below the XY views. The resolution enhancement can also be confirmed in the Fourier space as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, where the widefield power spectrum is mostly concentrated in the central area, the SIM data presents a much more even distribution across the frequency space, extended to the high-frequency region beyond 200 nm. Because of the high spatial information carried by the microtubule structures, a radial integration of the 2D power spectrum provides a close estimation of the system OTF where lateral resolution can be measured; they were measured by the position of the inflection point (arrowheads) to be 330 nm and 187 nm, respectively for widefield and SIM modes, close to the FWHM values measured from beads data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>. The performance of the system in the red channel is similar except for a slight reduction of frequency range due to the longer wavelength. Here, the resolutions measured from the Fourier power plots in widefield mode and 3D-SIM mode are 403 nm and 208 nm, respectively.</p><p id="P10">A significant benefit and uniqueness of the Deep3DSIM design is its upright configuration, whereas commercial SIM systems are built around inverted microscopes and are usually restricted to imaging thin samples, such as cultured cells. The Deep3DSIM system is therefore applicable to tissue-based imaging and live experiments such as electrophysiology. We evaluated the applicability of these unique capabilities of the instrument to thick biological specimens that have a substantial degree of RI inhomogeneity, leading to optical aberrations. We used AO SIM to image the thick and complex tissues of fixed <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) preparation. We imaged larvae from a transgenic line expressing a bright GFP protein trap of the cell-cell “septate” junction protein Neurexin IV (Nrx-IV), at a depth of 5-15 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The images of the AO-corrected volume showed significant improvements in both intensity and contrast after reconstruction, compared with images of the uncorrected volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The improvement was especially noticeable between the XZ views in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>, as the major effect of aberrations is to distort the PSF along the optical axis. This is particularly the case for the dominant spherical aberration, which elongates the focus along the optical axis but is also an effect of other aberration modes, such as coma, which typically lead to a bending of the PSF in cross-section view.</p><p id="P11">To further test the microscope’s performance at greater depth, we imaged dissected and subsequently formaldehyde-fixed whole <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brains. We imaged both the top and bottom layers of the thickest part of the brain lobes, mounted between a standard microscope coverslip (#1.5) and a slide, providing a total imaging depth of up to ~130 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). To help visualise the effects of aberrations and evaluate the ability of AO to correct them at depth, we placed 100 nm diameter red fluorescent beads (580/605 nm) on the glass slide underneath the tissue. We imaged two 4-5 μm thick image stacks centred around two sites – one ~3 μm and another ~130 μm away from the cover slip – which required focusing through the entire volume of the mounted brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). We found that AO aberration correction made a small but noticeable improvement to the contrast on the proximal side of the brain lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). On the distal side, control images bypassing the AO suffered from severe aberration-induced reconstruction artifacts, with the cell membranes not being observable as continuous structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, left). In contrast, imaging at the same depth with AO correction enabled 3D-SIM reconstructions to produce clearer 3D images with reduced artefacts and enhanced contrast. Large areas of the cell membranes could be visualised showing the expected overall structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, right). The effect of aberrations and their correction is impressively clear in the red channel, where the signal of individual beads closely mimics the shape of the system PSF while the equivalent image without AO presents large, unrecognizable pseudo-structures. The aberration correction method employed here effectively estimated a correction averaged across the entire FOV of 68 × 68 μm at 130 μm depth. It is worth noting that aberrations can differ across larger fields, and therefore, after applying an average correction, residual aberrations can still be observed in some regions of the AO-corrected bead images. However, the overall PSF shapes were still dramatically improved with AO compared to the equivalent without AO. Finally, the peak intensity and SNR with AO are significantly higher than the results without AO, as shown in the example intensity profile plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>.</p><p id="P12">Biological samples, even adherent cells in culture, can be thick enough to induce substantial aberrations which vary considerably throughout the volume of a specimen. Therefore, effective correction needs to be modified at different depth levels, while acquiring extended image stacks. As the Deep3DSIM system is capable of rapidly changing the focal position through remote focusing, we demonstrated combined remote focusing with AO aberration correction on cells in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). In principle, it would be possible to perform aberration measurements at every imaging plane within the volume. However, such an approach requires a disproportionate measurement time before each acquisition, which might lead to unnecessary photobleaching and phototoxicity. As we found that the aberrations change approximately linearly in depth, we could measure the aberration in two planes and calculate the corrections in intermediate planes by interpolation, an approach which we termed “multi-position AO”. To test multi-position AO, we imaged fixed COS-7 cells in culture stained for microtubules, to visualise the spindles during mitosis. We measured the aberrations at the top and the bottom of the cells, and then applied an interpolated correction at different Z positions between the two measured planes. Our results show conclusively that remote focusing with aberration correction produced images with improved contrast and resolution compared to remote focusing without aberration correction. The improvements provided by interpolated aberration corrections were particularly noticeable in point-like structures in the specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, right). In contrast, such points result in elongated structures when imaged without aberration correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, left). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref> displays the image intensity of two line profiles in X and Z directions without and with multi-position AO for comparison, demonstrating increased signal intensity with AO correction, in addition to the resolution improvement. In the case of the X profile plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, top), although two peaks can be separated without AO, indicated by the red arrows, the distance is enlarged compared to that in the image with AO due to the aberration-induced distortion of the sample structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, insets).</p><p id="P13">One of the challenges of 3D-SIM has been its limited ability to carry out live cell imaging rapidly and in thick specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). Living specimens are particularly challenging for two reasons. First, the structures can change within the time it takes to acquire a 3D volume. Second, imaging through living material causes more pronounced aberrations compared with fixed material, in which the RI is increased and made more homogenous by introducing a mounting medium with high RI, such as glycerol. The Deep3DSIM approach has the potential to resolve both these challenges. Aberration correction can, in principle, be used to correct more severe aberrations. In addition, using our interpolation approach to calculate the shape of the mirror required for correction of aberrations, as opposed to simply measuring the shape, is much quicker, enabling faster SIM to match dynamic biology.</p><p id="P14">To test the feasibility of 3D-SIM for dynamic live biological imaging, we imaged <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos undergoing rapid mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). We collected eggs from transgenic animals expressing the microtubule-binding protein Jupiter fused to GFP and the histone H2A proteins fused to RFP. The Jupiter::GFP, H2A::RFP eggs were dechorionated and mounted in aqueous solution in order to image chromosomes and microtubules simultaneously, during mitotic division in the syncytial blastoderm stages of early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. We used remote focusing to repeatedly acquire two-colour image volumes at a depth of 5 μm under the surface at a rate of 20 fps, equivalent to 10 s per 3D volume at room temperature for several minutes. Each image stack of 7 z-sections required 210 raw images (5 phases x 3 angles x 2 λ) for 3D-SIM reconstruction. Using AO-based aberration correction with interpolation, combined with remote focusing, we were able to obtain an effective time sequence of 3D-SIM stacks with reduced residual aberrations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref> displays lateral mid-sections of five selected time points within the first two minutes of the time series, showing the synchronous transition from metaphase to telophase. Five different Z positions from one selected timepoint are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>. These results demonstrate that the remote focusing functionality of the system can be successfully applied for live 3D-SIM experiments, allowing four-dimensional acquisition while keeping the specimen stationary, thus avoiding the usual agitation and perturbations associated with mechanical actuation.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">We have demonstrated that the design of Deep3DSIM, a prototype upright super-resolution microscope with integrated AO, enables effective 3D super-resolution imaging within thick complex tissues to a depth of at least 130 μm. Its modular design and Python-based open-source software for both system control and GUI (see details in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4">Methods and Materials</xref>), make it comparatively user-friendly and versatile. These design concepts allow the adaptation of the instrument to suit specific research applications and enable protocols for experiments at scale. The upright optical design combined with aberration correction and remote focusing renders the instrument particularly suited for applications that require super-resolution volumetric imaging of live (or fixed) thick tissue, organs, or whole organisms. Importantly, the design is compatible with specimen manipulation, such as microinjection, carrying out electrophysiology measurements, or adding reagents to specimens during imaging experiments. In this study, we have established a new paradigm for 3D-SIM to be applied at depth while acquiring volumes without moving the specimen or the objective and while varying the aberration corrections across the acquired volume, in a depth-specific manner. This general principle can now be applied to any SIM configuration, including an inverted one, which can make use of the highest possible NA objectives to obtain volumetric SIM datasets at depth with minimal artifacts and maximum possible spatial resolution.</p><p id="P16">Current commercially available 3D-SIM instruments are mostly based around inverted setups and high NA oil immersion objectives that are susceptible to aberrations when focusing into any specimens with RI mismatch, therefore frequently only producing good images up to depths of a few μm. When such instruments are used with silicon immersion objectives, with slightly reduced NA, high-quality SIM can be extended to a depth of around 20 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Ogushi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Richter et al., 2019</xref>). In all cases, objective correction collars can only effectively minimise spherical aberrations for SIM imaging in a single channel. For multi-colour imaging, the RI of the mounting medium and the immersion medium (or the objective’s correction collar setting) have to be carefully fine-tuned to match to the recorded wavelength-specific OTFs and to find a suitable compromise to accommodate multiple colours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Demmerle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, for most practical purposes, these microscopes can only effectively be applied to thin single layers of tissue culture cells on microscope slides or only to the superficial surface of complex tissues that are relatively optically transparent. Furthermore, they are not readily adapted to imaging regimes which require the specimen and the objective to remain motionless while imaging. Hence, Deep3DSIM fills an important application gap for deep imaging in live multi-cellular tissue. The method creates new possibilities for future biological investigations, such as super-resolution imaging in live specimens or whole animals, imaging fast live 3D time-lapse movies while carrying out specimen manipulations, for example micro-injection into <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, or carrying out electrophysiology measurements on living mouse brain sections or <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ preparations while imaging.</p><p id="P17">The range of remote focusing shown in this work was limited to ±5 μm, which is smaller than some previous demonstrations. There were two reasons for the choice of this range. First, the deformable mirror can only reliably produce PSFs with minimal aberration repeatedly in this range (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref>). Second, for 3D-SIM acquisition, 10 μm is a commonly used Z range. Especially in multi-color imaging, a rather large number of images, about 1200 frames per channel, would be required. While larger volume acquisition is possible, it would lead to considerable photobleaching and phototoxicity, as well as longer acquisition and reconstruction times. Moreover, there is a trade-off between the number of volumes that can be acquired (number of time points) and the number of Z-sections within the volume.</p><p id="P18">The resolution achieved with Deep3DSIM was 176 nm FWHM at 488 nm using a water-dipping objective with an NA of 1.1. In comparison, inverted commercial 3D-SIM instruments routinely achieve 100-120 nm resolution at 488 nm using a high-NA oil immersion objective. While the Deep3DSIM resolution is therefore lower in absolute terms, this was a design trade-off chosen to make the microscope compatible with live imaging in an upright configuration and with a large working distance. Hence, it is more pertinent to compare the resolution of Deep3DSIM to that achievable for live cell imaging in widefield microscopy, using the same NA water-dipping objective, which is 286 nm in the green channel and 336 nm in the red channel. However, the fundamental design of the Deep3DSIM microscope could be readily adapted, if necessary, to work in upright or inverted mode with other objective lenses, including oil or silicone immersion objectives to achieve higher spatial resolution, while still benefitting from the use of AO for motionless deep imaging. In these cases, the working distance would be compromised, making it much more difficult to manipulate the sample, for example by microinjection or with electrophysiology tools. Nevertheless, the implementation of AO hardware and software described in this report is suitable for most widefield-based instruments, including SIM that would benefit from the incorporation of a DM if it can easily be added to the optical path. Although the design of Deep3DSIM was mostly optimised for upright microscopy with tissue specimens, it can also benefit other types of microscopy and applications. Notably, CryoSIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Kounatidis et al., 2020</xref>) would hugely benefit from the inclusion of AO to correct for spherical aberrations induced by increased RI mismatch at cryogenic temperatures together with sampled-induced aberration, particularly with non-flat overlying ice at the specimen-air interface.</p><p id="P19">There are various routes through which the system performance could be enhanced in future versions of Deep3DSIM. First, the speed of acquisition in the reported demonstration was limited by a few key system components, which could be improved in future developments. A key limiting factor in widefield mode was the EM-CCD camera. The best overall performance in terms of structured illumination modulation was achieved when using conventional CCD modes. However, due to the data transfer time (3 MHz pixel readout rate), the frame rate was limited to about 100 fps for a reasonable size field of view. This acquisition speed could be increased by using newer sCMOS cameras. In addition, in SIM experiments the imaging speed was also limited by the update rate of the spatial light modulator (SLM), determined by the settling time of the nematic liquid crystal technology (around 20-40 ms), giving a maximum frame rate of 50 fps raw data. Fast SLMs using ferroelectric liquid crystal materials have been demonstrated in SIM for high-speed SIM imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Lin et al., 2021</xref>), though it is more challenging to use such SLMs for multi-colour imaging, as the phase modulation is binary and hence optimised for a single wavelength. Third, future improvements could also include the incorporation of denoising algorithms into the reconstruction process to allow lower light dosage, which would enable faster imaging, reduced photobleaching, and reduced specimen photodamage. Combinations of such hardware and software improvements would enhance acquisition speed for realistic experimental situations, imaging live biological processes in super-resolution at high volumetric and temporal rates. Finally, in the future, the optical path of Deep3DSIM could be simplified and reduced in size, thus making it easier to adopt or commercialise, as well as building specific Deep3DSIM systems designed for bespoke applications.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="methods | materials"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="S5"><title>Microscope platform</title><p id="P20">We based the Deep3DSIM system on our previous bespoke Cryo-SIM setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Phillips et al., 2020</xref>). The microscope body is built in an upright configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and is designed around a water-dipping objective lens (Olympus LUMFLN60XW), which was selected for imaging of tissues, particularly for <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, NMJ, and electrophysiological experiments. With the goal of flexibility and ease of use, especially to assist with fast and accurate sample navigation, we also included a low-magnification dry lens (Olympus LMPLFLN10X). The objective lenses were mounted at fixed positions, and the sample was translated in 3D by a set of X, Y, and Z stages. Images from the two objective lenses were mapped in 3D so that the same sites could be revisited with minimal error by both objective lenses. The XY translation was handled by a large-opening motorised stage (PI M-687.UN) and the Z translation was handled by a combination of a heavy-duty linear stage (Aerotech PRO115) and piezo stage (PI P-736.ZCN) for accurate and fast motion during experiments. The microscope body was connected optically to the rest of the system with a periscope. More details about the optical setup can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Structured illumination</title><p id="P21">To implement 3D SIM, we adopted mid-speed analogue SLM (Boulder Nonlinear Systems, HSP512-488-800) to produce structured illumination. The SLM was positioned in the sample-conjugated plane and linear sinusoidal patterns were generated for three orientation angles. The ±1<sup>st</sup> order and zero-order beams were used to interfere at the sample plane to generate the 3D structured illumination. To achieve optimal interference contrast, the linear polarisation of the excitation beam from the SLM was rotated using a liquid crystal device (Meadowlarks Optics, LPR-100-λ) to maintain S polarisation at the incident plane at the back pupil of the objective lens for each SI orientation. For widefield acquisitions, the SLM was switched off and used as a single reflector so that only the zero-order beam provided epi-illumination; while for SIM acquisition, the SLM was switched on and it was preloaded with the SI patterns that were generated according to the wavelength and the line width specified by the user in the software before acquisition. During image acquisition, the SI phase and angle were rotated in a fixed sequence, synchronised with the polarisation rotators, the light sources, and the cameras.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Deformable mirror</title><p id="P22">Sensorless AO was chosen for the correction of aberration, as it is simple and effective to implement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Žurauskas et al., 2019</xref>). A deformable mirror (Alpao DM69-15) was positioned at the back-pupil conjugated plane, between the main dichroic filter and the microscope body, so that the DM was used for correcting both the excitation and emission paths. The DM aperture was matched to cover the back-pupil of the objective lens by relay. An integrated interferometer was used to calibrate the DM for both aberration correction and remote focusing (optical path illustrated in yellow dotted line in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). A pair of flip mirrors were included to create an optical path that bypassed the DM (referred to as the “DM-bypass” path), to permit easy comparison between conventional imaging and that with AO aberration correction.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Software</title><p id="P23">The system control software package was composed of three parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>): <italic>python-microscope</italic> for low-level hardware control of the entire optomechanical system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Susano Pinto et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>microscope-cockpit</italic> for a user interface and experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>), and <italic>microscope-aotools</italic> for performing DM calibration and AO aberration correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hall et al., 2020</xref>). All three were further developed and improved, and links to the latest repositories can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref>. For SIM data reconstruction, we used a commercial package softWoRx (GE Healthcare). OTFs required for reconstruction for each imaging channel were generated from experimental data acquired from a single fluorescent bead. Multi-colour image alignments were performed in the open-source software Chromagnon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Matsuda et al., 2018</xref>).

The DM was calibrated to generate control metrics that delivered accurate wavefronts in Zernike modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Antonello et al., 2020</xref>). An integrated interferometer was built into the optical path that could be folded into the microscope when required. A quality control based on Zernike modes was implemented in <italic>microscope-aotools</italic> and regularly used to verify the accuracy of the DM. A Fourier domain image metric was used for optimizing each Zernike mode, for specimens with structures of sufficiently high spatial frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hall, 2020</xref>). When the spatial frequencies were not high enough, ISOsense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Žurauskas et al., 2019</xref>) was adopted to achieve a more robust AO correction.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Multi-position aberration correction</title><p id="P25">We used multi-position aberration correction to compensate for the optical distortions in thick volumes. We applied our standard sensorless AO routine at fixed positions, e.g. at the top and the bottom of the volume, and then we fitted the resulting correction Zernike coefficients to a line, assuming the RI changed in a linear manner with Z within the chosen volume. This simplification allowed us to calculate in advance the corrections required at every section of the volume. All patterns necessary for an experiment were registered to Z location and queued on the DM device. TTL triggers were then used in real-time to cycle through the patterns, while updating imaging position either with the piezo Z stage or with the DM-driven remote focusing.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Remote focusing</title><p id="P26">Remote focusing is highly desired in neuronal imaging and other experiments, such as electrophysiology, where it is required that the sample remains stationary during acquisitions. AO can be used to replace piezo Z stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Žurauskas et al., 2017</xref>). We controlled the remote focusing and the aberration correction independently, each one with its own set of corrections, which were then summed together if both functionalities were to be used simultaneously. To calculate the required remote focusing corrections, we first performed a calibration experiment where we used a sample with a single layer of fluorescent beads. The sample was displaced by the piezo Z stage first in one direction and then by the same amount in the opposite direction. Sensorless AO correction was used at both positions to correct for Zernike modes, which included defocus (Z4) and spherical aberrations (Z11, Z22, etc). We then performed a linear fit of the corrections and their corresponding Z positions, and we used this model as a look-up table to calculate the remote focusing pattern for all Z positions. This approach achieved a linear response with high precision on the Alpao DM69-15, within a range of 10 μm, but the accuracy was found lacking. This is not surprising to us, as this DM is known to have a creep effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bitenc et al., 2014</xref>). The dynamic characteristics of the device are discussed in more detail in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref>. We found that in practice the response can vary by a scaling factor related to the speed with which the DM shape was varied. To determine this scaling factor, we established a second calibration step where the piezo Z stage was used as a reference to displace the sample of beads in Z and provide ground-truth values. While performing the scale calibration, we matched the displacements by the remote focusing that is interpolated from the linear fitting with the displacement by the piezo stage, taking measurements of multiple points along the Z range. We then performed a linear fitting of both the remote focusing and the piezo stage Z points, and we related the two slopes to derive the scaling factor. Similarly to multi-position AO correction, all remote focusing patterns were computed in advance before image acquisition. They were then added to the aberration correction patterns and the results were queued on the DM driver. During image acquisition, TTL triggers were used to cycle through all queued patterns and to synchronise with the rest of the hardware.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P27">COS-7 (ATTC) cells were grown on #1.5 glass coverslips in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), washed twice with 2 ml of 100 mM sodium phosphate and fixed for 2 h in 2 ml PLP (2% [wt/vol] paraformaldehyde in 87.5 mM lysine, 87.5 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 and 10 mM sodium periodate).

the Deep3DSIM setup.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> The optical arrangement shows the upright configuration of Deep3DSIM allowing the use of micromanipulators for applications such as microinjection and electrophysiology. The excitation light is incident on a spatial light modulator (SLM), which is conjugated to the object/image plane, and then reflected off a deformable mirror (DM) before being focused on the sample with an objective lens. In the imaging path, the reflected fluorescence is coupled off via a dichroic beam splitter and then collected by separate cameras for each channel. <bold>(B)</bold> Different imaging modes are enabled in parallel on Deep3DSIM. Deep imaging without AO usually leads to an aberrated PSF due to RI mismatch and sample inhomogeneity. Sensorless AO correction compensates for sample-induced aberrations. Remote focusing (RF) enables fast focusing at various depths without moving the specimen/objective. Coupling AO and RF produces aberration-corrected imaging at different depths, without mechanical movement. <bold>(C)</bold> Deep3DSIM is controlled by Cockpit, which consists of 3 packages: python-microscope is responsible for the control of all hardware devices; microscope-cockpit provides a user-friendly GUI; microscope-aotools provides the AO functionality. The system uses a real-time controller, in this case, the Red Pitaya STEMlab 125-14, to coordinate different instruments for image acquisition with structured or widefield illumination.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS193091-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Characterization of the Deep3DSIM system.</title><p>Lateral <bold>(A)</bold> and axial (<bold>B</bold>) PSF for the different modalities of the instrument measured from 100 nm green-fluorescent beads.
