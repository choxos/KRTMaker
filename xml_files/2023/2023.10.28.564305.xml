State of the art, human <italic>in vitro</italic> models are enabling the study of the dopaminergic neurons’ loss, but not the dysregulation of the dopaminergic network in the nigrostriatal pathway. Additionally, these models do not incorporate aging characteristics which potentially contribute to the development of PD. Therefore, it is conceivable that research conducted using these models overlooked numerous processes that contribute to disease’s phenotypes. Here we present a nigrostriatal pathway model based on midbrain-striatum assembloids with inducible aging. We show that these assembloids are capable of developing characteristics of the nigrostriatal connectivity, with catecholamine release from the midbrain to striatum and synapse formation between midbrain and striatal neurons. Moreover, Progerin-overexpressing assembloids acquire aging traits that lead to early phenotypes of PD. This new model shall help to reveal the contribution of aging as well as nigrostriatal connectivity to the onset and progression of PD.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The nigrostriatal pathway connectivity is established through projections of the midbrain SNpc dopaminergic neurons to the dorsal striatum. Disruption of the nigrostriatal connectivity contributes to the development of PD symptoms, such as motor dysfunction, tremor, muscle stiffness, and bradykinesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Caminiti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Ghosh et al., 2019</xref>). The gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons leads to dopamine depletion in the striatum, with consequences in the synaptic network organization and cellular complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">Zhai et al., 2018</xref>). Before the onset of neuronal loss there is significant decrease of dopaminergic axons in the striatum. This reduction in dopaminergic axons is twice as pronounced in the striatum compared to the decrease in dopaminergic neuronal cells in the SNpc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Chung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Heng et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">L. H. Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Tagliaferro &amp; Burke, 2016</xref>). However, due to the research focus on the loss of neurons, which is the ultimate endpoint of the disease, the mechanisms of the retrograde dopaminergic axons’ degeneration from the striatum are still not understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Tagliaferro &amp; Burke, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Animal models of PD have been used to elucidate cellular and molecular dysfunctions, but they cannot fully recapitulate the impairments that occur in the human nigrostriatal connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Potashkin et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, human based cellular models such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived 2D neuronal cell culture and the more advanced 3D midbrain organoids have been extensively used for PD modelling. Midbrain organoids have the advantage of better recapitulating the neuronal connectivity in a 3D environment with active neuronal electrophysiology and self-organization properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">J. Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Monzel et al., 2017</xref>). Midbrain organoids derived from PD patient cell lines exhibit phenotypes relevant to the disease and they present a great tool for further understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Becerra-Calixto et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Jarazo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Jo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">H.

Although these models are useful for studying the dopaminergic neurons’ vulnerability in PD, they do not recapitulate the nigrostriatal pathway connectivity dysfunction which is essential for unveiling the sources of PD onset and progression.</p><p id="P4">More advanced 3D models with the combination of two or more region specific brain organoids have started to pave the way towards cellular models with higher complexity that can effectively reflect the neuronal connectivity between different brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Makrygianni &amp; Chrousos, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Panoutsopoulos, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Paşca, 2018</xref>). For instance, recent studies have shown the generation of pallium-subpallium, cortico-motor and cortico-striatal assembloids from human iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Birey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Miura et al., 2020</xref>), and their capability to develop physiological functional networks that could provide essential insights in diseases’ development and progression.</p><p id="P5">Here we present the development of a midbrain-striatum assembloid model that can recapitulate the nigrostriatal pathway connectivity, with catecholamines release from the midbrain to striatum and the formation of active synapses between the midbrain dopaminergic neurons and the striatal neurons. Although the midbrain-striatum assembloid model allows us to study aspects of the human nigrostriatal connectivity <italic>in vitro,</italic> it still lacks one major risk factor of PD, which is aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Collier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Hindle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Lapasset et al., 2011</xref>). To address whether aging induction could lead to neurodegenerative phenotypes in assembloids, we used a genetically engineered iPSC line that carries a Progerin-GFP transgene under the control of the Tet-On system for the controllable overexpression of Progerin in the presence of doxycycline (Gabassi et al., <italic>In Preparation</italic>). Our results show that Progerin-overexpression can induce aging phenotypes in the midbrain-striatum assembloid model which subsequently leads to the development of PD-associated early neurodegeneration phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>iPSCs and NESCs</title><p id="P6">The induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that were used in this study are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.

After the 24 hours, the cells were cultured in Essential 8 Basal Medium, with daily media changes. Confluent iPSCs (~70-90%) were splitted using UltraPure™ 0.5M EDTA, pH 8.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15575020). Immunofluorescence staining was performed to confirm the pluripotent identity of the iPSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 1.A-D</xref>). Neuroepithelial stem cells (NESCs) were generated from iPSCs using a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Reinhardt et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to the iPSCs, the NESCs were cultured in Geltrex-coated 6-well plates using supplemented N2B27 media, as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Monzel et al., 2017</xref>). The NESCs were passaged using Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich, A6964) and their neural stem cell identity was confirmed with immunofluorescence staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 1.E-G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Striatum Organoids</title><p id="P7">Striatum organoids (StrOs) were generated using an adapted protocol (C4) from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Miura et al., 2020</xref>) (C3) after comparing it with two other conditions (RA and SR) in two time points of culture (day (D)35 and D50) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). iPSCs at ~70% confluency were used for the StrOs generation. Before the procedure of spheroids formation, the cells were treated overnight with 1% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, D2650) in Essential 8 basal medium. For the spheroids formation (D -1), the iPSCs were first incubated into Accutase at 37 °C for 5 min. The accutase was stopped using 5x DMEM-F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21331-046). The cells were then resuspended in Essential 8 medium containing 20 μM Ri and counted using the Countless cell counting chambers slides (Invitrogen, C10313). For condition C4, 10000 cells were added per well in the BIOFLOAT™ 96-well plate U-bottom (faCellitate, F202003), centrifuged in 100g for 3 min and then incubated in the normal culture conditions of 37°C with 5% CO2. The spheroids were left intact for two days to form properly and at D1 the medium was exchanged with Essential 6 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1516401) supplemented with 10 μM Ri, 2.5 μM Dorsomorphin (Sigma-Aldrich, P5499) and 10 μM SB-431542 (Abcam, ab120163). The spheroids were cultured in the same medium until D5, with a reduction of the Ri concentration at 10 μM at D2, 5 μM at D3 until completely removed at D4. To start the differentiation process of the spheroids into StrOs, on D6 the medium was exchanged with a medium containing Neurobasal-A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10888022), 2% B-27 without vitamin A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12587010), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Invitrogen, 15140122), 1% GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35050061) and supplemented with 2.5 μM IWP-2 (Selleckchem, S7085) and 50 ng/ml Activin A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PHC9561). From D9 to 17, the media was additionally supplemented with 100 nM SR11237 (Tocris, 3411). Until D17 the medium was exchanged daily.

For condition C3, the same protocol as described in Miura and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Miura et al., 2020</xref>) was followed, without the addition of cis-4,7,10,13,16,1 9-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at D22 of differentiation.</p><p id="P8">For the generation of StrOs from the RA and SR conditions, iPSCs at ~70% confluency were collected using accutase as described above, and 9000 cells were plated in each well of the BIOFLOAT™ 96-well plate U-bottom (D -2). The media used for plating was containing 80% DMEM F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21331046), 20% KOSR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10828028), 3% FBS (Invitrogen, 16140071), 1% GlutaMAX, 1% NEAA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11140-050) and 0.7% 2-Mercaptoethanol 50 mM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 31350-010). This media was supplemented with 10 μM Ri and 40 ng/ml FGF-basic (PeproTech, 100-18B). After two days (D0 of culture) the media was exchanged with the Neural induction medium (NIM) containing 76.8% DMEM F12, 20% KOSR, 1% NEAA, 1% GlutaMAX, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 0.2% 2-Mercaptoethanol 50 mM. From D0 to 2 the NIM was supplemented with 5 μM DM, 10 μM SB and 10 μM Ri, while on D2 Ri was removed. From D2 to D16 the medium was exchanged daily. On D4 and 5 the medium was additionally supplemented with 5 μM IWP-2. On D6, NIM was exchanged to the neural differentiation medium (NM) which contained 96% Neurobasal A medium, 2% B-27 without vitamin A, 1% GlutaMAX and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. From D6 to 8, NM was supplemented with 20 ng/ml FGF-basic, 20 ng/ml EGF (PeproTech, AF-100-15) and 5 μM IWP-2. From D8 to 16, NM was supplemented with 20 ng/ml FGF-basic, 20 ng/ml EGF, 5 μM IWP-2, 50 nM SAG (Merck Millipore, 566660), 50 ng/ml Activin A and 1 mM for condition RA or 100 nM SR11237 for condition SR. On D17 the media was exchanged with a non-supplemented NM.

At D0, 9000 NESCs were added per well in the BIOFLOAT™ 96-well plate U-bottom and cultured in maintenance medium for 2 days. At D3 the medium was exchanged with the differentiation medium containing 1 μM purmorphamine and at D8 with the final differentiation medium without purmorphamine.

Due to the different media composition of the organoids, an optimization of the co-culture medium was needed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 4, Supplementary Figure 5, Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Four different media were tested. The Neural Medium (NM) was comprised of Neurobasal-A, 2% B-27 without vitamin A, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 1% GlutaMAX, while the Neural Medium Plus (NMpl) was supplemented with B-27 plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A3582801) instead of the B-27 without Vitamin A. In the third condition, the Neural Medium++ (NM++) was tested, which was the NM medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml BDNF (PeproTech, 450-02), 10 ng/ml GDNF (PeproTech, 450-10), 20 ng/ml NT-3 (Alomone labs, N-260), 200 μM AA (Sigma-Aldrich, A4544) and 100 μM cAMP (Biosynth, ND07996). The optimal assembloid co-culture condition for the assembloid model was consisted of the N2B27 medium (described by Monzel and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Monzel et al., 2017</xref>)), which consists of DMEM F12 (Invitrogen)/Neurobasal (Invitrogen) 50:50 with 0.5% N2 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17502001), 1% B-27 without Vitamin A, 1 % GlutaMAX and 1 % Penicillin/Streptomycin.

At D0 of the assembloids generation, each StrO was transferred in each well of the 96-well plate U-bottom that contained the MOs and the medium was exchanged to the assembloid co-culture medium. After 4 days, the two organoids were merged into an assembloid, and they were transferred in 24 well ultra-low attachment plates (Celltreat, 229524). Some of the assembloids were embedded in 30 μl Geltrex (Invitrogen, A1413302), as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Monzel et al., 2017</xref>).

Laminin coating was removed, and the plates were washed twice with sterile PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 14190250). Each assembloid was placed in the center of the well on the electrodes and after the media was carefully aspirated, it was left for 2-3 min to dry. Then, 15 μl of Geltrex was added on top of each assembloid and was left in the incubator for 5 min to polymerise. 500 μl of fresh culture medium was added in each well and the plate was kept in the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) under static conditions. Electrophysiological data were acquired with the Axion Maestro Multiwell 768-channel MEA System (Axion Biosystems) and the Axis software (Axon Biosystems, RRID:SCR_016308).

To recapitulate this pathway <italic>in vitro,</italic> we generated a 3D <italic>in vitro</italic> model of midbrain and striatum organoids. MOs were generated based on our previously published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Monzel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Nickels et al., 2020</xref>). For the generation of StrO different culture conditions were tested (RA, SR and C4) and compared to the recently published protocol (named C3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Miura et al., 2020</xref>) with minor changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). The purpose of this optimisation on the StrOs protocol generation was to reduce the lengthy culture time of 50-80 days to 35-50 days while preserving the mature population of medium spiny neurons (MSNs). For the conditions RA, SR and C4 organoids were cultured for 35 and 50 days, while for the C3 organoids were cultured until D50 (the earliest time point described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Miura et al., 2020</xref>)). In C4, the differentiation conditions are similar to C3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Miura et al., 2020</xref>), but in the maturation phase (D17 to D35), DHA was excluded as it is susceptible to oxidation and to avoid the use of ethanol (the solvent for DHA) in the medium. The same medium was used until D50 without the addition of DAPT at D42 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 2.A</xref>). DHA was also excluded from the C3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 2.B</xref>). For conditions RA and SR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 2.C, D</xref>) the previously published protocol which described the generation of ventral forebrain, subpallium-like organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Sloan et al., 2018</xref>), was adapted to shift the differentiation towards the LGE region and eventually to the dorsal striatum. In both conditions, SAG was added as it is neuroprotective and very important for neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>), while activin A has been shown to assist the differentiation of striatal projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Arber et al., 2015</xref>). As was demonstrated by Miura and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Miura et al., 2020</xref>), SR11237 was used to stimulate the RXRG receptor (SR condition), which has high expression in the development of the striatum as shown in the human brain transcriptome (HBT) database. Similarly, we also wanted to test the effects of RA supplementation (RA condition) as data in the HBT database show that RARB is also highly expressed in the first days of striatum development.</p><p id="P58">Gene expression analysis with qPCR for genes specific for the telencephalon and the LGE were used to confirm the differentiation of the organoids towards the dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 3.A</xref>). Although the forebrain marker Forkhead box protein G1 (<italic>FOXG1</italic>) was evenly expressed in all conditions, there were some differences in the expression of LGE progenitor genes. Achaete-Scute Family BHLH Transcription Factor 1 (<italic>ASCL1</italic>) showed a tendency of higher expression in the RA and SR conditions in both time points, indicating a slower differentiation of cells with higher number of progenitors at D50 of culture. In C4 at D35, <italic>ASCL1</italic> had similar expression with RA and SR conditions, but at D50 the expression was lower and similar to C3. Genetic-Screened Homeobox 2 (<italic>GSX2</italic>) is an essential transcription factor in LGE progenitors, that assists their differentiation towards neurons and glia cells in the dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Roychoudhury et al., 2020</xref>). In the here investigated conditions we show that <italic>GSX2</italic> is mainly expressed in the C4 and C3 at D50. The Forkhead Box P1 (<italic>FOXP1</italic>) and Forkhead Box P2 (<italic>FOXP2</italic>) genes are both transcription factors that are highly expressed in the striatum and are important for the development of MSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Fong et al., 2018</xref>). The expression of <italic>FOXP1</italic> was similar in all conditions, but <italic>FOXP2</italic> had higher expression in C4 and C3 at D50, indicating a better differentiation of the neurons towards MSN fate. In addition COUP-TF-interacting protein 2 (<italic>CTIP2</italic>), another crucial transcription factor for the differentiation of MSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Arlotta et al., 2008</xref>), showed higher expression in the organoids of C4 and C3. Expression of <italic>NKX2.1</italic> and <italic>OTX2</italic> genes are important for the development of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Sandberg et al., 2018</xref>). The low expression of these genes in C3 and C4 further validates a LGE and dorsal striatum identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 3.B</xref>). The presence of mature MSNs in the organoids was evaluated by the expression of the MSN specific marker Dopamine and cAMP-Regulated Neuronal Phosphoprotein 32 (<italic>DARPP32</italic>) and the dopaminergic receptors 1 and 2 (<italic>DRD1</italic> and <italic>DRD2).</italic> We observed that C4 had noticeable higher expression of <italic>DARPP32,</italic> while the expression of <italic>DRD1</italic> and <italic>DRD2</italic> was similar between C3 and C4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 3.C</xref>). Similar patterns were observed in the protein levels, where DARPP32 abundance was similar at D50 for conditions C3 and C4, DRD1 was higher in C3 and C4 at D50 and there were no differences in the levels of DRD2 between all conditions. Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65-kilodalton isoform (GAD65), important enzyme for the synthesis of GABA, was higher in C3. Overall, these results indicate that C4 and C3 have similar differentiation capacity towards dorsal striatum identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 3.D-G</xref>). C4 seems to result in progenitor rich striatum organoids at D35 with differentiated characteristics at D50.</p><p id="P59">Since MOs and StrOs were differentiated independently for their identity specification, the generation of the assembloid model firstly required the optimisation of a suitable co-culture medium. Assembloids were generated between D20 of MOs derived from a GFP-expressing cell line and D35 or D50 of StrOs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 4.A</xref>), from the four StrO conditions described before (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Four different medium conditions were tested to ensure the optimal development and identity specificity of both organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 4.B</xref>). First, we evaluated the development of the dopaminergic neurons in GFP-expressing MOs cultured for up to 20 days by staining for TH and MAP2. MOs cultured in NM and NMpl media showed significant depletion of dopaminergic neurons, while the organoids in NM++ and N2B27++ medium did not show significant differences from the control condition (MOs standard media, see Midbrain organoids section in Methods) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 4.C</xref>). Then, the four different media were tested in assembloids cultured for 20 and 35 days to assess the impact on both dopaminergic neurons (TH staining) and MSNs (DARPP32 staining). Similar to the observations in MOs, assembloids cultured with NM++ and N2B27++ media, showed high levels of TH neurons in both time points of assembloid culture, specifically in C4 and C3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Since these two conditions were more suitable for the development of TH-positive neurons and the N2B27++ was slightly more favourable for the DARPP32 positive neurons in C4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>), we used N2B27++ as the optimal co-culture medium for the assembloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.A</xref>). Overall, based on these data, in order to reduce the time of cultures and achieve the desired differentiation capacity in assembloids, StrOs generated with the strategy C4 at D35 of differentiation were used for the generation of assembloids in the subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S45"><title>Midbrain and striatum specific identity in the assembloid model</title><p id="P60">Characterisation was performed on assembloids cultured for 30 days. Microscopy assessment with immunofluorescence staining showed that the midbrain and the striatum organoids retain their identity in the assembloid model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.B-F</xref>). Midbrain progenitors positive for FOXA2 and CORIN were identified only in the midbrain side of the assembloid, while striatal progenitors positive for ASCL1 and CTIP2 appear only in the striatum side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.B, C, D</xref>). Additionally, mature neurons of midbrain and striatal identity were observed with the positive immunofluorescence staining of TH and DARPP32, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.E, F</xref>). To validate that the assembloid model exhibits neuronal activity, electrophysiological measurement with MEA were performed on assembloids generated from two independent WT cell lines. Analysis of the MEA recordings showed that assembloids from both lines display similar electrophysiological activity with no differences in the number of spikes, the interspike interval and the burst frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.G</xref>).</p><p id="P61">To confirm the qualitative observations, we performed single nuclei RNA sequencing on pooled assembloids from two batches, generated from the WT 1 cell line (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and cultured for 30 days. From the same batches, we also sequenced MOs and StrOs that after D20 and D35 respectively (time points used for assembloid generation) were cultured independently for 30 more days in the same assembloid co-culture medium. Datasets from the three models were analysed separately following the standard Seurat workflow. For the assembloid model, eight different clusters were identified and visualised with UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.A</xref>). The identity of each cluster was defined based on the expression of cellular specific markers from gene lists identified by literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Bhaduri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kamath et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">La Manno et al., 2016</xref>) and the PanglaoDB database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Calculation of the percentage of each cellular identity in the assembloid model revealed the presence of 5% A10 dopaminergic neurons (DANs(A10)), 6% of GABAergic neurons, 7% progenitors of the LGE (LGE Prog), 14% of radial glia cells (RGCs), 15% of medium spiny GABAergic neurons (MSNs), 16% of non-defined progenitors (Progenitors), 17% of A9 dopaminergic neurons (DANs(A9)) and 21% young neurons (yNeurons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.B</xref>). Hierarchical clustering of the cellular populations based on their top 500 variable genes, demonstrated the similar transcriptomic identity of the dopaminergic neuronal clusters, followed by the other mature neuronal populations of MSNs and GABAergic neurons, while young neurons and progenitor cells cluster together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.C</xref>). The identity similarity between clusters is further demonstrated by the Spearman’s correlation matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.D</xref>). This illustrates the close correlation of the progenitor clusters (LGE Prog, RGCs and Progenitors) that weakly correlate with the more mature populations. Additionally, there is a weak correlation between the A9 and A10 DANs, indicating their distinct genetic signature. Although A10 DANs exhibit low correlation with all the clusters, their slightly better correlation with the RGCs and Progenitors clusters, suggests a more immature identity. On the other hand, A9 DANs correlate with the more mature clusters (GABAergic Neur and MSNs), while showing a weak correlation with the progenitor clusters. Finally, yNeuron cluster exhibits an unidentified young neuronal identity, correlating with Progenitors, DANs(A9) and GABAergic neurons, but with highest correlation to the MSN cluster.</p><p id="P62">The same analysis was performed for the MO and StrO datasets, with the presence of cell clusters more specific to the midbrain and striatum identity respectively. MOs are comprised of dopaminergic neuronal clusters (DANs and DANs2, 28% and 3% respectively) but also GABAergic neurons (33%), general neurons with no specific identity (Neurons, 14%), radial glia cells (RGCs, 20%) and a small proportion of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs, 1%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 8.A, B</xref>). Heatmap of the 500 most variable genes, shows the clustering of RGCs in the middle, giving rise to the DANs, GABAergic neurons and Neurons clusters, while DANs2 and OPCs cluster separately, showing a more specified identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 8.C</xref>). In Spearman’s correlation, DANs2 cluster shows a more mature identity with a very weak correlation to the progenitor RGCs cluster and a stronger correlation with the GABAergic Neur and Neurons clusters. On the other hand, DANs cluster shows a less mature identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 8.D</xref>).

Similarly here, hierarchical clustering of the 500 most variable genes shows the close association of the progenitor clusters, followed but the more mature populations of MSNs and GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 9.C</xref>). The maturity of the MSNs is further confirmed by the Spearman’s correlation matrix, with their weak correlation to LGE and Telencephalic progenitors, and their strong correlation to the GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 9.D</xref>).

A clear shift of cellular populations from the MOs and StrOs into the assembloid model is visible in the UMAP plot of the integrated object based on the clusters identified separately in each model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 10.A</xref>). The progenitor clusters in all models appear in the upper part of the UMAP. DANs(A10) population clusters closer to the RGCs, illustrating once more their immature identity. Between the progenitor and mature clusters appears an intermediate more general cluster of progenitors in the assembloids model (Progenitors). This progenitor cluster seems to evolve into neuronal identity cells, given its close association with the yNeurons cluster. DANs cluster, that has a more immature identity in MOs, was not present in the assembloid model, while the general neuronal cluster in MOs, seems to have been shifted towards the DANs(A9) identity in assembloids. The MSNs cluster from StrOs, was preserved in assembloids. The strong correlation between GABAergic interneurons and MSNs is likely the reason why this cluster is not observable in the assembloid model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 10.B</xref>). Additionally, a small number of OPCs is only present in MOs.

Concerning the developmental neurogenesis and axonal guidance pathway, which was the second most enriched pathway in both comparisons, we observed that the majority of responsible genes for enriching this pathway are upregulated in the assembloid model compared to the MO and StrO models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.F</xref>). Additionally, we evaluated the expression of genes related to neuronal maturity and identified six genes, all showing upregulation in the assembloid model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.G</xref>).

First, to confirm that TH+ signal in the striatum of the assembloids originates from the MOs TH+ neurons innervation, we examined the presence of TH+ neurons in GFP-expressing MOs and StrOs cultured separately in the assembloid co-culture media for the same culture period as the assembloids (D30 assembloids, D50 MOs and D65 StrOs). We observed that MOs develop a high number of TH+ neurons, while the StrOs have almost no TH+ signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 11.A</xref>). Next, for visualising the TH+ neurite projections from the midbrain to the striatum in the assembloid model, we performed whole mount imaging of D30 assembloids containing GFP-expressing MOs. We were able to identify neurons that have TH+/GFP+ soma, indicating their midbrain identity, with TH+ axons projecting towards the striatum side of the assembloid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3.A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 11.B, C</xref>).</p><p id="P67">Nigrostriatal pathway connectivity and functionality in the assembloid model were further investigated.

We have previously shown that electrochemical monitoring of catecholamine levels in the supernatant of MOs can provide valuable insights into the presence of dopamine (DA), due to neglectable levels of the interfering cationic catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine within the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">Zanetti et al., 2021</xref>). As expected, we observed higher levels of catecholamines in the MO side of the assembloid compared to the StrO side (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 11.E</xref>). No differences in StrO and StrO cultured in MO-conditioned media were detected, indicating no significant catecholamine or DA uptake from the medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 11.F</xref>). Finally, we measured catecholamine levels in StrOs alone and StrOs in the assembloid model. The results showed that the StrOs in the assembloid model displayed higher signals compared to StrOs cultured alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3.B</xref>), suggesting the active secretion of the catecholamine DA from midbrain dopaminergic neurons that are projecting to the striatum in the assembloid model.</p><p id="P68">To further determine whether neurons of MO and StrO are connected through active synapses in the assembloid model, we established a rabies virus-based retrograde monosynaptic tracing system. This system allows tracing of monosynaptic connections between neurons, using a lentiviral vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>) that expresses histone 2B-tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP), the avian tumor virus A (TVA) receptor (for selective infection by EnvA-pseudotyped rabies virus), and rabies virus envelope spike glycoprotein (GP) (to allow for rabies virus transsynaptic spreading) (LV-GP-TVA-GFP), in combination with a recombinant G-deleted (ΔG) rabies viral vector, pseudotyped with EnvA envelope protein (selectively binding to TVA), and red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged (RBV-ΔG-EnvA-RFP). LV-GP-TVA-GFP-transduced neurons (starter neurons) are identified by nuclear GFP expression. Following infection with the RBV-ΔG-EnvA-RFP, the double-transduced starter neurons are traced by co-expression of nuclear GFP and RFP, and because of GP expression, allow ΔG-rabies virus to form infectious particles in their cytoplasm. Neurons laying presynaptic inputs on the targeted starter neurons, are rendered RFP+ due to the selective retrograde transmission of rabies virus across active synapses (target neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Ugolini, 1995</xref>). Therefore, target neurons are RFP+/GFP- whereas starter neurons are RFP+/GFP+. Only first-order synapses are traced because GP expression is confined to the starter neurons, not allowing for further propagation of ΔG-rabies virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Etessami et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Grealish et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Osakada &amp; Callaway, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P69">StrOs at D35 of culture were transduced with LV-GP-TVA-GFP expressing the H2B-GFP fusion protein under the human Synapsin promoter.

We were able to see that D60 assembloids had significantly higher levels of H2AX/53BP1 positive foci in the Progerin-expressing cells (marked as GFP+) compared to the non-Progerin-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5.A</xref>). Similarly, aging-associated markers such as p21, p16 and p53 were all significantly elevated not only in the Progerin-expressing cells, but more specifically in Progerin-expressing neurons (MAP2/GFP-double positive) in D60 assembloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5.B, C, D</xref>).</p><p id="P72">Next, we explored the impact of the Progerin-expressing cells on the whole assembloid model. For that, we performed transcriptomic analysis with bulk RNA sequencing on assembloids generated from the Progerin-expressing cell line and its respective isogenic control. In both cases, we used the doxycycline treated (WT_DOX, PROG_DOX) and the untreated conditions (WT_UNTR, PROG_UNTR). Principle component analysis (PCA) plot shows the clustering of the samples based on their transcriptomic similarity. In this case, all the Progerin-expressing (PROG_DOX) samples were clustered completely separately from the rest of the samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6.A</xref>). Similarly, a heatmap of the DEGs shows that the Progerin-expressing samples have a distinct expression pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 13.A</xref>). Additionally, the number of DEGs of assembloids with Progerin overexpression (PROG_DOX group) versus the control groups (PROG_UNTR, WT_UNTR, WT_DOX) was 2 or 3-fold higher (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 13.B</xref>). These data demonstrated that assembloids with Progerin overexpression acquire a distinct transcriptomic profile. To explore possible aging-related transcriptomic changes, relevant to the human brain in the Progerin-overexpressing assembloids, we pooled the DEG lists from the comparisons between the Progerin-overexpressing assembloids with the controls (PROG_DOXvsPROG_UNTR, PROG_DOXvsWT_UNTR and PROG_DOXvsWT_DOX) and we compared them to the differentially expressed genes of aged human post-mortem brain transcriptomic data from two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Berchtold et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">González-Velasco et al., 2020</xref>). For these comparison, we extracted the significant DEGs (adj. pvalue &lt; 0.05) that are commonly up or downregulated in the post-mortem and assembloid datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Extended data 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">4</xref>). From these genes we focused on the ones with a log2FoldChange higher than 2. Additionally, we included the expression of <italic>PNOC</italic> (foldchange = -1.34) and <italic>GMPR</italic> (foldchange = 1.72) genes. The expression pattern of these two genes is best associated with aging, according to González-Velasco and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">González-Velasco et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6.B</xref>). The aging associate genes <italic>VIP, SST, NRGN, NETO1, KCNAB1, GRM4, GABRA4, DRD2, DRD1, DLX6, CRH, COBL, CHCHD2, IER3, GMPR, COL21A1</italic> and <italic>CHI3L1</italic> were all significantly differentially expressed.</p><p id="P73">Confirming the transcriptomic changes, we were also able to observe significant reduction of the LAMINB1 protein levels, another aging-related phenotype, in the Progerin-overexpressing assembloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6.C</xref>). Finally, the β-galactosidase staining on assembloid sections, revealed significant higher levels of senescent cells in the Progerin-overexpressing assembloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6.D</xref>). Overall, we consider that these results reveal a successful induction of aging in the assembloid model with the inducible expression of Progerin.</p></sec><sec id="S49"><title>Neurodegeneration phenotypes in the Progerin-inducible aged assembloids</title><p id="P74">Next, we investigated whether the Progerin-overexpressing aged assembloids, at D60 of culture, lead to PD relevant neurodegeneration phenotypes. First, we measured the catecholamine levels in the StrO tissue in assembloids from the control (WT_Untreated, WT_DOX and Progerin_Untreated) and aged conditions (Progerin_DOX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7.A</xref>). Catecholamine levels were significantly lower in the striatum of the aged assembloid model. These data along with the RNA sequencing analysis, showing the clustering of all the control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6.A</xref>), demonstrates a similar phenotype between the 3 control conditions. Therefore, in the following experiments we only compared assembloids generated from the Progerin line without doxycycline treatment (Progerin_Untreated) with assembloids from the same line with doxycycline supplementation for inducing the Progerin overexpression (Progerin_DOX). KEGG and GO enrichment analysis from the bulk RNA sequencing transcriptomic data revealed significant dysregulation of synaptic and DA transmission related pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7.B</xref>), with the majority of the responsible genes to be downregulated in the Progerin-overexpressing assembloids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 14.A-E</xref>). To confirm these results at the protein level, we performed Western blotting for the postsynaptic protein Gephyrin and the presynaptic proteins VAMP2 and Synaptotagmin1 (SYN). Importantly, the three of them were significantly downregulated in Progerin-overexpressing assembloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7.C-E</xref>).</p><p id="P75">Loss of TH positive dopaminergic neurons which leads to striatal DA depletion is the key characteristic of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Chung et al., 2020</xref>). The lower catecholamine levels detected in the striatal compartment of aged assembloids, is a first indication that this pathology hallmark is recapitulated in the aging model. To further substantiate this finding, we assessed the levels of TH protein in the Progerin-overexpressing assembloids via Western blotting. Consistent with the electrochemical measurements, also the TH protein levels are reduced upon induced aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7.F</xref>). Finally, we investigated the integrity of the dopaminergic neuronal population within the assembloid model. Strikingly, this revealed an increase in the fragmentation of neurites from TH positive dopaminergic neurons, which is an early sign of degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7.G-H</xref>). The TH fragmentation was calculated using our automated image analysis method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Bolognin et al., 2019</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that there is indeed an early loss of dopaminergic neurons’ function in induced aged assembloids that mimics early stages of PD pathology. Accordingly, this new model could be very valuable to investigate early alterations during the onset and progression of PD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S50" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P76">In this study, we developed a midbrain-striatum assembloid model that resembles the physiological nigrostriatal pathway connectivity. This model represents a relevant tool for the investigation of PD. To date, most studies on PD research with advanced cellular 3D models are based on the use of midbrain organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Becerra-Calixto et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">H. Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Monzel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Smits et al., 2019</xref>). Although these organoids have proven to be an excellent tool for studying the dopaminergic neurons’ vulnerability in different PD-related conditions, they are not able to recapitulate the dysregulated connectivity in the nigrostriatal pathway, which is crucially affected in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Fuxe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Singh et al., 2015</xref>). For the reconstruction of the nigrostriatal pathway connectivity, here we show the generation of a midbrain-striatum assembloid model that retains the identity of the two regions with the expression of midbrain and striatum specific markers respectively.</p><p id="P77">Single nuclei RNA sequencing analysis further revealed the identity specificity of MOs and StrOs, while the assembloid model demonstrated the preservation of cellular populations from both organoids, with additionally the identification of A9 and A10 dopaminergic neuronal clusters that are not clearly detected in our MOs dataset. A9 dopaminergic neurons were revealed by the high expression of <italic>KCNJ6</italic> that encodes GIRK2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">H. Li et al., 2022</xref>), while expression of <italic>OTX2</italic> was found only in the A10 cluster. <italic>OTX2</italic> encodes a transcription factor that is crucial for the specification of the A10 dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Grealish et al., 2014</xref>). In parallel, the MSN population in the assembloid model is specified by the co-expression of <italic>ARPP21</italic> and <italic>PPP1R1B,</italic> a strong indication of an MSN identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ivkovic &amp; Ehrlich, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Straccia et al., 2015</xref>), which is not evident in the StrOs dataset where only <italic>ARPP21</italic> expression was found. This illustrates that the assembloid model, probably through a functional communication between both regions, favours the further specification of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons as well as the MSNs of the striatum.</p><p id="P78">Enrichment analysis of the DEGs between assembloids and MOs, and assembloids and StrOs, revealed the upregulation of genes related to developmental neurogenesis, axonal guidance, and neuronal maturity. In line with the importance of brain’s interregional communication in neuronal maturity and functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Qin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Voytek &amp; Knight, 2015</xref>), it is possible that neurogenesis and neuronal maturity are promoted by the interactions formed between midbrain and striatal neurons in the assembloid model. These observations align with another study in cortico-thalamic assembloids, where neuronal maturity was observed in the assembloid level compared to individual organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">Xiang et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, this assumption is further supported by the reduced expression of cellular and oxidative stress related genes in midbrainstriatum assembloids, as elevated stress levels in cerebral organoids have been linked with impaired cellular maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Bhaduri et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P79">Nigrostriatal pathway connectivity and functionality are also confirmed in assembloids, with the formation of active synapses between midbrain and striatal neurons and the release of catecholamines from the midbrain to striatum. This is specifically important, as the catecholamine DA release in the dorsal striatum from the SNpc dopaminergic neuronal axons is the major functionality of the nigrostriatal pathway and it is crucial for behaviour and movement control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aarts et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Sulzer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P80">A limitation of iPSC-derived organoid models in the research of age-related neurodegenerative diseases is that their developmental nature lacks the aging-specific phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Simpson et al., 2021</xref>). Since aging is the major risk factor in PD, we aimed to model this aspect in midbrain-striatum assembloids. To achieve this, we leveraged the overexpression of Progerin for introducing aging characteristics to our model. Similar approach has been previously described, where transient Progerin overexpression in iPSC derived dopaminergic neurons resulted in aging and neurodegeneration phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Miller et al., 2013</xref>). In our approach for Progerin overexpression, we used iPSCs carrying a Progerin transgene under the control of the Tet-On system (Gabassi et al., <italic>In Preparation),</italic> where doxycycline supplementation is essential for the inducible expression. Our optimised concentration of doxycycline for Progerin overexpression can be safely used in our system, as it does not affect the viability and metabolic activity in assembloids, and it does not introduce major changes in their transcriptome profile. Progerin overexpression was achieved in approximately half of the cells in doxycycline treated assembloids carrying the Progerin transgene, creating a mosaic Progerin-overexpressing model. In this mosaic model, we found that Progerin-overexpressing cells acquire aging characteristics compared to the non-Progerin-expressing cells. Some of these characteristics are the increased levels of DNA double strand breaks marked with the double positive H2AX-53BP1 nucleus foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Shibata &amp; Jeggo, 2020</xref>). Moreover, Progerin-overexpressing cells and neurons had significantly higher levels of p21<sup>CIP1</sup>, p53 and p16<sup>INK4A</sup>. The upregulation of these three proteins has been shown to be associated with cellular senescence and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Kumari &amp; Jat, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">Wagner &amp; Wagner, 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P81">To assess how Progerin-overexpressing cells affect the whole assembloid model we performed transcriptomic analysis with bulk RNA sequencing. Clustering of the data based on their transcriptomic similarity and the differential gene expression revealed a distinct transcriptomic profile for assembloids with Progerin overexpression. To investigate whether there are aging-related transcriptomic differences we performed a benchmarking analysis with the use of human brain post-mortem transcriptomic data from aged individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Berchtold et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">González-Velasco et al., 2020</xref>). An aging-related transcriptomic profile was observed in Progerin-overexpressing assembloids, with the identification of aging-related genes with a common expression pattern between assembloids and human brain post-mortem data. Noteworthy, Progerin assembloids DEG showed <italic>PNOC</italic> downregulation and <italic>GMPR</italic> upregulation, that were found to correlate best with the biological age of the human brain post-mortem data (Velasco et al., 2020).</p><p id="P82">Significantly upregulated genes found in Progerin assembloids have also been associated with aging and neurodegeneration. Specifically, higher expression of <italic>CHI3L1</italic> has been linked to aging and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Moreno-Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Sanfilippo et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>COL21A1</italic> upregulation has been correlated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Kong et al., 2009</xref>) and <italic>IER3</italic> gene has been implicated in cellular stress response and it is upregulated in inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Arlt &amp; Schäfer, 2011</xref>). From the significant downregulated genes<italic>, PNOC</italic> and <italic>VIP</italic> are associated with inhibitory neurotransmission in GABAergic neurons and are both significantly downregulated in human aged brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Loerch et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>SST</italic> and <italic>CRH</italic> downregulation has been found in aging brain but also in AD genetic signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Berchtold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Loerch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Peng et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, downregulation of <italic>NRGN</italic> expression correlates with higher density of amyloid plaques in post mortem brains of AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>GRM4</italic> which encodes for the Glutamate Metabotropic Receptor 4 has also been found to be reduced in the prelimbic of aged rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Hernandez et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>KCNAB1</italic> and <italic>GABRA4</italic> have a positive co-expression with <italic>BDNF</italic> which shows gradual downregulation in aging human prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Oh et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, <italic>DRD1</italic> and <italic>DRD2</italic> DA receptors’ downregulation correlates with brain aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Lubec et al., 2021</xref>). Both receptors are crucial for DA signalling in the striatum, and their reduced expression can be linked to motor and cognitive abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hemby et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>DLX6</italic> encodes an important transcription factor for the regulation of GABAergic neurons (Lombares et al., 2019) and therefore its downregulation could be associated with aging. <italic>NETO1</italic> is essential for the regulation of the connectivity of glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Orav et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Straub et al., 2011</xref>) and its downregulation could cause dysfunction in synaptic circuits. Reduction of <italic>COBL</italic> has be linked with reduced dendrite arborisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ahuja et al., 2007</xref>). Lastly, downregulation of <italic>CHCHD2</italic> could be associated with the aging brain and development of PD, as studies have shown that mutations in this gene are tied to dysfunctional mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Kee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Meng et al., 2017</xref>), while at the same time reduction of <italic>CHCHD2</italic> mRNA levels has been found in erythrocytes of PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). The aging phenotype observed in the transcriptomic profile of the Progerin-overexpressing assembloids was further validated by the significant reduction of the LAMINB1 protein levels and the significant increase in senescence-activated β-galactosidase positive areas. Both these phenotypes have been considered hallmarks of aging and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Dodig et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Matias et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Miller et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P83">Many of the genes mentioned previously are not only related to aging but also to neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD, highlighting the interconnected relationship between aging and neurodegeneration. Synaptic dysfunction in the aging brain is one of the major promoters of neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Azam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Buss et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Talyansky &amp; Brinkman, 2021</xref>). Dysregulation of synaptic and DA neurotransmission pathways revealed in the transcriptomic data of Progerin-overexpressing assembloids, was further validated by the downregulation of the post-synaptic protein Gephyrin, an important scaffolding protein that regulates the organisation of post-synapses in striatal GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Choii &amp; Ko, 2015</xref>), and the pre-synaptic proteins VAMP2 and Synaptotagmin1. VAMP2 regulates the fusion of synaptic vesicles and neurotransmitter release through the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">Yan et al., 2022</xref>) and Synaptotagmin1 is an essential Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for the fast release of DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>, 2022). In parallel, catecholamine measurements showed significantly lower catecholamine levels in the striatum of the Progerin-overexpressing assembloids, indicating dysregulation of DA release in the aged-induced model, a PD-relevant phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). These results reveal a defective synaptic and DA release system in Progerin-overexpressing assembloids.</p><p id="P84">Moreover, low TH protein levels in Progerin-overexpressing assembloids could be linked to dysregulated DA synthesis system and the presence of vulnerable dopaminergic neurons. TH is the key enzyme of DA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Daubner et al., 2011</xref>). Lower TH protein levels have been previously observed in surviving dopaminergic neurons of PD patients, indicating their vulnerability to the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kastner et al., 1993</xref>). Moreover, loss of TH activity followed by TH protein decline has been linked to DA deficiency in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Tabrez et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, quantification of the fragmentation index of the TH+ neurites revealed that dopaminergic neurons in the age-induced assembloids are more fragmented, demonstrating a degeneration phenotype prior to their neuronal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). The axonal fragmented phenotype has been previously described in iPSC-derived PD neuronal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Kouroupi et al., 2017</xref>). These results support that our age-induced assembloids display an early PD-relevant neurodegeneration phenotype, with dysregulation in the DA synthesis and release systems indicative of axonal degeneration preceding the eventual loss of dopaminergic neurons’ soma, in retrograde fashion as typically observed in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Chu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">L.
