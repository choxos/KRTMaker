Over time, phenotype-based markers have been replaced by anonymous DNA variation such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lander, 1996</xref>). With the advent of cheap high throughput sequencing, one can use low pass sequencing of subsequent generations (e.g., F2 generation) to accurately determine the genotype of an individual. This process is a type of imputation (i.e. the statistical technique to infer missing data), and statistical models have been specifically developed for the linked inheritance patterns of DNA sequence variation. Imputation approaches have been used for plant breeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bhattarai <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), farm animal agricultural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) and model organism studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Yao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Most imputation methods in current use rely on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) where the sample genotypes represent the emission space, and the reference panel haplotypes define a two-dimensional grid of hidden states where each row is a reference haplotype, and each column is a marker. This is known as the Li and Stephens model after their foundational work on statistical modelling of linkage disequilibrium and recombination rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Li and Stephens, 2003</xref>). In populations where the founding haplotypes are known, for example F2 crosses from inbred mice, implementations of the Li and Stephens model such as R/qtl2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Broman <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) can be used as an effective solution to the imputation problem. However, often the founding haplotypes are not available or too costly to obtain.</p><p id="P6">The success of genotype imputation in humans has been made possible by the construction of large reference panels of high-quality genotypes. Milestones in this direction are the HapMap Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Altshuler <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), the 1000 Genomes Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2015</xref>), and the Haplotype Reference Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">McCarthy <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Some of the imputation tools in widespread use that take advantage of reference panels are GLIMPSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rubinacci <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), QUILT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Davies <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), ShapeIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Delaneau <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Beagle (Browning <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>), miniMAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fuchsberger <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), and Impute2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Howie <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The reliance on reference panels or high-quality founder haplotypes has hindered the application of genotype imputation in less-studied organisms that lack extensive reference data. STITCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Davies <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) overcomes this limitation by recognising that in populations founded by a limited number of individuals, the unknown ancestral haplotypes are sequenced at relatively high depth even though each single sample is sequenced at low depth. STITCH can impute genotypes from low-depth sequencing data by alternating the Li and Stephens HMM with an expectation maximisation (EM) step where randomly initialised ancestral haplotypes are tuned to maximise the expectation under the model of the observed sample genotypes. This alternating procedure is repeated a parameterised number of times, leading to the reconstruction of the founder haplotypes and the imputation of the sample genotypes. Several hyperparameters need to be optimised for the reconstruction to be optimal, key among them the number of ancestral haplotypes to be reconstructed (K parameter). This optimization can be performed either by relying on quality metrics that are internal to the model (info score) or on external validation (correlation of imputed and known genotypes). Although STITCH has been used successfully in a number of diverse populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Nicod <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Zan <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Scott <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Zha <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Blain <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>), often the parameterisation and the assessment of the required level of coverage are presented as a single best choice and with little exploration of alternative parameters and experimental designs. Previous work explored some of the parameters that influence STITCH accuracy in an Angora rabbit population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), but this work did not explore the complex interplay between sequencing depth, population size, and cross structure.</p><p id="P8">We are studying phenotypes in the medaka fish (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>), which is a small teleost fish native to Japan, Korea and eastern China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wittbrodt <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). It has long been used as a model organism for genetic research thanks to its comparatively small genome (700.4 Mb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kasahara <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) and to its economic husbandry and tolerance to inbreeding. Taking advantage of these characteristics, an extensive medaka inbred panel has been established from a wild population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fitzgerald <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Inspired by some of the plant breeding strategies, we have been using 8 parental lines, in 10 different cross combinations, for phenotype mapping. A recent example, which we will use in this manuscript, generated a total of 2219 samples (of which 2177 were used in the final analysis).</p><p id="P9">A practical problem that we encountered was the optimal imputation of the DNA sequence of each individual. Given that our medaka lines exhibit some residual genetic variability, we reasoned that STITCH would be the ideal tool for this task. We optimised STITCH hyperparameters for this type of multi-parent cross by assessing the imputation accuracy with a sample of high-coverage genomes and we explored the optimal parameters for future cost-effective cross designs. We show that a correctly parameterised STITCH pipeline can effectively impute sample genotypes and show that there is a trade-off between the number of individuals sequenced and the per-sample coverage needed.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P10">We first developed a framework for the optimisation and assessment of imputation results from F2 crosses. We performed high-coverage sequencing on one F1 individual per cross (10 overall) and two F2 individuals (from one cross only). We reasoned that we could use F1 individuals as high-coverage “truth sets” for the imputation assessment to maximise the probability of observing all the haplotypes from a given cross in the smallest possible number of validation samples. We show that this choice does not affect model selection and does not inflate performance in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>. The F1 individuals are also useful to determine the set of truly polymorphic markers in the cross. Although we have sequenced individuals from the F0 founder lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fitzgerald <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) both previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Jaegle <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) and our own investigations suggested that there will be apparent deviations from the expected inheritance patterns (e.g. in cryptic segmental duplications and in genomic regions that are not fully inbred), and so we preferred to develop a system where no assumptions about the founders’ haplotypes are made. Before using them for imputation, we downsampled the F1 and high-coverage F2 samples to obtain approximately equivalent coverage to the low-depth sequencing data across all F2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, we had 12 samples imputed from low-coverage data for which we have also a high-quality, high-confidence genotype call. Using this truth set we explored STITCH parameters.</p><p id="P11">In our hands, the two key parameters for a successful imputation were the number of ancestral haplotypes (K parameter) and the selection of valid SNPs to impute. To select the imputable SNPs, we started with the SNPs that are polymorphic in the 10 F1 individuals (one F1 per cross) and the two high-coverage F2s. We then refined this set by running the imputation including the downsampled high-coverage datasets, computing the correlation of the imputed SNPs to the high-coverage calls, and rejecting SNPs with a low correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). We repeated this process for 5 iterations, progressively increasing the stringency of the correlation threshold (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). We show that this procedure substantially improves imputation performance and does not result in a biased dropout of low-frequency SNPs or SNPs present only in one founder line in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S4, S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6</xref>. For the selection of the best setting for K, we tested a range of values and selected the one that maximised the mean squared Pearson correlation across the 12 truth set samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). As both K and the final SNP set parameters are linked, our procedure is to first determine a plausible value for K using the unfiltered SNP set, then doing the SNP filtering (using the value of K determined in the initial assessment), and finally re-assessing the choice of K on the filtered SNP set.</p><p id="P12">Overall, our F2-STITCH pipeline proved to be highly successful in imputing the genotypes of our medaka cohort. We observed a mean per-sample squared Pearson correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>) of 0.996 between the imputed and ground truth genotypes. When binning the SNPs according to their Minor Allele Frequency (MAF), the squared Pearson correlation was as expected higher for bins containing more common SNPs (most likely due to being polymorphic in more than one cross) and decaying for rarer SNPs. Nonetheless, even the bin containing the least common SNPs (MAF 0 to 0.05) still showed an <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.977.</p><sec id="S6"><title>Parameters that influence accurate imputation</title><p id="P13">Using the pipeline, we then explored downsampling our overall F2 dataset in a variety of dimensions: in the sequencing depth, in the number of individuals overall, in the number of crosses, and in the number of individuals in a single cross. This explores much of the design space for practical cross strategies.</p><p id="P14">As expected, we observed less accurate imputation for lower sequencing depth and lower sample numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a, 3b</xref>), though there is a non-linear response in both cases. For example, we observed a large difference in imputation performance between a coverage of 0.5x and 0.25x, but a comparatively smaller difference when the coverage was changed from 1x to 0.5x. We observed a similar trend when reducing the total number of samples while retaining the original sequencing depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). In this case, the performance started to drop significantly for cohorts that were smaller than 1000 samples.</p><p id="P15">On the contrary, reducing the sample numbers by reducing the number of F2 crosses involved (and hence the number of distinct haplotypes to be reconstructed; we changed K proportionally, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>) did not significantly affect the quality of the imputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). When the dataset was reduced to a single F2 cross (and so 2 F0 founder lines) for a total of 474 samples, the <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> value was observed to be above 0.964 for all the MAF bins except the one with the least common SNPs (which had a much lower <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.694). This compares to an <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> range of 0.777 to 0.915 when using 500 samples randomly chosen from the whole dataset (contrast <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>, “500 random samples” to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>, “2 founder lines, 1 cross”, with 474 samples).</p><p id="P16">Finally, when we explored reducing the number of samples within a single F2 cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>), we observed that when the sample number fell below 200, the <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> sharply decreased. However, it should be noted that in a population similar to the one presented in this study, different F2 crosses share some common founder lines. As such, STITCH would be able to more accurately impute the genotypes compared to this simplified single-cross scenario by borrowing sequencing coverage of the founders from the other F2 crosses that have common parents.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Cost-benefit analysis</title><p id="P17">To determine what would be the ideal sequencing depth to aim for when designing similar experiments, we performed a combined downsampling of mean sequencing depth and sample numbers. We observed that for the original cohort size (2177 samples) a maximum sequencing depth of 0.5x was sufficient for obtaining an imputation result that is only marginally worse than the original (Pearson <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> 0.981 versus 0.996) while almost halving the financial burden (53.7% of the original).</p><p id="P18">For lower sample numbers, the required minimum sequencing depth proportionally increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). For 1500 and 1000 samples, a depth of 1x was needed to avoid strong degradation of the imputation quality. For sample sizes lower than 500 any sequencing depth downsampling led to much worse imputation results. Also, we noticed that the Pearson <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> reached a plateau at different levels for different cohort sizes, with larger cohorts reaching the plateau earlier and ending at higher Pearson <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> values, though the difference between the best achievable correlations is marginal at high sample numbers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">In this work, we have systematically explored the imputation accuracy from low-coverage sequencing for the commonplace F2 cross designs used in agriculture, model organisms and plant breeding. We also developed an economic model for the sequencing cost, on the assumption that the sample numbers would be fixed by other constraints (e.g. husbandry capacity). There is a relationship between the optimal sequencing depth and the number of samples for accurate imputation, as expected by the coverage of the underlying ancestral haplotypes. In practice, for sample sizes of 1000 aiming for a coverage of 1x at least for this cross structure provided nearly equivalent accuracy compared to our full set. In contrast for 2,000 samples a similar level of accuracy would be achieved with 0.5x. An alternative way of viewing this is that for sample sizes of 2000, there is little to be gained by raising the sequencing depth from 0.5x to 1x.</p><p id="P20">However, it is important to note that the optimal coverage and sample size cannot be determined <italic>a priori</italic> for an arbitrary population. Our results shall serve only as a guideline for similar experimental designs, as the genetic diversity and homozygosity level of the founders will have an impact on the optimal experimental design. In general, more diverse populations will require higher levels of coverage and/or larger sample sizes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Notes</xref>). Nonetheless, our pipeline can be used for exploring context-specific experimental and software parameters in such scenarios.</p><p id="P21">An important feature in both the practical F2 imputation and our assessment was the sequencing of F1 individuals at high coverage. In our experience, this was critical to select an initial set of SNPs which were polymorphic in the crosses and to assess imputation accuracy for different parameter settings. In practice, this means it is important to track and store F1 individuals during the breeding. As not all inbred lines are fully inbred, it is also advantageous to set up F2 crosses between single F0 individuals and track the relationship between F2 individuals and their specific F0 parents wherever possible. A benefit of STITCH is that it does not require a reference panel and will impute variants which are present in the F2 regardless of whether they were fixed in the F0 or not. While the info score produced by STITCH could be used for performance assessment in place of an external validation set to reduce cost, we suggest using an external validation when possible (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Notes</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Another point to note is that we used a different DNA extraction and sequencing library preparation strategy for the high sequencing coverage and low sequencing coverage samples (ligation-based and PCR-free in the first case, tagmentation-based in the second). Tagmentation-based libraries are cost-effective for large numbers of samples, while ligation-based PCR-free workflows are free from transposase binding site bias and PCR artefacts, and so are more suitable for obtaining a high-quality validation set. While this differential processing could introduce systematic differences in sensitivity and precision in detecting variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Ribarska <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), we think it does not substantially influence the parameter selection and coverage/sample size assessment performed in this study because: 1) a predetermined set of variants is used for imputation, and so false positives in the low-coverage samples have no impact on the imputation process; 2) the high-coverage samples are only used to validate the imputation process, and are not directly compared to the low-coverage samples; 3) the relative imputation accuracy between two imputation runs depends on the respective ancestral haplotype reconstructions, which are the same for both sets of samples. However, it must be noted that the <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> values reported in this work refer to the high-coverage samples only and may not be fully representative of the imputation performance in samples prepared with a different methodology.</p><p id="P23">A consequence of imputing only the highly confident polymorphic SNPs is that many other variants will not be imputed, including copy number variants, structural variants, insertions, deletions and hard-to-call SNPs. This does not invalidate the accurate imputation of the markers we have, but for downstream applications such as association studies, analysts should remember that the causal variant is not necessarily among the imputed set of markers. In our hands, a successful exploration technique is to group samples by the associated marker of interest and treat the grouped samples as a high-coverage meta-sample to explore other forms of genetic variation linked around a selected marker.</p><p id="P24">We have made this STITCH-based imputation scheme into a Nextflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Tommaso <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) pipeline inspired by the nf-core template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ewels <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) and available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/birneylab/stitchimpute">https://github.com/birneylab/stitchimpute</ext-link>. This pipeline can take as inputs high-coverage and low-coverage samples, with a specification of any sequencing depth downsampling to be performed (e.g. for later assessment) and will automatically iterate the imputation and performance assessment for building a final SNP set. The pipeline also allows the exploration of the STITCH parameters K (number of haplotypes) and nGen (number of generations) in a systematic manner. It can also be used in a more basic way to run a single imputation with a pre-defined SNP and parameter set. We have successfully used this pipeline in a number of F2 crosses with different operators and hope it will be useful to a broader set of research groups. We are currently processing a number of phenotypes on this and other complex cross designs and are aiming for a comprehensive association study using these imputed genotypes.</p><p id="P25">Although we have explored parameters and downsampling for this particular cross structure in this specific species (medaka fish), different cross structures with different divergence levels of parents and different recombination rates will mean that some level of parameter adjustment will be needed for each system. Our recommendations are: (a) to ensure that there are high-coverage F1 individuals (b) to carefully consider the sequencing depth compared to the number of samples in the F2 and (c) to consider the number of parents and the number of founding haplotypes.</p><p id="P26">One aspect that we did not explore in detail in this work is the definition of the initial set of SNPs used in the imputation and filtering process. A possible extension that could be implemented in a future version of our pipeline is the use of a variant caller designed for (ultra) low-coverage sequencing data such as BaseVar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) for defining this initial variant set without relying on the high-coverage samples.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Fish maintenance</title><p id="P27">All fish stocks were maintained and bred (fish husbandry, permit number 35–9185.64/BH Wittbrodt) in constant recirculating systems at 26 °C on a 14 hrs light/10 hrs dark cycle.

The resulting fragments were amplified by PCR (72°C for 3min, 95°C for 30sec, 12 cycles of 98°C for 20 sec, 58°C for 15 sec and 72°C for 30 sec and a final extension time of 3 min at 72°C) using 6,75 µL of KAPA 2 X HiFi master mix, 0,75 µL of Dimethyl sulfoxide and 2,5 µL of dual indexed primers. PCR products were pooled and selected for an average size of 450 bp using two rounds of magnetic SPRI beads cleanup (0.7X and 0.6X respectively). Finally, the library was quantified with the Qubit High-Sensitivity kit and the fragment size was assessed using the high-sensitivity assay in the Bioanalyzer.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Sample exclusions</title><p id="P30">Samples sequenced to an overall mean depth lower than 0.1x were excluded from the analysis.

We ran the imputation jointly on the low-coverage and downsampled ground truth samples (0.5x mean depth) and measured the SNP-wise squared Pearson correlation against the ground truth genotypes. We retained SNPs only above a certain threshold of squared correlation and then repeated the imputation on such SNP set. We iteratively refined the SNP set in this way for a total of 5 iterations, using filter values of 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, and 0.9. The final SNP set consisted of 3.2 million SNPs.
