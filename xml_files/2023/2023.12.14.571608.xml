By contrast, known prokaryotic Argonautes adopt single-stranded DNA as guides and/or targets, leaving the evolutionary origin of RNA-guided RNA silencing elusive. Here, we show an evolutionary expansion of Asgard archaeal Argonautes (asAgos), including the discovery of HrAgo1 from the Lokiarchaeon ‘<italic>Candidatus</italic> Harpocratesius repetitus’ that shares a common origin with eukaryotic PIWI proteins. HrAgo1 exhibits RNA-guided RNA cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic> and RNA silencing in human cells. The cryo-EM structure of HrAgo1 combined with quantitative single-molecule experiments reveals that HrAgo1 possesses hybrid structural features and target binding modes bridging those of the eukaryotic AGO and PIWI clades. Finally, genomic evidence suggests that eukaryotic Dicer-like processing of double-stranded RNA likely emerged as a mechanism of generating guide RNA for asAgos prior to eukaryogenesis.

In eukaryotic RNA silencing pathways, sequence-specific repression of target RNAs is achieved by Argonaute proteins loaded with small guide RNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Canonical eukaryotic Argonautes (eAgos) can be subdivided into two clades, AGO and PIWI, which are distributed broadly, albeit heterogeneously, across eukaryotic lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. AGOs and PIWIs are strictly conserved and arguably best studied in Metazoa (animals), where they rely on various guide generation pathways and carry out distinct physiological functions. Metazoan AGOs use small interfering RNA (siRNA) and/or microRNA (miRNA) guides, generated from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by Dicer-like RNase III family proteins, to post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In general, base-pairing of a short region at the 5’ end of miRNAs termed the ‘seed’ (nucleotides 2-8) to a target RNA is sufficient for AGOs to bind target RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. By contrast, PIWIs generally show lower seed binding strength and target RNA binding requires extended base-pairing in the central region of the guide to achieve stable binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Additionally, metazoan PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) guides are generated from longer single-stranded RNA by Zucchini, to suppress transposable elements (TEs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Both the arms race against TEs and global gene silencing are critical drivers of eukaryotic genome evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. As such, the origin and differentiation of AGO and PIWI have broad implications for the emergence and expansion of the eukaryotic tree of life. However, it is unclear how the divergence between AGO- and PIWI-based RNA silencing pathways originated and whether they have consistent signatures across the expansive eukaryotic tree of life.</p><p id="P4">Prokaryotic Argonautes (pAgos) are a highly diverse protein family with functions ranging from prokaryotic immunity by neutralizing foreign DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> or inducing cell death in invaded cells (abortive infection)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, to aiding in genome replication and recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. All pAgos characterized to date interact with DNA guides and/or targets; no known pAgo exclusively facilitates eAgo-like guide RNA-mediated RNA targeting. Thermophilic euryarchaeal Argonautes, which have previously been suggested to be most closely related to eukaryotic Argonautes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, exclusively mediate DNA-guided targeting of invading DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Furthermore, no dedicated guide RNA-generating systems, such as homologs of eukaryotic Dicer or Zucchini, have been found associated with pAgos. Hence, with these apparent mechanistic differences between pAgos and eAgos, it was thought that RNA-guided RNA-targeting Argonautes, along with their associated guide RNA-generating pathways, have arisen after eukaryogenesis and before the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Here we show that an Asgard archaeal Argonaute mediates RNA-guided RNA silencing, providing new insights into the origin and diversification of eukaryotic RNA silencing pathways.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Asgard archaeal diversification gave rise to eAgo-like Argonautes</title><p id="P5">Eukaryotes are thought to have evolved from an archaeon belonging to Asgard archaea (or Asgardarchaeota)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We thus set out to explore the presence of Argonaute proteins in these organisms using a custom hidden Markov model based on the conserved MID-PIWI domains (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). In 496 available Asgard archaeal metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), we identified a total of 138 Asgard archaeal Argonaute sequences (asAgos, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis shows that asAgos are polyphyletically distributed over 15 subclades located across the phylogenetic tree of Argonaute proteins, including subclades 1, 11, and 13 that respectively appear basal to the previously classified long-A pAgos, long-B pAgos, and short pAgos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Like many other prokaryotic defense systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, pAgos are present only in a fraction of prokaryotes. Here we found Argonaute-encoding genes in 21.5% (83/387) of the quality-filtered Asgard archaeal MAGs, higher than any other prokaryotic phylum as classified by the Genome Taxonomic Database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (GTDB v207). This apparent gene enrichment and diversification imply that Asgard archaea may have adopted Argonaute proteins for diversified functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Strikingly, we found that ‘<italic>Candidatus</italic> Harpocratesius repetitus FW102’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, a deep-sea rock-dwelling Lokiarchaeia archaeon named after the Greek god of silence, encodes two asAgos belonging to Asgard-specific-clades distinct from known pAgos. The HrAgo1 subclade clusters with eAgos while the HrAgo2 subclade comprises a mixture of long and short asAgos basal to all short pAgos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Both are encoded in operon-like gene clusters outside of other genomic defense islands, including CRISPR-Cas and CBASS systems. The HrAgo2 operon encodes various components involved in transposition (InsG and TniQ) and DNA replication (PCNA and TOPRIM). This is different from known short pAgos or SiAgo-like pseudo-short pAgos, which cooperate with immune effectors encoded in their gene neighborhoods to trigger cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The HrAgo1 operon is also unique in that flanking <italic>hrAgo1</italic> are an <italic>rnc</italic> gene, encoding a protein that comprises an RNaseIII domain and a double stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD), and a gene encoding a HEDxD/H helicase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Both proteins share functional domains with eukaryotic Dicer enzymes involved in guide RNA biogenesis.</p><p id="P7">HrAgo1 shows higher similarity to well-studied PIWIs (25-27% sequence identity) and AGOs (23-24%), than to various other pAgos (16-21%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). To date, the only eAgo-like HrAgo1 homolog that we could identify is a truncated asAgo sequence found in a Lokiarchaeon assembled from a Siberian soda lake metagenome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, with 34% sequence identity to HrAgo1 across the obtained L2-MID-PIWI segment. Although a subclade of asAgos (subclade 9 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) appeared to be basal to the whole eAgos clade in this analysis, the inferred evolutionary relation is supported by a low bootstrap value and unstable against changes in phylogenetic methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). To further elucidate the relation between HrAgo1 and eAgos, we expanded the sampling of AGO and PIWI clade homologs across the eukaryotic tree of life and performed Maximum Likelihood analyses using above-found Long-A pAgos/asAgos and the non-canonical Trypanosome-specific TrypAgos as outgroup. When analyzed using the conserved MID-PIWI domains commonly used for Argonaute phylogeny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, we found that the HrAgo1 clade is positioned as sister group to the PIWI clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Additionally, we examined the more variable N-L1-PAZ domains as well as the full-length N-L1-PAZ-L2-MID-PIWI domains, which, despite a few unstable branches of pAgos and eAgos whose evolutionary positions are uncertain, further confirmed the monophyly of HrAgo1 as being basal to the PIWI clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Combined with phylogenomic studies supporting an asgard archaeal origin of eukaryotes, our data suggest that eukaryotic PIWIs and HrAgo1 evolved from a common ancestor, prompting us to study the molecular mechanism and function of HrAgo1.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>HrAgo1 mediates RNA-guided RNA cleavage</title><p id="P8">The most apparent differences between eAgos and pAgos are their guide and target preferences.

Corroborating the <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>P-labeling-based detection, small RNA sequencing analysis confirmed that HrAgo1-associated small RNAs are mostly 15-25 nt in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The small RNAs have a bias for uracil (U) at their 5’ end (65%), similar to the guide 5’-end preference observed for most examined PIWIs and AGOs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a bias for U is observed to a lesser extent at position 2 (47%) and 3 (49%) of the guide RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Since previous studies have shown that nucleic acids co-purified with heterologously expressed pAgos generally match the types of their naturally preferred guides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, our data thus suggest that HrAgo1 utilizes guide RNAs, akin to eAgos.</p><p id="P9">Next, we analyzed HrAgo1 guide/target preferences <italic>in vitro</italic>. Upon incubation of HrAgo1 with 21-nt single-stranded (ss)DNA or ssRNA guide oligonucleotides and complementary 5’ Cy5-labelled ssDNA or ssRNA targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), HrAgo1 demonstrated ssRNA-guided cleavage of RNA targets in a magnesium-dependent manner, while it was unable to cleave DNA targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Of note, guide ssDNAs also facilitated cleavage of RNA targets, but with lower efficiency compared to guide ssRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), similar to the <italic>in vitro</italic> behavior of human AGO2 (hAgo2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Combined, these results show that, compared to other known pAgos, the prokaryotic HrAgo1 mechanistically acts more similarly to RNA-guided RNA-targeting eAgos.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Structural architecture of HrAgo1</title><p id="P10">To illuminate the structural basis for RNA-guided RNA cleavage by HrAgo1, we examined HrAgo1 in complex with a 21-nucleotide guide RNA by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single particle analysis. The resulting reconstruction, determined at a resolution of 3.4 Å, reveals a binary HrAgo1-guide RNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). Resembling eAgos and long pAgos, HrAgo1 adopts a bilobed conformation in which one lobe comprises the N-terminal, linker L1, PAZ, and linker L2 domains, connected to the second lobe comprised of the MID and PIWI domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c-d</xref>). The first six nucleotides of the guide RNA 5’ end (g1-g6) are ordered in the cryo-EM map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-d</xref>). Low resolution density for four nucleotides at the 3’ end of the guide RNA (g18-g21) is also apparent but uninterpretable, while the remainder of the guide RNA is unstructured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-d</xref>). In accordance with its phylogeny, an all-against-all comparison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> of experimentally determined structures of Argonaute-family proteins positions HrAgo1 between pAgos and eAgos, and closest to the PIWI-clade Siwi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The catalytic tetrad of HrAgo1 comprises residues Asp585, Glu623, Asp655, and His792 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). In the structure, all four catalytic residues are ordered and in position to mediate divalent cation binding and catalysis, akin to the catalytic site of AGO structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. This implies that HrAgo1 adopts a catalytically active conformation. The 5′-terminal phosphate group of the guide RNA is sequestered in the MID domain binding pocket through interactions with residues (Phe512, Lys516, Asn528, and Lys555) that are conserved in most Argonautes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). The negative charge of two phosphates of guide RNA nucleotides 1 and 3, as well as that of the C-terminal carboxyl group of HrAgo1, are neutralized by a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion as is observed in pAgos and PIWIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Instead of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Metazoan AGOs use another lysine residue in this pocket<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. A catalytic double mutant (D585A &amp; E623A, HrAgo1<sup>DM</sup>) did not mediate RNA cleavage, confirming that the catalytic DEDH motif in the PIWI domain facilitates target cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Corroborating the observed interactions with the 5’-phosphate, HrAgo1 showed higher activity with guide RNAs that are 5’-phosphorylated compared to guide RNAs with a 5’-hydroxyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Remarkably, HrAgo1 mediated RNA-guided RNA cleavage at temperatures ranging from 9 °C to 71 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>), coinciding with a steep temperature gradient around the hot hydrothermal vents that ‘<italic>Ca</italic>. H. repetitus’ resided. Such an extraordinarily broad temperature adaptation apparently places HrAgo1 between the temperature ranges of mesophilic eAgos with those from the euryarchaeal pAgos, which mostly function at temperatures above 75 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">Our structural data combined with biochemical experiments thus illuminate the mechanistic adaptation of the archaeal HrAgo1 as an eAgo-like RNA-guided RNA-cleaving enzyme.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>HrAgo1 structure bridges AGO and PIWI</title><p id="P13">The ability to rapidly find complementary mRNA targets in a crowded cellular environment and to effectively distinguish them from other transcripts is critical for the functions of eAgos. Argonaute proteins achieve efficient target binding by ordering the ‘seed’ region of the guide strand (nucleotides 2-8) in an A-form helical conformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. AGO-clade eAgos achieve full seed pre-organization using a loop that binds the g5-g6 backbone and a helix-7 which organizes g7–g8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, facilitating strong target association at short matching lengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. By contrast, known PIWI-clade eAgos only pre-organize the first few nucleotides of the seed (typically g2-g4), and require further guide-target pairing beyond the seed to achieve stable target binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In HrAgo1, guide RNA nucleotides g2-g6 are pre-ordered in an A-form-like helical conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>). Remarkably, HrAgo1 simultaneously possesses structural features related to guide RNA ordering that are typically observed in either AGOs or in PIWIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). HrAgo1 is AGO-like in that it uses contacts in the g5-g6-binding loop (H738 and the main chain amide of R746) to organize guide nucleotides g5–g6, and is also PIWI-like in that helix-7 is tilted away from the seed, leaving g7–g8 disordered. Tilting of helix-7 in HrAgo1 may be attributed to the presence of a loose “seed-gate” structure (residues Phe333-Gln354), also present typically found in PIWIs, but more stretched in AGOs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In PIWIs, the seed-gate structure has been proposed to enable extended target probing at positions g5-g9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Overall, HrAgo1 structure pre-organizes guide RNA in a manner more similar to AGOs, while showing features similar to PIWIs that may influence its target binding.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>HrAgo1 displays a unique hybrid mode of target binding</title><p id="P14">To investigate the target RNA binding kinetics of HrAgo1, we performed a single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Guide and target RNAs were labeled with Cy5 and Cy3 dyes respectively so that binding of the HrAgo1-guide complex to the target gives rise to a high FRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d-f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>).

The interactions between HrAgo1 and the target became observable when the latter matches the nt 2-4 (N3) positions of the guide RNA, and the dwell time increases drastically with the increase in guide-target match length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f and 4g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). At these short match lengths, the dwell time distribution follows a simple exponential decay, similar to previous observations of hAgo2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Starting from N6, the majority of the guide-target association events of HrAgo1 and hAgo2 persist beyond the experimental time limit of 200 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). The overall binding kinetics of HrAgo1 are thus similar to the behavior of hAgo2. This contrasts EfPiwi, which only shows observable interactions with the target at a match length of N6, and shows stable binding only at N15, in agreement with structural predictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">While HrAgo1 facilitates prolonged binding for most of the guide-target pairs between N6 and N8, a notable sub-population remains only transiently bound, resembling the behavior of EfPiwi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). The appearance of a second population has been occasionally observed previously when the binding pocket of Argonaute interacts with a specific species of nucleotide in the first position of the target, e.g. deoxyguanosine by TtAgo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> and deoxyadenosine by hAgo2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. However, the two-population behavior we observe here is independent of the identity of the first target nucleotide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5b-c</xref>), suggesting that HrAgo1 intrinsically utilizes two modes of target search, i.e. an overall strong seed binding mode as observed for AGOs, and a second mode of transient seed binding akin to PIWIs. Consistent with its hybrid structural features, HrAgo1 thus facilitates a unique hybrid mode of guide RNA-mediated target RNA binding.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>HrAgo1 mediates RNA silencing in human cells</title><p id="P16">The physiological function of HrAgo1 can provide clues to the emergence and diversification of RNA silencing pathways.

In addition, vectors expressing superfolder GFP (sfGFP) and FLAG-tagged hAgo2 (FLAG-hAgo2) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The 3′ UTR of the Fluc gene has two binding sites with perfect complementarity to miR-1-1, which allows Ago-mediated silencing of Fluc expression. To monitor miR-1-1-guided Fluc silencing, we performed qPCR to measure the relative expression level between target Fluc mRNA and the control Rluc mRNA. Remarkably, cells in which miR-1-1 and HrAgo1 were co-expressed, showed a significant (p&lt;0.01) decrease in the Fluc/Rluc mRNA ratio compared to cells in which the sfGFP control was co-expressed with miR-1-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Moreover, the level of post-transcriptional repression by HrAgo1 was comparable to that of the hAgo2 without significant difference. This demonstrates that HrAgo1 is capable of RNA silencing in human cells. Furthermore, the use of a dsRNA hairpin precursor to supply guide RNAs suggests that HrAgo1 can accommodate guide RNAs generated by the canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway involving the Microprocessor complex and Dicer.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">In this study, we explored the diversity of Asgard archaeal Argonautes and characterized HrAgo1, an eAgo-related asAgo. This extends our understanding on the evolutionary origin and diversification of pAgos as well as their relation with eAgos.

Our global phylogenetic analysis shows that asAgos exhibit a striking diversity including new, deep-branching subclades basal to Long-A, Long-B, and short pAgos. Asgard archaea may thus have been the donors of pAgos HGT for various bacterial and archaeal lineages, which adopted different types of guide and target nucleic acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The molecular basis underlying the differences in guide/target specificity among pAgos, as well as between pAgos and eAgos, is yet unclear.

These properties of HrAgo1 also provided a unique opportunity for us to gain insights into the diversification of AGO and PIWI at the molecular level. Based on our comparative analyses of structural and single-molecule FRET data between HrAgo1 and different eAgos, we hypothesize that the common ancestor of AGO- and PIWI-clade eAgos had a g5-g6 pre-organizing loop, while its helix-7 did not embrace g7-g8. AGOs kept and further refined the g5-g6 organizing loop, while repositioning helix-7 to enable g7-g8 pre-organization, allowing strong target association at short matching lengths to facilitate post-transcriptional silencing of a multitude of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. The structure of HrAgo1 suggests that early-branching PIWIs kept the g5-g6 loop, while later-evolved PIWIs lost it, giving rise to the more relaxed targeting preferences of metazoan piRNAs that enable defense against evolving genomic threats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">As HrAgo1 is positioned basal to the PIWI subclade while no stable sister clade of the broader eAgo clade has been identified, the exact evolutionary origin of eAgos and their associated pathways remains to be resolved. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that some candidate asAgos (e.g. subclade 9 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>) may be the closest relatives to all eAgos, though with weak phylogenetic support. Another defining feature of eAgos that differ from all characterized pAgos so far is their associations with dedicated RNA guide generation mechanisms, such as Dicer-based dsRNA processing pathway known to provide guides for AGOs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> and Zucchini-based ssRNA processing pathway for metazoan PIWIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. We found that <italic>hrAgo1</italic> is flanked by genes encoding RNaseIII/dsRBD domain-containing Rnc and DExD/H domain-containing Helicase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). These domains are found in the eukaryotic Dicer and Dicer-like proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, which suggests that the neighboring genes of hrAgo1 may adopt a guide-generating system that processes dsRNA. While the molecular mechanisms of these proteins require further experimental validation, we did find multiple examples of <italic>rnc-asAgo-helicase</italic> gene associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>); additional associations may have been missed due to fragmented genome assembly. Notably, syntenic associations where Rnc and asAgos are consecutively encoded on the same DNA strand are only found in the HrAgo1 clade and asAgo subclade 9 phylogenetically close to eAgos, which provides an additional support for their close relation to eAgos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Combined, our analyses provided new clues to the origin of eukaryotic RNA silencing pathways. Previous pan-eukaryote analyses have implicated that LECA likely encoded RNA silencing machineries comprising an AGO, a PIWI, a Dicer, as well as an RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp), which partners with Dicer in some physiological contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The evolutionary paths leading to the emergence of such an RNA silencing pathway in LECA was, however, unclear. Existing models posited that RNA silencing most likely emerged after eukaryogenesis based on two main observations: 1) archaeal pAgos previously found to be closest to eAgos performed DNA-guided DNA cleavage, contrasting the RNA-guided RNA cleaving eAgos, 2) the RNaseIII domains and Helicase domains of Dicer appeared to have respectively originated in bacteria and archaea, suggesting that they were likely combined after eukaryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Our data in this study shows that both RNA-guided RNA cleaving Argonautes and the <italic>rnc-ago-helicase</italic> genomic association exist in one Asgard archaeon. We have not found RdRp in the Asgard archaea. Based on these findings, and combined with the fact that Asgard archaea are the closest known prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes, we propose a new hypothetical model for the evolutionary origin and diversification of eukaryotic RNA silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). In this model, the eAgo-like RNA-guided RNA cleavage mechanism emerged among the Asgard archaea Argonautes, and formed genomic associations with genes encoding Rnc and DExD/H Helicase, leading to a primordial RNA silencing pathway. Gene rearrangements, duplication, and fusion occurred during the dynamic genome evolution around the period of eukaryogenesis, giving rise to Dicer-like proteins with different types of domain combinations similar to those found in extant eukaryotes. During eukaryotic lineage expansion, dsRNA processing by Dicer was specialized to provide guides for AGOs, while distinct guide-generating pathways, such as the piRNA pathway, developed to provide guides for PIWIs (at least in Metazoa). Structural divergence occurred in adaptations to the specific functions executed by these specialized pathways, such as the loss of g5-g6 seed pre-organization in PIWIs.</p><p id="P22">The physiological functions of HrAgo1 or other asAgos in their native organisms are yet undetermined due to the inability to cultivate Ago-encoding Asgard archaea.
