Despite improvements to patient outcomes over recent years, most of these have been observed in patients under 60, due to generally poorer tolerance of chemotherapy in older patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] and the significant cytogenetic heterogeneity between patients’ disease, the latter of which making it challenging to develop effective targeted therapies. As such, novel targeted therapies which can successfully eliminate pathogenic AML cells in stratified groups of patients are necessary.</p><p id="P6">Epigenetic modifiers have been characterised as having key roles in the pathogenesis of AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. The histone lysine demethylase 4A (KDM4A), which regulates transcriptional activity via demethylation of histone 3 lysine residues, including 9, 27 and 36, has been characterised as a ‘master’ regulator of AML cell survival mechanisms. Massett <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that genetic depletion of KDM4A or small molecule inhibition of KDM4 family proteins was detrimental to AML cell survival, while sparing healthy/normal haemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Supporting this, other studies showed that small molecule pan-inhibition of KDM4 and KDM6 family proteins was detrimental to cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, another member of the KDM family, KDM1A, was shown to be essential for the survival of AML cells driven by MLL-AF9, a leukaemogenic gene fusion product, through maintenance of a pro-oncogenic transcriptional signature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. There is also value in exploring the transcriptional mechanisms downstream of KDM4A, to understand its mechanisms of oncogenesis and identify novel targetable leukaemogenic pathways, which may support the development of novel precision medicine approaches; for example, for stratifying patients that have differing responses to KDM4A inhibitors or demethylase-targeting therapies.</p><p id="P7">The Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) family consists of five members, in which NFATc1-4 proteins function downstream of calcium signalling, while NFAT5 is responsive to osmotic stress. Physiologically, inactive NFAT proteins reside in the cytoplasm in a heavily phosphorylated state, and activation of calcium-coupled surface receptors triggers a signalling cascade via phospholipase C (PLC), which promotes calcium influx and subsequent dephosphorylation of NFAT, primarily by the phosphatase calcineurin. Dephosphorylated NFATs then translocate to the nucleus, where they bind DNA as a monomer and activate transcription; the most well-characterised example of this being at the IL-2 promoter in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. However, their role in myeloid cells has received limited attention. NFAT expression is downregulated during the differentiation of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs towards mature myeloid cells, and different NFAT family members have been found to have divergent roles in cell fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] and regulation of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. There is also growing evidence that NFAT signalling can enable therapy resistance in myeloid leukaemias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and enable AML development, such as in AML cells with the internal tandem duplication in FLT3 (FLT3<sup>ITD</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. In this study, we identified the <italic>NFATC2</italic> promoter as a novel binding and transcriptional target of KDM4A. We used genetic knockdown (KD) and global sequencing approaches in human AML cell lines, including a number of cytogenic AML subtypes, to characterise novel mechanisms of <italic>NFATC2</italic>-regulated oncogenic maintenance in AML, indicative of a putative targetable mechanism for further study.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P8">The suspension cell lines THP-1, HL-60, MV4-11, MOLM-13, Kasumi-1 (all ATCC; RRIDs: CVCL_0006, CVCL_0002, CVCL_0064, CVCL_2119, CVCL_0589, respectively) and OCI-AML3 (DSMZ; RRID: CVCL_1844) were cultured in HEPA-filtered incubators at 37°C and with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, in RPMI supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 10-20% (V/V) FBS, as recommended by the supplier.

The roles of NFATs in cell cycle regulation are well-described; for example, pan-NFAT inhibition using cyclosporine A (CsA) led to increased proliferation of the myeloid compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], indicating a cell cycle-suppressive role for NFATs in these cells. Consistent with this, constitutively active <italic>NFATC2</italic> exhibited a pro-arrest and pro-apoptosis phenotype in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. This is contrary to our finding, which implies that <italic>NFATC2</italic> maintains cell proliferation in the THP-1 model.</p><p id="P40">Cyclin D1 is a well-known regulator of the G1-to-S transition in the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] and so our finding of <italic>CCND1</italic> downregulation after <italic>NFATC2</italic> KD is consistent with the arrest phenotype in this context. Elsewhere, NFAT-binding DNA motifs have been characterised within the <italic>CCND1</italic> promoter, and NFATc1, specifically, has been demonstrated to regulate <italic>CCND1-</italic>mediated proliferation in vascular tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]; a relationship between <italic>NFATC2</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic> has not yet been described, to our knowledge. However, <italic>CCND1</italic> downregulation was not significantly demonstrated prior to 144 hr post-puromycin selection, despite <italic>NFATC2</italic> being downregulated at the 48 hr timepoint, which suggests that the <italic>NFATC2–CCND1</italic> relationship is not the result of direct transcriptional activity. To support this, <italic>CCND1</italic> was not found to be an NFATc2-bound gene from the ChIP-seq data and, as such, there are likely to be intermediate regulatory players which we have not characterised here.</p><p id="P41">The regulation of <italic>CCND1</italic> is complex; its expression and activity are dependent on epigenetic regulation, transcription factors, post-translational modification, and degradation, as covered in several reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. However, in the THP-1 model, we demonstrated that both OE and KD of <italic>NFATC2</italic> either increased or decreased cell expansion, respectively, suggesting that <italic>NFATC2</italic> has a rate-limiting effect on the cell cycle, for which <italic>CCND1</italic> may be a critical factor. In contrast, effects on cell expansion were not observed in MOLM-13 cells with either <italic>NFATC2</italic> OE or KD. While THP-1 and MOLM-13 cells share an MLL-AF9 rearrangement, there are some key mutational differences (e.g., THP-1 carries <italic>FLT3<sup>WT</sup></italic>, MOLM-13 carries <italic>FLT3<sup>ITD</sup></italic>), highlighting the importance of the mutational profile-specific context to the observed mechanism(s).</p><p id="P42">The heterogeneity of NFAT activity is partly due to their interactions with a myriad of transcriptional partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], which depends on the cell-specific signalling landscape. For example, transcriptional complexes formed by NFAT(c1-4) and AP-1 heterodimers leads to the integration of calcium and MAPK signalling pathways at the DNA-binding level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Such complexes may also be drug-targetable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], which could enable the targeting of NFAT complexes in AML cells where a specific combination of signalling pathways is activated. We identified significant enrichment of c-Myc targets within <italic>NFATC2</italic> transcriptional targets, in addition to co-enrichment of c-Myc and NFATc2 DNA-binding targets, via our sequencing experiments. These data suggest that c-Myc could be a transcriptional partner of NFATc2, by which they form DNA-binding complexes to regulate pro-oncogenic signalling, akin to NFAT:AP-1 complexes.</p><p id="P43">To support this hypothesis, <italic>MYC</italic> KD in THP-1 cells phenocopied <italic>NFATC2</italic> KD, as cells displayed reduced proliferation with evidence of G1/S phase arrest and <italic>CCND1</italic> downregulation, in addition to loss of colony-forming capacity. However, we found that <italic>MYC</italic> OE in THP-1 was accompanied by NFATc2 upregulation, but not vice versa, which suggests that the <italic>NFATC2</italic> is likely a transcriptional target of c-Myc itself; this would be useful to explore with further ChIP-Seq with c-Myc complex precipitation. While our evidence suggests likely DNA co-binding of NFATc2 and c-Myc at common loci, there appears to be a <italic>MYC–NFATC2</italic> regulatory axis which may contribute to the observed effects, and the underlying relationship is more complex.</p><p id="P44"><italic>MYC</italic> has ubiquitous cellular functions and has been characterised as a pro-leukaemogenic oncogene in AML; for example, it may drive drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] and its expression can be prognostic for patient outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. It can also be targeted therapeutically using inhibition of upstream BET signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. c-Myc has not been described as a transcriptional partner of NFATc2 previously, although one study has shown NFATc2 to upregulate <italic>MYC</italic> by binding its promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]; while we did not find this from ChIP-seq or <italic>NFATC2</italic> OE experiments, the context of this study was in non-AML cells.</p><p id="P45">In addition, we identified genes which regulate oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) as enriched in <italic>NFATC2-</italic>regulated and NFATc2-bound genes, in THP-1 cells. In support of this, the genes which were in the GSEA leading-edge subsets common to both sh<italic>NFATC2</italic> constructs for the overlaps between ‘MYC_TARGETS_V1’, ‘HALLMARK_OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION’, and also ChIP-seq binding sites, were primarily mitochondrial, and clustered together using STRING analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p id="P46">OxPhos is a highly complex respiratory process with many components (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]) and often cancer cells are described as being more dependent on glycolysis than OxPhos (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]), while some studies have shown AML cells to be vulnerable to inhibition of mitochondria-dependent respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. We functionally demonstrated that <italic>NFATC2</italic>, but not <italic>MYC</italic>, OE led to an increase of mitochondrial superoxide levels in THP-1, suggesting that there is a role for <italic>NFATC2</italic> in maintaining mitochondrial activity. In addition, it is known that the accumulation of ROS can drive mutagenesis in AML cells (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]), which could support a hypothesis that <italic>NFATC2</italic>-driven superoxide accumulation is an enabling mechanism for further leukaemogenesis and may have a role in AML progression.</p><p id="P47">The results from <italic>NFATC2</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic> KD are less clear, though there may be a trend towards downregulated superoxide with either KD. From these data, a role for <italic>MYC</italic> in OxPhos cannot be discerned directly, although it may have some input via its maintenance of <italic>NFATC2</italic> expression. Furthermore, despite the enrichment of mitochondrial complex IV genes in the NFATc2 DNA-binding targets, there was no change in complex IV protein quantity observed with either <italic>NFATC2</italic> KD or OE, suggesting that <italic>NFATC2</italic> is not a rate-limiting factor in terms of mitochondrial or, specifically, complex IV synthesis.</p><p id="P48">Clearly the role(s) of <italic>NFATC2</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic> in OxPhos and, more generally, mitochondrial function require further characterisation in future study, and these data underpin a rationale for doing so. THP-1 cells have been demonstrated to be highly OxPhos-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], and so this model may be biased; as such, further study should expand beyond this model alone. In addition, KDM4A enzymatic activity is known to be highly oxygen sensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], which could imply that the <italic>KDM4A–NFATC2</italic> axis has specific roles (or a lack thereof) to play across the variably hypoxic environments within the bone marrow microenvironment, at the site of AML residual disease; again, more sophisticated <italic>in vitro</italic> models should be used to assess this further.</p><p id="P49">Inhibition of NFAT activation is well-established pre-clinically and clinically using drugs such as CsA, tacrolimus and VIVIT peptide, but these drugs have been associated with significant toxicity, in part due to their non-specificity towards individual NFAT isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. There are experimental compounds which can target individual NFAT isoforms by binding specific domains (Kitamura and Kaminuma, 2021) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], but these are in their infancy. As such, multi-pathway inhibition at the level of the NFAT transcriptional complex—such as the putative NFATc2–c-Myc complex—or dual upstream pathway inhibition may enable the administration of sub-toxic doses, while retaining specificity to cells with such an active oncogenic mechanism.</p><p id="P50">Consider also that this study was conducted primarily in THP-1, a cell line derived from infant AML with MLL-AF9, meaning that the results are not generalisable to patients from older cohorts or with differing molecular profiles. Although <italic>NFATC2</italic> KD impaired colony formation in two other models (HL-60 and MV4-11), the specific mechanism was not investigated here. In addition, the effects of <italic>NFATC2</italic> depletion in healthy haemopoietic stem cells should be investigated further, to determine its role in these cells specifically and the potential for a therapeutic window.</p><p id="P51">Finally, we should consider the role of KDM4A in the mechanisms identified; whether it, too, regulates OxPhos/mitochondrial function and/or <italic>CCND1</italic>, so as to identify the comparative specificity of its inhibition against that of the NFAT family. While a specific inhibitor for NFATc2 is not currently available, there are more specific KDM4 family inhibitors. Alternatively, there may be specific epigenetic markings which correspond to <italic>NFATC2</italic> transcription in AML specifically, and these should be profiled more extensively, to further identify leukaemogenic epigenetic rewiring which may represent points of therapeutic vulnerability.</p></sec><sec id="S19" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P52">In this study, we have identified <italic>NFATC2</italic> as a novel player in AML cell pathobiology, downstream of the histone demethylase <italic>KDM4A</italic>, which has previously been characterised as a master regulator of oncogenesis in AML cells, and highlighted the role of <italic>MYC</italic> as a potential co-regulatory gene. In addition, we have started delineating some putative mechanisms of <italic>NFATC2</italic>-led oncogenesis in this context, which opens avenues for further mechanistic studies and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for AML. Firstly, these cells were found to be dependent on <italic>NFATC2</italic> expression for proliferation, which was mediated by G1/S cell cycle transition and, at least in part, by <italic>CCND1</italic> expression. Secondly, <italic>NFATC2</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic> shared significantly enriched sets of transcriptional and DNA-binding targets, and NFATc2 protein was found to be downstream of <italic>MYC</italic> expression. Thirdly, oxidative phosphorylation genes were enriched in <italic>NFATC2</italic> transcriptional and NFATc2-binding targets, and a subset of mitochondrial genes were common to <italic>MYC</italic> targets also. Of note, <italic>MYC</italic> KD phenocopied <italic>NFATC2</italic> KD in THP-1 cells, together suggesting shared genomic and functional properties. However, while <italic>NFATC2</italic> expression was found to be linked with mitochondrial superoxide levels in these cells, this was not found for <italic>MYC</italic> expression, indicating divergent roles in the nuanced regulation of metabolic activity. Together, these data provide a foundation for further investigation of the novel role(s) of <italic>NFATC2</italic>, its relationship with <italic>MYC</italic>, and dual-targeting possibilities, in the context of other models of AML.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Files</label><media xlink:href="EMS191302-supplement-Supplementary_Files.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d196aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the Wellcome Trust [105614/Z/14/Z], the MRC CiC [18048], the Howat Foundation and Friends of the Paul O’Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, and the Carnegie Trust [PHD007721] for funding this project.
