A subset of targets maintain a mitotically heritable memory of prior IFNγ exposure resulting in hyperactivation upon reexposure. Here we discovered that the active chromatin marks H3K4me1, H3K14Ac and H4K16Ac are established during IFNγ priming and selectively maintained on a cluster of GBP genes for at least 7 days in dividing cells in the absence of transcription. The histone acetyltransferase KAT7 is required for the accelerated GBP reactivation upon reexposure to IFNγ. In naïve cells, we find the GBP cluster is maintained in low-level repressive chromatin marked by H3K27me3 limiting priming in a PRC2-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, IFNγ results in transient accumulation of this repressive mark but is then selectively depleted from primed GBP genes during the memory phase facilitating hyperactivation of primed cells. Furthermore, we identified a cis-regulatory element that makes transient, long-range contacts across the GBP cluster and acts as a repressor, primarily to curb the hyperactivation of previously IFNγ-primed cells. Combined our results identify the putative chromatin basis for long-term transcriptional memory of interferon signalling that may contribute to enhanced innate immunity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cells exist in a dynamic environment, where they respond to a multitude of stimuli by rewiring their gene expression programmes. While acute transcriptional activation by external signals is well understood, the longer-term cellular consequences of such signals are poorly defined. Cells can maintain a memory of past stimulation that can be inherited for multiple cell generations. Post-stimulus epigenetic memory has been characterized mostly in the context of long-term gene repression. Prominent examples include read-write mechanisms that maintain gene silencing through DNA methylation, repressive histone modifications and Polycomb complex binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. However, transient gene activation can also be memorized, known as long-term transcriptional memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Such memory of gene activation is relevant as it may alter the cellular response to future reexposure to activating signals.</p><p id="P3">Despite the existence of transcriptional memory phenomena across multiple cellular processes and species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, its molecular principles are obscure and represent an important gap in our understanding of gene expression regulation. Cellular exposure to the cytokine Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) is known to induce transcriptional memory and is an ideal model for discovering the underlying mechanisms. IFNγ induces a broad set of genes acting in inflammation, cell death, and host defence to pathogens and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In addition to the transient activation of a large number of genes, IFNγ induces long-term transcriptional memory of a subset of genes in different cell types, including innate immune macrophages, non-immune fibroblasts and cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. We and others discovered that genes that display memory tend to reside in genomic clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. One of these is a clustered family of genes encoding Guanylate-Binding Proteins (GBPs), GTPases that are crucial for inflammasome activation and protection against infections and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. While IFNγ results in only a transient activation of GBPs, cells maintain a heritable epigenetic memory of activation for up to 14 days of continued proliferation in the absence of target gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. This primed state results in hyperactivation of GBP genes upon re-exposure to IFNγ which may represent a crucial means for enhanced innate immune responses to repeated cellular insults.</p><p id="P4">To define the mechanism of transcriptional memory, we previously surveyed both trans-acting factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and chromatin features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Here, we discovered an IFNγ-induced chromatin signature associated with transcriptional memory. This includes the acquisition of unique active histone marks (H3K4 monomethylation and H3K14 and H4K16 acetylation) and selective removal of repressive modification (H3K27 trimethylation). This chromatin signature is heritably maintained post-stimulation in proliferating cells, specifically at GBP genes that show transcriptional memory. After the initial IFNγ stimulation ceases and in the absence of ongoing transcription this heritable chromatin state functionally regulates future GBP gene expression triggered by IFNγ.</p><p id="P5">Unexpectedly, IFNγ-mediated induction of gene expression causes also a cluster-wide accumulation of repressive H3K27 trimethylation at and around GBP genes during initial stimulation. Subsequently, H3K27 trimethylation is removed selectively at GBP memory genes in primed and reinduction conditions. Furthermore, we uncovered a cis-regulatory element that generates long-range interactions within the GBP cluster enhanced during IFNγ induction. While these long-range interactions are not inherited post-stimulation, the element functions as a repressor of hyperactivation of GBP memory genes.</p><p id="P6">Our results are consistent with a model where the GBP memory loci selectively retain an epigenetically inherited chromatin signature after initial IFNγ stimulation, which in turn accelerates future expression hyperactivation upon IFNγ re-exposure. GBP gene hyperactivation is restricted by a repressive cis-regulatory element forming long-range interactions that are themselves not epigenetically inherited post-stimulation. Our results have broad mechanistic implications for the understanding of epigenetic memory of gene expression triggered by past exposure to the stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Specific active chromatin modifications are established during priming and heritably maintained at GBP memory genes post-stimulation</title><p id="P7">To discover potential carriers of mitotically heritable memory of gene activation, we explored a previously established model of interferon-γ (IFNγ) gene activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. We exposed human (HeLa) cells to recurrent IFNγ stimulation (priming and reinduction) separated by days or weeks in the absence of a stimulus and continuous cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Analysis of our previously reported RNA-seq dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> revealed that the expression of the majority of IFNγ inducible genes are activated to a similar level, irrespective of whether they have been activated before, indicating no memory of prior exposure. However, a subset of genes shows hyperactivation of expression upon reinduction compared to priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>), as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The most prominent among these is the GBP family of genes, where GBP1, GBP5 and GBP4 exhibit the highest degree of hyperactivation (strong memory GBPs), while GBP2 show weak hyperactivation. Interestingly, all these GBP genes are paralogs that are proximally arranged as a gene cluster on human chromosome 1. These findings suggest that an initial IFNγ stimulation (priming) induces a primed state within this cluster that allows faster and stronger expression of GBP memory genes upon IFNγ re-exposure (reinduction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). As the genes are not expressed in the intervening period between IFNγ pulses while cells continuously proliferate, this suggests that cells maintain an epigenetic mode of transcriptional memory.</p><p id="P8">We sought to discover the mechanism driving transcriptional memory at GBP genes. We previously found that trans-acting factors including upstream IFNγ signalling, JAK kinase activity, Polymerase II occupancy and activation of the key downstream transcription factor STAT1 are not the carriers of long-term memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Similarly, cis-acting chromatin features that are associated with active gene expression, including an increase in chromatin accessibility, H3K27 acetylation and H3K36 trimethylation are only transiently associated with GBP genes but return to baseline levels upon loss of expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Given the heritable nature of gene priming, we explored changes in specific chromatin modifications based on their potential to be maintained through cell division and their association with active genes that heritably control cell fate. These include histone H3K4 mono and trimethylation and H3K14 and H4K16 acetylation as they have been canonically implicated in regulating active chromatin states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. We assessed their enrichment in chromatin by Cut&amp;Run-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> in naïve cells, during IFNγ stimulation, in the period post-stimulation (primed) and upon reinduction. While these modifications are present at basal levels in naïve cells, they accumulated at GBP promoters and bodies upon IFNγ induction and accumulated further upon reinduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>), correlating with gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The enhanced accumulation of these modifications relative to the level observed during priming at GBP genes is among the highest observed across the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Upon IFNγ removal, H3K4me3 levels are rapidly lost in primed cells, with little remaining after 2 days and reach pre-stimulation levels by 7 days post IFNγ washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). This indicates H3K4me3 is an acute, non-memorized mark associated with ongoing expression that is reset when transcription ceases.</p><p id="P11">In striking contrast, we observed different dynamics of H3K4me1, H3K14ac and H4K16ac that were all maintained in primed cells at levels above those in naïve cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). The degree of retention is the highest on the strongest (GBP1, 4, 5) relative to weak GBP memory genes (GBP2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-E</xref>) or the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). This suggests that H3K4me1, H3K14ac and H4K16ac are selectively retained on the chromatin of memory GBPs in primed cells, despite that lack of GBP expression and continuous cell proliferation for up to 7 days (~7 cell divisions). These findings suggest that the maintenance of unique active chromatin modifications post-stimulation could confer transcriptional memory and allow differential expression of memory genes to recurrent stimulations.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>IFNγ-activated GBP cluster accumulates repressive chromatin that is selectively removed from GBP memory genes post-stimulation</title><p id="P12">In addition to the propagation of active chromatin marks, the removal of repressive marks may also contribute to the maintenance of a primed state. To investigate this, we analysed the Polycomb-mediated repressive histone mark, H3K27me3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, by Cut&amp;Run-seq to assess chromatin enrichment during and after IFNγ stimulation. We find H3K27me3 is pre-established broadly across the GBP cluster in naïve cells, including intergenic regions, in agreement with the lack of GBP expression before stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-C, G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-C</xref>). Surprisingly, while H3K27me3 has a known repressive role in transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, we find it further accumulates across the cluster during priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), when GBP genes are upregulated. This broad accumulation is generally maintained over the cluster in primed and reinduction conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A–C</xref>). In contrast, H3K27me3 is locally depleted from gene bodies and proximal promoters of strong memory genes (GBP1, 2, 4, 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). At these genes, loss of H3K27me3 is initiated after IFNγ priming and is maintained during memory and further depleted during reinduction. Genome-wide analysis reveals that the selective loss of H3K27me3 in primed and reinduction conditions is the most prominent at GBP memory genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Furthermore, we observed that the limits of this repressive domain coincide with previously reported TAD borders around the GBP cluster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). H3K27me3 enrichment at GBP cluster overlaps with a B compartment as defined by HiC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and shows overall higher levels compared to the cluster-wide active modifications, H3K14ac and H4K16ac (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). Such observation suggests that GBP cluster resides in a generally repressive chromatin domain.</p><p id="P14">To determine how repressive chromatin relates to active chromatin features at the GBP cluster we compared H3K27me3 with the H3K14ac mark within the same experiment as the latter is efficiently maintained at IFNγ-primed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). Analysis 4 hours post IFNγ stimulation shows that both H3K14ac and H3K27me3 are already accumulated above naïve levels indicating that chromatin reorganization is rapid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-G</xref>). Over the course of IFNγ activation, we observed a gradual increase in H3K14ac and a gradual local loss of H3K27me3 at GBP memory genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-G</xref>). The quantitative changes in chromatin structure may result either from a cell-autonomous gradual increase of target gene expression and/or an increase in the fraction of IFNγ-responsive cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we find that while during priming both H3K27me3 and H3K14ac accumulate on memory GBP genes, in primed cells, their local occupancy becomes antagonistic, where the highest H3K14ac peaks overlap with regions of local H3K27me3 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-D</xref>). This inverse enrichment is further extended during reinduction. These results suggest that while initially co-enriched, active and repressive chromatin modifications at the GBP cluster occupy locally distinct chromatin regions during the memory phase. The combined maintenance of active chromatin and selective removal of repressive modifications could underpin the transcriptional memory of GBP genes.e</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The writers for H3K14ac &amp; H3K27me3 are functionally required for GBP gene expression and memory</title><p id="P15">To assess the functional requirement for the active retention of active chromatin and local loss of repressive histone marks in transcriptional memory at GBP genes, we depleted the writers for these marks in the context of IFNγ priming and memory. First, we targeted the H3K14ac writer, KAT7 (also known as MYST2/HBO1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> as this mark is strongly maintained in the primed state, post-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). To minimize off-target and indirect effects we transiently depleted KAT7 with two distinct siRNAs (KAT7 siRNA-1 and -2) during the memory phase, directly comparing naïve and primed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We assessed the expression level of GBP memory genes (GBP1, 4, 5) and non-memory controls (STAT1, IRF1) and KAT7 by a Real-Time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B. C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">As expected KAT7 depletion generally results in downregulation of all tested genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). However, while the loss of expression of GBP memory genes was modest during priming, KAT7 depletion resulted in a stronger downregulation during reinduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, C, J</xref>). The stronger requirement for KAT7 during reinduction is specific for memory GBP genes as non-memory IFNγ-inducible controls (STAT1 and IRF1), showed a similar degree of downregulation in either condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). While we cannot exclude indirect effects, these results suggest that KAT7 and its catalytic product H3K14ac are functionally required to promote GBP memory gene expression, particularly during reinduction. This conditional dependency is consistent with the post-stimulus H3K14ac retention and high enrichment in primed and reinduction states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Next, we targeted EZH1/2, the methyltransferases of the PRC2 complex that generate the repressive H3K27me3 mark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. To target this complex with high temporal control we took advantage of a selective small molecule inhibitor (EZHi – UNC1999)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> in an experimental regime similar to that of KAT7 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). EZH1/2 inhibition resulted in the upregulation of all tested genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E, F</xref>), consistent with its known role in gene repression. Interestingly, the upregulation of GBP memory genes is much stronger during priming than reinduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E, F; Fig</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A, B</xref>). In contrast, non-memory IFNγ target genes showed no significant upregulation compared to mock (STAT1) in either condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A, B</xref>). These results indicate that EZH1/2, likely through its product, H3K27me3, represses the expression of GBP memory genes, particularly during priming. This conditional dependency is consistent with the high enrichment of H3K27me3 in the GBP cluster in naïve cells and during priming. In primed cells and upon reinduction, H3K27me3 is largely depleted, consistent with a minor functional role for EZH1/2 in expression at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A–C</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Combined our manipulation of KAT7 and EZH1/2 suggests that both the active and repressive chromatin dynamics we observed during priming and memory are functionally required for GBP expression and memory of the primed state.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Small molecule screening identifies putative regulators of IFNγ-induced transcriptional memory</title><p id="P19">To discover any other potential regulators of IFNγ priming of GBP genes, we screened a subset of the Epigenetic Chemical Probe Library from the Structural Genomics Consortium’s (SGC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> containing 21 small molecules targeting chromatin modifiers. To assess these compounds, we built an IFNγ expression and memory reporter cell line in which we included GFP as part of the endogenous GBP1 mRNA, expressed as a separate polypeptide, fatefully reporting GBP1 expression in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4C</xref>). Next, we treated these cells with the indicated SGC compounds before IFNγ activation of the GBP1 reporter and screened for GFP fluorescence by high throughput microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4C</xref>). While most compounds did not significantly affect IFNγ induction of GBP1-GFP we identified SGC0946 (inhibitor for DOT1L – H3K79 methyltransferase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> as a putative hit that leads to enhanced GBP1-GFP expression during IFNγ activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4D</xref>). We also observed a small, but significant, GBP1-GFP downregulation with NVS-MLLT-1 ((inhibitor for MLLT1 – chromatin reader component of super elongation complex)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and SGC6870 (inhibitor for PRMT6 – arginine methyltransferase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We also identified UNC1999, the inhibitor for EZH1/2 in this screen validating our earlier RT-qPCR results on EZHi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4D, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D-F</xref>).</p><p id="P20">We then explored the potential role of the positive hits (DOT1Li and EZHi) in priming and reinduction. Furthermore, to assess whether the effect of KAT7 depletion on GBP expression shown above is specific, we also included an inhibitor for p300 (p300i), an acetyltransferase for H3 and H4 distinct of KAT7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, and an inhibitor for G9a (G9a-i), a methyltransferase for repressive H3K9 methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. We measured GBP1-GFP expression during priming and reinduction following drug treatments by FACS which allowed us to score a large number of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). We found that treatments with DOT1Li and EZHi increased GBP1-GFP fluorescence in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H, I</xref>). In contrast, inhibition of G9a did not alter GBP1-GFP expression, suggesting that GBP expression is selectively dependent on Polycomb-mediated repressive chromatin and not H3K9 methylation or its writer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). Similarly, inhibition of p300 led only to a small, but significant, change in GBP expression, suggesting that the histone acetylation installed by KAT7 is selectively required for GBP expression rather than p300-mediated acetylation such as H3K27Ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">;Fig. 3H</xref>). Importantly, in agreement with RT-qPCR results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D-F</xref>), we observed a higher degree of GBP1-GFP upregulation in priming than reinduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H, I</xref>) upon EZH1/2 inhibition, confirming that the H3K27me3 and/or EZH1/2 are key limiting factors, particularly during GBP priming.</p><p id="P21">In sum, by small molecule screening, we identified EZH1/2, but also DOT1L, as a potential repressor of GBP expression memory genes during IFNγ stimulation. These findings suggest that, in addition to the repressive role of H3K27me3 described above, DOT1L or its catalytic products H3K79me1/2/3 may contribute to GBP cluster control, although this requires future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>A cis-regulatory element controls gene repression across the GBP cluster</title><p id="P22">Further analysis of the distribution of active and repressive chromatin modifications revealed their accumulation not only at GBP genes themselves but also at intergenic regions across the cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). This suggests that the GBP genes and the surrounding chromatin domain may be regulated globally across the cluster by a common control element.</p><p id="P23">To discover such elements, we compared the enrichment of H3K4me1, H3K14ac, H4K16ac with the binding of the key IFNγ-induced transcription factor STAT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.

Similar to GBP gene promoters, these elements also exhibit removal of H3K27me3 in primed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>) and generally display similar chromatin landscape dynamics throughout IFNγ priming regime as GBP memory genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B, C</xref>).</p><p id="P24">To determine the functional relevance of these putative cis-regulatory elements, we generated CRISPR knock-out lines for E1 and E2 and analyzed the consequences for IFNγ priming and reinduction of GBP genes by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).

While loss of E1 does not have a significant effect on GBP expression, E2-1 and E2-2 showed a marked upregulation of GBP memory genes, primarily upon reinduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). To confirm these results and exclude clonal heterogeneity, we subcloned a monoclonal line from the <italic>E2-2</italic> population and subjected it to a full IFNγ stimulation regime alongside wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). In agreement with the polyclonal lines, we find that loss of E2 results in strong upregulation of memory GBP genes, selectively during IFNγ reinduction while its contribution to initial priming is modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). This effect is specific to strong memory GBP genes (GBP1, 4 and 5) as STAT1 is not affected and weak memory control GBP2 is only marginally affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C, D</xref>).</p><p id="P25">In sum, we discovered that the E2 cis-regulatory element is a transcriptional repressor of GBP genes, not only of the proximal GBP5 gene but across the GBP cluster including distant loci (i.e. GBP1).

To explore this possibility, we employed Capture-C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, a modified HiC-type chromosome conformation capture method allowing unbiased assessment of all chromatin interactions from a selected genomic viewpoint. We designed specific hybridization probes to isolate the E2 locus following <italic>in vivo</italic> crosslinking, fragmentation and self-ligation to identify distal chromatin interactions. We also isolated a Cohesin-enriched locus upstream of GBP6 (labelled CH-C) that we previously identified as a repressor of the GBP memory genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. We performed Capture-C in the context of the IFNγ stimulation regime and found that both E2 and CH-C loci broadly engage chromatin, selectively within the GBP cluster across all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). The boundaries of these interactions coincide with previously identified Cohesin-enriched sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> and TAD borders in naïve Hela cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.

Both the E2 and CH-C loci show enhanced engagement with virtually all genes and loci tested within the cluster. However, these contacts are transient and occur only during IFNγ activation and are reset in primed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Consistent with this, we find no memory of long-range contact resulting in a similar degree of long-range engagement of E2 and CH-C with the GBP cluster upon reinduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P28">We validated these Capture-C results by conventional 3C-qPCR experiments.

Yet, paradoxically, we identified a novel cis-regulatory element that represses GBP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). We next explored how the GBP cluster can be strongly activated despite the repressive effect of the E2 element. As E1 and E2 are STAT1 transcription factor-bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) we expected these elements to produce non-coding RNAs as commonly found at enhancer elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Indeed, we detected ncRNAs by RT-qPCR specifically upon IFNγ activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>) and used these as a readout of the activity of these elements. Importantly, both cis-regulatory elements show hyperactivation during IFNγ reinduction compared to priming (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>), indicating they exhibit transcriptional memory, similar to GBP memory genes.</p><p id="P31">We hypothesized that the GBP genes and the E1 and 2 elements are activated with different kinetics allowing GBP genes to be rapidly activated but their expression curbed at a later stage. To test this, we performed a timecourse experiment in which we assessed the expression of both E1 and E2 as well as GBP genes at an early (4h) and later (24h) timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). We confirmed that both E1, E2 and GBP genes show transcriptional memory with enhanced expression upon re-exposure to IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). However, they show a striking difference in the dynamics of activation. The GBP memory genes, while poorly expressed during priming, show a very rapid activation upon reinduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Already at 4 hours of IFNγ, primed cells show much higher expression than at any time during priming. In contrast, the E1 and E2 elements showed a marked delay in reactivation. At 4 hours both E1 and E2 are expressed at levels much lower than their priming levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). These results indicate that the cis-regulatory elements exhibit a delay of IFNγ-mediated transcriptional activation compared to GBP memory genes.</p><p id="P32">Interestingly, when comparing the chromatin signatures of E1 and 2 with that of GBP genes we observed that the cis-regulatory elements exhibit a marked loss of H3K4me1, H3K14ac, H4K16ac relative to the levels established during priming whereas GBP genes maintain these marks to levels similar or even higher than those established during IFNγ priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C, D</xref>), consistent with their more rapid reactivation upon IFNγ reinduction. H3K27me3 was lost from both E1 and GBP genes in primed cells and upon reinduction. However, we noticed that the E2 element does not show such a pronounced loss of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C, D</xref>), suggesting that E2 maintains a more repressive chromatin signature.</p><p id="P33">Overall, the delayed expression of the E1 and 2 elements, weaker maintenance of active chromatin marks and the retention of repressive H3K27me3 at E2 may explain how GBP memory genes can initially ‘escape’ from its repressive function.</p><p id="P34">We hypothesise that at a later stage during IFNg re-exposure, the E2 element acts to curb GBP activation, preventing excessive hyperactivation. To test this, we turned to our GBP1-GFP reporter and monitored GFP expression during the 24-hour of priming and reinduction by IFNg by live-cell imaging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). Consistent with our earlier FACS readouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), GBP1-GFP is activated to modest levels during priming but hyperactivated during reinduction of previously primed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8D</xref>). We scored the number of cells that either activated GBP1-GFP to levels observed during priming or showed hyperactivation of GBP1-GFP unique to primed cells. We observed that the number of cells expressing GBP1 during priming gradually increases over the 24-hour period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7H</xref>). In contrast, in primed cells the number of cells that hyperactivate GBP1, while initially increasing, plateaus after approximately 10 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7H</xref>). This temporal dynamics is consistent with the expression dynamics and chromatin status of the cis-regulatory elements in the GBP cluster whose delayed activation allows initial rapid GBP induction but limits later hyperactivation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P35">Long-term transcriptional memory phenomena have been observed in species ranging from yeast to plants to humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.

Despite its strong epigenetic nature, the molecular basis for what carries this memory has remained elusive.</p><p id="P36">We have now identified a set of chromatin modifications (H3K4me1, H3K14ac, H4K16ac) that are established on the GBP gene cluster which shows strong transcriptional memory. These marks are maintained for at least 7 days during which cells undergo multiple rounds of genome duplication and cell division. Importantly, these marks are associated with promoting transcription yet are maintained in the absence of detectable target gene expression making them putative carriers of memory. Their stable maintenance in proliferating cells in the absence of the initial trigger, suggests active propagation allowing the re-establishment of these chromatin modifications post-replication. Read-write mechanisms engaging in a feedback loop have been described for repressive marks such as Polycomb-mediated H3K27me3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, H3K9 methylation at heterochromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, as well as for DNA CpG methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P37">Specific active chromatin modifications including those we identified here, are reported to be locally maintained on mitotic chromosomes, constituting ‘mitotic bookmarks’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. This behaviour is consistent with a role as mediators of transcriptional memory. However, how they engage in readwrite feedback to avoid dilution during cell division remains unclear and is an important future direction of inquiry. Furthermore, our results are also consistent with the previously identified role of H3K4me1 in enhancer priming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> indicating this mark can be stably maintained.</p><p id="P38">In addition to the maintenance of active chromatin, we find that the PRC2 mark H3K27me3 is established across the GBP gene cluster during priming. It is unclear why strong transcriptional activation of the GBP cluster results in the recruitment of both active as well as repressive chromatin. This repsonse may be part of a mechanism to limit the otherwise strong and rapid activation of IFNγ targets. This is consistent with our finding that limiting PRC2 activity, that is responsible for H3K27 methylation, results in GBP hyperactivation. Importantly, H3K27me3 repressive chromatin is selectively depleted from memory genes and maintained at a low level in primed cells. The failure to re-establish H3K27me3 following IFNγ priming may be important to the priming of GBP genes. We propose that transcriptional memory is a consequence of the combined maintenance of active marks with the selective loss of repressive marks established during priming.</p><p id="P39">Furthermore, we identified a novel cis-regulatory element within the GBP cluster that makes extensive contacts with GBP genes across the cluster during IFNγ gene activation. These long-range contacts are not themselves inherited which indicates they are a consequence rather than the cause of transcriptional activation. Importantly, we discovered that the E2 element exerts a repressive effect on GBP expression, particularly during extended exposure to IFNγ reactivation. The E2 element has the signatures of an enhancer that is bound by the STAT1 transcription factor and generates RNAs during activation, yet, in the context of GBP expression, it acts as a repressive element. IFNγ target genes are proinflammatory and GBP gene expression has been shown to affect cell viability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. We postulate that the E2 element is important to prevent excessive GBP activity, particularly in cells already primed by IFNγ. We previously identified a Cohesin-bound boundary element of the GBP cluster that we found to have a similar repressive effect on GBP hyperactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Possibly E2 and this boundary element cooperate in this function. How these elements exert their repressive effect on GBP expression remains an open question.</p><p id="P40">In summary, our findings suggest that transcriptional memory is mediated by a balance of unique active and repressive chromatin modifications that are differentially inherited in IFNg-primed cells, resulting in memory of prior IFNg exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>).

DNA digestion was performed with DpnII restriction enzyme (NEB) and religated with T4 DNA HC ligase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Removal of residual proteins and RNA was performed by Proteinase K (Ambion) and RNase A (Thermo Fisher Scientific) treatments, according to the manufacturer’s protocols. DNA was purified with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol and ethanol, according to the published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Sample yield and quality were assessed by gel electrophoresis, Qubit BR dsDNA assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Real-Time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses performed on genomic, digested and re-ligated controls. For RT-qPCR assays, each final 3C sample was diluted to 25 ng DNA per reaction. Ct values were normalized according to the published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> with primer efficiency determined computationally from amplification efficiency per PCR cycle using LinReg software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> and amplification of E2 or CH-C baits within digested fragment set as a loading control.

IFNγ activation results in GBP transcription, and increased long-range interactions between the cis-regulatory elements, cluster boundaries and genes. It further results in establishing activating chromatin in part by KAT7, but also a further elevation of repressive chromatin mediated by PRC2. In the primed state, transcription is lost but active chromatin is selectively retained and mitotically heritable while suppressive H3K27me3 chromatin is locally depleted from GBP genes. This allows rapid and strong reactivation of GBP genes upon re-exposure to IFNγ. The cis-regulatory element acts to repress GBPs across the cluster preventing hyperactivation by IFNγ.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS192872-f008"/></fig></floats-group></article>
