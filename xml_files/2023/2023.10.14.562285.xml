Sea robins are unusual “walking” fishes that use leg-like appendages to navigate the seafloor. Here, we show that legs are <italic>bona fide</italic> sense organs that mediate the unique ability to localize and uncover buried prey. We then probe the developmental and physiological basis of these novel sense organs as a striking example of a major trait gain in evolution. We find certain sea robin species have legs with unique end-organs called papillae that mediate enhanced mechanical and chemical sensitivity to enable predatory digging behavior. Papillae exhibit dense innervation from touch-sensitive neurons, noncanonical epithelial taste receptors, and chemical sensitivity that drives predatory digging behavior. Using a combination of developmental analyses, crosses between species with and without papillae, and interspecies comparisons of sea robins from around the world, we demonstrate that papillae represent a key evolutionary innovation associated with behavioral niche expansion on the seafloor. These discoveries provide a conceptual framework for understanding how molecular, cellular, and tissue-scale adaptations integrate to produce novel organismic traits and behavior.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">The evolution and diversification of novel traits enables adaptive behavior and expansion into new ecological niches. Yet, there are few examples that connect the molecular and developmental origins of a major trait gain with its physiological, behavioral, and ecological relevance. One remarkable example of trait gain is the “leg”-like appendage found within the family of fishes known as sea robins (Triglidae). Legs consist of six independently controlled, detached pectoral fin-rays used for “walking” and are thought to facilitate predation of food sources concealed beneath the seafloor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Indeed, sea robins are so adept at finding prey that other fishes follow them to steal otherwise undetectable potential food sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. By exploring this largely unstudied system, we made several serendipitous discoveries which define sea robin legs as novel sense organs that mediate species-specific functions suited to distinct behavioral niches.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Sea robins use sensory legs for digging</title><p id="P4">Anecdotal stories of sea robins’ ability to find buried prey are common in the fishing community, but this behavior has not been examined experimentally. To test this ability, we developed a simple behavioral assay in which sea robins (<italic>Prionotus carolinus</italic>) were housed in a controlled tank with either mussels or capsules containing crude or filtered mussel extract buried in sand without visual cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary movie 1</xref>). Sea robins alternated between short bouts of swimming and walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and appeared to “scratch” at the sand surface with their legs while walking, which we hypothesized represented sensory behavior. Indeed, sea robins regularly found all buried prey-related items but did not uncover control capsules containing sea water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), consistent with previous physiological evidence that the legs of some sea robins respond to chemical, tactile, and proprioceptive stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. To determine if leg sensation facilitates predatory digging behavior, we tested whether the leg nervous system transduces specific cues that evoke sensory behavior. Using electrophysiological recordings from spinal nerves that innervate legs, we found that distal legs were robustly mechanosensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, e</xref>). Furthermore, legs responded to prey extracts and common tastants for fish such as small non-polar L-amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, and other amine and imine molecules including D-amino acids, methylated amino acids, and GABA-related compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). We also measured responses to compounds typically associated with nociception, such as TRP channel agonists, which elicited slower response kinetics compared with tastants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Based on this physiological profile, we repeated behavioral experiments using capsules containing single molecules that evoke leg neural activity. Remarkably, sea robins successfully located capsules containing only single leg agonists such as L-alanine, betaine, or D<sub>2</sub>-aminobutyric acid (D<sub>2</sub>ABA), but not TRP channel agonists or inert compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). These results demonstrate that leg chemosensitivity for tastant-like molecules contributes to predatory behavior and suggest that legs could function as sensory organs.</p><p id="P5">How do sea robins use their legs to sense prey if they are covered by sand? Chemicals released by prey would need to diffuse through sand and accumulate at sufficient surface concentration for sensation. To understand the limitations of detection, we developed a mathematical model that describes diffusion in sand over a spatial scale that depends on time and the physicochemical qualities of stimuli emanating from buried prey sources. Using values consistent with our behavioral experiments, we found that stimulus sources must be concentrated and shallow to reach the surface without being significantly diluted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). To test this prediction, we asked if sea robins could find mussels buried at varied depths and concentrations. As expected, the success rate of capture sharply decreased with depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). Furthermore, sea robins were successful at finding capsules containing leg agonists ranging from 1 mM to 100 mM, corresponding with micromolar surface concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). Thus, sea robin legs detect buried chemical sources using near-surface cues at micromolar concentrations, consistent with their benthic ecology and leg chemosensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Digging sea robins have specialized legs</title><p id="P6">During the course of behavioral experiments, we accidentally obtained a second species of sea robin, <italic>Prionotus evolans,</italic> which also has legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Remarkably, we found that <italic>P. evolans</italic> failed to find buried mussels, squid, or crabs, despite consuming the same prey when visibly presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Based on these observations, we conclude that <italic>P. carolinus</italic> is a robust digging species while <italic>P. evolans</italic> is non-digging and uses its legs for locomotion and probing visible prey. Considering the prominent role of sensory legs in digging behavior, we wondered whether interspecies behavioral differences reflect leg specialization. To our surprise, we observed striking macroscopic differences in leg morphology between the two species. The distal legs of digging <italic>P. carolinus</italic> were shovel-shaped and covered in epithelial protrusions similar to papillae found on tongues and along the gastrointestinal tract of many animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In contrast, non-digging <italic>P. evolans</italic> legs were rod shaped, lacked papillae, and instead exhibited broad, shallow ridges in regions corresponding to papillae-covered surfaces in <italic>P. carolinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Based on these morphological differences, we hypothesized that papillae are specializations that facilitate digging behavior.</p><p id="P7">Leg papillae resemble sensory structures such as taste bud-containing oral papillae and mechanosensory papillae found on the facial regions of animals ranging from birds to star-nosed moles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, leg papillae lacked markers for canonical chemosensory cell types such as those in taste buds, solitary chemosensory cells, and olfactory receptor neurons, which we could readily detect in other sea robin tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1b-f</xref>). Instead, the only putative sensory cells we observed within papillae were free nerve-endings that permeate the distal leg epithelium in both <italic>P. carolinus</italic> and <italic>P. evolans</italic>. Nerve endings were densely concentrated within individual papilla in <italic>P. carolinus,</italic> but distributed along the broad ridges of <italic>P. evolans</italic> legs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Consistent with established function of free nerve endings, the distal legs of both sea robin species were sensitive to strong mechanical stimuli. However, papillae-covered surfaces of <italic>P. carolinus</italic> exhibited enhanced touch sensitivity that could reflect an adaptation that allows digging species to differentiate among objects, textures, or motion in sand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Chemical stimuli are required for sensory digging behavior, so we next wondered whether chemosensitivity is distinct in digging sea robins. Whereas digging <italic>P. carolinus</italic> exhibited robust responses to common appetitive chemicals like L-amino acids, non-digging <italic>P. evolans</italic> legs were insensitive and instead only responded to a subset of chemicals, including nociceptor-associated molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Remarkably, dose-response experiments revealed that the legs of digging sea robins were ~100X more sensitive to L-amino acids than non-digging species, consistent with behavioral results and limitations of stimulus diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Thus, enhanced chemical sensitivity in <italic>P. carolinus</italic> legs is associated with the ability to localize buried prey.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Molecular and cellular basis of sensory adaptation</title><p id="P9">What are the molecular and cellular mechanisms of enhanced chemosensation in digging sea robins? Free nerve endings are typically associated with mechanosensation and chemesthesis (thermal, nociceptive, and tactile sensations)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, but not the detection of appetitive stimuli like the amino acids that elicit digging behavior. Early retrograde tracing of nerve endings in legs demonstrated that neuron cell bodies reside in dramatically enlarged spinal dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which connect to six novel spinal cord lobes that are specific to each leg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This is consistent with leg nerve responses to sensory agonists including the common tastant L-alanine, and the Piezo mechanoreceptor agonist Yoda1, which induced responses with kinetics similar to those recorded from nociceptor agonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). To characterize cellular properties, we dissociated and cultured functional sensory neurons from the specialized ganglia of digging <italic>P. carolinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Whereas isolated neurons responded to Yoda1, the nociceptive TRP channel agonist carvacrol, and depolarizing high-extracellular potassium, we did not record measurable responses to appetitive leg agonists such as L-alanine. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c, d</xref>). Furthermore, most neurons exhibited mechanical stimulus-induced currents that varied in kinetics, suggesting a diversity of mechanoreceptor subtypes which is indicative of specialized somatosensory function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Thus, we conclude that sensory ganglia neurons mediate leg responses to touch and nociceptor-associated molecules but not to appetitive chemicals.</p><p id="P10">We next analyzed the molecular basis of sensory leg function. Consistent with mechanosensitivity of legs and the sensory neurons that innervate them, leg ganglia from both species exhibited enriched expression of the mechanosensitive ion channels <italic>piezo1</italic> and <italic>piezo2</italic> but did not express chemoreceptors for appetitive molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Both <italic>piezo</italic> channels colocalized with the sensory neuron marker <italic>trpv1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g, h</xref>) and <italic>piezo1</italic> transcripts were particularly enriched in neurons that innervate legs compared with those from pectoral fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g, h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>), suggesting that <italic>piezo1</italic> may serve an unappreciated role in environmental sensation in fishes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Considering that the leg-specific, enlarged dorsal root ganglia of both species contain sensory neurons expressing similar mechanosensitive ion channels, we conclude that mechanosensation across species shares a common molecular and cellular basis and suggest tissue-level adaptions (papillae versus ridges) underly species-specific mechanosensory properties.</p><p id="P11">If sensory neurons are not responsible for appetitive chemosensation, we wondered if this modality could be mediated by noncanonical sensory cells within the leg epithelium. To determine whether specific leg regions are specialized for chemosensation, we used a split-recording chamber and found that only the papillae-covered distal leg was responsive to appetitive chemicals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We then exploited this anatomical specialization to identify candidate chemoreceptors using comparative transcriptomics from distal versus proximal legs. Strikingly, the taste receptor <italic>t1r3</italic> was the single most-upregulated receptor in the distal leg epithelium of digging <italic>P. carolinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). At the cellular level, we observed robust and specific epithelial localization of <italic>t1r3</italic> mRNA within the tips of papillae, which specify sensory leg function of digging sea robins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). T1r3 is canonically expressed in the specialized receptor cells of oral tastebuds, where it forms obligate heterodimers with T1r1 or T1r2 to mediate sensation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data 3a</xref>). Indeed, we also detected expression of <italic>t1r2</italic> in papillae epithelial cells, albeit at lower levels, suggesting expression of functional heteromeric taste receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In contrast, we did not detect taste receptor expression in the legs of non-digging <italic>P. evolans</italic>, consistent with insensitivity to most common tastants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). To determine whether the selectivity of sea robin taste receptors matches leg physiology and behavior, we heterologously expressed <italic>P. carolinus</italic> receptors in HEK293T cells and measured responses to chemical agonists. Remarkably, we found that co-expression of T1r2 and T1r3 mediated robust responses to the same L-amino acids that distinguish digging <italic>P. carolinus</italic> chemosensitivity from that of non-digging <italic>P. evolans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data 3b,c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Thus, papillae are molecularly defined polymodal sensory structures that specialize sea robin legs to support adaptive digging behavior.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Leg sensory organs as a major trait gain that enables novel behavior</title><p id="P12">To further interrogate the role of papillae in digging behavior we examined their function in three contexts: (1) sea robin ontogeny; (2) interspecies F1 hybrid animals; and 3) across the diverse phylogenetic tree of sea robins. Larval sea robins hatch without legs and are initially pelagic. Then, legs separate from pectoral fins during the first three weeks of development as the animals settle to the sea floor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). While observing this transition we discovered that <italic>P. carolinus</italic> lacked papillae during the first five weeks of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Strikingly, <italic>P. carolinus</italic> began to localize and dig up prey at a stage coinciding with papillae formation, suggesting that the presence of papillae facilitates digging behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Next, we considered the pattern of inheritance in crosses of hybrid animals with distinct parental traits. Crosses of digging <italic>P. carolinus</italic> males with non-digging <italic>P. evolans</italic> females produced viable offspring that could be raised through the stage of leg-separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Hybrid animals developed legs that possess papillae which closely resemble the digging parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Consistent with a critical role in sensation, papillae correlated with enhanced chemosensitivity and sensory digging behavior in hybrid sea robins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5e-f</xref>). These results collectively support the hypothesis that papillae are required for sensation and predatory digging.</p><p id="P13">Finally, we leveraged the biodiversity of sea robin species from around the world to ask whether sensory specialization reflects the ancestral condition or is a recent innovation. We first used museum specimens to examine the leg morphology from a wide range of sea robin species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data 4</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed leg papillae in only a small group of sea robins comprising the closest relatives of digging <italic>P. carolinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>, <italic>red text</italic>). In contrast, the legs of many species exhibited a stick-like morphology similar to fin rays, suggesting these structures may function as simple locomotory appendages that are ancestral to more advanced sensory legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>). Guided by this analysis, we obtained and examined the physiology and behavior of two additional species, one with papillae (<italic>Prionotus scitulus</italic>) and one lacking papillae (<italic>Prionotus tribulus</italic>). Only <italic>P. scitulus</italic> exhibited chemosensory specialization and digging behavior, consistent with its leg morphology and close evolutionary proximity to <italic>P. carolinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i-k</xref>). Therefore, leg papillae are sensory specializations unique to a specific clade of sea robin species and represent a novel trait gain.</p><p id="P14">We conclude that sensory digging behavior is restricted to a small lineage of specialist fishes that have diversified legs as novel sense organs, evolving unique molecular, morphological, and functional properties in sensory end-organs at the tips. We hypothesize that sea robins initially developed fin ray-like legs for locomotion. Ancestral organs then evolved limited sensory capability to facilitate manipulation of the visible substrate in search of food. Finally, evolution of sensory papillae further specialized legs to localize and uncover buried prey. Thus, sensory papillae represent a striking example of a major trait gain within a specific lineage that allows organismal expansion into a new behavioral niche. Indeed, our companion study demonstrates that legs use developmental programs that share features with other animal forelimbs and additionally contribute to the specialization of sensory structures (<italic>Herbert, et al</italic>). Future work will leverage the remarkable biodiversity of sea robins to understand the genetic basis of novel trait formation and diversification in vertebrates by focusing on molecular mechanisms of fin ray separation, adaptation of the nervous system, and acquisition of sensory properties. Thus, our work represents a basis for understanding how novel traits evolve to facilitate the lifestyles of diverse organisms across distinct ecologies.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S6"><title>Animals</title><p id="P15">Adult wild-caught sea robins (<italic>Prionotus carolinus</italic> and <italic>Prionotus evolans</italic>) were provided by the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA, and kept on a 12 hr light/dark cycle in natural sea water.
