One potential source of new gene regulation is mobile DNA, which can sometimes drive the expression of genes near its insertion site in a genome through outward-directed promoters. However, we do not know how frequent this ability is, nor how frequently mobile DNA may evolve such promoters <italic>de novo</italic>. Here we address these questions for the insertion sequence family IS3, the most abundant family of a simple form of prokaryotic mobile DNA. First, we estimate that at least 30% of IS3 sequences harbor outward-directed promoters. Second, we combine high-throughput mutagenesis with a massively parallel reporter assay to show that single point mutations suffice to create outward-directed promoters in all the IS3 sequences we studied. We found that in 5.6% of 18’607 mutant IS3 sequences, promoter activity emerged de novo. Promoters preferentially arise at emergence hotspots in each IS3 sequence. These hotspots overlap with promoter motifs that already exist or are newly created by mutation. One common route to promoter activity is gaining a -10 box downstream of an existing -35 box, which we call “Shiko Emergence.” Overall, we show that mobile DNA has a high latent potential to drive new gene expression. This makes mobile DNA ideal for domestication by its host organism. It also raises intriguing questions about how this potential has evolved.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Mutations that affect gene regulation have led to many evolutionary adaptations and innovations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, from antibiotic resistant pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> to the limbless body plan of snakes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.

In one key study, de novo CREs emerged repeatedly under directed evolution in specific locations within three randomly generated DNA sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. These observations and theoretical work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> suggest the existence of DNA hotspots that readily evolve CRE activity. However, beyond anecdotal evidence, we do not know how frequent such hotspots are, and what constitutes a hotspot for de novo CRE emergence.</p><p id="P4">De novo CREs can also emerge from mobile DNA, by fortuitously encoding transcription factor binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> or <italic>outward-directed promoters</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> – CREs that transcribe genes adjacent to a mobile DNA’s genomic integration site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In eukaryotes, many young CREs originate from remnants of mobile DNA called short-interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) and long terminal repeats (LTRs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. A subset of CREs called enhancers have also been demonstrated to originate from SINEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> in humans, cows, and dogs. This mode of origin is not rare: Some 44% of primate-specific enhancers may have been co-opted from mobile DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">In prokaryotes, the simplest and most abundant kind of mobile DNA is the insertion sequence (IS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. It consists of a gene encoding transposase – responsible for its mobility – that is flanked by direct and terminal inverted repeats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. ISs fall into multiple families. One especially abundant family is the IS3 family, with hundreds of known members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. In multiple directed evolution experiments, an IS3 member with an outward-directed promoter repeatedly integrated at key genomic locations to selectively increase the expression of various genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">The cis-regulatory potential of the IS3 family is unknown, because it remains unclear whether IS3s commonly possess outward-directed promoters, and how easily mutations in ISs can create de novo CRE activity. Here, using a combination of computational analysis and experimental validation on selected IS3s, we first estimated that at least 30% of known IS3 family members encode outward-directed promoters. We then introduced more than 18’000 mutations into parts of five IS3s that do not already drive outward-directed gene expression and assessed the ability of these mutations to create CRE activity. We found that for each of the five IS3s, de novo CRE activity can emerge from single point mutations. We additionally identify hotspots within these IS3s where CRE activity is most likely to emerge, noting that most hotspots overlap with promoter motifs or regions where mutations form a new promoter motif. Overall, our results suggest that mobile DNA has a high latent cis-regulatory potential, begging the question how this potential evolved.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>IS3s are enriched with outward-directed promoter signatures</title><p id="P7">Four IS3 family members have been serendipitously observed to have outward-directed promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. However, it is unclear how frequent outward-directed promoters are among the more than 700 characterized IS3 sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. To find out, we first used established computational tools called position-weight matrices (PWMs) to identify protein binding sites in DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). Briefly, PWMs are statistical representations of all possible DNA sequences (“sites”) a protein can bind to, based on experimentally validated binding sequences. A PWM encodes the frequencies of allowed nucleotides at each position of a binding site as a logarithmically transformed score in information-theoretical units (bits)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Given a query DNA sequence, we can use PWMs to assess whether the query exceeds a threshold of similarity to known protein binding sites, in which case we classify the query as a binding motif.</p><p id="P8">A canonical prokaryotic promoter contains two AT-rich sites called the -35 and -10 boxes spaced 14-17 base pairs (bp) apart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. These boxes bind a subunit of RNA polymerase called the σ<sub>70</sub> factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. We used PWMs for the -10 and -35 boxes to search for promoters in 706 IS3 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>) and refer to any positive match as a promoter signature (see methods). We found 2’209 such promoter signatures, 1’428 of which (~65%) occurred on the bottom strand of DNA.</p><p id="P9">To locate these promoter signatures in the 706 IS3s, we partitioned the total length of each IS3 sequence into 20 equidistant bins (median length 63.5 bp), and counted the promoter signatures in each bin across all 706 IS3s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>). We found that on both strands, promoter signatures are significantly non-uniformly distributed across the IS3s (K.S. test, top strand p=9.61x10<sup>-5</sup>, bottom strand p=0.0112, Methods), because the distal-most 10 percent of IS3s – the region where functional outward-directed promoters can occur (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>) – contain more promoter signatures than the rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We then asked whether this distribution of promoter signatures could occur by chance alone, given the sequence composition of our IS elements. To answer this question, we scrambled each of the 706 IS sequences within each bin, searched for promoter signatures, and plotted their locations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1a,b</xref>) (Methods). We found no significant difference between the mean number of signatures per bin in the wild-type vs. the scrambled sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1c</xref>) (two-tailed t-tests, top: p=0.752, bottom: p=0.161). Overall, this analysis demonstrates that the non-uniform distribution of promoter signatures results from the DNA sequence composition of ISs.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>At least 30% of IS3s encode outward-directed promoter activity</title><p id="P11">To validate our computational predictions experimentally, we randomly selected five IS3s with predicted outward-directed promoter signatures, and five predicted not to have outward-directed promoter signatures. We then synthesized 120 bp from the termini of these sequences that include the promoter signature (if present), cloned them into a fluorescence reporter plasmid (pMR1), transformed <italic>E. coli</italic> with the resulting plasmid, and measured fluorescence with a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, FACSAria III). We compared the fluorescence levels to both a control that lacked an insert in the plasmid entirely, and another that encoded a promoter oriented in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>) (see methods).</p><p id="P12">We found that all tested IS3s (5/5) predicted to have outward-directed promoters indeed drove reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref>). Two of the five IS3s not predicted to have outward-directed promoters also exhibited higher fluorescence than both controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1e</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that the promoter signatures we identified within 150 bp from the ends of IS3s indeed constitute outward-directed promoters. Based on our data, we estimate that ~19% (413) of the identified 2’209 signatures are outward-directed promoters. They occur on 215 IS3 sequences. Given our low false positive rate, we thus estimate that at least ~30% (215/706) of all IS3s may encode outward-directed promoters. This number may be an underestimate, because our experiments also reveal a high false negative rate for promoter prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1e</xref>). That is, computational analysis fails to identify promoter signatures for some IS3 sequences that actually drive gene expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Promoters readily emerge from non-regulatory mobile DNA</title><p id="P13">Because all mobile DNA is continuously exposed to mutation pressure during its evolution in a host genome, we wished to find out if and how mutations can create promoters de novo in IS3s without outward-directed promoter activity. To choose an appropriate size of IS3 DNA fragments for mutagenesis, we first performed an experiment that inserted a functional promoter at varying positions across an IS3 backbone, and asked whether this promoter could drive detectable gene expression of an adjacent reporter gene. This experiment shows that the promoter needs to occur within 150 bp from the reporter gene to drive detectable expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>). This observation motivates our choice to study de-novo promoters that originate from the ends of IS3 sequences, because only from there can they drive ectopic gene expression.</p><p id="P14">We amplified five 150 bp sequences from the ends of three <italic>E.coli</italic> IS3s without detectable promoter activity, which we call 1L, 1R, 2R, 3L, and 3R (see methods), and refer to them as parent sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4a</xref>). We pooled these parent sequences, and created from them a deep mutational scanning library of daughter sequences via error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>). We cloned this library into the pMR1 plasmid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, and transformed it into <italic>E.coli</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The pMR1 plasmid encodes a gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) on the top strand, downstream of each mutagenized IS fragment, and a gene encoding a red fluorescent protein (RFP, mCherry) on the bottom strand, upstream of each mutagenized IS fragment. The pMR1 plasmid thus allowed us to simultaneously measure promoter activity resulting from mutations on both strands of the IS3s.</p><p id="P16">To measure reporter expression driven by each daughter sequence, we used Sort-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>). Specifically, we separated bacterial cells with a cell sorter (BD Biosciences, FACSAria III) into four fluorescence bins according to whether their daughter sequence drives no, low, medium, or high fluorescence. We sequenced the plasmid inserts from the subpopulation of each bin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>). We performed Sort-Seq in three technical replicates (r1, r2, r3), calculating a fluorescence score for each sequence and triplicate that ranged between one (no expression) and four (highest expression) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>). We report the fluorescence score of each sequence as an average over these triplicates. This average score strongly correlated with the score from each technical replicate (Pearson R, GFP: R<sub>mean:r1</sub> = 0.93, R<sub>mean:r2</sub> =0.95, R<sub>mrean:r3</sub> = 0.94. RFP: R<sub>mean:r1</sub> = 0.94, R<sub>mean:r2</sub> = 0.95, R<sub>mean:r3</sub> = 0.95) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>) (see methods).</p><p id="P17">This massively parallel reporter assay identified 18’607 unique daughter sequences, with a mean of 3’721 daughter sequences per parent sequence (1L = 3’162, 1R = 6’354, 2R = 4’130, 3L = 3’027, 3R = 1’934) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>). The daughter sequences harbored a median of 2.0 point-mutations (standard deviation 1.18) relative to their respective parent. Despite this small number of mutations, every parent gave rise to multiple daughter sequences with active de novo promoters. More specifically, we discovered 1’047 daughter sequences (5.6%) that showed promoter activity. Of these, 584 (~3.1%) expressed GFP (top strand), and 472 (~2.5%) expressed RFP (bottom strand). The strength of de novo promoters follows a broad tailed distribution, with many more strong promoters emerging than would be expected from a normal distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Parent sequences substantially differ in their potential to evolve new promoters</title><p id="P18">We then asked whether promoters emerged with equal likelihoods among the different parent sequences. To answer this question, we computed for each parent sequence the probability <italic>Pnew</italic> that mutations create a new promoter, and did so separately for promoters emerging on the top and the bottom strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d,e</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We found that <italic>P<sub>new</sub></italic> varied 11.5-fold among parent sequences, from <italic>P<sub>new</sub></italic>=0.02 to <italic>P<sub>new</sub></italic>=0.23. In addition, promoters are 1.2-fold (584/472) more likely to emerge on the top (GFP) strand than on the bottom (RFP) strand. For the parent sequence with the lowest <italic>P<sub>new</sub></italic> (sequence 2R), 11% and 2% of daughter sequences drove new expression on the top and bottom strands respectively. Conversely, for the parent sequence with the highest <italic>P<sub>new</sub></italic> (3R), 23% of daughter sequences drove new gene expression on the top strand and 3% on the bottom strand. Thus, relative to the other parent sequences, some parent sequences are biased towards evolving promoter activity, while others are biased against evolving promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d,e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The frequency of de novo promoters and their strengths increases with the number of mutations</title><p id="P20">We next asked how the strength of a de novo promoter is related to the number of mutations in the daughter sequence harboring it. To this end, we grouped the daughter sequences into categories encoding 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more (4+) mutations, and calculated the frequencies of the different promoter strengths from each category (none, weak, medium, and high) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2f</xref>). The frequency of daughter sequences encoding promoters increased with the number of mutations (1 mutation: 7.8%, 2: 8.2%, 3: 9.9%, 4+: 14%). The vast majority (~96%) of daughter sequences with only a single mutation and a new promoter drove weak expression, and fewer than 1% drove high expression (none: 2’855 daughter sequences, weak: 233, moderate: 8, high: 2).</p><p id="P21">Conversely, for emergent promoters with 4+ mutations, 69% of the promoters produced weak expression and 11% high expression (none: 1’080, weak: 117, moderate: 35, high: 18). Thus, both the frequency of de novo promoters and the frequency of strong de novo promoters increases with the number of mutations.</p><p id="P22">Because single mutations are more frequent than double, triple etc. mutations, they arguably provide the easiest evolutionary route to new promoters. To better understand how single mutations creating new promoters are distributed within daughter sequences, we generated genotype-phenotype maps for all 1’549 daughter sequences that differed only by a single mutation from their respective parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1g,h</xref>) (3L = 300, 3R = 303, 1L = 323, 1R = 278, 2R = 345). This figure once again illustrates that the vast majority (~96%) of promoter-creating mutations produce weak promoters.</p><p id="P23">Because weak emergent promoters are so widespread in the single mutants, we first focused our analysis on them. To start, we found that with one exception, these mutations are uniformly distributed throughout each sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4a</xref>). The exception is the parent sequence 3R(+) (K.S. test, p-value = 0.007), in which a cluster of weak-promoter-originating mutations exists in the final 50 bp of the parental 3R(+) sequence.</p><p id="P24">The parent sequences have an average AT-content of ~54.9% (3L: 54.0%, 3R: 50.7%, 1L: 56.7%, 1R:61.3%, 2R: 50.0%), which is higher than that of the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome (~50.8%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Because the -35 and -10 box consensus sequences are also AT-rich (<monospace>TTGAAA</monospace> and <monospace>TATAAT</monospace> respectively), we hypothesized that weak promoters often emerge by increasing the binding scores for either -35 or -10 boxes. To test this hypothesis, we calculated the changes in PWM scores of both -10 and -35 boxes before and after each mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4b,c</xref>). We found that -10 box scores are ~1.5 times (14.2% vs 9.3%) more likely to increase when a single mutation creates a weak promoter than when it creates no promoter (chi-squared test, 4 d.f., p = 0.014). We refer to the latter class of mutations as <italic>promoter-neutral</italic>. In contrast -35 box scores are not more likely to increase when a mutation creates a new promoter than when it does not (weak promoters: 12.8% vs promoter-neutral: 14.1%). Additionally, for promoter-creating mutations, -10 and - 35 box scores did not change 72.5% and 74.7% of the time, respectively. For promoter-neutral mutations, -10 and -35 box scores did not change 78% and 66.2% of the time. Overall, these observations suggest that single mutations that create weak promoters do sometimes but not always exert their effect through canonical promoter motifs.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Mutual information identifies promoter emergence hotspots</title><p id="P25">We next asked whether some regions within parent sequences may be biased towards evolving promoter activity through any number of mutations. To this end, we calculated, for each position <italic>(i)</italic> in each parental sequence, the mutual information <italic>(I<sub>i</sub>)</italic> between the identity of the nucleotide in each daughter sequence and the level of gene expression (fluorescence) associated with the nucleotide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>)</bold>. The essence of this mutual information calculation is to divide the joint probability of a position having a particular base <italic>b and</italic> fluorescence score <italic>f</italic>, <italic>P<sub>i</sub></italic>(<italic>b,f</italic>), by the product of the individual probabilities <italic>P<sub>i</sub></italic>(<italic>b</italic>) X <italic>p</italic>(<italic>f</italic>).

The higher the mutual information at position <italic>i</italic>, the more that position contributes to fluorescence changes, revealing where mutations are likely to create new binding sites for transcription factors and σ factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>) (Methods).</p><p id="P26">The total mutual information, i.e. (<italic>I<sub>i</sub></italic>) added across all positions, indicates how likely mutations in a parent are to create promoter activity overall. This total mutual information varies substantially among parent sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d</xref>). For the five parent sequences and both orientations, the total mutual information has a median of ~0.037 bits per parent sequence. However, two parent sequences in particular: 1L(-) and 3R(+) have exceptionally higher total mutual information, with 0.405 and 0.161 bits respectively (~4.4x and ~10.9x higher than the median of all parent sequences). These sequences also have the highest promoter emergence probability <italic>P<sub>new</sub></italic> on either DNA strand (10% and 23%, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2d</xref>). In contrast, sequence 2R(-) with the least mutual information (0.00860 bits), did not harbor any emergence hotspots and had the lowest <italic>P<sub>new</sub></italic> of 2%.</p><p id="P27">Studying the distribution of mutual information within each parent sequence, we found that mutations increase fluorescence in clusters. We refer to these clusters as promoter emergence hotspots, and identified 18 such hotspots. Each parent harbored 0-4 hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5</xref>). To identify pertinent sequence signatures within each hotspot, we overlayed the mutual information with the location of PWM-predicted -10 and -35 boxes in the parental sequences. The majority (10 of 18) hotspots overlap with existing -10 or -35 boxes. This overlap can be explained by our analysis in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>, where a subset of single mutations create weak promoters by increasing binding scores of these boxes.</p><p id="P28">Sequence 3R(+) encodes both a -10 and a -35 box spaced 15 bp apart, each overlapping with one hotspot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3f</xref>). However, 3R(+) also contains an additional hotspot downstream of these boxes that is not similar to a -10 or -35 box. Because repression is a frequent mode of bacterial gene regulation, we hypothesized that this hotspot may be a repressor binding site. To test this hypothesis, we measured reporter fluorescence driven by both the wild-type 150 bp construct and a shortened version of the construct that did not contain the candidate repressor binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3g</xref>).

In 2 of 8 of these hotspots, this results in the emergence of bidirectional promoters. The strongest new promoters emerge specifically when the new -10 box is formed downstream of a preexisting -35 box, which we call Shiko Emergence.

We then demonstrated with a massively parallel reporter assay that IS3 sequences without promoter activity can evolve promoters through one or few mutations. Many such mutations occur in hotspots of promoter emergence. Multiple hotspots involve alteration or creation of -10 or -35 boxes.</p><p id="P39">The naturally occurring outward-directed promoters we identified in wild-type IS3 sequences preferentially occur at their ends (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). This preference can mostly be explained by biases in sequence composition, because it also occurs when IS3 sequences are subdivided into multiple sequence windows (bins) whose sequence is randomized. Such randomization additionally suggests that purifying selection is not removing promoters from the interior of IS3 sequences, otherwise the scrambling would have caused the incidence of such internal promoters to increase.</p><p id="P40">While most mobile DNA insertions into a genome may be deleterious, some may be beneficial because they drive the fortuitous expression of an adjacent gene. ISs that can drive such beneficial expression may be preferentially preserved in evolution. In fact, one IS3 with an outward-directed promoter is employed by its host as a mobile promoter to increase the expression of various genes during multiple directed evolution experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. ISs outside the IS3 family found in pathogenic strains of bacteria have also been used by their hosts for their mobile and outward-directed promoter activity to evolve antibiotic resistances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. These findings are also consistent with the observation that prokaryotes and eukaryotes opportunistically use mobile DNA to evolve new cis-regulatory activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The high incidence of outward-facing promoters we detect in wild-type mobile DNA suggests that the expression of adjacent genes may be beneficial or at least tolerated more often than hitherto assumed.</p><p id="P41">When subjecting multiple parental IS3 sequences to mutagenesis, we found that all of them (10/10) could evolve promoter activity from single mutations. In addition, single mutations that create new promoters are frequent. Specifically, among 1’549 IS3 daughter sequences with single point mutations, ~7.8% had acquired the ability to drive gene expression. This is important because single mutations provide the easiest route towards new promoters. Although most new promoters created by single mutations are weak, such weak expression can be an essential step towards further evolutionary adaptation if it affects a beneficial gene. We found that the incidence of strong promoters increases with the number of mutations an IS3 experiences, such that daughter sequences with four or more mutations were 24 times more likely to encode strong promoters than daughter sequences with single mutations (1.44% vs 0.06%). This means that once a weak promoter is created, further mutations and selection can easily enhance the expression strength of this promoter.</p><p id="P42">Comparing our observations with limited previous work suggests that the regulatory potential of both existing and mutated IS3 sequences is higher than expected by chance, i.e., from random sequences. One previous study synthesized 40 randomly generated 103 bp parent sequences (with a fixed GC-content of 50%), and tested their ability to evolve promoters de novo. This study found that ~10% (4/40) of random sequences already encoded promoter activity, and in ~60% (23/40) single point mutations sufficed to create an active promoter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Another study used a thermodynamic model to computationally sample the entire genotypic space of a 115 bp-long DNA sequence for constitutive promoter activity (4<sup>115</sup>~4x10<sup>69</sup> possible sequences). It estimated that ~20% of these sequences encode promoter activity, ~80% could gain promoter activity from single point mutations, and ~1.5% of all single point mutations create promoter activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P43">By comparison, IS3s are 1.5-3 times more likely (30% vs 10-20%) to encode outward-facing promoters than random sequences. In addition, 1.25-1.67 times as many IS3s (100% vs 60-80%) can evolve promoters from single mutations compared to random sequences. Moreover ~5 times as many (7.8% vs 1.5%) single mutations in IS3s create functional promoters compared to the average random sequence. Collectively, these observations suggest that IS3s may be biased towards evolving promoter activity compared to random sequences. We caution that this assertion may be confounded by differences in study designs, such as differences in the size, base composition, and number of mutations per parent sequences. However, if true, it raises the question whether natural selection played a role in creating this potential.</p><p id="P44">Mutual information has been used previously to map existing promoter architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, and our work shows that it can also help to identify potential future cis-regulatory architectures, which have been called cryptic promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, cryptic low-affinity TF binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, proto-enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, etc. Specifically, mutual information helped us to identify 18 hotspots of new promoter emergence, where mutations in our 5 IS3 sequences are especially likely to give rise to new promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P45">We found a likely explanation for promoter emergence in 13 of 18 hotspots.

The strongest new promoters emerge from these hotspots when the new -10 box lies downstream of a preexisting -35 box, a process we call Shiko Emergence. In the absence of an adjacent upstream -35 box, the new -10 box creates weaker promoters.

We tested the null hypothesis of indistinguishable fluorescence for the two categories with a Mann-Whitney U test, and corrected all p-values with a Benjamini-Hochberg correction to compute a q-value, where q&lt;0.05 indicates a significant association between gaining a -10 box and increased promoter strength at a false discovery rate of 0.05.
