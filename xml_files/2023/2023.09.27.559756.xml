Here we describe one potential therapeutic strategy which involves targeting members of the glutaminase family of mitochondrial metabolic enzymes (GLS and GLS2), which catalyze the first step in glutamine metabolism, the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate. We show three examples where GLS expression increases during coronavirus infection of host cells, and another in which GLS2 is upregulated. The viruses hijack the metabolic machinery responsible for glutamine metabolism to generate the building blocks for biosynthetic processes and satisfy the bioenergetic requirements demanded by the ‘glutamine addiction’ of virus-infected host cells. We demonstrate how genetic silencing of glutaminase enzymes reduces coronavirus infection and that newer members of two classes of small molecule allosteric inhibitors targeting these enzymes, designated as SU1, a pan-GLS/GLS2 inhibitor, and UP4, which is specific for GLS, block viral replication in mammalian epithelial cells. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of glutamine metabolism for coronavirus replication in human cells and show that glutaminase inhibitors can block coronavirus infection and thereby may represent a novel class of anti-viral drug candidates.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped viruses that contain a single positive RNA strand and “corona”-like spike proteins extending from their envelopes. Seven types of coronaviruses have been reported to infect humans. In 2019, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus triggered a worldwide pandemic, with multiple viral variants having emerged since that time. Human coronaviruses OC43 (HCoV-OV43) and 229E (HCoV-229E) are far less lethal and typically only give rise to common cold symptoms. Each coronavirus family member has a distinct spike protein and consequently binds to different receptors to enter cells. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, HCoV-OC43 engages the N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl neuraminic acid receptor, and HCoV229E interacts preferentially with human aminopeptidase (hAPN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 are members of the coronavirus beta sub-group family, while HCoV-229E is a member of the alpha sub-group. Since the onset of the pandemic, therapeutic antibodies and vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 have been developed, although each has its limitations. Thus, there continues to be a pressing need to identify new therapeutic strategies that will provide broad protection against new virus strains and mutants which are likely to emerge.</p><p id="P3">Viruses have been suggested to reprogram the metabolism of host cells to support their bioenergetic requirements for replication, raising the possibility that targeting metabolic activities essential for viral infections might offer potential therapeutic strategies. For example, there have been reports suggesting that some viruses are dependent upon glutamine metabolism for their replication and the generation of new viral particles including Kaposi-sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV), vaccinia virus (VACV), adenovirus (AD) and influenza A virus (IAV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Normal healthy cells typically utilize glucose as their primary bioenergetic and biosynthetic material, whereas, cancer cells often reprogram their metabolism by increasing the utilization of glutamine as the primary nutrient to support their TCA cycle and satisfy the metabolic requirements necessary for their high rates of proliferation and ability to survive various types of cellular stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Members of the glutaminase family of enzymes play a critical role in satisfying these metabolic requirements by catalyzing the first step in glutamine metabolism, the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate, with glutamate then being converted to α-ketoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase to enter the TCA cycle.</p><p id="P4">Two genes, <italic>Gls</italic> and <italic>Gls2</italic>, encode the glutaminase enzymes in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. <italic>Gls</italic> encodes KGA (kidney-type glutaminase) and the C-terminal truncated splice variant GAC (glutaminase C), hereon collectively referred to as GLS, which are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, while <italic>Gls2</italic> encodes LGA (liver-type glutaminase, hereon designated GLS2) and is primarily expressed in liver, pancreas, and brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. GLS has been shown to be highly expressed in various types of cancers including basal-subtype triple negative breast cancer, glioblastoma, and pancreatic cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, due to the actions of the transcription factors c-Myc and c-Jun<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> GLS2 was recently implicated in luminal-subtype breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. We and others have reported that allosteric inhibitors of GLS, including 968, BPTES, CB839, and UPGL00004 (designated as UP4 from hereon) block cancer cell proliferation<sup>18</sup><sub>’</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, with CB839 being examined in a number of clinical trials as an anti-cancer drug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">GLS inhibitors including BPTES and CB839 have also been shown to block the replication of some viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. However, thus far, it has not been demonstrated that glutamine metabolism is essential for coronavirus infection and if GLS inhibitors might be effective in blocking their replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Here we show that three members of the coronavirus family, SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E reprogram the metabolic machinery of host cells, and in doing so, cause their replication to become glutamine-addicted. In these studies, we have used different cell lines for each coronavirus based on the expression of viral binding receptors; the mouse kidney epithelial cell line VeroE6 for SARS-CoV-2 infections, the human bronchial epithelial cell line HBEC and human colon cancer HCT8 epithelial cells for HCoV-OC43, and the lung epithelial cell line MRC5 for HCoV-229E (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We then demonstrate that glutaminase inhibitors, including two new compounds (SU1 and UP4) that we have developed, represent potential therapeutic agents for blocking coronavirus infection with broad application.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Coronavirus infection induces metabolic reprogramming in host cells</title><p id="P6">Viruses induce metabolic reprogramming in infected cells, and their replication depends on biosynthetic precursors and ATP provided by the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Since glutamine supplies multiple biosynthetic pathways with carbon and/or nitrogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, we were interested to see whether coronavirus infection upregulates glutamine metabolism in primary human bronchial epithelial cells HBEC3-KT (HBEC from hereon). We therefore applied LC-MS-based targeted metabolomics to metabolite extracts from HBECs that were either uninfected or infected for 24 hours with the human beta-coronavirus HCoV-OC43. Upon infection, there was an apparent activation of glutamine metabolism, as read-out by increases in the products of glutaminolysis, namely glutamate and α-ketoglutarate, and downstream metabolites such as fumarate and aspartate (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). We also observed an increase in the levels of several nucleotides in infected cells, consistent with the known dependence of viral replication on activated nucleotide biosynthesis in host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Glutaminase expression is upregulated during coronavirus replication</title><p id="P7">Based upon the changes in glutamine metabolism caused by coronavirus infection, we examined whether glutaminase expression was upregulated when host cells were infected with HCoV-OC43. HBECs and HCT8 cells, when 80% confluent, were infected with HCoV-OC43 for 24 hours, and then the cells and their medium were collected. Western blot analyses were performed using an anti-HCoV-OC43 antibody to detect the viral nucleoprotein OC43 as a read-out for viral replication, and anti-GLS and anti-GLS2 antibodies were used to identify the two forms of glutaminase expressed in the human epithelial cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). Although GLS protein expression was relatively low in HBECs, it increased significantly (eightfold) upon HCoV-OC43 infection. On the other hand, GLS2 protein expression was not detected before or after virus infection, indicating that only GLS is involved in coronavirus HCoV-OC43 replication in HBECs. In HCT8 cells, GLS protein expression was modestly increased (1.7 fold) with virus infection, whereas GLS2 protein levels were not changed (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). However, the basal levels of both GLS and GLS2 were higher in HCT8 cells compared to HBECs, most likely because the former represents a human colon cancer cell line. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays showed that the RNA transcript levels of GLS but not GLS2 were upregulated in both virus-infected HBECs and HCT8 cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1E</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We then carried out immunofluorescence experiments in HBECs to visualize GLS expression as a function of virus infection at a cellular level. Cells were cultured in a 4-well chamber slide with 60-70% confluency, infected the next day with HCoV-OC43 as described above for 1 hour, and then incubated in fresh culture medium for 22 hours with and nuclear staining for 1 hour with NucBlue. After fixation, immunofluorescence staining was carried out using antibodies specific for either GLS or the HCoV-OC43 N protein, with the cell nuclei being visualized. Four HBECs shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H-a</xref> (blue) exhibited different levels of GLS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H-b</xref>, red) and HCoV-OC43 expression (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H-c</xref>, green). The merged images show that the virus-infected cells consistently expressed higher levels of GLS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H-d</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Next, we performed a time course for HCoV-OC43 infection of HBECs. The cells (70-80% confluent) were infected with HCoV-OC43 for 1 hour, with the cells from one plate then being collected. Fresh medium was added to the remaining plates, and additional samples of cells and their culture medium were collected after 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours of incubation at 37°C. The expression levels of the HCoV-OC43 nucleoprotein OC43 and GLS were detected by Western blot analyses from whole cell lysates (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), while qPCR was used to measure the total RNA transcript levels of GLS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>) and of viral RNA in the media (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>). OC43 and GLS expression levels in HBECs showed significant increases between 12 and 48 hours of virus infection. The increase in GLS expression followed the time course for that of the virus protein OC43 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), and the same was true for their RNA transcript levels (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>), indicating that the upregulation of GLS expression began with the onset of virus infection.</p><p id="P10">We also examined glutaminase expression in MRC5 cells infected by HCoV-229E (an alpha coronavirus). MRC5 cells at 80% confluency were infected with HCoV-229E (MOI 0.01, 1 hour, at 33°C), and then incubated for 23 hours with growth medium at 37°C.

The cells were then infected with HCoV-OC43 for 24 hours, and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting to determine GLS expression, while their medium was collected and analyzed by qPCR to detect total viral RNA. We found that HCoV-OC43 replication was reduced significantly when GLS was depleted from the cells, as evidenced by the decreased expression of the viral protein OC43 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) and the reduced amount of viral RNA (72% and 80% respectively with two shRNAs) and in the level of viral RNA transcripts in the medium (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Similar reductions in HCoV-OC43 protein expression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), and in the levels of viral RNA transcripts in the medium (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) were observed when using two independent siRNAs targeting GLS.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>GLS expression is upregulated in HBECs by c-Jun during virus infection</title><p id="P12">GLS expression in cancer cells has been reported to be upregulated either by c-Myc or c-Jun<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, and the JNK/c-Jun pathway has been shown to be activated in some infected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. To further examine how GLS expression is increased upon virus infection, HBECs were infected with HCoV-OC43 for one hour followed by a 23-hour incubation, at which point the cells were collected and Western blot analyses performed. Phospho-c-Myc, phospho-c-Jun(S63) and phospho-c-Jun(S73) were all observed to be increased after infection, as were the total protein expression levels for c-Myc and c-Jun together with the viral protein OC43 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). However, while inhibiting c-Myc did not cause a reduction in the expression levels of GLS in virus-infected host cells (HCT8) (not shown), blocking c-Jun activation using the small molecule inhibitor SP600125 reduced both GLS protein expression and the amount of viral RNA transcripts detected in the medium (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2F</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>, respectively)</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Glutaminase inhibitors block coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, HCov-OC43 and HCoV-229E replication</title><p id="P13">We next examined whether small molecule allosteric inhibitors targeting the glutaminase enzymes could impact coronavirus infection.

Both GLS expression and its specific activity has been implicated in a number of human cancers, although GLS2 has also been shown to be important in luminal-subtype breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In our studies, we have examined four different host cell lines and three members of the coronavirus family and found that in most cases GLS is essential for viral replication; however, in one host cell, MRC5, it appears that GLS2 is the glutaminase enzyme required for viral replication. The upregulated expression of GLS in cancer cells has been shown to be an outcome of either c-Myc blocking the inhibitory actions of a microRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, or through signaling pathways that result in the activation of the transcription factor c-Jun<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. For host cells infected by coronaviruses, we have found that it is c-Jun activation that upregulates GLS expression. Thus far, very little is known regarding how glutaminase activity is activated either in cancer or virus-infected cells. We and others have shown that both GLS and GLS2 activation requires that the enzyme undergoes a transition from an inactive dimer to a tetramer and then ultimately to a higher-order filament<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. The formation of activated glutaminase filaments requires both the binding of substrate and an anionic activator. Inorganic phosphate is commonly used to serve as an activator <italic>in vitro</italic>, although the concentrations required (50-100 mM) are unlikely to be achieved in most physiological settings and therefore, we are setting out to determine what type of metabolite or cofactor might serve this function in cells.</p><p id="P20">There has been a significant amount of effort devoted to developing small molecule inhibitors that target the glutaminase enzymes, given their roles in tumorigenesis. Two of the more common types of GLS inhibitors are the 968 class of molecules and the BPTES family of inhibitory compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Among the latter are CB839 and our more newly developed UP4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, which are significantly more potent than the lead compound BPTES, with CB839 being examined in clinical trials for various cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. The BPTES series of compounds bind within the interface where two GLS dimers come together to form a tetramer and stabilize an inactive tetrameric species that is incapable of forming higher order filament-like structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. The 968 class of GLS inhibitors which includes the lead compound 968 and our more potent analog SU1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> function in a distinct manner from the BPTES class of compounds, by preferentially binding initially to GLS monomers and then stabilizing both inactive dimers and tetramers. Both classes of allosteric GLS inhibitors effectively blocked coronavirus replication in HBECs, HCT8 and VeroE6 cells, as read out by the synthesis of a viral coat protein and when assaying viral RNA transcript levels, matching the effects we observed when knocking down GLS expression in host cells. However, in MRC5 cells, only the 968 analog SU1 was effective at inhibiting viral replication because of the required role of GLS2, which is relatively insensitive to UP4 and other related compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. These findings are summarized in the schematic presented in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p id="P21">Current approved anti-coronavirus drugs target proteins essential for virus replication, including RNA polymerases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, spike proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, proteases such as TMPRSS2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, and nucleocapsid proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Our work has focused on blocking the metabolic activities required to generate building blocks for biosynthetic processes and the energy supply necessary for coronavirus replication. Because the glutaminase enzymes are often much more highly expressed and activated in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> and viral-infected host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, as compared to normal healthy cells, small molecule inhibitors targeting these enzymes offer a potentially safe therapeutic strategy. Here we now show that three coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 require glutamine metabolism for their replication and are susceptible to inhibition by allosteric glutaminase inhibitors. We demonstrate how glutaminase inhibitors are especially effective at blocking coronavirus infection and that they may serve as new lead compounds toward the design of even more potent and novel anti-viral drug candidates.</p><p id="P22">Finally, our findings raise interesting questions and lines of investigation for future studies. They include determining how virus infection triggers the necessary signals to upregulate glutaminase expression and elucidating the mechanism responsible for the activation of GLS catalytic activity. It also will be of interest to establish whether glutaminase filament-like structures form within virus-infected host cells, similar to the case for cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. If so, do these higher order oligomeric structures serve as a scaffold for a metabolic complex necessary for satisfying the requirements for viral replication? Recently we showed that glutaminase inhibitors can block the ability of both GLS and GLS2 to form filaments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> and it will be interesting to see if additional strategies be designed to specifically block their formation and thus yield additional classes of anti-viral therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><sec id="S13"><title>Coronaviruses</title><p id="P23">SARS-CoV-2 WA/1 (BEI resources, cat.
