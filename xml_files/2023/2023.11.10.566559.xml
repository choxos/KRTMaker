A homozygous missense mutation (c.2006G&gt;T), resulting in an amino acid substitution (p.Cys669Phe) in the extracellular domain of β-DG, causes severe Muscle-Eye-Brain disease with multicystic leukodystrophy. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the severe human pathology, we generated a mouse model of this primary dystroglycanopathy. We find that homozygous mutant mice show no obvious abnormalities during development and reach mature adulthood. However, α- and β-DG protein levels are significantly downregulated in muscle and brain of homozygous mutant mice. The mutant mice show a form of myopathy with late-onset and not fully penetrant histopathological changes in skeletal muscle and are impaired in their performance on an activity wheel. The brain and eyes of the homozygous mutant mice appear to be structurally normal, but the localization of mutant β-DG is altered in the glial perivascular endfeet (PVE) at the blood-brain- and blood-retina barrier resulting in a perturbed protein composition in the PVE. In conclusion, the mouse model of the C669F β-DG mutation does not seem to recapitulate the severe developmental phenotypes observed in human patients but represents a novel and highly valuable tool to study the impact of β-DG functional changes at the molecular level and to gain insight into the pathogenesis of primary dystroglycanopathies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The dystroglycan (DG) protein complex is central in a number of physiological and pathological contexts, playing a particularly important role in skeletal muscle, brain and eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Adams &amp; Brancaccio, 2015</xref>). It is composed of two subunits, the extracellular and highly glycosylated α-DG and the transmembrane β-DG, which act as a molecular link forming an axis between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Ervasti &amp; Campbell, 1993</xref>). The β-DG subunit establishes contacts with dystrophin and the cytoskeleton. DG is the major non-integrin cell-extracellular matrix adhesion complex and provides stability to various tissues such as skeletal and smooth muscle and the central and peripheral nervous systems. In addition, DG is involved in the stabilization of cell-matrix interfaces such as at the neuromuscular junction, the interface between endothelial cells and astrocytic endfeet at the blood-brain barrier, podocyte-glomeruli basement membrane contacts, and at the epithelia-connective tissue border in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Barresi &amp; Campbell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bozzi <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Winder, 2001</xref>). In addition, DG plays a very early and crucial role during mouse embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Williamson <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). Mutations that disrupt the function of DG, its associated proteins or enzymes important for its post-translational maturation, lead to various forms of muscular dystrophy, which can be accompanied by distinctive eye, and brain phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bianchini <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackroyd <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Most of the DG-related muscular dystrophies result from alterations of the α-DG glycosylation shell observed in “secondary dystroglycanopathies” that are due to genetic abnormalities of glycosyltransferases involved in the glycosylation of α-DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Muntoni <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Fortunato <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Endo, 2014</xref>).

However, the exact relationship between the level of α-DG glycosylation and its pathophysiological consequences remains to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Jimenez-Mallebrera <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Although an increasing number of severe neuromuscular diseases resulting from <italic>DAG1</italic> mutations, the so-called “primary dystroglycanopathies”, have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hara <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Geis <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Özyilmaz <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dong <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dai <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), the underlying molecular basis of these diseases remains largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brancaccio, 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P4">One of the primary dystroglycanopathies results in Muscle-eye-brain (MEB) disease with multicystic leukodystrophy, a severe neuromuscular condition with brain and eye abnormalities. This primary dystroglycanopathy arises from a homozygous missense mutation (c.2006G&gt;T) resulting in an amino acid substitution (p.Cys669Phe) in the ectodomain of β-DG and has been described in two human patients (i.e. two sisters, aged 2 and 3 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Geis <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Beyond the identification of the initial carrier family and the characterization of histomorphological features (analyzed at an early postnatal stage and with no follow-up available), our previous work in transfected cell lines showed that the β-DG C667F mutation in mice (murine topological counterpart to the human C669F mutation) leads to a defective trafficking process of the entire adhesion complex, such that the complex remains mostly engulfed in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Signorino <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). No further biochemical or molecular data or follow-up of the two patients are available on this primary dystroglycanopathy, and it remains unclear how the mutation in β-DG leads to the destabilization of the whole DG complex (DGC) and to the severe symptoms observed in human patients.</p><p id="P5">To unravel the underlying mechanisms of the pathology in muscle, brain, and eyes, we generated and characterized a mouse model carrying the C667F mutation (corresponding to the C669F mutation in humans) within the ectodomain of β-DG. Our analysis shows that the mouse model of the C669F β-DG-associated MEB does not seem to recapitulate the developmental phenotypes observed in human patients, but that this mutation results in highly specific deficits in the glia-vascular unit in the central nervous system (CNS) and in late-onset histopathological changes in skeletal muscle. Taken together, our mouse model represents a novel and highly valuable tool to understand the mechanisms underlying certain aspects of the pathology of primary dystroglycanopathies and to study the impact of β-DG functional alterations at the molecular level.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animals</title><p id="P6">All mouse experiments were carried out with strict observance of protocols and guidelines approved by the University of Bonn Animal Care and Use Committee, Federal Government of Germany and European Union legislation.

Mice heterozygous for the mutation (<italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/+</sup></italic>) are viable, healthy, and fertile. Homozygous mice (<italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic>) survive to adulthood, are healthy and have no apparent behavioral phenotype in the home cage until over one year of age. Furthermore, homozygous mutants appear to be fertile (2 matings resulted in 2 litters of 2 and 4 pups, respectively). However, comparison with littermates showed that <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> males weigh significantly less than control littermates at 2 and 6 months of age, but not at 1 year of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) We also found that <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice are not born with the expected Mendelian frequency (on average only 7.63 ± 1.98 % of mice per litter were homozygous), suggesting an embryonic phenotype that results in prenatal lethality but is only partially penetrant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>DG protein levels are reduced in skeletal muscle and brain tissue of <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice</title><p id="P30">Next, we investigated whether the mutation leads to alterations in DG protein expression and processing in brain and muscle tissues. Based on our previous observations in transfected cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Signorino <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>) we expected an alteration in α/β-DG processing or trafficking and thus a potential reduction in protein levels in homozygous mice. Lysates and succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) enrichments from brain and muscle tissues were first subjected to a Western blot analysis with an antibody recognizing the core protein of both α- and β-DG. This showed that although DG was cleaved into its α- and β-subunits, α- and β-DG protein levels were substantially reduced in skeletal muscle and brain of <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice compared to wildtype or heterozygous controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D,F</xref>, <bold>S1A</bold>). We then used the anti-α-DG IIH6 antibody, which detects the glycan moiety responsible for α-DG binding to laminin and is commonly used to identify glycosylated α-DG. α-DG could be detected with this antibody in Western blot analysis of muscle and brain tissues from homozygous animals indicating that α-DG is glycosylated in <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E</xref><bold>, S1B</bold>). Thus, the C667F mutation results in reduced levels of DG but no alteration in its processing or glycosylation in the mouse model.</p><p id="P31">To investigate the mechanisms underlying the reduced DG levels we first performed quantitative RT-PCR of brain tissue to exclude that the reduced DG expression levels were due to reduced transcription of <italic>Dag1</italic>. This analysis revealed no significant difference in <italic>Dag1</italic> mRNA levels between homozygous, heterozygous, and wildtype animals (<bold>Figure S1C</bold>). In addition, analysis of polyubiquitination levels of total protein extracts from brain and muscle samples excluded hyperactivation of the proteasome-ubiquitin protein degradation pathway (<bold>Figure S1D</bold> and data not shown). Next, we investigated whether the reduced level of α-DG has an impact on signaling pathways downstream of DG-mediated cell-ECM interaction. In particular, we analyzed the pI3K/AKT pathway, and we found no differences in the ratio of pAKT/AKT between control and <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice (<bold>Figure S1E</bold>).</p><p id="P32">Given the reduced DG expression observed in Western blots of muscle and brain tissue from <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice, we next examined the effect of the mutation on DG protein localization in muscle fibers and on skeletal muscle integrity and function.

To determine whether the C667F mutation alters the localization of DG in muscle fibers, we first examined whether α- and β-DG could still be detected at the sarcolemma of muscle fibers in homozygous mice. To this end, we performed immunostaining for glycosylated α-DG, β-DG or α/β-DG core protein in conjunction with laminin on sections of the hindlimb muscle (tibialis, biceps, triceps) at multiple time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A-F</xref> and data not shown). For these and all subsequent experiments, both, heterozygous and wildtype mice were used as controls, as DG levels were not reduced in the heterozygous mice(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, <bold>S1</bold>). Immunostaining revealed that α- and β-DG were present at the sarcolemma of homozygous mice and expression was not obviously reduced as compared to controls at any of the time points analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B-H</xref> and data not shown). Localization of laminin around the individual muscle fibers was also similar in mutants and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E, F</xref>). Since the C667F mutant protein accumulates in the ER of transfected cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Signorino <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), we investigated whether α- and β-DG protein might be partially retained in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). To this end, we performed double staining for Calsequestrin (CASQ), a marker for the SR, and for either glycosylated α-DG or β-DG in muscle from 1-week and 6-months-old mice. We could not detect any obvious increase in α- or β-DG levels in the SR of the homozygous mutant mice at these stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2G, H</xref> and data not shown). These data indicate that the mutation in the ectodomain of β-DG does not result in a severe disruption of DG processing or subcellular localization during muscle development and maintenance but rather in an overall reduction of DG protein levels that was only apparent in Western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>A late-onset histopathological phenotype is observed in skeletal muscle in a subset of <italic><sub>Dag1</sub>C667F/C667F</italic> <sub>mice</sub></title><p id="P34">Given the reduction in α- and β-DG protein levels in skeletal muscle of homozygous animals we examined whether the hindlimb muscle (m.

Both, heterozygous and wildtype mice were used as controls because the muscle histology of the heterozygous mice was indistinguishable from that of wildtype mice (data not shown). One sign of muscular dystrophy and the subsequent muscle fiber regeneration is the presence of nuclei in the center of the muscle fiber. Histological analysis of 2-months-old mice did not show an overt phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B, C</xref>). However, in 6-months and 1-year-old mice we found a substantial increase in the percentage of fibers with nuclei in the central region in two of the male homozygous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Next, we performed a quantitative analysis of the muscle fiber cross-sectional area (2- and 6-months-old mice) and minimum Feret’s diameter (2-, 6-months and 1-year-old mice) in homozygous and control mice, since the degree of variability in muscle fiber size may be an indicator of muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Briguet <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). This analysis showed no significant difference in the coefficient of variation (VC) of either the cross-sectional area or of the minimum Feret’s diameter of muscle fibers in homozygous mice compared to control mice at any of the analyzed stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref> and data not shown). Even when these two measures were specifically compared between control males and males with an increased number of fibers with central nuclei, no significant difference could be detected (data not shown). Nevertheless, histograms of the minimum Feret’s diameter of mice at 6-months and 1-year of age showed a broadening and flattening of the distribution in male and female homozygous mutant mice compared to controls (<bold>Figures S2A, B</bold>).

To this end, 1-year-old control and <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mutant mice were individually housed in cages containing an activity wheel and their performance was automatically monitored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Novak <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>).

In our paradigm, we also tested for effects on movement coordination: the wheel was made more complex over time by removing individual rungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Maximum running speed, average running speed, total running time and total running distance for individual sessions or the entire dark period were compared between control and <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mutant mice for the three wheel types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3F-I</xref><bold>, S2C-H).</bold> On the regular wheel, the average and the maximum running speed per dark phase and per session were reduced in the mutants as compared to the controls suggesting that their performance was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3H, I</xref><bold>, S2F,G</bold>). The performance levels observed on the regular wheel were maintained on the more complex wheel types in both control and mutant animals, indicating that motor coordination was not impaired in the <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3F-I</xref><bold>, S2C-H</bold>).

In conclusion, these data show that 1-year-old <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mutant mice have a reduced running capacity as manifested by reduced speed compared to control mice, whereas time spent on the wheel, motivation and coordination are not overtly affected in the homozygous mutant mice, suggesting a muscle-specific phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>No obvious anatomical changes in brain or eye of <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice</title><p id="P36">Conditional inactivation of <italic>Dag1</italic> in the mouse brain results in a detachment of radial glia endfeet from the basement membrane at the pial surface of the brain and a collapse of radial glia fibers.

Thus, if this mutation in β-DG affects DG expression levels, localization or function in the developing brain, homozygous mutant mice may have anatomically altered cortical structures. However, analysis of the layers in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex using Hoechst or neuronal markers (BCL11A for cortical neurons) at different postnatal time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) did not reveal any changes in the organization of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B-E</xref> and data not shown).

To investigate whether these phenotypes are recapitulated in our mouse model, we isolated eyes at different postnatal and adult stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Histological analysis of the eyes did not reveal any overt phenotypes, except for one mouse at two months of age with cataract in one eye (1 out of 12 eyes). In this eye, the ganglion cell layer was thinner and disorganized, which is also typically observed in glaucoma which presents with a loss of retinal ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Munemasa &amp; Kitaoka, 2013</xref>). In the developing retina, DG is required to maintain the structural integrity of the inner limiting membrane (ILM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Clements <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>).

However, the intensity of the fluorescent signal for either α-DG or β-DG at the PVE appeared to be reduced in 2-months-old homozygous mutant animals compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5G, H</xref> and data not shown), and β-DG was abnormally clustered around blood vessels in the brain of <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice aged 2 months or older (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref> and data not shown). Super-resolution microscopy of lectin and β-DG revealed that the perivascular localization of β-DG (surrounding the lectin staining on the extravascular site) was lost in homozygous mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>, <bold>Movies S1 and S2</bold>). Furthermore, the DG core protein could be detected in the PVE in the molecular layer of the cerebellum in control mice, whereas it was absent in the PVE of <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Labeling with GFAP, GLT-1 (Glutamate transporter 1, also known as EAAT1), and S-100β, three proteins expressed in astrocytes, two of which (GFAP, S-100-β) are known to localize to the PVE, showed that the PVE are formed in <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Langer <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5I,J</xref><bold>, S3C</bold> and data not shown). Laminin, a component of the basement membrane between blood vessels and the PVE, was preserved in the homozygous mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>) as were the PDGFRβ-positive pericytes in the perivascular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5K</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Thomsen <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, the co-immunostaining for β-DG and PDGFRβ showed that β-DG is expressed in pericytes. In conclusion, these data suggest that the reduced presence and clustering of DG along blood vessels is likely a consequence of DG mislocalization in the PVE rather than structural changes in the PVE.</p><p id="P41">To investigate whether the altered localization of DG results in aberrant localization of other proteins important for blood-brain barrier function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), we examined the expression of Aquaporin 4 (AQP4), which is highly enriched in the PVE and plays a critical role in brain water homeostasis, at multiple time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A, C-E</xref> and data not shown). AQP4 was no longer properly localized to the PVE in homozygous mutant animals and could only be detected at very low levels around some blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6C, D</xref>). Western blot analysis of brain tissue showed that the absence of AQO4 in PVE was not caused by an overall reduction in protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that this phenotype is due to mislocalization of the water channel rather than reduced expression levels. AQP4 is anchored to the PVE membrane by components of the DGC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cherkaoui <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nicchia <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Sato <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lien <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Therefore, we next examined the localization of dystrophin (DYS) and α-syntrophin (α-SNT) at the PVE. Immunostaining showed that both proteins were no longer localized to the PVE in the <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice at 2-months of age or older suggesting that the C667F mutation results in altered interactions of β-DG with the intracellular components of the DGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6F-H</xref> and data not shown). Finally, we examined the localization of the inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel KIR4.1 (also known as KCNJ10), another important component of the blood-brain barrier that is also anchored to the PVE membrane by the DGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Jukkola &amp; Gu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fujimoto <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>).

Interestingly, AQP4, α-SNT and KIR4.1 were still localized around blood vessels in the brain of 1-week-old homozygous animals (<bold>Figures S3D-F</bold>), suggesting that DG is important for maintaining the molecular composition of the PVE during the blood-brain barrier maturation.

The glial components of the blood-retinal barrier also contain DGC-AQP4-KIR4.1 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Haenggi &amp; Fritschy, 2006</xref>) and immunostaining for the DG core protein showed its localization around blood vessels in retinas of control animals. In the retinas of homozygous animals, the DG core protein was no longer detected around blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Immunostaining for glycosylated α-DG or β-DG could not be performed because the available antibodies did not work on paraffin sections of the retina. Laminin, which is part of the basement membrane around blood vessels in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Gnanaguru <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>), was not altered in homozygous mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). Immunohistological analysis for AQP4 and KIR4.1 showed that in the retina of <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice, AQP4 was absent from the PVE at blood vessels in the superficial plexus, whereas KIR4.1 localization appeared to be normal or was only slightly reduced. In contrast, AQP4 expression persisted, albeit at reduced levels, in the PVE at blood vessels in the deep and intermediate plexus of homozygous mutant mice, while KIR4.1 was severely reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7E,F</xref>). α-SNT expression appears to be diffuse in the retina and is not restricted to the blood-retinal barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Enger <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). No difference in α-SNT localization was detected between control and mutant animals at 2- or 6-months of age (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the mutation in β-DG has distinct effects on DGC-AQP4-KIR4.1 complex formation in the PVE formed by astrocytes versus Müller glia cells, consistent with previous data suggesting that the DGC-AQP4-KIR4.1 complex differs between these two glial cell types in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Enger <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Nicchia <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S30" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S31"><title>DG expression levels and localization in the <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice and in human patients</title><p id="P43">Our results show that DG protein levels are reduced in skeletal muscle and brain of the <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice. However, the glycosylation of α-DG is not affected and the localization of α/β-DG at the sarcolemma of muscle fibers is not overtly altered in the homozygous mutant mice. This observation contrasts with the reports on human patients in whom glycosylated α-DG was no longer detectable at the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Geis <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). These data suggest that the mutation may affect the processing of the DG protein differently in humans and mice. This is supported by our observations in vitro, as in a human kidney cell line (293-EBNA) transfected with the mutant DG, the folding and structure of the α/β maturation interface was severely altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Signorino <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). While these in vitro results are inconclusive because they are based on overexpression of mutated murine DG in a non-muscle human cell type, they still support a potential difference in protein processing between humans and mice. A more pronounced reduction of DG at the cell membrane of human cells may be an important reason why an early-onset, mild dystrophic phenotype is observed in patients but not in the mouse model.</p><p id="P44">Despite these differences between mouse and human, the reduction in DG levels that we have observed in the mouse model allows us to make some considerations. Indeed, in transfected cell lines, the mutation does not seem to completely inhibit the maturation of the DG precursor into its two different subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Signorino <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). It also seems likely that some fraction of the unprocessed α/β-DG precursor would be destroyed or form aggregates (as indicated by the clustering pattern of β-DG that we observed in immunofluorescence at the PVE), which we are unable to transfer onto gels and blotting membranes. It is noteworthy that the C667F mutation leaves C711, which is thought to form an intramolecular disulfide bridge with C677 in the ectodomain of native β-DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Deyst <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Sciandra <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Watanabe <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). This is consistent with the pattern of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and proteolysis data on recombinant β-DG’s ectodomain molecules, suggesting the presence of a tightly packed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Signorino <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P45">These results are relevant in several respects. First, our data strongly suggest the presence of some sort of compensatory mechanism in the mouse <italic>in vivo</italic> that allows for the correct processing of at least part of the DG precursor. Second, the presence of a reduced amount of properly processed, glycosylated and trafficked DG appears to be sufficient for adequate DG axis function in the development and maintenance of muscle, brain, and eye. Third, while we cannot determine whether the observed phenotypes are solely due to the reduced DG levels or whether an altered structure and interaction capacity of β-DG contributes to the phenotype, it is important to note, that the DGC appears to remain intact in the skeletal muscle and is not functionally impaired in the radial glia scaffold during development but is disrupted at the blood-brain and blood-retina barrier. These results suggest tissue-, cell- and maybe even stage-specific consequences of the C667F mutation on DG function.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Late-onset signs of muscle pathology and skeletal muscle dysfunction in <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup> mice</italic>

Dystrophic muscle typically exhibits greater variability in muscle fiber diameter than wildtype muscle. In our mouse model, histograms of the minimal Feret’s diameter showed a wider spread of values in male and female homozygous mutant mice compared to controls. However, VC did not show a significant difference between <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice and controls. Despite this mild muscle phenotype, 1-year-old male and female <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice were impaired in their performance on an activity wheel. In particular, the running speed of <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice was reduced compared to controls, suggesting that muscle function was impaired, possibly as a consequence of the observed reduction in DG protein levels. In contrast, neither motivation to run nor coordination seemed to be affected in the mutant mice.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Disruption of the DGC and associated proteins in PVE at the blood-brain and blood-retinal barrier of <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice</title><p id="P47">We show that the DGC, AQP4 and KIR4.1 localization in PVE is disrupted in homozygous <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice. AQP4 is known to be critical for water homeostasis in the brain and retina. AQP4-null mice have altered barrier function of PVE in the brain and the deep plexus of the retina, decreased blood-brain water uptake and are more prone to develop a hydrocephalus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Haj-Yasein <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Verkman <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Nicchia <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>).

Loss of Dp71 in mice, a major dystrophin gene product in the adult brain and a direct interacting partner of DG, results in a strong reduction of AQP4 in PVE and a complete absence of α-SNT in the brain and an impaired blood-retinal barrier. In addition, β-DG localization in the PVE is reduced by about half in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cherkaoui <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Fujimoto <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Sene <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). Dp71 interacts with both AQP4 and KIR4.1 in cortical astrocytes and in Müller glia cells suggesting that the DGC is essential for the localization of both proteins in the PVE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fujimoto <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Sene <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P49">Taken together, the severe disruption of the molecular complexes at the PVE in brain and retina of <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> indicates that β-DG function is essentially lost in this highly specialized cell compartment of glia cells. This is in sharp contrast to the unimpaired development of the brain and retina and the mild muscle phenotype in the mutant mice suggesting that β-DG function is partially or fully maintained in these tissues or developmental stages despite the mutation.

Whether the C667F <italic>Dag1</italic> mutation also affects β-DG function at synaptic contacts in the central nervous system remains to be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Primary dystroglycanopathies and mouse models for muscular dystrophies</title><p id="P50">While numerous cases of secondary dystroglycanopathies have been described, few patients affected by primary dystroglycanopathies have been identified so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brancaccio, 2019</xref>). Besides the C669F mutation in <italic>DAG1</italic> found by Geis and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Geis et al., 2013</xref>), which inspired the present mouse model, only three other mutations have been characterized in more detail. The observed phenotypes ranged from an early-onset form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) with cognitive impairment first detected in a 3 year-old child (T192M mutation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dinçer <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hara <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>) to a mild case of muscular dystrophy with hyperCKemia in a compound heterozygous 7-year-old patient (V74I, D111N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dong <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) and a late-onset form of LGMD identified in a 64-year-old man (R776C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dai <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). As far as mouse models of primary dystroglycanopathies are concerned, the only one available so far carries the missense mutation T190M (orthologous to the human T192M), which is located within the N-terminal domain of α-DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bozic <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) and results in partially impaired glycosylation of α-DG. While this mouse model shows neuromuscular abnormalities, histological signs of muscular dystrophy (i.e., centrally located nuclei in skeletal muscle fibers) have only been reported in 21-week- and 1-year-old mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hara et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that the mouse model shows a late-onset muscular dystrophy phenotype, whereas the patient had an early onset of the disease. The effect of the mutation on the brain has not been investigated in the mouse model. Thus, both the T190M and the C667F mouse models show a discrepancy in the onset and severity of the phenotype compared to the human patients. Importantly, this discrepancy between mouse and human phenotypes it is not limited to these two models of primary dystroglycanopathies: even the paradigmatic <italic>mdx</italic> (dystrophin-less) mice, which are viable and have an almost normal lifespan, show a much milder phenotype than human Duchenne patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Putten <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Implications of the <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mouse model for the treatment of rare dystroglycanopathies</title><p id="P51">It should be noted that although the phenotype of the <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mouse model is less severe than the disease symptoms in human patients, the late onset histopathology in skeletal muscle, along with abnormalities in the PVE in the brain and retina, may well be characteristic of the mild end of the MEB disease spectrum, making this mouse model a valuable tool to study certain mechanistic aspects of this primary dystroglycanopathy. In particular, the patients with the <italic>DAG1</italic> C669F mutation present with megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Geis <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). In the vast majority of patients with MLC, the phenotype is associated with pathogenic variants in <italic>MLC1</italic> or <italic>GLIALCAM</italic>. Recently, in MLC patients without mutations in these two genes, a pathogenic variant of <italic>AQP4</italic> was discovered that disrupts the membrane localization of AQP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Passchier <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Thus, our finding that AQP4 localization to PVE is disrupted in <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mice may provide a first insight into the potential mechanisms underlying the MLC in the patients with the C669F mutation in <italic>DAG1</italic>. Thus, we anticipate that the availability of the <italic>Dag1<sup>C667F/C667F</sup></italic> mouse model for further molecular or pharmacological studies may have a biomedical impact, since mutations in DG, or in the enzymes responsible for its maturation in the so-called secondary dystroglycanopathies, are involved in numerous rare neuromuscular disorders that severely affect the lives of thousands of patients and families worldwide. An example of the impact that basic biochemical and cell biological research can have on the development of therapeutic strategies is the work on the DG-agrin interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gesemann <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">1998</xref>). Such work eventually led to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies that were developed and tested in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Moll <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Meinen <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Another potentially directly relevant therapeutic approach in the context of the PVE phenotype in our mouse model is the observation that AQP4 polarization in PVE is altered in a rat retinal injury model. This deficit can be rescued by treatment with bumetanide, an NKCC1 (Na+-K+-2Cl– cotransporter 1) inhibitor that downregulates AQP4 by interfering with the metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9)-mediated cleavage of β-DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Last but not least, a better knowledge of the DG core protein can guide the design of better antibodies, especially for diagnostic purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Humphrey <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Fortunato <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S36"><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (417960915 to S.B; SCHO 820/6-1 to S.S.), the SFB 1089 (to S.B., S.S.), the Bonner Promotionskolleg “NeuroImmunology” (BonnNi; 2020-S1-06 to R.L.T.) funded by the Else Kröner Fresenius Stiftung, and the French AFM-Telethon Pr. 20009 (“Establishing new models for primary dystroglycanopathies” to A.B.).

(A) Strategy for the development of a <italic>Dag1<sup>C667</sup></italic> (human: C669F) point mutant mouse model: the model was developed using a standard homologous recombination approach in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. A targeting vector containing the mutated exon 5 (TGC&gt;TTC) and flanking genomic regions (homology arms) was constructed and then transfected into ES cells. Neomycin (Neo)-resistant cells were screened by PCR and DNA sequencing. Positive clones were injected into blastocysts to generate chimeras. To excise the Neo cassette and generate the F1 generation (heterozygous point mutant knock-in mice), chimeras were crossed with Cre-expressing mice. Pups from the F1 generation were then screened to test for germline transmission.
