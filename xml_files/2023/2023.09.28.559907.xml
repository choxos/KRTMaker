How intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> ions bind and increase channel activity is not well understood. Analysis of K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel structures indicate that there is a large twisting of the βN-αQ loop in the intracellular RCK2 domain between the inactive and Na<sup>+</sup>-activated conformations, with a lysine (K885, human subunit numbering) close enough to form a salt bridge with aspartate (D839) in the Na<sup>+</sup>-activated state. Concurrently, an aspartate (D884) adjacent in the same loop adopts a position within 4 Å of several acidic or polar residues. In carrying out mutagenesis and electrophysiology with human K<sub>Na</sub>1.1, we found alanine substitution of each of these residues resulted in almost negligible currents in the presence of up to 40 mM intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>. The exception was D884A, which resulted in constitutively active channels in both the presence and absence of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>. Further mutagenesis of this site revealed an amino acid size-dependent effect. Substitutions at this site by an amino acid smaller than aspartate (D884V) also yielded constitutively active K<sub>Na</sub>1.1, D884I had Na<sup>+</sup>-dependence similar to wild-type K<sub>Na</sub>1.1, whilst increasing the side chain size larger than aspartate (D884E or D884F) yielded channels that could not be activated by up to 40 mM intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>. We conclude that Na<sup>+</sup> binding results in a conformational change that accommodates D884 in the acid-rich pocket, which triggers further conformational changes in the RCK domains and channel activation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Na<sup>+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sub>Na</sub>) open in response to elevation in the cytoplasmic Na<sup>+</sup> concentration, contributing to hyperpolarization of the membrane potential of neurons and other cell types. K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 and K<sub>Na</sub>1.2 (or SLACK and SLICK) are members of the large-conductance, RCK domain-containing subfamily of K<sup>+</sup> channels and are activated by intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> is an essential determinant of wild-type (WT) K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel opening, and in normal physiology K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 activity is coupled to persistent inward Na<sup>+</sup> currents, for example through re-opening voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels or NALCN channels that increase local Na<sup>+</sup> concentration above that of the bulk cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Additionally, transient currents through AMPA receptors located in the vicinity of K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 have also been implicated as a Na<sup>+</sup> source for the channel, as part of a negative-feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The importance of these channels is highlighted by the seizure disorders and intellectual disability caused by pathogenic variants in either K<sub>Na</sub>-encoding gene, <italic>KCNT1</italic> or <italic>KCNT2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). In most cases, pathogenic variants in either gene result in a missense mutation that leads to enhanced K<sub>Na</sub> channel activity, but loss of function is also found with some <italic>KCNT2</italic> variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Quinidine, bepridil, and clofilium were the first drugs to be identified as K<sub>Na</sub> channel inhibitors with bithionol, riluzone, loxapine, and niclosamide as activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Each of these drugs are non-selective and are unlikely to be of clinical use in K<sub>Na</sub> disorders. In response to <italic>KCNT1</italic> gain-of-function disorders, several groups have identified novel K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Our approach exploited K<sub>Na</sub> channels structures and targeted the pore domain in virtual high throughput screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), but it is conceivable that future structure-based screening could instead target the Na<sup>+</sup>-activation mechanism, which could improve specificity. However, the structural basis of how Na<sup>+</sup> ions interact with K<sub>Na</sub> channels and how this results in channel activation remained unknown.</p><p id="P4">Previously, residues located in the rat K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 RCK2 domain were proposed to form a Na<sup>+</sup> binding site based upon a Na<sup>+</sup> coordination motif, DXRXXH that is found in Na<sup>+</sup>-activated GIRK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Mutating D818 and, to a lesser degree, H823 diminished rat K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 Na<sup>+</sup>-activation when the channels were expressed and recorded from patches excised from <italic>Xenopus</italic> ooctyes. In general, Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity was shifted to higher concentrations for channels mutated at either site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). In human K<sub>Na</sub>1.2, mutation of the equivalent aspartate residue, D757, to arginine abolished Na<sup>+</sup>-activation in whole <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, with function rescued by application of the activator niflumic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). The structures of the chicken K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel in the closed (zero Na<sup>+</sup> conditions) and activated (high Na<sup>+</sup> conditions) conformations were since resolved by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single particle averaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), in which the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding fold proposed by Zhang <italic>et al</italic> (2010) was not evident. The region containing the proposed DXRXXH coordination motif is conserved between chicken and rat K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 but remains as a static loop in both the active and inactive conformations, as will be described below. Since Na<sup>+</sup> is too small to be identified in the cryo-EM structure, it is not known where in the channel they bind and how this results in increased channel activity.</p><p id="P5">In studying the cryo-EM structures of the inactive and active chicken K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel subunits, we identified a conformational difference between the two that we hypothesized could underlie Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent activation. Furthermore, it appeared to involve the aspartate residue identified by Zhang and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) in playing a conformation-stabilizing role. Using site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiology we identify additional residues in a nearby region that are critical for Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent activation and propose that a twisting of a loop between βN and αQ in RCK2 acts as a molecular switch that underlies K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 activation. Whilst preparing this manuscript, complementary studies on K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 Na<sup>+</sup>-binding and activation were published, involving molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) or cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), together with functional characterization. In presenting and discussing our findings we highlight where our interpretation is consistent or conflicts with the conclusions of either of these studies.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Analysis of protein structures</title><p id="P6">Structures of chicken K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 in the Na<sup>+</sup>-activated (PDB: 5U70) and Na<sup>+</sup>-free (PDB: 5U76) states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) were analyzed and figures prepared using UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).

To assist comparisons between studies of K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 clones from different species the positions of the amino acids detailed in this study in human, rat, and chicken are provided in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We hereon refer only to the amino acid numbering in human K<sub>Na</sub>1.1. The proposed Na<sup>+</sup>-coordinating motif, based on that in GIRK channels, is conserved between species and forms the loop between βL and αO in the K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 RCK2 domain. Firstly, the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding fold proposed by the molecular modelling and simulations of RCK2 of the rat K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) subunit was not observed in the cryo-EM structures of either the active (PDB: 5U70) or inactive (PDB: 5U76) chicken K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channels. Secondly there was no discernible difference between the two structures in the positioning of the sidechain of this aspartate or any of the neighboring residues previously proposed to contribute to Na<sup>+</sup>-binding (D839 in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, in the structure of the Na<sup>+</sup>-activated state, a lysine reside in the loop between βN-αQ (K885 in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) falls within 3.4 Å of the aspartate, sufficiently close to form a salt bridge. In the apo state this loop is not fully resolved, indicating mobility, but the structures suggest a near half-rotation of this loop. Consequentially, the adjacent aspartate in the same βN-αQ loop (D884 in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) adopts a position within 4 Å of several acidic or polar residues in the Na<sup>+</sup>-activated state (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), which both we and Xu and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) termed an “acidic pocket”. Specifically, the aspartate side chain is predicted to contact both E920 and T922 sidechains and the connecting peptide backbone in the βO beta sheet in RCK2 between these two amino acids. The cryo-EM structures therefore indicate that the rotation and stabilization of the βN-αQ loop is a conformational change in RCK2 upon Na<sup>+</sup> binding.</p><sec id="S8"><title>Activation of WT K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 by intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> and pharmacological activators</title><p id="P12">Guided by K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel structural data, a combination of mutagenesis and whole-cell electrophysiology was used to investigate the involvement of residues in Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent activation of the human K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel. In our hands, human K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 runs down within seconds in excised inside-out patches, leaving unitary or no currents. Therefore, to efficiently explore the effects on macroscopic K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 currents, we conducted whole-cell patch clamp recordings from CHO cells expressing WT or mutant K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 using pipette solutions with different concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup> and using pharmacological activation to bypass Na<sup>+</sup>-activation and confirm the presence of relatively Na<sup>+</sup>-insensitive channels. The anti-psychotic drug loxapine and anti-helminthic drug niclosamide are potent activators of WT K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 4.4 μM and 2.9 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Both drugs also reduce the voltage-dependence of K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 activation, resulting in near-linear current-voltage relationships and increased inward current at voltages negative to the reversal potential (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Initially, niclosamide was selected to confirm function expression of “inactive” mutant channels. CHO cells are believed to have little or no endogenous ion conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). However, when 30 μM niclosamide was perfused into the bath a current with density 58.96 ± 9.60 pA/pF at +10 mV was recorded from non-transfected CHO cells, compared to 1.49 ± 0.67 pA/pF at +10 mV prior to its application (n=4 and 5 cells, respectively). Though this current is relatively small in comparison to exogenous K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 current (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), this could confound the functional rescue of seemingly inactive K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channels. The identity of the conductance and charge-carrier evoked by niclosamide is unknown, but experiments ruled out K<sub>Na</sub>1.1, since the current was not inhibited by 10 μM bepridil (not shown). The reversal potential (-73.30 ± 0.85 mV, n=4) would be consistent with a K<sup>+</sup>-selective conductance, but no further experiments were conducted to characterize the current and its ion selectivity. Loxapine had no effect on the membrane conductance of non-transfected CHO cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) and was therefore more suitable for these experiments.</p><p id="P13">Firstly, to replicate the importance of the previously proposed Na<sup>+</sup>-sensor, D839 was mutated both to glutamate and alanine. The D839E mutation, which lengthened the sidechain without affecting the negative charge, gave currents that were qualitatively no different to WT K<sub>Na</sub>1.1. The current-voltage relationships closely resembled the WT K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel with 10 mM and 40 mM intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>, and no currents were recorded in 0 mM intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with Zhang and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), no currents were recorded in the presence of 0, 10 and 40 mM intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> from D839A channels. Large, relatively voltage-independent currents were yielded upon perfusion of 30 μM loxapine into the bath solution, confirming the presence of this Na<sup>+</sup>-insensitive mutant K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel at the cell membrane (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Na<sup>+</sup>-activation stabilizes D884 in an acidic pocket</title><p id="P14">The structural analysis conducted above suggested that Na<sup>+</sup>-activation causes the βN-αQ loop to transition from a highly mobile or disordered state to a conformation that is stabilized by a salt bridge between D839 and K885. To test this idea, K885 was neutralized to alanine. Like with D839A K<sub>Na</sub>1.1, negligible currents were recorded from cells expressing K885A K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 with 0 mM and 10 mM intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). A small current was recorded from K885A K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 when intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> was elevated to 40 mM, suggesting a substantial decrease in Na<sup>+</sup>-sensitivity of the channel. Functional expression of K885A K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channels was again confirmed by addition of 30 μM loxapine, which evoked large whole cell currents comparable with those we observed earlier in the study.</p><p id="P15">We then questioned if the concurrent positioning of D884 in the vicinity of other negatively charged (D898 and E920) or polar (T922) sidechains was significant. Mutation of each of these to alanine similarly disrupted Na<sup>+</sup> activation with no significant currents recorded with 0, 10, or 40 mM intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>. Functional rescue was achieved with each of these mutant K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channels following application of 30 μM loxapine. We initially considered whether this acidic pocket might form a site for Na<sup>+</sup> to occupy and activate the channel, co-ordinated by these several negatively charged and polar residues. To see if we could rescue one of these mutations, E920A, or attract D884 into this site and increase activity, D898 and T922 were mutated to the positively charged lysine. However, with each of the D898K, E920A/D898K, and T922K K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channels the effect was same as the alanine substitutions in this pocket (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Again, no currents were recorded with 0, 10, or 40 mM intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> and functional rescue was achieved with 30 μM loxapine application. We found that that mutation of D898 to either alanine or lysine appeared to result in a weak inward rectification in loxapine-evoked current-voltage relationships (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>The size of amino acid substitutions of D884 in the βN-αQ loop controls the activation state of K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channels</title><p id="P16">We returned to investigate the significance of D884 and its negative charge, which occupies the acidic pocket upon Na<sup>+</sup> activation, by mutating to alanine. Unexpectedly, this resulted in a large increase in channel activity and apparent loss of Na<sup>+</sup>-dependence. The voltage-dependent currents recorded from CHO cells expressing D884A K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 with 0, 10 or 40 mM intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> were all similar (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Perfusion of 30 μM loxapine to cells had little effect on the current amplitude apart from an apparent loss of voltage-dependence, as indicated by a straightening of the current-voltage relationship (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Mutation of the same residue to valine, which has a longer sidechain by just one carbon, had similar effects (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Activation midpoints derived from conductance-voltage relationships fitted with a Boltzmann equation for D884A and D884V in 10 mM Na<sup>+</sup> were significantly hyperpolarized compared to WT K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). With 40 mM intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>, the activation midpoints for D884A and D884V K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 were not significantly different from WT K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 under the same conditions. Whilst WT K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 currents were negligible with 0 mM intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>, the activation midpoints for D884A and D884V with 0 mM Na<sup>+</sup> were not significantly different to those obtained with 10 and 40 mM Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Upon increasing the size of the hydrophobic sidechain further by mutating D884 to isoleucine and phenylalanine, different effects were observed. D884I K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 currents were similar to those obtained from WT K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 with each intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration tested (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, no discernible current could be recorded from D884F K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 with any of the Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations tested up to 40 mM, though function was rescued by loxapine application (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). It appeared that it was the size of the sidechain at this position that was critical to determining K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel function. Finally, we mutated D884 to glutamate, which retained the negative charge but increased the sidechain by one carbon. The D884E mutation in K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 had an effect similar to D884F, with negligible currents with each of 0, 10, and 40 mM intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>, but large whole-cell currents were recorded following the application of loxapine (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P18">These results indicated that it was the size and not the charge of the side chain at amino acid position 884 that determined whether the K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel remained Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent or became locked in either the inactive or Na<sup>+</sup>-activated state under these conditions. We returned to the structure of the Na<sup>+</sup>-activated K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel and modeled the D884 mutations <italic>in silico</italic>. Whilst aspartate and isoleucine at position 884 could be closely accommodated in the surrounding pocket, together with the smaller alanine and valine sidechains with some leeway, substituting the larger glutamate and phenylalanine sidechains resulted in steric clashes with T922 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). D884 was mutated to asparagine in rat K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 by Xu and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), resulting in Na<sup>+</sup> -insensitivity, and we found that this mutation also resulted in a steric clash <italic>in silico</italic> (not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">Our data suggest that the βN-αQ loop in RCK2 of K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 acts as a molecular switch, controlling transitions between the Na<sup>+</sup>-activated and Na<sup>+</sup>-free inactive states. In the activated state, this loop is stabilized by a salt bridge between K885 and D839. This explains why previous mutations of this aspartate, D812 in rat K<sub>Na</sub>1.1, by Zhang and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) resulted in a loss of Na<sup>+</sup>-sensitivity, leading to their proposal that this formed a Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site. Concurrently, the ability of D884 to occupy a pocket that includes D898, E920, and T922 in the activated state seems to be important for activation. Increasing the size of this sidechain prevented K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel activation by 40 mM intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> but decreasing the size of the sidechain caused the channel to adopt a constitutively activated, but voltage-gated, Na<sup>+</sup>-independent state. This would imply that the conformation adopted by this pocket in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup> prevents D884 and the βN-αQ loop from adopting the stabilized state, but can accommodate alanine and valine sidechains in place of D884. This domain is highly conserved between K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 and K<sub>Na</sub>1.2, including each of the residues described here, indicating a common mechanism.</p><p id="P20">This acidic pocket together with D884 were recently proposed by both Xu and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) and Zhang and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) to be a potential cation binding site. Mutating the equivalent of D884 in rat K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 to asparagine rendered the channel non-functional at intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations to up to 2 M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Consequently, and supported by molecular dynamics simulations, this aspartate was proposed as one of two Na<sup>+</sup>-binding sites in each subunit. In contrast, we found that the charge of this residue is not critical to K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel function, since D884I K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channels behaved similarly to WT K<sub>Na</sub>1.1. <italic>In silico</italic> mutagenesis of this aspartate in the chicken K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 structure to asparagine caused a steric clash with acidic pocket residues, similar to D884E and D884F, which substitutions prevented Na<sup>+</sup>-activation in our experiments. This explains the lack of activity with the asparagine mutation observed by Xu and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). D884 is part of cation-binding “site 2” identified by Zhang and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), who also studied the D884A K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 mutation. Using intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations upwards from 100 mM, they found a four-fold decrease in the Na<sup>+</sup> EC<sub>50</sub>. Since we recorded activated K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel currents in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>, this may represent residual Na<sup>+</sup>-dependence from an alternative Na<sup>+</sup> binding site with these higher concentrations.</p><p id="P21">We are unable to propose a specific Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site from our investigation, but mutagenesis of acidic pocket residues D898, E920 and T922 that also disrupted Na<sup>+</sup> activation would support the view that Na<sup>+</sup> binds in this region. These residues may have a role in co-ordinating Na<sup>+</sup> ions, consistent with E920 having been identified by Xu and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) as a Na<sup>+</sup> co-ordinating sidechain. Mutation of one of these residues, D898, to either lysine or alanine resulted in inward rectification of the K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 current-voltage relationship when activated by loxapine. It was noted in the structure of the chicken K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 channel that the ring of RCK domains forms a “funnel” that narrows as it approaches the pore-forming region and has a largely electronegative surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). D898 contributes to this highly negatively charged surface which may contribute to ion conduction. The negatively charged residues are thought to attract K<sup>+</sup> ions and contribute to the relatively high K<sup>+</sup> conductance of this and other member of the channel subfamily, and mutation of D898 may have an effect of outward K<sup>+</sup> currents, leading to the slight inward rectification observed.</p><p id="P22">The rotation and adoption of a stable alpha helix by the βN-αQ loop in RCK2 was also highlighted in the recently published structure of the human K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 in the activated state, but disordered in the Na<sup>+</sup>-free state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). The authors argue that this conformational change influences interactions between RCK2 and RCK1 domains, resulting in the overall expansion that opens the channel gate. In conclusion, this structural and our functional data point to this loop as the key regulator of K<sub>Na</sub> channel activation by Na<sup>+</sup>. The constitutive activity with the D884A and D884V mutant K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup> provide further clues to how this channel is regulated. Given that these mutant channels, with the smaller side chain, are able to activate without Na<sup>+</sup>, this indicates that the WT channel is primed for activation but requires a small structural change caused by Na<sup>+</sup> binding to enable the βN-αQ loop to adopt the activated state. It is this inactive, but primed state that may be disrupted by inherited mutations that result in K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 gain of function.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S12"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Supported by a BBSRC-CASE PhD studentship in conjunction with Autifony Therapeutics Ltd awarded to B.A.C.

Significance</title></caption><p>Sodium-activated potassium channels regulate neuronal excitability, and their dysfunction causes severe childhood disorders. Here, we identify a structural determinant in the intracellular domains that is responsible for triggering channel activation in response to sodium ion binding. An increase in the size of a particular amino acid renders the channel sodium-insensitive, whilst a decrease in size enables the channel to activate in the absence of sodium. This enhances our understanding of how this subclass of potassium channels respond to changes in the intracellular ionic environment. Furthermore, this may also further our understanding of the basis of human neurological disorders and their treatment.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Structural analysis of the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site proposed by Zhang and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) in chicken cryo-EM structures.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Structure of chicken K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 in the active conformation (PDB: 5U70) with one subunit in the tetramer colored blue.
