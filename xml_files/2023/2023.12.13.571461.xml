Quantifying this process is important for breeding wheat varieties with high yield and of high quality. We present a method that allows up-scaling of the state of the art method - visual scoring - by using image sequences acquired from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). This reduces measurement time and environmental changes during the measurement as well as rater bias. We compared the potential of a widely used multispectral sensor and a cheaper high-resolution RGB camera to track the dynamics of senescence. A UAV each was equipped with one of these sensors and used to measure canopy reflectance throughout the senescence process that lasted several weeks, for more than 400 winter wheat cultivars across three field seasons. Multiple spectral and RGB indices were calculated at the experimental plot level and used to model the dynamics of senescence. Model fits were further processed to extract key time points of the senescence phase. By comparing the results of the two sensors with each other and with the visual evaluation, respectively, we show that both sensors allow monitoring of senescence dynamics and measure key time points of the phase with a precision close to that of more sophisticated proximal sensing approaches. Optimal timing of measurements proved to be more important than the choice of sensor, confirming that timely and frequent measurements should be prioritized over more expensive sensors that provide a higher spectral resolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>High Throughput Field Phenotyping</kwd><kwd>Winter Wheat</kwd><kwd>Senescence Dynamics</kwd><kwd>GxE</kwd><kwd>UAV</kwd><kwd>Spectral Indices</kwd><kwd>RGB</kwd><kwd>Cost Reduction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Background</title><p id="P3">A significant portion of daily calorie and protein intake is based on on a handful of arable crops, notably wheat. Consequently, there is an immediate need to identify and mitigate risks associated with the cultivation of these crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Tilman et al. 2011</xref>). This urgency is further accentuated by the projected decline in global wheat production and quality, including protein content and composition, due to the impacts of global climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">S. Asseng et al. 2015</xref>; Senthold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Asseng et al. 2019</xref>). Potential mitigation strategies encompass diversifying cropping systems or developing crop varieties with enhanced performance under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Reynolds et al. 2016</xref>). An important stress-adaptive trait that is effective in several crops is the prolonged maintenance of green leaf area after anthesis to increase carbon assimilation during grain filling. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Thomas and Smart 1993</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In wheat, the primary limiting factor for potential grain yield is seen predominantly in sink strength, which refers to the number of grains available for grain filling and their capacity to absorb assimilates. This critical determinant is largely established before grain filling initiates, extending up to and including a short period after anthesis, as extensively reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Borŕas et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">R. A. Fischer 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Distelfeld et al. 2014</xref>. Nevertheless, several studies have documented a positive correlation between delayed senescence and grain yield, especially in combination with stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Verma et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lopes Maimaitijiang et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Montazeaud et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">M. Christopher et al. 2017</xref>). In addition, the onset of senescence marks a basic transition of canopies from carbon assimilation to N remobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Thomas and Ougham 2014</xref>), and its timing is therefore expected to affect not only GY but also grain protein concentration, which is a key quality parameter of major economic importance.</p><p id="P5">In situations in which severe stress challenges wheat, a prolonged retention of green leaf area can be construed as a strategy to prevent premature senescence. An example of this is the CIMMYT wheat line SeriM82, which has a significant stay-green related yield advantage in Australian multi-environment trials over locally adapted genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">J. T. Christopher et al. 2008</xref>). In this case, a denser root system at depth likely increases deep soil moisture extraction late in the season, supporting an extended grain filling duration by delaying stress-induced senescence, resulting in increased individual grain weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">J. T. Christopher et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">John T. Christopher, Veyradier, et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">John T. Christopher, M. J. Christopher, et al. 2016</xref>). Understanding this yield-determining phase in wheat is critical, especially in light of future climate change and more extreme events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Seneviratne et al. 2021</xref>). Even in countries with temperate conditions, such as Switzerland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">A. M. Fischer et al. 2022</xref>), an increase in agriculturally relevant climate extremes, such as heat waves, is expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Tschurr, Feigenwinter, et al. 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P6">There are several approaches to track senescence in crop plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kipp et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Anderegg, Yu, et al. 2020</xref>). This is often done with very expensive equipment, such as hyperspectral sensors (spectroradiometry). These sensors are used in manual plot-by-plot measurements and require optimal environmental conditions for the entire duration of the measurement, in particular stable light conditions. Therefore, there is a great need to increase the throughput, for example by using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)s derived traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Makanza et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Li et al. 2023</xref>). Although such approaches can reduce human bias compared to visual scoring and are thus more reproducible, they require stable measurement conditions. In particular, different lighting conditions can strongly influence the measurements and cause bias if they change during a measurement. Therefore, faster measurement approaches, such as using UAVs, allow a high measurement density under good conditions, as the time per measurement is lower compared to other approaches. This can additionally reduce costs, as less labor is required and very expensive sensors are not needed. Furthermore, for dynamic and complex processes such as senescence, multi-environment trials are required to disentangle genotypic and environmental effects. Therefore, it is very important that a reproducible and unbiased method is used to meaningfully compare across different environments. Furthermore, the use of less expensive sensors, such as regular Red-Green-Blue (RGB) cameras, would be beneficial to make such measurements accessible to a wide range of applications. Previous studies demonstrated that vegetation index dynamics utilizing few specific spectral bands provide an accurate and robust representation of canopy senescence dynamics in wheat, whereas approaches based on full reflectance spectra suffered from specificity to environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Anderegg, Yu, et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hassan et al. 2018</xref>). This suggests that senescence dynamics may be accurately tracked using less sophisticated and readily affordable sensors. The aim of this study was therefore i) to evaluate UAV-based reflectance measurements as tools for high throughput senescence monitoring; ii) to compare the state-of-the-art approach relying on expensive multispectral (SPC) sensors with less sophisticated and more affordable RGB cameras, and with the conventional method of visual scoring; and iii) to evaluate the effect of the temporal measurement resolution in comparison to the sensor used. Four winter wheat trials, conducted across three years, each encompassing between 180 and 800 plots, were considered in this study to develop and validate a method for the above research objectives. Phenologically and morphologically diverse winter wheat cultivars were included in the investigation: The GABI wheat panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kollers et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Gogna et al. 2022</xref>), European and Swiss cultivars, as well as more than 300 breeding lines were measured over the years. Accordingly, these trials were well suited for the development and evaluation of a robust method with respect to both a wide genetic diversity as well as year-to-year variability.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P7">The analysis is divided into four main steps: data acquisition, pre-processing (photogrametry for RGB and SPC, signal correction for SPC), dynamic modelling, and validation. Data from two sensors, a SPC and a RGB-camera mounted on UAVs were combined with visual scorings. Extensive pre-processing of the UAV raw data is required to extract plot-level reflectance for each measurement time point. Within the dynamic modeling, the best index and modelling approaches are considered and used to extract key time points of the senescence phase. These time points were then used to compare and validate the two sensors with regard to their capability of capturing visually observed senescence dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Field Site and Experiments</title><p id="P8">All experiments were conducted at the ETH Zürich research station for Plant Sciences Lindau-Eschikon, Switzerland (47.449 N, 8.682E, 520 m a.s.l.) within or right next to the Field Phenotyping Platform (FIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kirchgessner et al. 2017</xref>). The experimental field is a gleyic cambisol soil with 21% clay, 21% silt and 3.5% organic matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kirchgessner et al. 2017</xref>). Data originating from four different experiments were used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). RGB and SPC measurement were acquired for three experiments (2018, 2021 and 2022 all FIP main) and visual scoring for two experiments (2018 and 2021) respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>Visual Scoring</title><p id="P9">Reference assessments of senescence were obtained through visual inspection of canopies at regular intervals, starting before the onset of senescence in the earliestmaturing genotype and continuing until the latest-maturing genotype reached maturity. Canopies were inspected at a view angle of approximately 45°, lower leaf layers were manually exposed where necessary to enable inspection. All estimates were made for a central region of about 0.5 m x 0.5 m in each plot. In 2019, canopy senescence was assessed by estimating the fraction of green, chlorotic, and necrotic leaf and stem area, with chlorotic areas interpreted as representing an intermediate stage of senescence. The resulting average impression of the advancement of senescence was expressed as an integer value on a scale ranging from 0 (representing complete canopy senescence) to 10 (representing fully stay-green canopies). Ear senescence was not considered. In 2022, the focus of the visual scorings was put on the remaining green leaf area, whereas stem and ear senescence was not considered, and no distinction was made between chlorotic and necrotic tissue, with both considered as “senescent”. All visual scorings were made by a single person to avoid scorer-bias. Data was recorded using the field book app (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Rife et al. 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.3</label><title>Sensors</title><p id="P10">For RGB image acquisition, a camera with a full frame sensor of 6000×4000 pixel (Sony <italic>α</italic> 9 Model ILCE-9, Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a prime lens with a focal length of 55 mm and a maximum aperture of f/1,8 (Sonnar T <italic>∗</italic> FE 55 mm F1,8 ZA, Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was used as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Roth, Camenzind, et al. 2020</xref>.

Both sensors were mounted to a Matrice 600 Pro drone (SZ DJI Technology Co. Ltd., Shenzhen, China) and attached to a Ronin-MX gimbal (SZ DJI Technology Co.

Cameras with comparable specifications and especially resolution can be found for less than 1000 USD. This means that the RGB camera is currently between eight and eleven times cheaper than the SPC sensor.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>2.4</label><title>UAV Measurements</title><p id="P11">The RGB-UAV flights were performed at 28 m altitude with front overlap ratio of 90 % and a side overlap ratio of 80 %.

Images from a given measurement flight were first aligned, and camera position estimations referenced using GCPs placed in the field. The world-coordinate positions of the GCPs were measured with a Trimble GPS RTK (R10, Trimble Ltd., Sunnyvale, U.S.A.) with a maximal error of 2 cm. From a generated dense point cloud, a digital elevation map was extracted and orthophotos were projected onto it. This orthophoto was used only to define the region-of-interest (ROI) of plots, but not for data extraction. To avoid fusing pixels from different shots and height-related artifacts, these ROIs were back-projected to the original images (according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Roth, Aasen, et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Roth, Hund, et al. 2018</xref>).

Calibration of the SPC images was done after the clipping of individual plots from orthophotos. At the beginning of each flight, five control panels with a known reflectance (0 %, 15 %, 25 %, 75 % and 100 % black) were measured. Measured panel reflectances were then used to fit a linear model according to the empirical line method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Baugh et al. 2008</xref>), and predict the calibrated multispectral values.

Within the region of interest the index was calculated for each pixel and the median of the resulting index values was exported for further analyses. 25 and 16 indices were extracted from the SPC and the RGB imagery, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><label>2.7</label><title>Dynamic modelling</title><p id="P16">Various approaches for modelling the dynamics of senescence based on repeated visual scoring, measurements of green leaf area, or spectral indices have been proposed, and different sets of parameters are often extracted from model fits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Chapman et al. 2021</xref>). The choice of model and parameters depends on the level of assessment and on the frequency with which these assessments are made. At the canopy level, senescence typically shows a sigmoidal progression, which can be well represented by two-parameter or four-parameter logistic-type models. Alternatively, splines may provide more flexibility to represent atypical senescence curves as well, or may be used to model spectral indices that deviate in their dynamics from visual observations. However, using more flexible approaches increases the risk of overfitting to errors associated with single measurements or scorings when compared to more rigid fully parametric approaches. Here, we evaluated both approaches. Four-parameter Gompertz models were fitted as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Anderegg, Yu, et al. 2020</xref>): <disp-formula id="FD1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where <italic>S</italic> represents the trait value; <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic> are the lower and upper asymptotes, respectively; <italic>b</italic> is the rate of change at time <italic>M</italic>; and <italic>M</italic> is the time point when the rate is at its maximum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Gooding et al. 2000</xref>). A corresponding two-parameter model with asymptotes constrained to 0 and 10 was also fitted. Monotonically decreasing P-splines were fitted using the R-package scam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Pya et al. 2014</xref>), with the number of spline knots set to three quarters of the number of observations, as done for similar data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Roth, Rodríguez-Álvarez, et al. 2021</xref>. Given that our main interest is in extracting the dynamics of senescence rather than absolute values at a specific point in time, all scorings and measurements were scaled at the plot level to range from 0 to 10, representing the minimum and maximum value recorded for the assessment period, respectively. To simplify modelling and model interpretation, the scale for indices with increasing values during senescence was inverted. The different models were applied to the visual scoring as well as to all indices. The correlation between visual scoring and the high throughput field phenotyping (HTFP) method was then calculated using the equivalent model for each (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><label>2.8</label><title>Extracting key time points</title><p id="P17">From the fitted models, a value was predicted for each plot on each day in the assessment period.

In addition, the range of correlation values was taken into account by selecting the best index. That is, a slightly lower correlation value was preferred if the range between the minimum and maximum value was smaller. A smaller range represents a more robust index and was therefore considered superior in this study. In a second step, the best model was selected according to the same metrics as before, but calculated per model within the previously selected best index per sensor. This method allows to determine the index-model combination that represents the best correlation and therefore the relative behavior of the genotypes, but does not take into account the absolute deviation or bias between two compared methods.

When considering the best index-model combination for each parameter individually, correlation coefficients ranged from from 0.73 (<italic>t</italic>80) to 0.82 (<italic>t</italic>80) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure A5</xref>). For five of the seven parameters the <italic>NDV Ired</italic>650 or <italic>NDV Ired</italic>668 were the best indices. However, just in two occasions (<italic>Integral</italic> and <italic>onsen</italic>) in combination with the <italic>cgom</italic> model.</p><p id="P24">For the RGB indices, the <italic>ExGR</italic> with the <italic>cgom</italic> model showed overall the best performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 and Table A4</xref>). Again, most of the parameters show a strong correlation between RGB indices and visual scoring (<italic>t</italic>50, <italic>t</italic>20, <italic>endsen</italic>, <italic>Integral</italic>, and <italic>M</italic>), while <italic>t</italic>80 and <italic>onsen</italic> do not show a strong or any correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). By selecting for each parameter the best combination, we found correlation coefficients ranging from 0.32 (<italic>t</italic>80) to 0.91 (<italic>t</italic>20) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure A6</xref>). The <italic>ExGR</italic> index was found twice to be the best index per parameter as well (<italic>Integral</italic> and <italic>M</italic>), however just once in combination with the <italic>cgom</italic> model.</p><p id="P25">Dynamics parameters derived from the best RGB and SPC indices correlated over two years of experiment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, FIP main 2021 and 2022). Years were analyzed separately, allowing to check for effects deriving from the year. Correlation coefficients all showed values between 0.55 and 0.72 in 2022. In 2021, correlation values ranged from −0.02 for <italic>t</italic>80 up to 0.4 for <italic>t</italic>50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Zero values can occur if a model converges but predicted values never cross the pre-defined thresholds required for parameter extraction. The resulting correlation per year with all the parameters as well as RMSE values are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table A5</xref>.</p><p id="P26">Taken together, the extracted parameters explain and define the dynamics of the senescence process. However, the overall dynamics of the process can also be visualized as continuous over time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> shows the median of the best index across two years (2021 and 2022) of SPC and RGB over time. In 2021, the SPC measurements started 19 days after the RGB campaign. The parameter <italic>t</italic>80 derived from the RGB measurement in 2021 is in the phase where no SPC measurement took place. In 2022, the measurement period with both sensors was equivalent in duration. Both trajectories show a very similar trend, a relatively long and pronounced initial phase with values around 10. Senescence then starts slowly, visible by the decreasing value, followed by a linear phase. This phase either ends abruptly due to the harvest, or the slope is again slightly reduced towards the harvest time or towards the end of the measurement phase.</p><p id="P27">The accuracy of extracting the parameter shown is highly dependent on the data at hand. Subsampling the measurement series generally resulted in decreased correlation coefficients and higher variance in estimated parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). The overall tendency in both sampling strategies shows lower correlation coefficients and especially a wider spread of the values when reducing the measurement times. Parameters at the very beginning or end of the senescence phase (e.g. <italic>t</italic>80 and <italic>t</italic>20) show less reduction in accuracy and variance than others (e.g. <italic>Integral</italic>). The performance with fixed start and stop values seems to be overall better and more stable (lower variance) than with unconstrained subsampling. In particular, the SPC sensor shows a large increase in variance and a reduction in correlation coefficient overall with a lower number of measurements.</p></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="discussion"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">This study transfers a methodology for extracting key parameters of the senescence phase from ground-based to UAV-based reflectance measurements, providing the required high throughput <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Anderegg, Yu, et al. 2020</xref>. Extensive data sets from multiple years allowed us to thoroughly validate a SPC and a RGB sensor as tools to track visually observed canopy senescence. For both sensors we identified a robust reflectance index that allows to track this process, namely for the SPC the <italic>NDV Ired</italic>650 and for the RGB sensor the <italic>ExGR</italic> index in combination with a dynamic model (<italic>cgom</italic>). By validating these sensors against visual scoring, the state of the art in plant breeding, as well as against each other, we could show a strong correlation regarding several parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). We propose a robust method to extract key parameters of the senescence phase in a high throughput manner. Furthermore, our results indicate that the accuracy of assessments depends primarily on the temporal resolution of the measurements, rather than on the availability of narrow-band, specific spectral indices. This suggests to invest more in a temporal higher resolved data set than a spectral higher resolving sensor.</p><p id="P29">The described method allows the up-scaling of previously developed approaches, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lopes et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">John T. Christopher, Veyradier, et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Anderegg, Yu, et al. 2020</xref>, allowing such methods to be implemented in actual breeding programs due to a feasible amount of work required to collect the necessary datasets. Furthermore, our results show that both evaluated sensors can deliver similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table A5</xref>) and provide a representation of the senescence process that is similarly accurate to that obtained by using more sophisticated sensors, such as spectroradiometers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Anderegg, Yu, et al. 2020</xref>). This indicates that cheaper RGB sensors can be used similarly, in line with results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cao et al. 2021</xref>. Also, such RGB sensors are widely used for other phenotyping purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Ge et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Jin et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Roth, Camenzind, et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Anderegg, Tschurr, et al. 2023</xref>). Compared to SPC sensors, RGB sensors are more robust regarding different illumination conditions, and provide often higher resolution but fewer measured bands.</p><p id="P30">However, this also means that measurements can be made under less optimal conditions, which can facilitate more continuous monitoring of experimental plots. Our results confirm that a high measurement frequency and a sufficient duration of measurement campaigns are more important to collect valuable information than the chosen sensor, and particularly, its spectral resolution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> shows a very late start of SPC measurements in 2021, which is also reflected in a low correlation (correlation coefficient: 0.2; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table A5</xref>) between RGB and SPC for <italic>t</italic>80, a parameter defining the early phase of senescence. When the measurement period was identical (as in 2022) both sensors are equal in accuracy, which is also reflected in high correlation coefficients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table A5</xref>). When considering the best index per parameter for each sensor, higher correlation coefficients were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure A5 and A6</xref>). The indices show a slightly different pattern over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure A7</xref>). This may explain why the parameters can vary between the indices, and thus the correlation between the visual scoring and the HTFP derived measurement can be increased by selecting an index-model combination separately for each parameter. However, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, there are also differences between the different models used. The differences are small if the period was measured in high temporal resolution. In this case, the measurement error is also small (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures A1, A2, A3 and A4</xref>). If this is not the case, some models or indices follow a pattern that is not physiologically meaningful. Therefore, if one is interested in observing the whole dynamic of a period, and may compare it between different environments, we suggest using one index with one model, to be chosen as described in this study. This allows a robust tracking of the phase of interest. Conversely, if the interest lies in extracting a single key time point, the precision can be maximized by selecting a specific index for each index. In our study, selecting the best index-model combination per parameter increased the correlation between 0 and 0.48 for RGB and 0.01 to 0.19 for SPC (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> versus A6, respectively A5 versus A5).</p><p id="P31">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, the different models also have an effect on the correlation score. While there is often little difference between the two types of Gompertz models, there is an overall tendency for both P-Splines and the linear model to perform worse. This indicates that fully parametric approaches are better suited to model canopy senescence dynamics.</p><p id="P32">The temporal density of the measurements was shown to have a greater effect on the results and on the variance of the extracted parameters than the sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). However, some parameters can be extracted with comparable precision and variance even with a reduced number of measurement points (e.g. <italic>t</italic>80, <italic>t</italic>50, and <italic>t</italic>20) if the start and end of the period are fixed to a physiologically meaningful point in time. If this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref> right side), the correlation coefficients show a higher variance with reduced measurement times. This trend can be observed for both sensors. Therefore, for a robust and meaningful parameter extraction and a better understanding of the observed period, continuous measurements over time as well as a meaningful timing regarding the start and end of the measurement campaign are key. There are proposals to interpolate the measured features using an environmentally meaningful component (e.g. temperature) to fill measurement gaps as meaningfully as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Graf et al. 2023</xref>). However, this requires a huge amount of data to train on a genotype-specific level, which is unlikely to be available if the measurements were not made in a dense temporal resolution in the first place. With more bands available in the SPC sensor, more potential combinations for indices are possible. This may be of interest not only to follow the dynamics of senescence, but also to study the contribution of biotic and abiotic stress to the overall dynamics of green leaf area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Anderegg, Hund, et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P33">The ability to measure at high temporal resolution allows for a deeper understanding of senescence dynamics. These dynamics can then be used to identify potential stressors, similar to what was done in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Tschurr, Kirchgessner, et al. 2023</xref> for dynamic canopy cover measurements. And in a next step, implemented in crop models to further improve prediction accuracy by accounting for growth stress according to measurable traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Diepen et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wang et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Jamieson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Brown et al. 2018</xref>). This approach could also be used to assess and improve the performance and phenological adaptations of crop mixtures in a high-throughput manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Tschurr, Oppliger, et al. 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P34">The RGB sensor already has a higher GSD than the SPC sensor, but for both the resolution was not sufficient to distinguish between plant and soil pixels in the images during the senescence phase. During earlier growth phases, the resolution of the RGB sensor was high enough to allow this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Roth, Camenzind, et al. 2020</xref>). In the senescence phase this requires very high resolution, but would allow to determine the senescent leaf area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Anderegg, Zenkl, et al. 2023</xref>. This could ultimately allow to determine the actual state of senescence, by defining the ratio between green and already dead plant tissue. These measurements could then also be modelled and evaluated with the suggested method in this study, treated as one of the shown indices. Furthermore, even organ-level senescence dynamics could be extracted when the resolution is sufficient. This could allow to disentangle flag leaf senescence, whole plant senescence, grain maturation and their corresponding genotypic patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Chapman et al. 2021</xref>). Lower UAV flight height as well as an adapted flight strategy (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Xiao et al. 2023</xref>) with a high resolution RGB camera could allow this. However, the resolution of SPC sensors is typically lower, again suggesting further investigation and development of methods using RGB sensors.</p></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P35">This study highlights the promising potential of up-scaling and improving the efficiency of senescence measurements by the use of UAV. Our results show comparable results to those obtained by previous state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a strategy that prioritizes increasing measurement frequency over time, as opposed to investing in more expensive sensors equipped with a high number of spectral bands. Our investigation showed similar results when using a standard RGB sensor as opposed to a 10-band SPC sensor, consistent with previous research using hyperspectral sensors. Particularly for the senescence phase of winter wheat, a phase characterized by substantial genotype by environment (G×E) interactions, achieving high temporal resolution and measurement throughput is crucial to advance our understanding and selection of well-adapted genotypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Appendix</label><media xlink:href="EMS192795-supplement-Appendix.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d219aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Hansueli Zellweger and Simon Corrado for managing our field experiments over the years, and members of the Crop Sciences group for valuable help in data acquisition and fruitful discussions.
