However, the precise mechanisms remain elusive. Using a well-defined drug-gene pair, we identified an enhancer region for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, <italic>DPYD</italic> gene) expression that is relevant to the metabolism of the anti-cancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Using reporter systems, CRISPR genome edited cell models, and human liver specimens, we demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>vivo</italic> that genotype status for the common germline variant (rs4294451; 27% global minor allele frequency) located within this novel enhancer controls <italic>DPYD</italic> transcription and alters resistance to 5-FU. The variant genotype increases recruitment of the transcription factor CEBPB to the enhancer and alters the level of direct interactions between the enhancer and <italic>DPYD</italic> promoter. Our data provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms controlling sensitivity and resistance to 5-FU.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Epigenetics</kwd><kwd>Gene Regulation</kwd><kwd>5-Fluorouracil</kwd><kwd>Chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>CEBPB</kwd><kwd>Chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>Biomarkers</kwd><kwd>Drug Resistance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Therapeutic resistance has been reported for nearly all anti-cancer drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], and as many as 90% of mortalities in cancer can be linked to drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Enhancer-mediated regulation of gene expression has been increasingly implicated in multiple cancer-related processes, including resistance, response, and toxicity to cancer therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. However, the specific molecular mechanisms through which epigenetic changes drive these processes remain mostly elusive.</p><p id="P4">Enhancers regulate gene expression by recruiting transcription factors (TFs) and subsequently interacting with the promoter region of a target gene to drive expression. The activity of enhancers can be affected by localized epigenetic state and genetic variations that affect TF binding. More than 90% of disease-associated genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) lie in the non-coding portion of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Many of these GWAS variants map to putative enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Regardless, translating enhancer GWAS variants into disease mechanisms remains a largely unmet challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P5">In previous studies, we identified a <italic>cis</italic> expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for the chemotherapeutic metabolism gene dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase enzyme (DPD, encoded by the <italic>DPYD</italic> gene) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. DPD is the initial and rate-defining enzyme for conversion of the commonly used chemotherapeutic 5-fluoruracil (5-FU) into inactive metabolites. Hepatic DPD eliminates approximately 85% of circulating 5-FU within minutes of administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], and deficiency of DPD is associated with severe (clinical grade ≥3) toxicity to 5-FU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Clinical and preclinical studies have identified missense and splicing variants of <italic>DPYD</italic> that consistently correlate with reduced DPD function and increased 5-FU toxicity risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. However, these variants explain &lt;20% of reported cases of grade ≥3 5-FU toxicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], and the mechanisms contributing to 5-FU resistance, and therefore means to overcome resistance, remain elusive.</p><p id="P6">In the present study, we used human liver tissues and cellular models to identify and characterize a novel <italic>cis</italic> enhancer element capable of modulating <italic>DPYD</italic> expression. We additionally provide mechanistic data demonstrating that transcription-factor driven expression of <italic>DPYD</italic> is dependent on allele status for a common germline genetic variant located within this enhancer, suggesting that the variant could be a valuable biomarker of 5-FU toxicity risk.

We defined the upstream boundary of the target region using enhancer data supported by multiple methods and gene-enhancer links supported by multiple methods as implemented within GeneHancer (i.e., putative enhancer regions with “double-elite” status; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then mapped annotated transcription factor binding sites in the target region using ChIP-seq data from the Ensembl Regulatory Build as an additional layer of evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In all, three candidate proximal upstream enhancer regions were identified, which will be referred to herein as E9, E16, and E20 based on the relevant location upstream of the <italic>DPYD</italic> transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) and -activation (CRISPRa) were used to determine which of these regions were capable of regulating <italic>DPYD</italic> expression. For CRISPRi, we generated cell lines that stably expressed the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain of Kox1 fused to nuclease-deficient Cas9 protein (dCas9-KRAB; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]). For CRISPRa, we created cell lines that stably expressed dCas9 fused to the histone acetyltransferase E1A binding protein P300 (dCas9-P300; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]). Six guide RNAs (gRNAs) were used to target dCas9 fusion proteins to each region of interest, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to monitor changes in <italic>DPYD</italic> expression following transfection.</p><p id="P9">Targeting of dCas9-KRAB (CRISPRi) to the E9 region significantly decreased <italic>DPYD</italic> expression relative to control for four of six gRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Targeting of dCas9-KRAB to E16 resulted in a significant decrease in <italic>DPYD</italic> expression for one of six gRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), and no significant reductions in <italic>DPYD</italic> expression were noted following transfection of gRNAs for E20 in dCas9-expressing cells; however, two gRNAs increased <italic>DPYD</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). For reciprocal CRISPRa experiments, targeting dCas9-P300 to E9 significantly increased <italic>DPYD</italic> expression for four of six gRNAs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), whereas gRNAs specific to E16 and E20 did not elicit any significant changes in <italic>DPYD</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1F and 1G</xref>). Consistent with the results in HepG2 cells, CRISPRi and CRISPRa targeted to the E9 region significantly altered <italic>DPYD</italic> expression in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1A and S1D</xref>), whereas no significant changes were noted when targeted to E16 or E20 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1B, S1C, S1E, and S1F</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To confirm that the expected epigenetic changes were induced at the E9 region, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) in dCas9-KRAB and -P300 expressing cells transfected with E9 gRNAs. As expected, targeting dCas9-KRAB to E9 resulted in a localized increase in H3K9me3 compared to controls, indicating a shift from active to inactive chromatin at E9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>; the primer nearest E9 is denoted by the gray box). Targeting of dCas-P300 to E9 caused changes consistent with epigenetic activation of the region, including a localized gain of H3K27ac-marked chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar changes in localized histone modifications were noted when dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-P300 HCT116 cells were directed to E9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that the E9 region might act as a <italic>cis</italic> regulatory element modulating <italic>DPYD</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Identification of rs4294451 as a putative regulatory SNP within E9</title><p id="P11">In an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted in human liver specimens, Etheridge <italic>et al.</italic> previously identified three independent haplotype blocks that significantly associated with altered <italic>DPYD</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. One of the blocks identified in that study spanned the E9 region, prompting us to investigate if genetic variants in E9 could potentially perturb <italic>DPYD</italic> regulation. Based on the biological role of enhancers, we postulated that a causal functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) could interfere with transcription factor binding. Within the Ensembl Regulatory Build [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], we identified a region of approximately 150 bp showing evidence for binding by multiple transcription factors in HepG2 cells, but not in other cell types tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). Within this region, we identified the variant rs4294451, which is a tag SNP for the previously identified eQTL block [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], prompting us to hypothesize that this variant might be the causal eQTL SNP.</p><p id="P12">To assess the contribution of rs4294451 alleles to <italic>DPYD</italic> regulation, we first performed reporter assays by cloning the <italic>DPYD</italic> promoter and E9 enhancer region containing either the reference or variant allele for rs4294451 (T or A, respectively) into a luciferase reporter vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Reporter vectors containing the T-allele yielded significantly higher luciferase activity compared to vectors containing only the <italic>DPYD</italic> promoter (p=0.00054), whereas those containing the A allele within E9 showed a more modest increase (p=0.070, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Directly comparing E9-containing reporters, vectors containing the T allele showed significantly higher activity than those with the A allele (p=0.046, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that the variant could impact <italic>DPYD</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Impact of rs4294451 genotype on <italic>DPYD</italic> expression and regulation</title><p id="P13">To directly characterize the impact of rs4294451 alleles on <italic>DPYD</italic> expression at the endogenous locus, we used CRISPR-mediated genome editing to create matched isogenic HCT116 knock-in cell models for each genotype. Consistent with the results from the reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), cells homozygous for the A allele had significantly lower <italic>DPYD</italic> expression compared to cells that were homozygous for the T allele (p=0.0011, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Heterozygous rs4294451 A/T cells displayed intermediate expression compared to cells with homozygous A/A and T/T genotypes (p=0.00013 and p=0.028, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). At the chromatin level, cells homozygous for the A allele showed reductions in H3K27ac and accumulation of H3K9me at E9 compared to cells that were homozygous or heterozygous for the T allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D–3E</xref>). This finding is consistent with the A allele being associated with a less active epigenetic state at E9. Cells carrying a heterozygous genotype for rs4294451 displayed an intermediate epigenetic state, which is consistent with one epigenetically active and one inactive copy of E9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D–3E</xref>). Similar epigenetic differences between rs4294451 genotypes were noted at E9 in liver specimens obtained from human donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A–S3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Allele-specific expression of <italic>DPYD</italic> transcripts</title><p id="P14">To precisely determine the impact of rs4294451 alleles on <italic>DPYD</italic> expression <italic>in vivo,</italic> we measured allele-specific expression using reverse transcriptase digital droplet PCR (RT-ddPCR) using donor liver tissues. Because rs4294451 falls outside of the coding region, we used coding region variants as proxies to measure strand-specific expression. These coding variants consisted of DPYD-c.85T&gt;C (rs1801265) and c.496A&gt;G (rs2297595), both of which are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the rs4294451 T allele (c.85C: D’=0.92, R<sup>2</sup>=0.80; c.496G: D’= 0.67, R<sup>2</sup>= 0.21). Imperfect LD between rs4294451 and proxies allowed us to use samples that are heterozygous for the coding region SNP, but homozygous for rs429441 genotype, as an additional level of control. In samples measured using the c.85 genotype, the fractional abundance of the C-allele ranged from 0.542 to 0.602 in samples heterozygous for rs4294451 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Expressed in terms of relative expression, the C-allele was expressed at levels 18–51% higher than the T-allele (i.e., 0.542/0.458=1.18 and 0.602/0.398=1.51). In contrast, the sample that was homozygous for the rs4294451 T allele showed allelic expression at the c.85 locus that was indistinguishable from the DNA control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating equal expression of both transcripts. In measurements using c.496, a significant allelic-imbalance of 0.565 (CI: 0.546–0.584) in favor of the variant c.496 G-allele compared to the DNA control (CI: 0.488–0.511) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). This again indicated higher expression of the linked rs4294451 T allele. Notably, liver specimens that were homozygous at the rs4294451 locus again showed c.496 allelic expression that was indistinguishable from the DNA control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>).

To determine if known transcription factor binding sites could be affected by allele status at rs4294451, we computed binding scores for JUND, MYBL2, HNF4A, CEBPB, FOXA1, and FOXA2 for sequences comprising the E9 region containing the T and A alleles at rs4294451. CEBPB, FOXA1, and FOXA2 showed differential predicted binding scores between the rs4294451 A- and T-containing query sequences (data not shown). For CEBPB, the differential binding site had a higher score than other sites in the queried region that did not overlap with rs4294451, suggesting that the SNP could affect CEBPB binding in the region. While predicted binding in the region varied for FOXA1 and FOXA2 depending on rs4294451 genotype, other binding sites that did not overlap with the variant site showed stronger predicted binding, indicating that the SNP was likely not affecting the critical binding site in the region. Binding scores did not differ by genotype for JUND or HNF4A, and no binding site above the threshold score was detected in the region for MYBL2.</p><p id="P18">Based on the above, we sought to determine if CEBPB could regulate <italic>DPYD</italic> expression through the E9 region and if regulation was affected by rs4294451 genotype. We first used reporter assays in conjunction with CEBPB.

In cells overexpressing CEBPB, plasmids containing the promoter and E9 region resulted in higher luciferase activity compared to those containing only the <italic>DPYD</italic> promoter, regardless of the presence of the A or T allele (p=0.0036 and p=0.0017, respectively), suggesting that rs4294451 genotype does not completely disrupt CEBPB regulation through E9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Comparing results for the A and T alleles at rs4294451 in the presence of overexpressed CEBPB indicates that the T allele is likely more responsive to CEBPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>; p=0.036).</p><p id="P19">To directly examine CEBPB binding to the E9 region and to determine if binding affinity differs between the rs4294451 A and T alleles, we performed ChIP with CEBPB antibodies in isogenic knock-in HCT116 cells for the rs4294451 A/A, A/T, and T/T genotypes.

As the critical determinant of 5-FU pharmacokinetics, liver DPD expression is pivotal to both the risk of severe adverse events and therapeutic resistance in 5-FU chemotherapy at opposite ends of the exposure spectrum. This is underscored by the narrow therapeutic window for 5-FU, with toxicity and efficacy occurring at partially overlapping drug exposure levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Deleterious germline coding-region <italic>DPYD</italic> variants have been linked to severe 5-FU toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]; however, these variants are responsible for only a small fraction of severe adverse events in 5-FU use and are unlikely to contribute to drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Elevated expression of DPD in tumor cells is known to confer 5-FU resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], and upregulation of hepatic DPD expression has been shown to reduce drug exposures and promote the development of 5-FU–resistant tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. However, the mechanisms regulating DPD expression are not well characterized, nor is it understood how the regulatory processes can be altered to support the development of 5-FU resistance.</p><p id="P24">In the current study, we identified a novel <italic>cis</italic> enhancer region for <italic>DPYD</italic> that is located approximately 9 kb upstream from the gene’s transcription start site. We additionally provide evidence that the E9 region directly interactions with the <italic>DPYD</italic> promoter, supporting E9 as a functional enhancer for <italic>DPYD</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). We demonstrated that CEBPB is a critical transcription factor for <italic>DPYD</italic> that binds to this enhancer region, termed E9, promoting enhancer–promoter interactions and increasing <italic>DPYD</italic> expression. We also showed that the allele status of the germline variant rs4294451, located within the E9 region, can affect CEBPB-driven <italic>DPYD</italic> expression and sensitivity/resistance to 5-FU, making it a strong candidate biomarker for 5-FU toxicity risk and potentially tumor resistance to 5-FU–based cancer therapy. These findings are consistent with the recent identification of a haplotype block linked to the rs4294451 T allele that was significantly associated with elevated <italic>DPYD</italic> expression in human liver tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. In the present manuscript, we show that the rs4294451 T allele is enriched for active chromatin marks in both human liver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>) and in cellular knock-in models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D–E</xref>). Furthermore, using an innovative digital droplet RT-qPCR–based approach, we demonstrate that the rs4294451 T allele is associated with elevated expression of the <italic>cis DPYD</italic> transcript in human liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F–G</xref>).</p><p id="P">Allele frequency data retrieved from gnomAD suggest that a majority (65-70%, estimated from allele frequencies) of individuals of African ancestry carry the rs4294451-T allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>), whereas only about 35% of individuals of European ancestry are predicted to be carriers of the T allele. African American patients have worse overall survival in colorectal cancer compared to white patients, owing to biological and non-biological factors. While differential access to healthcare, treatment bias, and socioeconomic factors have been shown to contribute to the poorer prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], other unrecognized factors also contribute to this difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Our data support a hypothesis that higher systemic 5-FU catabolism to due elevated liver DPD expression in carriers of the rs4294451-T allele results in lower exposure to active anti-tumor metabolites of 5-FU. Additionally, we demonstrate that colorectal cancer cell lines likely retain the enhancer functions associated with the rs4294451-T allele, suggesting that tumor cells carrying this variant could more readily inactive 5-FU via increased DPD expression. The higher likelihood of carrying the T-allele in individuals of African ancestry would therefore place them at greater risk. Additional studies will be needed to investigate the degree to which rs4294451-T contributes to survival and progression in colorectal cancer and in other solid cancers frequently treated with 5-FU.</p><p id="P25">The transcription factor CEBPB is a member of the CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein family, a group of transcription factors that contain basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domains and is highly expressed in liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Multiple CEBPB isoforms have been detected, with some acting as transcriptional activators and others as inhibitors. The data presented herein indicate that active isoforms of CEBPB are up-regulating <italic>DPYD</italic> through binding to the E9 enhancer region. Inhibitory isoforms of CEBPB have also been shown to be important for certain physiological processes including tumorigenesis and liver regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Our over-expression studies used the full-length active isoform. Therefore, we cannot rule out a role for the inactive isoform participating in the regulation of <italic>DPYD</italic> expression. In addition to acting as a homodimer, CEBPB can also heterodimerize with other CEBP family proteins and interact with other transcription factors, including P300/CBP, CREB, NFKB, AP1, and NFAT, to co-regulate gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>].

Enrichment of CEBPB to the E9 region was likewise shown to be higher in cells with the rs4294451 T allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) and higher levels of interaction were also noted between the E9 region with the T allele and the <italic>DPYD</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).

The binding of CEBPB to specific motifs has recently been shown to be cell-type specific and to rely on non-consensus binding motifs with binding strengths that can be modulated by the sequence and structure of surrounding DNA regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], providing a possible explanation for the discrepancy between predicted and observed results.</p><p id="P27">To our knowledge, this is the first report directly linking CEBPB to 5-FU metabolism and the first mechanistic data demonstrating <italic>cis</italic> effects of a regulatory variant on <italic>DPYD</italic> expression. The role of CEBPB in modulating 5-FU resistance and toxicity is not without precedent. For example, mir-191 is abnormally expressed in several cancers and has been associated with both 5-FU resistance and the regulation of CEBPB expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]; however, the CEBPB–DPYD regulatory axis has not previously been recognized. Furthermore, CEBPB signaling has been shown to be activated in colorectal cancer cells following treatment with 5-FU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], suggesting that CEBPB-mediated activation of <italic>DPYD</italic> expression might represent a dynamic response to therapy.</p><p id="P28">While the contributions of regulatory variants to 5-FU metabolism have not been widely studied to date, previous studies have explored DPD regulation.

Reactions were carried out in 10 <italic>μ</italic>L reaction volumes, consisting of 5 pmol each primer and 1 <italic>μ</italic>L of a 1:50 dilution of each 3C sample. Amplification was performed using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche) on a LightCycler 480 thermocycler (Roche). PCR conditions were 95°C for 10 minutes, and 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds, 65°C for 1 minute, and 72°C for 15 seconds. Enrichment was calculated as 2<sup>-(cp (ligated DNA) - cp (non-ligated DNA))</sup>. Enrichment with the fragment containing the nearest primer was used as the control for interaction frequency for further normalization between replicate experiments. Specifically, when primer 5 was used as the anchor, data were normalized to the average of values obtained from using primers 5 and 4. When primer 7 was used as the anchor, data were normalized to the average of values from primers 7 and 8. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Background impedance values for RTCA E-View plates (Agilent) were obtained using complete DMEM prior to plating cells. Cells were seeded at a density of 5,000 cells per well and incubated for 20 hours, at which time medium was removed and replaced with medium containing serial dilutions of 5-FU ranging from 1.25 μM to 100 μM. Impedance values (expressed as cell index, CI, units) were recorded every 15 minutes over the course of the experiment to monitor proliferation. Results represent the average of three independent cultures. To account for minute differences in plating and potential cell loss during drug addition, relative CI was calculated as the CI measured 48 hours after 5-FU divided by the CI recorded immediately after treatment. Four parameter logistic non-linear regression analysis was used to determine IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations (GraphPad Prism version 9, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>CEBPB knockdown cells</title><p id="P43">Lentiviral particles for CEBPB knockdown were generated by transfecting shRNA plasmids (TRCN0000007440 and TRCN0000007442) or scramble shRNA control (a gift from David Sabatini; Addgene_1864 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]), psPAX2 (a gift from Didier Trono; Addgene_12260), and pMD2.G (a gift from Didier Trono; Addgene_12259) into HEK293T cells using TransIT-Lenti (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI). A 3:1 ratio of transfection reagent to total plasmid was used for all transfections. For all transfections, medium was changed 14 hours after transfection, and viral supernatants were collected 34 hours later. Supernatants were filtered using 0.45 μm PVDF filters (Millipore) to remove debris/cells and used directly for transductions. For transductions, target cells were seeded at a density of 4×10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 6-well plates and incubated with 500 μL virus-containing supernatant, 12.5 μg/mL polybrene (MilliporeSigma), and 1.5 mL fresh DMEM culture medium.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Analysis of transcription factor binding motifs</title><p id="P44">Potential transcription factor binding sites within the E9 region were determined using TFBSTools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. DNA sequence corresponding to the 101-nucleotide region centered on rs4294451 was retrieved from genome build GRCh38.p13 (NC_000001.11). A second DNA string was created to mimic the sequence corresponding to the rs4294451 A allele. Position frequency matrices for each transcription factor were retrieved from JASPAR CORE 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>] and converted to log-scale position weight matrices using the toPWM method implemented in TFBSTools. JASPAR includes binding site information from multiple sources. ENCODE data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>] were available for CEBPB (matrix ID MA04661) and JUND (MA0491.1). In absence of ENCODE data, alternatives including PAZAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] (HNF4A, MA0114.2; FOXA1, MA0148.3), REMAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>] (FOXA2, MA0047.3), and data from an individual publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>] (MYBL2, MA0777.1) were used. EP300 is a cofactor that does not recognize a specific DNA motif on its own; instead, it interacts with various DNA-binding factors to modify chromatin and facilitate activation of target genes. As such, P300 does not have a DNA-binding motif and was not included in analysis. Nucleotide sequences were scanned using the patterns presented in the position weight matrices to identify putative transcription factor binding sites. Forward and reverse strands were searched, and the 70<sup>th</sup> percentile between the minimum and maximum possible value for a matrix was used as the minimum threshold score. Empirical p-values for each score were calculated by an exact method using the TFMPvalue R package. R version 4.2.2 was used for analyses</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P45">Significance was defined as p&lt;0.05 unless otherwise noted in the text. Pairwise comparisons were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t tests calculated using GraphPad Prism version 9. One-way ANOVA statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism. Summary statistics pertaining to allele-specific expression were calculated using Quantasoft software as described in the Allele-specific gene expression section. Transcription factor binding predictions and associated analyses were performed in R version 4.2.2 as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures and Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS190635-supplement-Supplementary_Figures_and_Tables.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d30aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health under award number R01CA251065 (SMO, P.I.).
