However, we lack a proper understanding of the underlying compounds that are responsible for the observed toxicity. In this study, we tested the toxic physiological effects of three common commercially available natural food dyes (red, green, blue), and their main ingredients (turmeric and spirulina), on <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> oviposition, larval development, and larval foraging behaviour. Larval development and egg-to-adult survival was significantly impacted by blue and green dyes. These effects were recapitulated when flies were fed with increasing concentrations of turmeric and spirulina, suggesting that turmeric is a toxic component of the food dye. Red dye, which contains neither turmeric or spirulina, had little impact on fly health and behaviour. Green and blue food dyes decreased egg laying, an effect similar to that observed in increasing concentrations of turmeric and, to a lesser extent, spirulina. When given a choice, larvae preferred to feed as follows: control &gt; red &gt; blue &gt; green diet patches, a pattern inversely correlating with the previously observed toxicity. Our results show that, despite turmeric being often considered a super food, it can have toxic effects that the impact organismal physiology and health.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Curcumin</kwd><kwd>chemical ecology</kwd><kwd>food additives</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The psychology of colour influences consumer behaviour and has been the target of marketing strategies in various industries, including food and beverages (J. S. Kumar, 2017I). Although food safety standards ensure that such additives are safe for consumption, recent studies have determined that synthetic food dyes are a major source of intoxication, leading to severe health implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dey &amp; Nagababu, 2022</xref>). In mice, tartrazine (also known as Yellow 5, E102) decreased learning and memory, and in rats, it significantly increased activity in open field tests, likely due to brain damage induced by reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gao et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, a three-generational study determined the adverse effects of tartrazine on various neuro-behavioural parameters in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). For instance, dye exposure led to accelerated swimming direction development in F1 and F2 males, surface rearing and exploratory behaviour in F1 males were impaired, and olfactory orientation was improved in F2 males. Other food dyes, e.g., Red 2 (E123), have also been implicated in toxicity effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Mpountoukas et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, more studies are urgently needed to understand better the health implications of food dyes and the underlying components used in their production.</p><p id="P3">Studies in invertebrate models, primarily <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies, have corroborated the results from vertebrate model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bilder &amp; Irvine, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Link &amp; Bellen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Reiter et al., 2001</xref>). Turmeric, often classified as a super food, increased larval mortality and decreased adult fly survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Uysal et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, studies have also assessed the toxic impact of synthetic food dyes on <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, linking, e.g., ‘brilliant blue’ and ‘sunset yellow’ exposure to developmental delay, reduced locomotion, morphological changes, and paralysis, with indications of potential interference with neurotransmitters (P. B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, ‘brilliant blue’ significantly decreased <italic>Drosophila</italic> longevity, with other dye colours having similar but less pronounced impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Türkoğlu et al., 2015</xref>). Population decline was also determined by various yellow and red synthetic dyes in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Uysal et al., 2017</xref>). Despite growing evidence of toxic effects of food dyes, decades of studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have used food dyes to quantify food intake without fully acknowledging the potential toxic effects of these compounds. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Tanimura et al., (1982)</xref> utilised red and blue synthetic dyes to determine the preference of <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains for different types of sugar, but no preliminary assessment of dye toxicity appears to have been conducted. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Shell et al., (2018)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Shell &amp; Grotewiel, (2022)</xref> highlighted the benefits of using synthetic food dye for assessing fly consumption-excretion, providing the means to detect metabolic activity by measuring the absorbance of excreted dye in a spectrophotometer. This technique formed the basis for further studies investigating food preferences using different synthetic dyes as labels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Mack &amp; Zhang, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Shell et al., 2021</xref>). Dyes have also been used to determine how intestinal barrier dysfunction may link to age markers like inflammation and metabolic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Rera et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">2013</xref>), but with no preliminary assessment of the negative impacts of the dyes on development or survival. Therefore, toxicity studies of food dye in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can shed light on the potential effects for human consumption and help improve current protocols in the broader field of nutritional sciences using invertebrates as models.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we investigated the toxic effects of three commercial food dyes (red, blue, and green) and their main colour-giving compounds (turmeric and spirulina) on female oviposition, larval development, larval foraging behaviour and adult sex ratio in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. We conducted three experiments to reveal the toxicity effects of these compounds. In experiment one (‘no choice – dye diet’), adult females were placed in diets made with one of the food dyes and allowed to oviposit freely. We then measured total number of eggs laid as well as egg-to-adult development. In experiment two (‘choice experiment – dye diet’), eggs were placed in foraging arenas (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Morimoto, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Morimoto et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">2019</xref>) and allowed to forage freely among patches with control diet and dyes, upon which patch utilisation and pupation site were recorded. These two experiments allowed us to determine the toxicity effects of each food dye and the perceived preference for each food dye by individuals. Then, in experiment three (‘no choice – turmeric or spirulina diet’), we used the same approach as experiment one but placed females in diets with increasing concentrations of either turmeric or spirulina to determine potential toxic effects. Based on the manufacturer’s ingredient list, we expected the red dye to have no effect on any of the traits measured, while we expected both blue and green dyes to negatively affect the traits due to the addition of turmeric in their recipe. However, we had no <italic>a priori</italic> information as to the proportions of turmeric and spirulina added to the blue and green dyes, and, therefore, had no <italic>a priori</italic> predictions as to which dye should have the strongest toxic effects. Our findings question turmeric status as a superfood by showing that it can be highly toxic to a developing model organism.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Fly stock and egg collection</title><p id="P5">We used an outbred population of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> from Brittany, France. Fly stocks were maintained in large populations (&gt;1,000 individuals) at 20 °C, approximately 40 % humidity, with a 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod, and fed a yeast-sucrose diet (‘control’ diet) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Morimoto, (2022)</xref>. Eggs were collected by placing two bottles with the control diet in the stock population cage for 24 h. Bottles were retrieved and maintained at 20 °C until adult emergence. Within 6 h of adult emergence, five randomly selected virgin males and females were placed in vials with 5 mL of diets containing food dyes (experiment one), turmeric or spirulina (experiment three). Twenty vials with control diets were reserved, and the groups were allowed to oviposit for 15 h, after which eggs were then collected from the vials and immediately placed into the foraging arenas (experiment two). All experiments were conducted at 20 °C with 24:0 h light:dark photoperiod.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P6">All statistical analyses were conducted in RStudio 2023.06.0+421 ‘Mountain Hydrangea’.

The concentration was selected to determine potential impacts of diet without reducing macronutrient intake to an extent that would elicit negative impacts on development or behaviour. The concentration used here exceeds those utilised in previous studies (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Tanimura et al., 1982</xref>), as the solid food used here is not as colourless as liquid fly diet, thus needing more dye to become visible in uptake. As food was not limited in any of the exposure experiments, it was not necessary to replace 20 % of the control diet with water to account for potential differences in macronutrients.</p><p id="P8">Adults were allowed to interact freely, mate, and females were allowed to lay eggs for 48 h, after which adults were discarded. The eggs were then counted using a Leica M9i stereomicroscope and maintained as described above to complete development until adult emergence. Pupation was scored twice daily (mornings and afternoons) by counting the number of pupae per food patch, as a measure of developmental time (egg-to-pupa). After pupation was first observed, all vials were maintained for 10 days, allowing adults to emerge before being frozen at -20 °C for 48 h. Where larvae did not pupate within the specified 10 days, additional 20 days were given. If pupation did not occur after 30 days, the experiment was terminated (‘censored’).. The number of emerged males and females in each diet treatment were compared to determine the sex ratio of emerging adults across diet treatments. Egg-to-adult viability was calculated as the number of adults divided by the number of eggs in the vial x 100. We fitted a generalised mixed model (GLMER) with egg batch as the random variable and food dye as the independent variable. To analyse the counts of the number of eggs laid in each diet, we fitted a model with Poisson error distribution. For developmental time and sex ratio, we used a Gamma error distribution to best fit the data. For the egg-to-adult viability percentage, we used a Binomial error distribution. P-values were obtained using the ANOVA function of the ‘car’ package and the pairwise comparisons from the ‘summary’ function in base R.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Experiment Two: Choice – dye diets</title><p id="P9">30 or 60 eggs were placed at the centre of a foraging arena (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>total</italic></sub> = <italic>8</italic> per egg density), which was designed as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Morimoto, (2019)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Morimoto et al., (2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">2019</xref>). Briefly, a 90mm petri dish was covered with a solution of 2 % agar, and 4 equally spaced discs were removed to make space for discs representing one of the four diets (control, red, blue, and green). Discs were made using a 15 mL Falcon tube. The two egg densities were used because previous studies have shown that social group density influences accuracy and speed of larval foraging decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Morimoto et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">2019</xref>). Larvae had free choice of foraging patch and pupation site. Foraging arenas were frozen at -20 °C after 11 days of incubation, after which pupation site was scored by counting the number of pupae in the proximity of each of the diet patches. To estimate food utilisation, we photographed each diet patch in each replicate, and created a score of food utilisation that ranged from 0 to 3 (0 = not utilised, 1 = poorly utilised, 2 = utilised, 3 = heavily utilised; see Figure S1 for scoring criteria). Three independent scorers (JM, DD, CC) analysed the images and assigned scores. The average of the scores were used as food utilisation index (see below). We fitted a linear mixed model with batch as random factor to investigate pupation number in relation to food dye, egg density (as factor with two levels) and the interaction between dye and egg density. We then fitted a multinomial regression to model the probability of pupation in each of the sites, and 95 % confidence intervals of estimates were obtained using the ‘confint’ function in R.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Experiment three: no choice – turmeric or spirulina diets</title><p id="P10">We adopted the same experimental design as described for experiment one, but here the diets had increasing concentrations (0 %, 1 %, 2.5 %, 5 %, and 10 % w/v) of either pesticide-free turmeric or pesticide-free spirulina (Sevenhills Wholefoods®). These concentrations were selected to determine potential toxic effects, as well as understanding concentration-related impacts. Each compound was analysed separately (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>total</italic></sub> = 30 per compound). To establish a baseline for comparison with the food dye experiment, we also had diet treatments containing each of the food dyes tested in experiment 1 (<italic>N</italic> = 3 per food dye) at 20 % v/v concentration. We fitted a general linear model with log-transformed number of eggs laid, developmental time, and untransformed sex ratio, with turmeric or spirulina concentration as the independent variable. For the proportion of adult emergence, we fitted a generalised linear model with Binomial error and quasi extension to account for the overdispersion of the data. P-values were obtained from F-statistics in the ‘anova’ function in R.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S10"><title>Experiment one: Food dye significantly affected fly development</title><p id="P11">Food dye affected female oviposition behaviour (χ<sup>2</sup> = 47.833; <italic>degrees of freedom (df)</italic> = 3; <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001).

Increasing turmeric concentration decreased egg laying (F<sub>4,25</sub> = 24.78; <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001), extended developmental time (F<sub>4,25</sub> = 1251.4; <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001), and decreased egg to adult viability (F<sub>4,25</sub> = 76.32; <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001), effectively recapitulating the toxic effects observed in the green food dye for a concentration of 10 % turmeric, and the blue dye for a concentration of 2.5 % turmeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a-c</xref>).

Here, we showed that food dyes can display toxic effects, using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model organism. We found that green and blue dyes were toxic to the developing fly. Through followon studies, we found that turmeric and, to a lesser extent, spirulina were likely the toxic agents responsible for the observed differences. Increasing the concentration of turmeric almost perfectly recapitulated the adverse effects observed for oviposition, developmental time, and egg-to-adult viability observed in green and blue dyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>). These results confirm previous findings in flies that turmeric can be highly toxic and decrease survival in both larvae and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Uysal et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, our findings show that experimental protocols that use food dyes to measure food intake must be mindful of the dyes’ potential side effects on larval food intake and life-histories.</p><p id="P15">A previous experiment by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Kumar et al., (2020)</xref> showed that exposure to 20-30 % of ‘Brilliant Blue FCF’ dye decreased hatching success, pupation, and adult eclosion in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This dye was chemically manufactured, and thus, the toxicity effects are likely due to toxic chemical elements as opposed to natural compounds tested here. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Marcus et al., (2018)</xref> showed that female <italic>Drosophila</italic> preferred to lay eggs on green over blue and aqua-coloured sheets placed under clear agar, highlighting the importance of colour itself for egg allocation and egg-laying for the species. We did not observe this effect with a higher incidence of laying in the control and red dye diets when compared with flies housed with green and blue diets. This effect is probably because of some gustatory and/or olfactory cues from the turmeric and spirulina present into those dyes, which females used for oviposition selection.</p><p id="P16">A study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> found that increasing turmeric concentration reduced adult survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Uysal et al., 2015</xref>), while another found that turmeric had no impact on oviposition of this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Rawal et al., 2014</xref>). Only one study examined the impact of curcumin, the main active compound in turmeric, on <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval development, reporting increased development times but without further investigations into the underlying molecular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Soh et al., 2013</xref>).

Moreover, curcuminoids are known to act as photoactivatable insecticides, wherein the combination of oxygen and light with their photosensitiser property trigger photochemical reactions culminating in the destruction of e.g., membranes, mitochondria, and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ben Amor &amp; Jori, 2000</xref>) – which is known as photodynamic inactivation (PDI). This phenomenon has been linked to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Allison et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Smijs et al., 2007</xref>). We hypothesise that curcumin is the main driver of the effect of turmeric observed in our data, and further studies focusing on this compound are being conducted. Curcumin has also been found to reduce neurotoxicity in transgenic flies that are models for Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that curcumin and, perhaps, turmeric may have tissuespecific effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Caesar et al., 2012</xref>). Studies in another fly species (<italic>Bactrocera cucurbitae</italic>) found that developmental time was significantly increased with curcumin exposure, which they attributed to an aversion to the diet due to post-ingestion toxic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Puri et al., 2021</xref>). This aversion directly affected the weight needed for pupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Davidowitz et al., 2003</xref>), delaying overall growth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Puri et al., (2021)</xref> further determined that <italic>B cucurbitae</italic> egg-to-adult survival decreased in a concentration-dependent manner by curcumin.</p><p id="P17">A recent study in western honeybees <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> showed that the synthetic blue dye ‘Brilliant Blue FCF’ significantly reduced larval survival compared to the control diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Ehrenberg et al., 2019</xref>). They hypothesised that the blue dye could either elicit a change in nutrient uptake, be metabolised differently to other dyes, leading to complex intermediates, or affect metamorphosis and pupal development through impacts on resource allocation. Our study did not allow us to investigate the underlying mechanisms, but it is likely that both turmeric and, to a smaller extent spirulina, modulate excretion pathways that are associated with toxicity, such as the uric acid metabolism pathway. Recently, we have shown that the uric acid metabolism is a key modulator of diet- and toxic-dependent responses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Morimoto, 2022</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the toxic effects observed here are, at least partly, related to this pathway. Future studies using molecular tools will allow us to characterise this and help gain insight into the molecular routes through which turmeric and spirulina realise their toxic effects.</p><p id="P18">Previous studies investigated the benefits of rearing animals intended as fish feed on spirulina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Ratti et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Tu et al., 2022</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Qiu et al., (2019)</xref> determined that higher concentrations of microalgae in diets for <italic>Drosophila</italic> significantly decreased egg-to-adult viability, whilst also leading to lower adult body weight. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Qiu et al., (2019)</xref> also assessed the macronutrients of the algal mixture, which had a protein:carbohydrate ratio of 44:26 (1.69:1), as well as containing more than 25 % lipids, whilst standard fly food is more than 50 % carbohydrates and contains no lipids. It is known that the optimum diet for <italic>Drosophila</italic> body size is a protein-to-carbohy-drate ratio of 1.5:1, which is comparable to that of spirulina(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Rodrigues et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, increasing lipid concentration in the diet appears to have no effect on fly development and body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Reis, 2016</xref>). Therefore, diet macronutrient composition alone cannot fully explain the results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Qiu et al., (2019)</xref>. Recently, we showed that diet affects toxicity, and thus, there may be combinations of nutrients and toxic compounds that potentialise the toxicity of diet compounds (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Morimoto, 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, our results show that spirulina, although relatively less toxic than turmeric, can still induce developmental delays and decrease egg to adult viability when in high concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P19">Turmeric and spirulina are often considered to be superfoods. Here, we show that they can also be super toxic in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model. As a result, products reliant on these compounds, such as food dyes, may prove toxic to flies and potentially, higher animals. Future studies should focus on the molecular pathways through which turmeric and spirulina induce toxicity in flies, which can reveal candidate genes for toxicity effects in vertebrates and establish the fly as a model for identification and isolation of toxic compounds. Our findings in the invertebrate model serve as a cautionary tale for the indiscriminate labelling of foods as causing no harm when consumed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Table S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS190459-supplement-Table_S1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d24aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS190459-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d24aAdFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>JM is funded by BBSRC grant (BB/V015249/1).
