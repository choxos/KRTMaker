Herein, we report a synthetic biodegradable macroporous hydrogel for efficient formation of 3D networks from human primary cells, analysis of cell-secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) and microfluidic integration. Using polymerization-induced phase separation, matrix metalloproteinase-sensitive polyethylene glycol hydrogels are formed with interconnected porosity in the presence of living cells.

Two major approaches have been sought: cell embedding in hydrogels and top seeding on porous scaffolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). For 3D embedding, a variety of natural (e.g., collagen,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]</sup> gelatin<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]</sup>) and synthetic hydrogels (e.g., clickable polyvinyl alcohol<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]</sup> or poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]</sup>) have been reported. However, these hydrogels suffer from small pores (5-50 nm) and low permeability, which impede nutrient transport and cell-cell communication in 3D. In contrast, top seeding typically relies on macroporous scaffolds with large pores (100-600 μm)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]</sup> where the cell to surface interface is 2D. As a result, cells often fail to form 3D networks. Various techniques, such as emulsification<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]</sup>, porogen leaching<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]</sup> and particle annealing<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]</sup> have been employed to create macroporous hydrogels with relevant pore sizes.

PEG hydrogels were formed by thiol-Michael crosslinking<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]</sup> between 4-arm PEG vinylsulfone (4-PEG-VS) and di-thiol crosslinkers in the presence of dextran and hyaluronic acid (HA). This composition resulted in <italic>in situ</italic> pore formation by polymerization-induced phase separation (PIPS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). A fibronectin-derived arginylglycylaspartic acid peptide (N-C: CG<bold>RGD</bold>SP) was added to promote cell attachment, whereas a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-sensitive di-cysteine peptide<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]</sup> (N-C: KCGPQG↓IWGQCK or GCRDGPQG↓IWGQDRCG, ↓ indicates cleavage site) and PEG di-thiol<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]</sup> (PEG-2-SH, <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub>=2.0 kDa or 3.4 kDa) were used as degradable and non-degradable crosslinkers, respectively. Using fluorescently labeled 4-PEG-VS, dynamic <italic>in situ</italic> pore formation was evidenced by time-lapsed confocal microscopy. After 1 h of crosslinking, spatial patterns of binodal nucleation were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Movie 2</xref> show that PIPS and interconnected porosity was only observed in the phase-separated hydrogels using dextran.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>Effect of Polymer Composition on Hydrogel Mechanics</title><p id="P7">Rheological analysis revealed that increasing the concentration of 4-PEG-VS from 2.0% to 2.5% yielded significantly stiffer hydrogels for both degradable and non-degradable groups with storage moduli (<italic>G’</italic>) ranging from 30 ± 17.2 Pa to 421 ± 169.5 Pa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). Depending on the hydrogel composition, gelation (crossover of <italic>G’</italic> and loss modulus (<italic>G”</italic>)) started immediately or after up to 15 minutes upon <italic>in situ</italic> crosslinking at 37°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2a</xref>), whereby MMP-degradable hydrogels crosslinked faster than their non-degradable counterparts. Lutolf et al.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that the presence of positively charged amino acid residues near the cysteine of a crosslinker, such as the lysine residue in the MMP-sensitive crosslinker, modulates the thiol group’s pKa, thereby accelerating crosslinking kinetics in Michael-addition PEG hydrogels.</p><p id="P8">By increasing the dextran concentration from 0.0% to 1.0%, <italic>G’</italic> increased for both non-degradable and degradable hydrogels. This effect can be attributed to the strong phase-separating properties of dextran against PEG precursors, which may lead to a localized densification of the PEG phase and stiffer hydrogels. Varying the dextran molecular weight (<italic>M</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub>, 40 kDa or 500 kDa), however, did not significantly affect the hydrogel mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2b</xref>). By changing the concentration of HA and thereby the viscosity of the hydrogel precursor, the stiffness of the hydrogel could be tuned (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2c</xref>). High viscosity has been suggested to prevent the phases from collapsing into microspheres before the structures are stabilized by crosslinking in PIPS.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]</sup> Our findings show that the inclusion of HA enhanced the crosslinking when its concentration was increased from 0.25% to 0.50%. However, higher concentration of HA (0.83%) reduced <italic>G’,</italic> indicating that crosslinking was less efficient for highly viscous formulations. Interestingly, a rheological test evidenced the viscoelasticity in the PEG hydrogel matrices for both degradable and non-degradable groups, presumably due to the HA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). Qiu et al.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]</sup> reported that a viscous macromolecular component in a hydrogel can contribute significantly to the stress-relaxation properties and fast cellular morphogenesis.

The porosity after PIPS was analyzed by quantification of confocal microscopy images using an algorithm reported by Vandaele et al.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]</sup> As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a-c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>, the increase of dextran concentration from 0% to 0.5%, 1% and 2% led to an increase in pore radius (median pore radius: 4.0, 7.0, 10.0 and 10.0 μm, respectively) and porosity (25.1 ± 2.1, 37.6 ± 4.1, 50.4 ± 1.9 and 55.8 ± 5.9%, respectively) as well as higher pore connectivity. Furthermore, the increase of dextran <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub> from 40 kDa to 500 kDa resulted in a shift towards larger pore radii (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). The resultant porosity in 500 kDa dextran group (19.7 ± 3.0%) was smaller than that of the 40 kDa group (24.7 ± 6.4%) but was higher than in compositions without the addition of dextran (12.0 ± 10.1%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>).

MMPs are known to be crucial for hMSC differentiation as well as for osteoblast survival during osteogenesis.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]</sup> Therefore, we reason that only when cells are able to remodel their surrounding matrix through proteolysis by MMPs, they form an interconnected 3D cell network with long-term stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). hMSC viability on day 2 was above 80% in both degradable and non-degradable hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). Notably, ultrafast cell spreading as well as 3D cell network formation within these macroporous hydrogels were respectively observed as early as 1.5 h and 24 h after being embedded in the hydrogel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). When embedded in MMP-sensitive hydrogels, hMSCs continuously remodel their environment and maintain a 3D cell network for at least 35 days. Quantification of mean cell area further evidenced the permissiveness of degradable hydrogels for hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). The average cell area in the degradable hydrogels was significantly larger compared to non-degradable hydrogels. An extensive 3D cell network formed in the degradable hydrogels on day 8. By contrast, the extent of cell network formation was significantly less in the non-degradable hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). When grown in a more permissive environment, hMSCs formed multiple dendritic processes connecting them with neighboring cells.</p><p id="P11">Based on the success of hMSC cultures, we further tested the suitability of macroporous PEG hydrogels for 3D osteogenic culture of human osteoblasts (hOBs). Cell viability after embedding was above 90% in both degradable and non-degradable groups and remained high after 2 days of culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Similar to hMSCs, a difference in cell morphology between degradable and non-degradable hydrogels was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>). Quantification of cell denticity using ImageJ NeuriteQuant<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f</xref>) shows that hOBs within degradable PEG gels have longer dendritic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4g</xref>) despite having similar mean cell areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4h</xref>). Moreover, we observed that the addition of cell-adhesive RGD-peptides is critical for hOB spreading and network formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). Notably, we demonstrated that manipulating the porous architecture by increasing dextran concentration and, consequently, pore size influenced hOB morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10a</xref>). Cells within PEG hydrogels with larger pore sizes (1.0% dextran) displayed a significantly larger cell area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10b</xref>) and longer dendrites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10c</xref>) on the second day of osteogenic culture compared to hydrogels with smaller pore sizes (0.2% dextran). In summary, our findings underscore the importance of both matrix degradability and porous architecture in the formation of long-term stable 3D cell networks from both hMSCs and hOBs.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><label>2.5</label><title>Histological Analysis of Static Osteogenic Cultures</title><p id="P12">As the osteogenic differentiation proceeded, the cell-laden hydrogels became increasingly opaque.

Similar to the non-sectioned samples, results show that degradable hydrogels facilitated pronounced cell network formation on day 8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Movie 3</xref>) that remained stable for at least 30 days in contrast to non-degradable hydrogels. Collagen type I is the major ECM protein secreted by osteoblasts during bone formation.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]</sup> Picrosirius red-polarization imaging revealed the presence of cell-secreted collagen fibers on day 8, especially in the MMP-degradable hydrogels due to its permissiveness for cell-matrix remodeling. Importantly, the synthetic nature of the macroporous PEG hydrogel allowed for assessment of collagen secretion considering that all detectable collagen fibers were produced by embedded cells. This is unachievable in conventional proteinaceous hydrogels such as collagen type I<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]</sup> and gelatin derivatives.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]</sup></p><p id="P13">Collagen content and maturity were quantified based on the fiber hue method as described elsewhere.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]</sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref> shows that more green and yellow color corresponding to low fiber thickness and immature collagen was present in the non-degradable hydrogels. In contrast, cells within the MMP-degradable hydrogels produced more mature collagen fibers as indicated by the larger proportion of red color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). Moreover, the red color content significantly increased from day 8 to day 30. Alizarin red staining further indicated enhanced matrix mineralization especially in close proximity to embedded cells within the degradable hydrogels compared to non-degradable ones after 30 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>). Compared to day 8, an increase in mineral deposition on day 30 implies the 3D osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs into a more mature bone cell phenotype. Osteocalcin, a marker for mature osteoblasts,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]</sup> was predominantly expressed in MMP-degradable hydrogels after cultivation for 30 days. In contrast, only limited expression of osteocalcin was observed in the non-degradable hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the MMP-degradable macroporous PEG hydrogels are permissive for the formation of 3D bone cell networks and allow for subsequent osteogenic differentiation in a static culture.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><label>2.6</label><title>On-Chip Integration of Macroporous PEG Hydrogels</title><p id="P14">For potential microfluidic applications, we injected the void-forming hydrogels into a microfluidic chip and introduced perfusion through the porous matrix. Flow visualization showed that interstitial liquids could pass through the macroporous PEG hydrogels when applying a pressure gradient on a microfluidic setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>). The pressure difference across an acellular PEG hydrogel was created by applying dissimilar flow rates (<italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub>&gt;<italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub>) to the two medium channels. The perfusion of different fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran tracer molecules (70 kDa and 500 kDa) was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Time-lapsed microscopy images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Movie 4</xref>) indicate that fluorescence intensity increased gradually for both tracers over time. The intensity of tracer molecules increased until reaching a plateau (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>). Yet, no statistical difference in the intensity change was observed between the two tracer molecules. We thus reason that pores within PEG hydrogels were large enough for both sizes of tracer molecules to pass through. These results correlate with the pore size quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) that pore sizes in PEG hydrogels are in the order of μm, which are much larger than the sizes of tracers.</p><p id="P15">To quantify hydrogel permeability, we employed a microfluidic setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>) to create a pressure difference across the hydrogel caused by different volumes of medium added to each syringe barrel.

The addition of 500 kDa dextran increased the permeability of the macroporous hydrogel compared to 40 kDa dextran as expected given the larger pore sizes as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. Importantly, the permeability is comparable to that of a reference hydrogel made of collagen type I.

Using the permeability values of macroporous PEG hydrogels with 40 kDa dextran, a global model on the microfluidic chip was generated to estimate the pressure gradient across the hydrogel region by applying two different flow rates (<italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>low</italic></sub>=10 μl min<sup>-1</sup> and <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>high</italic></sub>=100 μl min<sup>-1</sup> per inlet, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6g</xref>).

However, it is essential to note that this model does not account for the impact of embedded cell networks on hydrogel permeability or the complexities of dynamic cell-matrix remodeling, which can alter fluid dynamics. Moreover, the FSS was calculated based on permeability values from PEG hydrogels with 40 kDa dextran and would be different when using more permeable 500 kDa dextran. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of how FSS affects bone cells in microfluidic culture, more advanced CFD models are therefore warranted for future investigations.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>2.7</label><title>On-Chip Culture of 3D Bone Cell Networks</title><p id="P18">We investigated the feasibility of generating 3D bone cell networks on a chip. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7a</xref> shows hMSCs embedded in both degradable and non-degradable matrices during the second day of osteogenic culture. Remarkably, similar to off-chip cultures, hMSCs exhibited remarkable capacity for rapid spreading, forming intricate 3D cell networks with elongated dendritic protrusions after two days, within the degradable matrix.</p><p id="P19">Cell seeding density has been shown as a key factor in dictating 3D differentiation of primary hOB within a collagen type I hydrogel.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]</sup> We further studied how different cell seeding density (low: 5x10<sup>5</sup> ml<sup>-1</sup> and high: 1x10<sup>6</sup> ml<sup>-1</sup>) influences the formation of 3D bone cell networks in degradable macroporous PEG hydrogels on a chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7b</xref>). Following seven days of cultivation in osteogenic medium, hMSCs cultivated at high seeding density exhibited a dendritic morphology, actively forming an intricate 3D cell network. Conversely, cells at low seeding density appeared elongated, yet failed to establish intercellular connections.</p><p id="P20">Given their macroporosity, permeability and permissiveness for differentiation, we lastly examined the potential of void-forming PEG hydrogels for dynamic cell culture on a chip. Specifically, we studied the effect of controlled delivery of FSS on the viability of embedded hMSCs. Cells were subjected to mechanical stimulation for 2x10 minutes per day, following the same regimen as the CFD model, using either a low flow rate (<italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>low</italic></sub>=10 μl min<sup>-1</sup> per inlet) or high flow rate (<italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>high</italic></sub>=100 μl min<sup>-1</sup> per inlet), while cells cultivated under static conditions were selected as the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7c</xref>). The live/dead assay results on day 13 revealed comparable cell viability between static and low FSS culture, while high FSS led to a significant reduction in cell viability. The cell death under high FSS could be attributed to high shear stresses well beyond the physiological range. Indeed, previous studies have shown that laminar flow at physiological levels exerts an anti-apoptotic effect on MSCs<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]</sup> and osteocytes.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]</sup> The approximate average FSS <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> at <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>high</italic></sub> (17.43 Pa) calculated by the CFD simulation far exceeded the physiological range within the LCN porosities (0.8–2.0 Pa)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]</sup>, resulting in more apoptotic cells compared to the static and low FSS groups, where the average FSS <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> was estimated to be 1.74 Pa. This preliminary investigation highlights the potential of void-forming PEG hydrogels for dynamic cell culture on a chip and sheds light on the influence of FSS on hMSC viability. However, to establish definitive conclusions regarding the effect of perfusion on osteogenic differentiation, in-depth dynamic perfusion cultures are warranted.</p><p id="P21">In conclusion, we have successfully developed a synthetic macroporous PEG hydrogel that effectively supports 3D culture of human bone cell networks from primary cells. By adjusting the mechanical and microarchitectural properties, as well as the degradability of the hydrogel, rapid cell spreading and osteogenic differentiation are promoted. Within the MMP-degradable matrices, single bone cell precursors respond to the porous architecture, forming an interconnected cell network in 3D without adding morphogens<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]</sup>, and differentiating into an osteoid-like tissue. An essential advantage of this technique lies in the synthetic nature of these hydrogels, which are chemically defined and have minimal batch-to-batch variations. Furthermore, the use of this synthetic non-fibrillar hydrogel facilitates histological analysis of cell-secreted collagen fibers as a potential biomarker for studying (patho-)physiological processes linked to bone formation. Moreover, the unique process of PIPS allows for the formation of interconnected pores in the presence of living cells, a feature unachievable with other types of macroporous hydrogels formed through previously described methods.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]</sup> The resulting permeability allows for fluid flow through the matrix, making it compatible with microfluidic platforms and the potential to deliver mechanical stimuli to enhance osteogenesis. This <italic>in vitro</italic> platform may open up new avenues for future mechanistic studies on bone development, providing valuable insights into both healthy and pathological conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10"><label>4</label><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="S11"><title>Hydrogel Preparation</title><p id="P22">To prepare (labeled) PEG hydrogels, (rhodamine-labeled) 4-PEG-VS (20% w/v in HEPES), 40 kDa or 500 kDa dextran (Sigma-Aldrich, 31389-25G or 31392-10G, in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4), RGD (China Peptides, N-C: CG<bold>RGD</bold>SP, in PBS pH 7.4 or pH 6), HA (Sigma-Aldrich, 9067-32-7, 0.5%–1% w/v in Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco, 14025-050) or Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco, high glucose)) and crosslinker (PEG-2-SH (2 kDa or 3.4 kDa, Laysan Bio, in PBS pH 7.4 or pH 6) or MMP-degradable (China Peptides, N-C: KCGPQGIWGQCK or GCRDGPQGIWGQDRCG, in PBS pH 7.4 or pH 6 or TEOA)) were thoroughly mixed in this order to ensure PIPS, efficient crosslinking and even distribution of RGD. RGD and crosslinker stock solutions were prepared directly before mixing the precursor solution and kept on ice to prevent rapid oxidation of thiol groups.

Two different tracer solutions were prepared by diluting a 0.1% w/v stock solution of 70 kDa or 500 kDa FITC-dextran (both Sigma-Aldrich, FD70S-100MG and FD500S-100MG) 1:1000 in DMEM. The chips were then mounted onto the microscope stage, the tracer solutions were filled into 20 ml syringes which were connected to the luer connectors on the chips via needles (0.80x22 mm, blunt, Braun), tubing (Semadeni Plastics, 4348) and male luer connectors (Cole Parmer, 45518-07) that were primed with liquid to prevent air from being trapped along the flow path.
