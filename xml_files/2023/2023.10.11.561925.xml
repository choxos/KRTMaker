The pathogenesis of infections caused by a broad range of viruses, from neurotropic viruses like Rabies and Zika to respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, differ between the sexes and across the lifespan. Typically, older males are more susceptible to severe acute outcomes, while females are more vulnerable to the post-acute sequelae of infections. All of these complications can include neuroinflammation, stroke, cognitive dysfunction, and delirium. While these symptoms can be secondary to infection, recent studies suggest that even peripheral infections can lead to neuropathological changes in the brain. However, few studies have characterized the expression of viral receptors in the human brain or examined age- or sex-related differences in such expression. In this study, we used a publicly accessible transcriptomic database to assess the impact of age and sex on the expression of 67 viral host factor genes, associated with ten virus families. Analyzing data from 15 brain areas (n=33, F=14, M=19, age:4 mo-80 yrs), we determined the lifespan trajectory for each gene in each area via LOESS regressions. We used unsupervised hierarchical clustering to determine if a brain-wide pattern or virus family pattern can be detected. Using Dense-tSNE, a dimension-reduction and visualization technique, we discovered four distinct developmental trajectories, clustering the areas into two mixed-sex subcortical clusters and one each of male and female cortical clusters. Applying Differential Expression Sliding Window Analysis (DeSWAN), we identified the genes driving these age- and sex-related differences. Many sex differences were noted in childhood, potentially impacting the brain’s susceptibility to viral infections and underscoring a broader dimorphic organization of male and female brains. These insights contribute to our understanding of sex-specific responses to viral infections, offering the potential for more personalized treatment strategies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The recent COVID-19 pandemic, Zika virus outbreak and surge in Dengue fever highlight the escalating threat to public health of neuroinfectious diseases transmitted by single-strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bohmwald et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Morgello, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Sun et al., 2020</xref>).

However, little is known about the expression of virus receptors in the human brain, especially how receptor levels vary by age and sex across cortical and subcortical structures. Viral pathogens can trigger acute and post-acute neurological symptoms, from mild reversible symptoms such as headache, fever, anosmia, ageusia, confusion and memory problems to more severe symptoms such as encephalitis, meningitis, stroke, paralysis and even death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Koyuncu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Engin et al., 2021</xref>). Understanding age- and sex-related patterns of virus receptor expression in the human brain may provide new insights into the neurological consequences of certain viral diseases. Here we use transcriptomic data on ssRNA viral receptor expression in the human brain to characterize and compare the development of those markers in females and males.</p><p id="P3">Various host factors, such as environment, virus characteristics, and host conditions, influence viral infections’ intensity, prevalence, and pathogenesis. A growing body of evidence emphasizes the importance of sex and age as dominant factors impacting how humans respond to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Peretz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Mauvais-Jarvis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jacobsen and Klein, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Samadizadeh et al., 2021</xref>). For example, men and older COVID-19 patients were more likely to be admitted to hospital, require ICU care and have a greater risk of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kaeuffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Prado-Galbarro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Rosenthal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Scully et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gujski et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Murthy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Rao et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, other Coronaviridae, such as SARS and MERS, showed a male bias in morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Wouk et al., 2021b</xref>). In contrast, post-acute-sequelae of COVID-19, commonly known as Long Covid, is more severe and persistent in women than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Sudre et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, women are more susceptible to certain viral infections, such as the Influenza A virus, with higher morbidity and mortality than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aaby et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Klein and Huber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Klein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Morgan and Klein, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Giurgea et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Viral particles can enter the brain via direct or indirect routes, and while the immune response rapidly clears most viruses, some can persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Nath and Johnson, 2022</xref>). Even cleared viruses may have already infected cells in the brain, leaving behind a range of neurological changes. For example, a recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce neurons and glia to fuse with neighbouring cells and create multinucleated syncytia, allowing for viral propagation from within one cell to the next (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Martínez-Mármol et al., 2023a</xref>). That process depends on receptors and co-factors such as hACE2, TMPRSS2 and NRP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Martínez-Mármol et al., 2023a</xref>). Moreover, other viruses such as rabies virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, poliovirus, measles virus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, Zika virus, dengue virus, Nipah virus, chikungunya virus can cause syncytia to form in pulmonary and cardiac tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Martínez-Mármol et al., 2023b</xref>). Viral infections may also lead to transcriptomic and structural changes in the host cells, such as the molecular signatures of brain aging and loss of cortical gray matter observed after severe COVID-19 infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Douaud et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Mavrikaki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>).

That step ensured that the trajectories represent change across the lifespan rather than the amount of gene expression. Next, locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) curves with 128 points were fit separately to the female and male z-scored data using the LOESS function in base R (span value of 0.75 and 95% confidence intervals (CI)). The curves were plotted with age on a log scale to better represent and visualize the rate of change that occurs across the lifespan, with rapid development in infancy and childhood and slower changes through adulthood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). These steps produced 2010 trajectories (2 sexes X 15 brain areas X 67 virus receptors).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Clustering Virus Receptor Genes Trajectories</title><p id="P12">The dimensionality of the data was reduced by performing unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the LOESS trajectories using the Ward.d2 algorithm (hclust function in base R). The resulting trajectory clusters reflect the minimum number of trajectories that captured how virus receptor gene expression changed across the lifespan in female and male brains. First, all 2010 trajectories were clustered to examine the overall range of trajectories and assess for sex biases in the trajectories where one sex was more likely to have virus receptor genes that followed a particular pattern. Second, the trajectories for genes in each of the 10 virus families were clustered separately. Third, the trajectories within the 15 brain areas were clustered independently. For each analysis, we selected the number of clusters (<italic>k</italic>) by calculating the total within-cluster sums of squares (WCSS) for a range of <italic>k</italic> and applying the elbow method (“elbow” package in R) and generating the average trajectory for each cluster. Finally, we validated the uniqueness of the cluster trajectories using the Fréchet distance metric to compare the shapes of the trajectories while maintaining the orderly progression of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Alt and Godau, 1995</xref>). The Fréchet distance is 0 for identical trajectories, and the greater the difference between the trajectories, the larger the Fréchet distance. All pairwise comparisons between the cluster trajectories were made, and the resulting Fréchet distances were analyzed using Estimation statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Ho et al., 2019</xref>). In all cases, the distribution of Fréchet distances showed similarity within clusters and different trajectories between clusters, thereby validating the unique patterns of molecular brain development identified by the different clusters.</p><p id="P13">To quantify sex differences, we started by calculating a Sex Bias index (SBI) for each cluster, which could range from +1 if a cluster had only female trajectories to 0 for an equal number of female and male trajectories to -1 for only male trajectories.

Ages with a consistently higher or lower number of differentially expressed genes across the p-values were selected as the reference ages. Statistical comparisons between the expression of the 67 virus receptor genes in females and males were made at each reference age. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to correct for multiple comparisons, and the q-value was calculated for each gene to control the false discovery rate (FDR) and identify genes with significant differential expression (q-value&lt;0.05). The results were visualized in a heatmap with 67 rows for the genes and 13 columns for the reference ages. The cells in the heatmap were colour-coded pink when females expressed more of the gene and green when males expressed more. The order of the rows was determined by a surrounding dendrogram so that genes with similar patterns of sex differences across the lifespan were grouped.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S14"><title>Non-linear undulating development of viral receptors in female and male brains</title><p id="P18">We applied a data-driven approach to characterize the development of virus receptors in the human brain and assess sex differences.

For example, about 1 in 150 people infected with the West Nile virus (WNV), a member of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, develop encephalitis with males being more susceptible to neuroinvasive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Carson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">James et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Yeung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Riccetti et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P48">The 4 receptors for WNV, CD209, CLEC4M, ITGAV, ITGB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref>, blue arrows) show a pattern of sex differences in childhood with fewer differences in young or older adults in DFC, A1C or HIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref>). In the DFC 3 of the 4 receptors (CD209, CLEC4M, ITGB3) had higher expression in infant females but switched to higher expression in male children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14A</xref>). In contrast, in the A1C, 3 of the 4 receptors (CD209, CLEC4M, ITGB3) had higher expression in male children and for CD209 that extended through adolescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14B</xref>). In the HIP, CD209 and ITGAV had higher expression in female infants and children while CLEC4M and ITGB3 had higher expression in male children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14C</xref>). In adults, the genes with differential expression all had higher expression in females, including CD209 and CLEC4M in DFC, ITGAV and ITGB3 in A1C, and CLEC4M and ITGAV in HIP. Thus, the pattern of sex- and age-related differential expression of the WNV receptor genes in these brain areas does not provide new insights into greater susceptibility of adult males to neuroinvasive symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Sensory motor deficit</title><p id="P49">Sensory-motor deficits encompass a range of neurological complications caused by viral infections, leading to symptoms such as paralysis, seizures, tinnitus, anosmia, balance and proprioception. These deficits are observed in individuals infected by various viruses, including the Enterovirus (EV) and the Rabies virus (RABV).</p><p id="P50">One of the prominent receptors for EV is SCARB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref>, orange arrow), which is involved in cellular processes such as lysosomal targeting and neuron repair and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kobayashi and Koike, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the distribution of SCARB2 is correlated with pathological changes observed after infection with the Enterovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Jiao et al., 2014</xref>). Two receptors for the RABV, NGFR and NCAM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref>, orange arrows), are essential factors regulating central nervous system growth and development and are widely expressed in the brain. Once inside the cell, RABV is readily transported from neuron to neuron, causing dysregulation of the cytoskeleton and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). All of these receptors had age- and sex-related differential expression and some variation among the brain areas. In the DFC, SCARB2 and NGFR had similar patterns of sex differences with higher expression in infant females, shifting to higher expression in older male children and then back to higher expression in females through adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14A</xref>). In A1C and HIP, both SCARB2 and NGFR had higher expression in young female children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14 B&amp;C</xref>). For SCARB2, that higher female expression extended through adolescence in A1C and returned in older female adults in HIP. In contrast with the female-dominated patterns for SCARB2 and NGFR, the expression of NCAM1 had higher expression in infant males in the DFC and A1C that shifted to higher female expression in older children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14 A&amp;B</xref>). In the HIP, NCAM1 had higher expression in adolescent females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14C</xref>). The high mortality caused by RABV continues to be a significant public health concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kumar et al., 2023</xref>). These patterns of age- and sex-related differences in virus receptor expression in the human brain may provide some insights into vulnerability to infection and sex-specific treatments.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Cognitive Impairments</title><p id="P51">Many viral infections cause cognitive deficits that can be acute or longer-lasting and include symptoms such as “brain fog” characterized by difficulties in organizing thoughts, multitasking, and problem-solving. Additionally, individuals may experience memory problems, executive function challenges, and cognitive fatigue, collectively impacting their cognitive abilities and overall cognitive performance. Two common viruses that have these symptoms are the SARS-CoV-2 virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Soriano et al., 2022</xref>), a member of the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family, and the Influenza A virus (IAV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hosseini et al., 2018</xref>), a member of the <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family.</p><p id="P52">All of the 7 SARS-CoV-2 receptors (ACE2, ADAM17, AXL, CTSL1, FURIN, NRP1, SCARB1)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref>, grey arrows) had sex- and age-related differential gene expression, but the pattern of sex differences differed between the cortical and subcortical areas. In the DFC and A1C, the sex differences were dominated by higher female expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14 A&amp;B</xref>). Still, in the HIP, most of the sex differences were dominated by males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14C</xref>). Only one receptor, ACE2, did not follow that pattern and had more expression in the DFC of older males and the A1C of males from infancy through adolescence, but weak differential expression in the HIP. In addition, many integrin co-factors that facilitate cell entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus had higher expression in adult females. The one exception was ITGA2, which had higher expression in adult males in the DFC, A1C and HIP. The higher expression of the integrins, especially in adult females, is interesting because that may contribute to some long-COVID symptoms by enhancing invasion of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain.</p><p id="P53">The 7 IAV receptors (ANXA5, CACNA1C, CD209, CD74, CLEC4M, EGFR, UVRAG)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref>, grey arrows) tended to have higher expression in female infants and young children. For example, in the DFC, all 7 genes had higher expression levels in young females, but 4 of them (ANXA5, CD209, CD74, UVRAG) switched to higher expression in older male children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14A</xref>). We found different patterns of sex differences in A1C and HIP. In A1C, 3 receptors (CACNA1C, CD209, CLEC4M) had higher expression levels in very young males. At the same time, the other 4 had higher expression in young females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14B</xref>). In HIP, 2 IAV receptors (CACNA1C, EGFR) had higher expression in young males, 4 receptors (ANXA5, CD74, CLEC4M, UVRAG) had higher expression in adolescent males and 3 in adult males (CACNA1C, CD74, UVRAG)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14C</xref>). These complex patterns differed among these 3 brain areas and suggested that considering the age, sex and the brain areas associated with the specific cognitive symptoms are important for understanding the neural basis of deficits caused by IAV infection.</p><p id="P54">Together, the DE-SWAN analyses revealed complex patterns of virus receptor sex differences at distinct stages of life, with many genes having differential expression during childhood and adolescence. Furthermore, we highlighted particular gene- and brain-area-specific patterns that might be associated with neurological complications accompanying some viral infections.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Sex-specific virus receptor development in the cortex</title><p id="P55">Finally, we analyzed the overall high-dimensional developmental patterns among the 15 brain areas for both sexes. For these analyses, the data frame was reorganized to focus on studying the development of the brain areas. That involved making a matrix with 30 rows, one for each brain (n=15) area and sex (n=2), and 8576 columns for the 128 LOESS fitted values for each of the 67 genes. Then we applied unsupervised hierarchical clustering to determine if the high dimensional pattern of brain-wide development would reveal groups of brain areas with similar development.</p><p id="P56">The cluster analysis identified 4 groups, including 2 large clusters with most brain areas but almost exclusively just 1 sex: one cluster with male-only data; one with mostly female data except for the male HIP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 15A</xref>). The other 2 small clusters had both sexes and data from the CBC or MD. Thus, even this optimized analysis found little evidence for brain area-specific development and instead highlighted that sex was the strongest driver of diversity in the data for most brain areas.</p><p id="P57">To further unpack these clusters, we applied tSNE visualization (denstsne in R) to provide a 2D representation of the high dimensional information about virus receptor development in the human brain. Colour-coding the tSNE plot for the 4 clusters showed good segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 15B</xref>), but adding colour-coding for age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 15C</xref>) did not reveal an overall pattern. Instead, colour-coding the data for sex and cortical vs subcortical showed an obvious sex-specific pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 15D</xref>). The trajectories for the 11 cortical areas were separated by sex on the tSNE plot, while the 4 subcortical areas (AMY, HIP, MD, CBC) for females and males were either adjacent to or nearby in the plot. The spatial separation of the female and male cortical areas supports the conclusion that virus receptor development in the human cortex follows distinct sex-specific programs. Furthermore, those programs are not simple shifts where one sex develops earlier than the other but instead they are unique development patterns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S31" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P58">This study characterized the sex-specific development of 67 ssRNA virus receptor and co-factor genes in the human brain. We applied high-dimensional analyses of the developmental trajectories for the virus genes in each brain area. Most trajectories have non-linear changes across the lifespan, including undulating trajectories. Surprisingly, there was little overlap between the sexes in the developmental trajectories for each gene in the brain areas. Further analysis showed that all 10 virus families had sex-specific development. Still, there was a range of sexual dimorphism among the virus families, with the <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> family having the most distinct difference between the development of females and males. By applying a sliding window differential gene analysis (DE-SWAN) to each of the 15 brain areas, we identified that most sex differences occurred in childhood before puberty. Notably, the disparity in virus receptor gene development between females and males was most distinct in the cortex, where the 2 sexes followed unique trajectories.</p><p id="P59">The gene- age- and sex-specific patterns found here may help to understand certain neurological symptoms associated with viral infections. For example, a prevalent view is that the immune response in females contributes to their better outcomes after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Scully et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Takahashi et al., 2020b</xref>). Our findings suggest that age- and sex-specific expression of virus receptors in the human brain may also contribute to sex differences in severity, comorbidity and presentation of neurological symptoms caused by neurotropic viral infections. That notion is consistent with observational data that the sex bias in disease outcomes is age- and virus-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Peretz et al., 2015</xref>) and the absence of a host factor can impede or prevent infection while an increased presence can enhance infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Song et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Martínez-Mármol et al., 2023b</xref>). Thus, our characterization of age- and sex-specific expression of virus receptors in the human brain identifies additional factors that may contribute to the vulnerability and variability of neurological symptoms caused by viral infection.</p><p id="P60">We designed this study to assess age- and sex-related differences in virus receptor development in the human brain. We applied a sensitive bioinformatics approach for assessing non-linear developmental patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lehallier et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">2020</xref>). In our study, we used LOESS regression models to trace lifespan trajectory patterns that followed the non-linear pattern of gene expression. That trajectory analysis takes advantage of all the data and does not force cases into predefined age bins that may not be appropriate for both sexes. Additionally, the unsupervised clustering effectively revealed differences among trajectories without any <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge about the sex, gene, or brain area. However, like all studies using the rare and valuable resources of developmental postmortem brain tissue, this study had a limited number of cases to analyze. To help with mitigating that limitation we used the most extensive transcriptomic database available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kang et al., 2011</xref>) and adopted this modern data-driven approach using sensitive analyses for describing the non-linear developmental patterns. We were surprised when those patterns revealed so many sex differences. Those sex differences reflect population-level changes in gene expression but may provide a framework for understanding individual differences in the impact of viral infections at different stages of the lifespan.</p><p id="P61">It is important to recognize that other factors such as gender, socio-economic status and access to healthcare contribute to differences in the impact of viral infections on females and males. However, that information is not collected by the brain banks. In addition, our study used transcriptomic data from individuals who died from accidents and a range of diseases, so it is impossible to tease apart the impact of the different causes of death. Nevertheless, the design of our study, the use of an extensive database, and the application of sensitive trajectory analyses provide a new understanding of virus-related sex differences in the human brain.</p><sec id="S32"><title>Sex differences within virus families and brain areas</title><p id="P62">The diversity of trajectories and lack of overlap between females and males for each virus family and brain area highlights the complex molecular environment for viral infections in the human brain. The cluster analysis showed that the various trajectory patterns included multiple genes, brain areas and virus species. However, they did not equally represent the two sexes. All of the virus families had at least 1 trajectory pattern that was strongly or exclusively female and most had a trajectory dominated by males. Since there are virus-specific sex biases in disease outcomes, we examined if sex biases in virus receptor expression were linked to specific virus species. Most of the sex biased trajectories represented multiple virus species but a few were dominated by or exclusive to 1 virus species. For example, the two female-only trajectories for the <italic>Pneumovirdae</italic> family represented receptors for different virus species. The trajectory that increased included receptors for the human metapneumovirus (HMPV) while the trajectory that decreased included receptors for the human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). Those findings may help to clarify the mechanisms that cause neurological complications in females after HMPV versus HRSV viral infections.</p><p id="P63">Previous studies found that WNV-infected females report more symptoms than WNV-infected males, but in the United States, males infected with WNV have higher rates of hospitalization and occurrence of neuroinvasive disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Curren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hoffman et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, hearing loss is one of the expected long-term outcomes of WNV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Weatherhead et al., 2015</xref>). Age is another factor in WNV, where neuroinvasive infection is more common in older adults, but it does occur in the pediatric population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Herring et al., 2019</xref>). Unfortunately, there is little information about sex differences in children’s symptoms with neuroinvasive WNV infections. The current findings about WNV receptor expression in children, where some have higher expression in females and others in males, will spur interest in examining if girls and boys have different outcomes after WNV infection.</p><p id="P64">One of the striking sex differences was the complete separation of virus receptor development in the cortical areas between females and males. Females are often described as developing precociously relative to males, but our findings paint a different picture. Instead, the high-dimensional analysis of all 67 receptors in the cortical areas showed that females and males have distinct developmental trajectories. They are not simply age-shifted; rather, the cortex of females and males have different molecular environments for virus receptors. This finding has broad implications for understanding the pathophysiology of neurological symptoms caused by viral infections.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>The majority of sex difference occur before puberty</title><p id="P65">Most sex differences in virus gene expression were found between birth and 10 to 12 years, before puberty. That timing stresses the importance of collecting high-quality sex-disaggregated data about the neurological impact of viral infection in children. Also, it highlights the need to explore more targeted treatments for viral infections in children. Those findings raise questions about the long-term impact of viral infection on brain development since the sex differences occur during rapid development and refinement of circuits in the brain. For example, inflammation caused by viral infections in the developing brain increases the risk of cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, cognitive impairment, and Parkinson’s disease (Hagberg et al., 2012; al-Haddad et al., 2019). The sex differences identified in our study provide a starting point to address the sex-specific impact of molecular mechanisms used by viruses to cause inflammation in the developing brain. Furthermore, those molecular differences may contribute to the prevalence of certain post-infection disorders observed in older children, teens and adults.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Viral infections may have sex-specific neuroinvasive impact in children</title><p id="P66">Many studies have examined the neuroinvasive impact and resulting pathology of viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Koyuncu et al., 2013</xref>). However, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need to understand the mechanisms underlying the neuroinvasive potential of viral agents and the subsequent acute and post-acute neurological manifestations. The need is particularly true for respiratory transmitted viruses as these infections contribute significantly to yearly morbidity and mortality rates impacting vulnerable populations such as young children, older adults, and individuals with weakened immune systems. In addition, they have different morbidity and mortality rates between females and males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bohmwald et al., 2018b</xref>; Tsai et al., 2021; Pelà et al., 2022). While acknowledging the variability in morbidity and mortality between sexes, it is worth noting that the extent of this variability can be influenced by complicated interaction between the host, virus and environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Peretz et al., 2015</xref>; Kumar et al., 2021b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Samadizadeh et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings shed light on overlooked sexual dimorphisms in the molecular mechanisms used by respiratory virus families and may inform prevention and management strategies for infected individuals, including asymptomatic cases that can still have long-term neurological complications.</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Model systems to study sex differences in the impact of viruses on the brain</title><p id="P67">Various animal models and, more recently, brain organoids are used to understand disease progression, pathogenesis, and host immune responses to neuroinvasive viruses. For COVID-19 research, several transgenic mice models engineered with human ACE2 (hACE2) simulate varying aspects of the disease, from lethal to non-lethal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Muñoz-Fontela et al., 2020</xref>). Those studies revealed the neural impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on both neurons and non-neuronal cells in the brain (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Song et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fernández-Castañeda et al., 2022</xref>), including fusion of neurons and glial cells into syncytia with pathological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Martínez-Mármol et al., 2023a</xref>). Furthermore, studies using non-human primates showed the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, and that neuronal damage is greater in older animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Beckman et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, brain organoids have provided invaluable insights into the neuroinvasive potential of the SARS-CoV-2, Zika, and Dengue virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Abreu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Sutarjono, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pellegrini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Song et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Martínez-Mármol et al., 2023b</xref>).</p><p id="P68">The over-representation of male animals is a significant shortcoming in understanding the mechanisms contributing to sex-specific symptoms and outcomes of viral infection. Nevertheless, when animal studies are designed to examine the impact of sex on viral infections, they often identify key differences (Barna 1996,Wynne 2011,Snyder-Keller 2019,Yirrell 1987,Yan 2021). An ideal animal model should explore a range of host-virus interactions that would facilitate the translational potential of preclinical studies.</p><p id="P69">In conclusion, our study identified a complex spatiotemporal pattern of sex differences in developing ssRNA virus receptors in the human brain. Surprisingly, most sex differences occurred before puberty and were most robust in the cortex.</p><p id="P70">Viral receptors are the first line of interaction and the spatiotemporal expression of the receptors plays a key role in understanding the pathogenesis of various infectious symptoms. Identifying the precise timing of receptor differences in males and females provides invaluable insight, guiding us toward developing more effective treatments. We hope the sex differences identified here will serve as a call to action for future studies into the neuroinvasive impact of viruses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Fig 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS189611-supplement-Supplemental_Fig_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Fig 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS189611-supplement-Supplemental_Fig_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplemental Fig 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS189611-supplement-Supplemental_Fig_3.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplemental Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS189611-supplement-Supplemental_Table_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d38aAdEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplemental Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS189611-supplement-Supplemental_Table_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d38aAdEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplemental Table 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS189611-supplement-Supplemental_Table_3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d38aAdEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS189611-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAdEhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S36"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We recognize that our McMaster University laboratory is located on the traditional territories of the Mississauga and Haudenosaunee nations and within the lands protected by the “Dish with One Spoon” wampum agreement.
