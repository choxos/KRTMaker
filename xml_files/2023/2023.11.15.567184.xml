By combining Cell Painting, a morphological profiling assay that captures diverse cellular states, with the bi-potent HepaRG<sup>®</sup> liver progenitor cell line, we have developed a high-throughput, single-cell technique, to track liver cell fate and map small-molecule induced changes using a morphological atlas of bi-lineage liver cell differentiation. To our knowledge this is the first-time single-cell trajectory inference has been applied to image-based Cell Painting data and leveraged for drug screening. The overarching goal of this new method is to aid research into understanding liver cell regeneration mechanisms and facilitate the development of cell-based and small-molecule therapies. Using this approach, we have identified a class of small-molecule SRC family kinase inhibitors that promote differentiation of HepaRG<sup>®</sup> single-cells towards the hepatocyte-like lineage and promotes differentiation of primary human hepatic progenitor cells towards a hepatocyte-like phenotype <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Hepatocytes are long-lived quiescent cells that, within the context of the liver <italic>in vivo</italic>, retain their proliferative capacity, thus allowing for homeostatic and injury-induced liver regeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. However, in chronic liver disease the proliferative capacity of hepatocytes is diminished. The expansion of hepatic progenitor cells, which have the potential to differentiate into functional hepatocytes, represents an alternative pathway for liver regeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. However, the extent of the contribution and the mechanisms responsible for this alternative pathway are unclear, and the only curative option for patients with severe chronic liver disease is liver transplantation. Unfortunately, donor organ availability does not meet demand, and, for example, in the UK approximately 20% of patients die waiting for a donor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, making liver disease responsible for 4% of all deaths (1 in every 25 deaths) worldwide accounting for two million deaths annually <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently required for the treatment of advanced liver disease.</p><p id="P3">Both cell-based and small-molecule therapies hold promise as alternative strategies to whole organ transplant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, two major barriers remain; firstly, <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation of adult human hepatocytes is limited and challenging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and the generation of functionally mature liver cell types <italic>in vitro</italic> is only partial since primary human hepatocytes rapidly lose most of their differentiated functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. These challenges limit the application of cell-based therapies and the study of liver cell functions <italic>in vitro</italic> and must be overcome for the liver research field to exploit alternative therapeutic strategies to treat liver disease. This project therefore aims to identify small-molecule modulators of liver progenitor cell status, particularly those that promote the generation of fully mature liver cell types, to aid cell banking, research into liver cell regeneration mechanisms, and the development of cell-based and small-molecule therapies to treat liver disease.</p><p id="P4">To track cell state transitions involved in liver cell differentiation we sought to use multiparametric high-content cellular morphological profiling which offers an inexpensive, high-throughput, single-cell, spatially resolved alternative to RNA-sequencing for profiling cell states. High-content imaging is having a major impact at all stages of the drug discovery process <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, despite collecting single-cell information within each image most data analysis is performed on aggregated cell populations at the “well level”, and single-cell analysis pipelines have not been developed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In 2013 the Cell Painting assay was developed as an unbiased, cell based, morphological high-content profiling assay capable of capturing subtle changes in morphology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. It combines six fluorescent dyes, imaged in five channels, to visualise eight cellular components and organelles; nuclei, F-actin, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, golgi, plasma membrane, cytoplasmic RNA and nucleoli <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Quantitative data can then be extracted from microscopy images to identify the phenotypic impact of chemical or genetic perturbations. Due to the broad morphological information contained in the images, Cell Painting has been exploited for many research applications, including clustering chemical and genetic perturbations based on their morphological impact, identifying disease phenotypes, drug screening, toxicity prediction and mechanism of action prediction using machine learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">By combining Cell Painting with the bi-potent HepaRG<sup>®</sup> liver progenitor cell line, we have developed a high-throughput single-cell technique to track liver cell fate during bi-lineage differentiation. In this work we describe the first morphological assay to leverage the mathematics of trajectory inference and apply it to high dimensional, single-cell, morphological data to track liver cell fate and identify small-molecule modulators of liver cell differentiation.</p><p id="P6">The HepaRG<sup>®</sup> cell line is a popular <italic>in vitro</italic> model and primary human hepatocyte surrogate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The HepaRG<sup>®</sup> progenitor cells demonstrate bi-lineage differentiation potential and produce a mixed population of hepatocyte-like and biliary-like cells over the course of four weeks with the addition of commercially available differentiation supplements halfway through the process <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Using the Cell Painting assay to capture the morphological changes induced by a bioactivity compound library of 496 target-annotated small molecules we identified compounds that induced the same differentiated morphological phenotype as the differentiation supplement at the image level. We then developed a single-cell analysis pipeline to track liver cell differentiation using the Cell Painting data and applied trajectory inference to build a single-cell morphological atlas of liver cell differentiation. Finally, we overlaid the drug induced data to gain single-cell resolution into the drug induced changes to assess how the compounds altered liver cell fates and lineages.</p><p id="P7">From this work we have identified compounds and their putative targets and pathways that support expansion and appropriate lineage commitment, to aid the development of cell-based and small-molecule therapies to treat liver disease. Further, we have taken our hepatocyte promoting compounds, including SRC family kinase (SFK) inhibitors and validated them in primary human hepatic progenitor cells, where partial differentiation into hepatocytes is inferred through an increase in hepatic functional markers such as HNF4a and Cyp2E1.</p><p id="P8">Overall, we have developed a high-throughput morphological cell state tracking pipeline at the single-cell level to identify small molecule modulators of liver cell differentiation which were subsequently validated in lower throughput primary human hepatic progenitor differentiation assays. Single-cell morphological profiling represents a holistic, high-throughput and inexpensive method to quantify cell state transitions and is applicable to many assays systems, providing deeper insights into the impact of small-molecule perturbations on cellular differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell Painting can be used to morphologically distinguish liver cell states</title><p id="P9">The bi-potent liver progenitor cells HepaRG<sup>®</sup>, undergo differentiation producing a mixed population of biliary-like and hepatocyte-like cells. During this differentiation process the cells undergo distinct morphological changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To identify molecules that modulate liver cell differentiation, we developed a high-content morphological assay protocol in 384-well plate format, compatible with automated high-throughput imaging, to track liver cell differentiation by applying Cell Painting to the bi-potent HepaRG<sup>®</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To begin with we first assessed the ability of the Cell Painting assay to distinguish the HepaRG<sup>®</sup> progenitors from our positive control, HepaRG<sup>®</sup> Differentiation Medium Supplement, and negative control, HepaRG<sup>®</sup> Growth Medium Supplement (here after referred to as differentiated control and undifferentiated control) after eight days in cell culture. Initial analysis was performed using the well level median morphology metrics, an industry standard approach for high-content drug screening. At the end of the eight days the differentiated controls are partially differentiated, forming a mix of hepatocyte-like and biliary-like cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). This assay format allows us to identify modulators of liver cell differentiation including those that increase differentiation of the cells beyond that of the differentiated controls within the 8-day assay period.</p><p id="P11">Quantification of the controls was carried out using the median cell value for 848 morphological features extracted using Cell Profiler. Principal component analysis and Pearson distance to the positive controls across four separate plate replicates shows clear separation of the controls and reproducible differentiation phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c and d</xref>). Coefficient of variation (CV) for Pearson distance ranges from 1.2-14.6 % across the control classes and plate Z-primes range from 0.17-0.65 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) across four plates. Further, a three-class Random Forest machine learning classifier trained to distinguish the controls from each other performed with an accuracy score of 1 (100% accurate) across the three classes. Together this demonstrates a robust assay for drug screening.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Identification of small-molecule modulators of liver cell bilineage differentiation</title><p id="P12">We used this assay to profile 496 compounds from a library of bioactive target annotated compounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) screened at two concentrations (5μM and 0.5 μM) to identify hit compounds that promote the differentiation of HepaRG<sup>®</sup> liver cells. We identified 27 hits that had a Pearson distance of less than 0.9 to the differentiated control (+differentiation supplement) and a Euclidean distance of less than 1.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a and b</xref>). Hits belong to several classes of compounds including HDAC inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, and SRC family kinase (SFK) inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). HDAC inhibitors have previously been shown to promote the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into hepatocyte-like cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, highlighting the ability of our HepaRG<sup>®</sup> cell assay to identify biologically relevant small-molecules and pathways.</p><p id="P13">To confirm initial compound screening hits we performed 8-point semi-log dose response tests on resupplied compound material. Further, noting that PP1 and PP2 both belong to the pyrazolopyrimidine class of cell permeable compounds that has been shown to inhibit SFK members; Lck, Fyn, Hck, and Src, as well as non-Src family kinases such as CSK, RIP2, and CK1δ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, we added two further SFK inhibitors (dasatinib; a dual SRC/ABL inhibitor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and NXP900; a highly selective SFK inhibitor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>) to the list of compounds in order to determine if PP1 and PP2 were acting via SFK inhibition or other kinase targets. In total we re-tested 14 compounds in triplicate multiparametric dose responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). All compounds validated showing dose dependent activity except ZM336372 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Overall, the most potent hits were the SFK inhibitors, all of which validated, with the most selective SFK inhibitor, NXP900, being the most potent hit with an IC50 of 3nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d and e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Single-cell morphological analysis</title><p id="P14">To gain insights at the single-cell resolution and to understand how the compound hits modulate cell fate towards the two different cell lineages, we built a single-cell morphological atlas of HepaRG<sup>®</sup> bilineage differentiation and then overlaid the single-cell drug induced changes on top.</p><p id="P15">To build the morphological atlas of HepaRG<sup>®</sup> differentiation we captured Cell Painting images every 24-72 hrs from 20 time points over the course of the full four-week differentiation protocol to track the morphological changes associated with HepaRG<sup>®</sup> bilineage differentiation at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). UMAP analysis of the single-cell time course data over the entire differentiation process generates a continuous trajectory of cellular bilineage differentiation from a starting population of progenitors (Day 1) all the way through to two distinct final cell populations (Day 28) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To confirm that the two final cell populations are the expected clusters of hepatocyte-like and biliary-like cells we used known cellular morphological markers to identify the cell populations, similar to the use of gene expression markers in single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Here we used mitochondrial intensity to identify the metabolically active mature hepatocyte-like population, and cell and nuclear size to identify the biliary-like and progenitor populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Overall the divergence of two separate cell populations demarked by expected morphological features is clear, demonstrating the ability of Cell Painting to track a complex process such as bilineage differentiation at the single-cell level.</p><p id="P17">Having confirmed the ability of the assay to resolve the different cell populations and build a continuous morphological atlas of the bilineage differentiation, we next overlaid the small molecule compound screening data. Firstly, we assessed the effects of the controls at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Importantly, the “spiked in” progenitor control from the screen (seeded 24hrs before the end of the assay) overlay completely with the original 24hr timepoint from the timecourse data used to create the single-cell morphological atlas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), demonstrating the ability to merge datasets at the single-cell level after plate-based standardisation to the controls. Secondly, the differentiated control samples in the screening assay push the cells closer to the final timepoints in the timecourse data compared to the undifferentiated control but the cells do not reach full maturity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This was expected since the screening assay was only 8 days long.</p><p id="P18">We next overlaid the single-cell data for compound treatments of interest at three concentrations (1, 3 and 10 μM). The confirmed compound treatments show dose dependent shifts in the cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref> and c and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Consistent with the image level analysis, the SFK inhibitors demonstrate the greatest effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b and c</xref>) and again, the selective SFK inhibitor NXP900 was found to be the most potent. Of interest both the approved SFK inhibitor, Dasatinib and particularly NXP900, very clearly favour the hepatic lineage in a dose dependent manner.</p><p id="P19">Strikingly in the image level analysis, the top concentration of NXP900 (10 uM) appears to deviate from the desired phenotype since the Euclidean distance to the positive control increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In multiparametric high-content phenotypic profiling studies such deviations at high concentrations are common and are often thought to be a consequence of cytotoxicity. However, the single-cell analysis reveals that this is because NXP900 treatment has dramatically altered the cell type composition, highly enriching the hepatocyte-like population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This highlights the additional information and resolution achievable when using the single-cell level data in comparison to the industry standard image level analysis of drug treatments. Further the SFK inhibitor NXP900, and Dasatinib to a certain extent, appear to promote hepatic differentiation in the 8 day assay to the same extent as the final timepoints in the timecourse data when the cells have had the full 4 weeks to differentiate, therefore outperforming the differentiated controls in the assay, indicating that the SFK inhibitors significantly accelerate the hepatocyte differentiation process.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Trajectory Inference</title><p id="P20">In order to quantify biological progression through this process of bilineage differentiation, we computationally inferred the differentiation trajectory of liver cells from the single-cell Cell Painting atlas by pseudo-time mapping using the slingshot method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. This produced two lineage trajectories starting from the single-cell progenitor population as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). We then projected the NXP900 single-cell data onto the liver differentiation trajectories to determine the pseudotime scores and quantitatively compare NXP900 induced differentiation with the controls. NXP900 led to much greater pseudotime values for the hepatocyte lineage when compared to both the undifferentiated control and the differentiated control (commercially available supplement, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">methods</xref>), supporting the idea that NXP900 is promoting the hepatocyte-like cells in the HepaRG<sup>®</sup> line, and further, promoting a more mature hepatocyte-like cell than the differentiated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). To quantitatively compare how the compounds affected the ratios of the two mature cell types we used the lineage weightings to assign each cell to either the progenitor (pre-branching of the two lineages), the hepatocyte, or the biliary lineage. From this we can see that the majority of the progenitor control cells map to the portion of the trajectory that is pre-branching (progenitors), while the differentiated control and most of the hit compounds lead to a nearly 50:50 split of the biliary and hepatocyte lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). NXP900 and Dasatinib cause a significant increase in cells along the hepatic lineage, increasing the proportion to over 75% in the NXP900 treated populations. This could have important implications in minimising heterogeneity <italic>in vitro</italic> and enabling more efficient engraftment <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Validation of hits in primary human hepatic progenitor cells</title><p id="P21">Our morphological single-cell trajectory inference of small molecule compound perturbations suggests that SFK inhibitors promote the hepatocyte-like lineage in the HepaRG<sup>®</sup> cells, something that cannot be detected using the image level data. Small molecules that can be added to culture media as a supplement to promote the functional maturity of primary hepatocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> are of great interest to the liver regeneration community. We therefore chose to test the SFK inhibitors in primary adult human hepatic progenitor cells (HPC), bipotent cells isolated from discarded donor organs, to measure multiple functional hepatic markers and confirm the ability of the compounds to induce differentiation of human HPC towards a hepatocyte-like phenotype. The following markers, HNF4a (an essential transcription factor involved in the functional differentiation of hepatocytes during development), CYP2E1 (cytochrome P450 enzyme) and albumin (Essential role in transportation) were selected to infer hepatocyte differentiation. Biliary epithelial cell marker, CK7 and proliferation marker Ki67 were also included in the phenotypic panel. Incubation of human HPC with the SFK inhibitors NXP900, PP1 and PP2 all demonstrate a significant increase in the proportion of cells expressing Cyp2E1 and HNF4a compared to untreated controls. Albumin expression remained low across all compound treatments, suggesting only partial differentiation at this timepoint. Of note, PP1 also significantly reduced the biliary epithelial marker CK7, suggestive of a phenotypic shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a and b</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We further tested several other hits from the HepaRG<sup>®</sup> screen in the primary human HPC and found that several hits increased a single hepatocyte functional marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Interestingly, the PI3K-AKT inhibitor, Wortmannin demonstrated a 40% increase in HNF4a expression coupled with a reduction in CK7 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>), suggestive of differentiation.</p><p id="P23">Taken together, these data validate the use of single-cell morphological trajectory inference assay to identify candidate small-molecule modulators of liver cell differentiation for further testing in primary human cells. Of particular interest would be the use of SFK inhibitor NXP900 as well as the PI3K-AKT inhibitor, Wortmannin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">During development, in response to endogenous and exogenous stimuli, disease onset, and throughout life, cells transition from one functional “state” to another <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

This technique will be particularly powerful when applied to multi-cellular assays as exemplified here in the mixed lineage analysis where cell non-autonomous or cell-type specific responses to perturbations can be assessed within the context of complex multi-cell assays. Further since the analysis strategy models biology as a continuous trajectory, we can triage for off-target and unwanted trajectories caused by compounds while previously we have only been able to assess perturbations in terms of distance to static phenotypes of interest.

It is our understanding that ours is the first study to demonstrate a role for small molecule SFK inhibitors in the promotion of hepatocyte progenitor differentiation and as a potential therapeutic opportunity for liver regeneration.</p><p id="P29">In contrast to currently approved dual Src-Abl inhibitors, including dasatinib, which block SRC in the active “open” conformation (promoting the association of Src and signalling partners via allosteric facilitation) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, NXP900 binds and locks Src tyrosine kinase in a closed inactive conformation, inhibiting both scaffolding and catalytic activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. The novel mechanism of action of NXP900 contributes to its unique target selectivity profile with 1000-fold selectivity for SFK members over ABL kinase and results in highly potent, selective and sustained pathway inhibition, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Dasatinib is already FDA approved and NXP900 has progressed into phase 1 clinical studies and thus each represent promising drug candidates to stimulate endogenous or exogenously administered (i.e., cell therapy) liver cell differentiation in situ to restore damaged liver function. The SFK inhibitors could also be used as a cell culture additive to maintain liver differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> for biological investigation and drug discovery applications.</p><p id="P30">In summary, we describe a novel application of trajectory inference to high-throughput morphological data to quantify cell state transitions at the single-cell level in a high-throughput screening format. We have demonstrated the utility of the method by application to a small molecule compound library screen in a liver progenitor differentiation assay and validated the hits by confirming activity in lower throughput primary human hepatic progenitor differentiation assays. This demonstrates our assay is validated in a high-throughput format and suitable for screening larger libraries of target-annotated compounds and diverse chemicals to identify additional therapeutic targets and chemical starting points and thus launch new drug discovery programs for liver regeneration. The validated hits from the pilot screen include a series of SFK inhibitors revealing a novel role for SRC (and other SFK members) in accelerating hepatocyte differentiation. Future work to demonstrate the clinical utility of SFK inhibitors in promoting liver regeneration includes <italic>in vitro</italic> functional assays such as drug metabolism and albumin secretion. Further, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies to investigate the effects on efficiency of expansion and differentiation of exogenously applied hepatocytes as well as the ability to directly target endogenous HPC repair mechanisms will be important. Finally, single-cell morphological trajectory inference is applicable to other high-content image-based assays, particularly stem cell differentiation and disease progression and thus has broad utility for comprehensive investigation of modulators of cell state transitions.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>HepaRG<sup>®</sup> cell culture</title><p id="P31">Cells were supplied by Biopredic International and cultured according to the user guide.
