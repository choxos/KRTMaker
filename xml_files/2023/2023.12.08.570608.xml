Yet the extent of noise, including false-positives, associated with these methodologies, is difficult to quantify as experimental approaches for validating the results are generally low throughput. To address this, we introduce pyRBDome, a pipeline for enhancing RNA-binding proteome data <italic>in silico</italic>. It aligns the experimental results with RNA-binding site (RBS) predictions from distinct machine learning tools and integrates high-resolution structural data when available. Its statistical evaluation of RBDome data enables quick identification of likely genuine RNA-binders in experimental datasets. Furthermore, by leveraging the pyRBDome results, we have enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of RBS detection through training new ensemble machine learning models. pyRBDome analysis of a human RBDome dataset, compared with known structural data, revealed that while UV cross-linked amino acids were more likely to contain predicted RBSs, they infrequently bind RNA in high-resolution structures. This discrepancy underscores the limitations of structural data as benchmarks, positioning pyRBDome as a valuable alternative for increasing confidence in RBDome datasets.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play diverse and crucial roles in gene expression by influencing the structure, function and stability of RNA, both co- and post-transcriptionally. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Holmqvist &amp; Vogel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Glisovic <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). RBPs have been associated with many human diseases, including neurological disorders, muscular atrophies and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Castello <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). In bacteria, RBPs make key contributions to rapid adaptation to challenging environments, and in pathogens, they control virulence and the capacity for host infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Christopoulou &amp; Granneman, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Holmqvist &amp; Vogel, 2018</xref>). Due to their key functions, considerable efforts are being made to identify RBPs in diverse organisms and to characterise these proteins functionally and structurally. This has inspired the development of several high-throughput methods that capture all proteins interacting with RNA (RBPome). These methods usually involve UV or chemical treatment of cells to create covalent bonds between proteins and direct RNA substrates. This is followed by enrichment of the cross-linked RNA-protein complexes and identification of proteins by quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Esteban-Serna <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>)). Common approaches for enriching RNA-protein complexes include using oligo(dT) beads to capture proteins cross-linked to polyadenylated RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Castello <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Baltz <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Stenum <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>), silica beads that capture all RNAs and cross-linked proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Asencio <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Chu <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Shchepachev <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Trendel <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Beckmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>) or organic–aqueous phase separation methods that rely on the fact that cross-linked RNAs alter the physiochemical properties of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Queiroz <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Trendel <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Urdaneta <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). To identify the cross-linked proteins, purified complexes are treated with ribonucleases and analysed by MS.</p><p id="P4">These ground-breaking studies have uncovered a plethora of novel RBPs in diverse organisms, many of which contain domains that have never been associated with RNA-binding before. While having a comprehensive list of all RBPs in your favourite organism is tremendously valuable, the next most informative piece of information would be the location of the RNA-binding domains (RBDs) within these proteins (RBDome), as this would allow mechanistic insights into RNA recognition and the design of mutations to dissect the physiological significance of RNA-binding. Although protocols for the global identification of putative RBPs have been optimised for diverse organisms, identifying the amino acid sequences UV cross-linked to RNA (and therefore likely directly bind RNA <italic>in vivo</italic>) in RBPome data is both experimentally and computationally challenging. To identify amino acid-RNA adducts, the cross-linked RNA is chemically or enzymatically digested to make detection of the cross-linking site by MS feasible. However, this digestion is often incomplete, and the heterogeneity in the length and sequence of nucleotide adducts generates variable mass shifts.</p><p id="P5">This dramatically increases the MS/MS search space, making detection of the cross-linking sites using conventional MS data analysis programs unfeasible. To overcome this problem, several experimental computational MS workflows have been developed that either directly detect peptide-RNA conjugates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kong <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kramer <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Schmidt <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Trendel <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Yu <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Götze <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Knörlein <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>) or identify putative RNA-binding sites (RBSs) by relying on the fact that sequences neighbouring the cross-linked peptides <italic>can</italic> be identified by conventional MS (RBDmap; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Castello <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>)), allowing extrapolation of sequences most likely cross-linked to RNA. Recent RBDome methods (RBS-ID and pRBS-ID) utilise hydrofluoride to chemically digest RNAs cross-linked to peptides to a single nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">2021</xref>). This greatly reduces the computational workload, increasing the sensitivity of cross-linking site detection at single amino acid resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">2021</xref>).</p><p id="P6">While RBDome and RBPome methods have generated a wealth of valuable data, each has its own caveats and noise levels. Thus, there is a possibility of recovering many false positive hits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bogdanow <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Nesvizhskii <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). For example, although RBDome methods promise single amino acid resolution of binding site identification, there is a degree of uncertainty when it comes to mapping the cross-linked amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kim &amp; Pevzner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Edwards, 2013</xref>). Moreover, a recent study has shown that UV cross-linked amino acids detected by these methods can also be indirectly cross-linked to RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Knörlein <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Evidently, experimental validation of the findings is critical; however, the available methodologies are generally low throughput, making it challenging to quantify what fraction of RBDome data are biologically meaningful. An alternative approach would be to enhance the reliability of the experimental results using computional approaches. For example, one could calculate what fraction of cross-linked amino acids in RBDome data are in known RBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Queiroz <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bae <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">2020</xref>) or interact with RNA in available crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Knörlein <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). To conduct a meaningful statistical analysis, however, a ground truth dataset is required that (ideally) consists of a large collection of high-resolution structures of protein-RNA complexes. However, such datasets are not readily available, especially for model organisms for which few protein-RNA complexes have been structurally characterised. This includes one of our favourite model organisms: <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Furthermore, although extremely informative, ground truth datasets are not exhaustive, as they generally only contain relatively stable interactions that can be structurally characterised.</p><p id="P7">As an alternative, but also complementary, approach for assessing and enhancing the quality of experimental RBPome and RBDome data, we developed a Python computational pipeline (pyRBDome). This pipeline compares results from these high-throughput analyses against a large database of predicted RNA-binding residues. The pipeline generates this database for proteins of interest using a wide variety of different prediction tools that utilise distinct approaches for predicting RNA-binding sequences. Subsequently, the pipeline aggregates the results and putative RBSs are superimposed on (model) structures and other human-readable formats. When provided with RBPome data, the pipeline enables users to extract the most likely RNA-binders and identify amino acids most likely to bind RNA. When provided with a list of cross-linked peptides (RBD-Map, RBDome data), and amino acids (RBDome data), pyRBDome identifies the most common peptide motifs associated with RNA-binding and determines whether the data are significantly enriched for predicted RBSs by calculating 3D distances between experimental and predicted RBSs. By displaying Pfam domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Mistry <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) identified in 3D structures, the user can easily determine the domains involved in the interactions. By clustering the cross-linking sites/peptides in domain structures, pyRBDome can identify interfaces within domains involved in RNA-binding. In conclusion, pyRBDome can reveal important mechanistic insights into RNA recognition, greatly facilitating further experimental validation of RNA-binding.</p><p id="P8">A second and equally important motivation for developing this pipeline was to make the analysis of RBP/RBDome datasets more accessible to groups that do not routinely perform such experiments or wish to analyse existing datasets. Moreover, because the pyRBDome code was written as Python Classes with associated test Jupyter notebooks, these can also be readily incorporated into new software tools.</p><p id="P9">Here we demonstrate how pyRBDome can effectively identify putative RNA-binding sequences in human and bacterial proteins and enhance RBDome datasets computationally. Moreover, using machine learning (ML), we show that combining prediction results from distinct computational tools employed in pyRBDome can enhance the sensitivity and specificity of computational prediction of RNA-binding amino acids in RBPs. We provide a detailed comparison with human structures of protein-RNA complexes, which revealed that UV cross-linking sites in proteins often correlate with the proximity to RNA in structurally characterised protein-RNA complexes, but not necessarily with direct RNA interaction.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The pyRBDome pipeline</title><p id="P10">The main goal of this project was to develop a pipeline that would enable us to evaluate and enhance the quality of RBPome and RBDome datasets. The pyRBDome pipeline is written in Python, and the various analysis steps are provided in a series of Jupyter notebooks to facilitate the process of following, controlling and adjusting the analysis steps. The pipeline consists of two parts: pyRBDome-Core and pyRBDome-Notebooks. The former contains the Python classes and functions that are required for running the pyRBDome-Notebooks code.</p><p id="P11">Each class in pyRBDome-Core has associated test Jupyter notebooks, making it easy to learn how to run the code. This should facilitate incorporation of the code into new bioinformatics tools. All the notebooks can be run either in Jupyter, or in the terminal using papermill (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</ext-link>). A schematic representation of the entire pipeline is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. EV1</xref>. A minimum requirement for running the pipeline is a CSV file with a list of UniProt IDs for their proteins of interest. The pipeline will then enable users to identify putative RNA-binding amino acids within these proteins. If a list of putative RNA-binding peptides or amino acids for these UniProt IDs was provided, such as data from RBDMap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Castello <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>), or RBS-ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">2021</xref>), the pipeline will enable the user to identify which among the provided sequences/amino acids contains predicted RNA-binding residues, enabling effective selection of sequences that are likely to bind RNA. An example of such a CSV input file is provided in Dataset EV1. To facilitate these analyses, pyRBDome relies on multiple distinct RBS prediction tools. Considering the large size of RBS-ID and RBDMap data, and therefore the need to process a substantial number of proteins within a reasonable timeframe, the selection of these tools was based not only on their performance, but also on their runtime, and the ability to submit many proteins to webservers (also see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Discussion</xref>).</p><p id="P12">RBS predictions are generally based on a wide range of features, such as amino acid sequence, structural data, and physicochemical properties of the studied proteins. Two of the computational programs used were specifically designed to identify potential RBSs using protein structure (aaRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>)) and/or sequence information (aaRNA and RNABindRPlus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Walia <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>)). However, a potential limitation of using these programs is that they were trained on data from known RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which might make them less effective in identifying RNA-binding residues in unconventional RBPs. Therefore, we also analysed our data using BindUP, which predicts RBSs based on the electrostatic features on the protein surface and can more reliably detect non-canonical RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Paz <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). RBSs can sometimes overlap with small molecule binding sites of enzymes, such as in the case of GAPDH, aconitase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Walden <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), and thymidine synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Chu <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>). Hence, we used FTMap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Brenke <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>) to find putative small molecule binding sites in structures. FTMap identifies possible ligand-binding pockets by globally docking a series of small organic probes onto the input structures to identify protein regions that represent binding hotspots. Incorporating FTMap data also offers the additional benefit of enabling the selection of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with a higher likelihood of being druggable. Additionally, many RBPs contain flexible and/or disordered domains, which are common in eukaryotic species. Therefore, we also included DisoRDPbind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Peng &amp; Kurgan, 2015</xref>), which predicts RBSs in intrinsically disordered regions.</p><p id="P13">Consequently, pyRBDome integrates five independent yet complementary computational methodologies to compare against biochemically derived RNA-interacting protein sequences. While each approach has its own degree of uncertainty, our rationale lies in the consistency across these methods to identify amino acids more likely to be <italic>bona fide</italic> RBSs.</p><p id="P14">Several of the aforementioned tools rely on structural data to make their predictions. If available, the pipeline automatically downloads these structures from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rcsb.org">rcsb.org</ext-link>. In cases where such information is unavailable, pyRBDome retrieves structural estimates generated by AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Jumper <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) or the homology modelling server SWISS-MODEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Holm &amp; Rosenström, 2010</xref>). This facilitates the analysis of RBPome and RBDome data from less well characterised model organisms.</p><p id="P15">To compare the experimental data to the predictions, for each peptide sequence provided, the pipeline calculates the minimal distance (in Å) to RBSs predicted by the individual tools. It stores its progress, such as whether files have been downloaded from webservers or specific tasks have been completed, as well as the analysis results in an SQLite database. The final results can subsequently be exported to CSV files where for each cross-linked peptide (Dataset EV2) or amino acid (Dataset EV3) provided, the pipeline reports where in the PDB file the peptide was mapped to and how frequently a predicted RNA-binding amino acid was detected. Manual inspection of the data in PyMOL revealed that cross-linked peptides and amino acids were often found near known RBSs. Therefore, we consider cross-linked sequences (peptides or amino acids) that are in close proximity of predicted sites (within hydrogen bonding distance (4.2Å) as a starting point) as promising hits. Thus, for each amino acid in each protein, the pipeline also reports its distance to predicted RBSs and distance to RNA molecules in known structures, if this information is available (Dataset EV5). Finally, using Interproscan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Quevillon <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), locations of domains within the protein sequences are determined, making it possible to identify domains involved in RNA-binding. The tables that are generated by the pipeline make it straightforward to statistically identify sequences obtained from RBDome experiments that are more likely to be <italic>bona fide</italic> RNA-binders.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>UV cross-linking data infrequently agrees with structural data</title><p id="P16">To showcase the feasibility of pyRBDome, we applied the pipeline to a recent human RBS-ID RBDome dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). This dataset was chosen because, at the start of this project, it was the richest cross-linking dataset available: It includes data for almost 600 human RBPs and predicted RNA cross-linked amino acids for each protein. To facilitate the comparison of experimental data with predictions, pyRBDome requires peptide sequences that are at least 4 amino acids long as it needs to locate these sequences in 3D (model) structures. However, because the published RBS-ID data only provided the locations of cross-linked amino acids, we artificially extended these sequences on both ends with varying lengths (up to 27 amino acids; arbitrary number) to generate a dataset that we refer to as the “cross-linked peptide” dataset. The results of the pyRBDome analyses of this dataset is organised in tabular form in Dataset EV4.</p><p id="P17">If the user provides amino acid cross-linking data, the pipeline determines the preferentially cross-linked amino acids. Consistent with previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), pyRBDome identified cysteines and the aromatic amino acids tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine as the most cross-linked amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. EV2A</xref>). Therefore, the user should expect to see a similar enrichment in their data. The pipeline performs the same analysis by grouping the amino acids into bins based on their physicochemical properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. EV2B</xref>), which identified sulphur-containing and aromatic amino acids as preferentially cross-linked. pyRBDome also enables the user to determine if sequences from specific domains were preferentially cross-linked. Using the InterProScan package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Jones <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Blum <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) pyRBDome searches for domains within the proteins identified in the experimental data and it then counts how frequently cross-linked peptides and amino acids were mapped to these domains. Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), the canonical RNA recognition motif (RRM) and hnRNP K homology (KH) RBDs were the most enriched domains in the cross-linking data, followed by zinc finger (ZnF: C2H2, CCCH, and CCHC), WD40 repeats, and Helicase/DEAD domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. EV2C</xref>).</p><p id="P18">A second reason for choosing this human RBS-ID dataset was that high-resolution protein-RNA structures were available for 155 of the approximately 600 proteins. Consequently, we were able to compare the RBS-ID results with both RBS predictions collated by the pyRBDome pipeline and known protein-RNA interactions (ground truth dataset). Having ground truth datasets also allowed us to benchmark the different prediction tools employed in pyRBDome and to directly compare their performances (detailed below). To establish such human ground truth datasets, we downloaded hundreds of PDB files containing human protein-RNA complexes from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rcsb.org">rcsb.org</ext-link>. This yielded 371 protein-RNA structures (including the 155) that met our criteria for downstream analyses (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Methods</xref> for details). Using these structures, we generated two distinct ground truth datasets. Firstly, we used Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adasme et al, 2021</xref>) to identify amino acids directly interacting with RNA in these structures. This ground truth dataset is referred to as GT-PLIP. The PLIP software package also enabled us to identify specific types of protein-RNA interactions, such as hydrogen-bonding, π-stacking, hydrophobic and salt-bridge interactions. However, due to limitations in resolution, not all structures generated PLIP results, yielding a relatively small dataset comprising of 192 proteins. To address this (potential) limitation, we established a second ground truth dataset, categorising amino acids that are within hydrogen-bonding distance (4.2Å) of RNA as RNA-binding (0 for non-interacting and 1 for interacting amino acids). We refer to this ground truth dataset as GT-Distance. This generated a richer and larger dataset (n=347), with ~10% of the amino acids assigned as RNA-interacting. To capture all experimentally determined protein-RNA interactions for each protein, PLIP and distance-based detection of RNA-binding amino acids were performed using all available protein-RNA structures associated with individual UniProt IDs.

These assumptions were tested using machine learning (ML). Using the ground truth datasets outlined above, we developed eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ensemble classification models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Chen &amp; Guestrin, 2016</xref>) that utilise the prediction results from the diverse tools used by pyRBDome as features to predict how likely an amino acid is to bind RNA (detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. EV4</xref>).

However, precision-recall analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B and E</xref>) indicated that the XGBoost classifiers trained on the combined prediction results of the human ground truth datasets exhibited lower false positive and false negative rates compared to classifiers trained solely on data from individual tools. Furthermore, XGBoost models trained with more RBS prediction data displayed improved Area Under the Curve (AUC) values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C and F</xref>), implying they better distinguish between amino acids that bind RNA and those that do not. We note that models trained on GT-PLIP generally performed poorer than might be expected. This is likely because not all available structures could be analysed by PLIP due to limited resolution, reducing the size of the training dataset. Additionally, the unbalanced nature of GT-PLIP dataset, with only approximately 5% of all amino acids interacting with RNA, likely also significantly contributed to the lower precision of the XGBoost models trained on the PLIP data, despite artificially balancing the datasets (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P25">It is important to note that the individual prediction tools (i.e., the model features) do not contribute equally to the predictions made by the XGBoost models, but the significance of each model is evaluated during the training. Analysis of the feature reliance in the performance of the XGBoost model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. EV5A</xref>) revealed that BindUP, RNABindRPlus and aaRNA exhibited the highest importance among the RBS prediction tools, enabling the model to approximate the ground truth more accurately. Training XGBoost models using various combinations of RBS prediction data revealed that models trained with a more extensive collection of RBS prediction data showed increased precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>; Average Precision (AP)).

Recent studies have demonstrated that RBPs are enriched for tripeptide motifs consisting of positively charged, negatively charged, and aliphatic amino acids, and these triplets are conserved across evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Beckmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Bressin <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). In three organisms that were analysed (<italic>Homo sapiens, Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella. typhimurium</italic>), tripeptides with a combination of arginines, lysines and glycines were strong predictors for RBPs. The pyRBDome pipeline can perform tripeptide motif analyses RBDome data, enabling users to identify motifs most likely to contribute to RNA-binding in their model organism. pyRBDome searches for tripeptide motifs enriched in the cross-linked peptides relative to randomly selected peptides from the same protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). To enhance these analyses, pyRBDome also performs the same motif analyses based on the biochemical properties of the amino acids in the tripeptide motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Strikingly, the result show that while amino acids with positively charged residues are highly enriched in the human ground truth data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, C</xref>), tripeptides containing combinations of aromatic (i.e., Y and F) and aliphatic (i.e., G, V and A) are very highly enriched in the cross-linked peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B, D</xref>). This is consistent with the strong bias towards UV cross-linking to specific amino acids, such as aromatic amino acids, to RNA.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>pyRBDome reveals insights into domain RNA-binding interfaces.</title><p id="P28">In addition to providing information about enriched domains in RBDome data, the pipeline can also identify RNA-binding interfaces within individual domains. UV cross-linking is inefficient and stochastic, so within individual protein domains, only a few of all possible RNA-binding interactions will be detected, providing limited mechanistic insights into domain-RNA interactions.</p><p id="P29">However, it is reasonable to assume that these domains within different proteins will have defined modes of RNA recognition. Therefore, if peptides/amino acids reported in RBDome data indeed represent genuine RNA-binding events, aggregating the cross-linking data from proteins that share the same domains may provide valuable insights into preferred RNA-binding interfaces.</p><p id="P30">To test this hypothesis, we further analysed the cross-linking data for RRM-containing proteins. The RRM domains in which cross-linking was detected were structurally aligned using MM-align (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mukherjee &amp; Zhang, 2009</xref>) and superimposed. For those RRM domains for which crystal structures were not available, AlphaFold2 structure models were used. Subsequently, the cross-linked peptides and amino acids were highlighted within the superimposed structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-B</xref>). Typical RRM domains consist of four anti-parallel β sheets stacked on top of two α helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Our analyses revealed that many cross-linked amino acids clustered in the same regions of the RRMs and concentrated in the β sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This finding is consistent with the essential role of the RRM β sheets in RNA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Maris <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Moreover, aromatic amino acids from the first and third β sheet that are important for RNA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Maris <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) frequently cross-linked to RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, red bars). However, to obtain meaningful results, many cross-linking events within a specific domain are required. To illustrate this point, the same analyses on type 1 KH domain proteins (36 cross-links), which were also enriched in the RBD-ID data, did not reveal a convincing cross-linking pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. EV6</xref>). Nevertheless, our work demonstrates the potential of using high-throughput UV cross-linking studies for studying protein-RNA interfaces.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>UV-induced protein-RNA cross-links frequently occur in proximity to structurally determined protein-RNA contacts.</title><p id="P31">We next asked to what extent the RBS-ID data agreed with our ground truth datasets. For this purpose, we only considered UniProt IDs from the RBS-ID data for which protein-RNA structures were available. We then compared this selection of RBS-ID data with our PLIP-analysed structures (GT-PLIP dataset). For each cross-linked amino acid reported in the RBS-ID data, we measured the distance (in Å) to the nearest RNA-binding amino acid detected by PLIP. The results were then aggregated into the cumulative plot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>. Much to our surprise, these data showed that only 21.1% (43/204 amino acids) of the reported cross-linking sites interact with RNA in high-resolution structures (as reported by PLIP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Knörlein <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>) demonstrated that UV does not necessarily always cross-link the amino acids that in available structures bind RNA, but neighbouring amino acids can also be indirectly covalently attached to RNA. Consistent with this idea, more than half (56.4%) of the cross-linked amino acids were located within hydrogen-bonding distance (4.2Å) of PLIP sites and 42% within 4.2Å distance of RNA in these structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Statistical analyses (Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) tests) revealed that RBD-ID data are indeed highly enriched for amino acid positions that are close to PLIP sites or RNA molecules in 3D structures (relative to shuffled cross-linked amino acids or all amino acids; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A-B</xref>). These data therefore reinforce the idea that, when comparing the experimental data to existing structural data, UV cross-linking does not always capture amino acids directly binding to RNA, but that they are generally closer to RNA molecules.</p><p id="P32">We next focussed specifically on the cross-linked amino acids that overlapped with RBSs in our GT-PLIP dataset and asked what type of interactions they are involved in. Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Knörlein <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>), we find that phenylalanine π-stacking interactions with RNA are most abundantly detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C-D</xref>). However, our results also suggest important contributions for hydrophobic and π-cation interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Cross-linked peptides as reliable proxies for RNA-binding regions?</title><p id="P33">As outlined above, a main reason why we established the pyRBDome pipeline was because for our model organism (Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) there was an insufficient number of high-resolution structures of protein-RNA complexes available to generate a robust ground truth dataset for validation purposes. When analysing data from less well characterised organisms, the user can instruct the pipeline to determine whether cross-linked peptides and/or amino acids are highly enriched for RBSs predicted by the various tools employed by pyRBDome. Additionally, the user can test whether the cross-linking data is enriched for amino acids that, according to our XGBoost model, have high RNA-binding probabilities. Examples of such analyses on the human RBS-ID data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref>. These data indicate that the reported cross-linked amino acids have a significantly higher likelihood to bind RNA compared to randomly selected amino acids from the same proteins or the general population of all amino acids from the analysed proteins. However, the variability in the distribution of the RNA-binding probabilities for cross-linked RNAs, as shown by lower tail of the distribution, indicates that while cross-linked amino acids are indeed more likely to be predicted as RNA-binding, they are not a definitive indicator by itself.</p><p id="P34">Therefore, we next asked whether cross-linked <italic>peptides</italic> might be a better proxy for RBS detection. The pyRBDome pipeline allows the user to test this in two ways: Firstly, the user can compare the data with results obtained from individual predictors, such as aaRNA or FTMap, for example, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. EV7</xref>. These data show that the generated RBS-ID peptides were both enriched for predicted RBSs and/or more likely to be in closer proximity to these sites (aaRNA and RNABindRPlus; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. EV7A-B</xref>). Interestingly, the same was true for putative small-molecule binding sites predicted by FTMap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. EV7C</xref>). The second approach determines whether the cross-linked peptides are enriched for amino acids with higher RNA-binding probabilities as determined by our XGBoost model. We addressed this by (I) tracking the highest RNA-binding probability found in a peptide sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>) and (II) calculating the mean RNA-binding probabilities for each peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Our analyses strongly indicate that cross-linked peptides typically include at least one amino acid with a significantly higher RNA-binding propensity compared to control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Notably, the RNA-binding probability distribution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref> for cross-linked peptides is distinctly skewed towards higher values, suggesting that these peptides have a greater tendency for containing RNA-binding amino acids relative to the randomly selected control group peptides. However, the randomly generated peptides were not products of Trypsin and/or Lys-C digestion. To address this, we also compared the cross-linking data to peptides from parent proteins digested <italic>in silico</italic> by Trypsin/Lys-C. This comparison showed an even higher presence of predicted RBSs in cross-linked peptides, affirming the predictive strength of our XGBoost model and the significant value of cross-linked peptide data for detecting RBSs.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>pyRBDome correctly identifies RBSs in an <italic>S. aureus</italic> 3’-5’ exonuclease.</title><p id="P35">Having extensively tested pyRBDome on human data, we next applied the pipeline on RBPome data from a less well characterised organism.

The S1 and KH domains, located at the C-terminus of each subunit, form the entrance of the channel, and direct single-stranded RNA towards the catalytic residues of the RNase PH-like domain, which is located at the N-terminal side of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hardwick <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). In the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> PNPase-RNA crystal structure, a 12-nucleotide RNA fragment interacts with the KH domain, through the conserved RNA-binding GSGG loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. EV8A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A-C</xref>). These amino acids were predicted to bind RNA with high probabilities by RNABindRPlus and our XGBoost model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A-C</xref>). The predictions of our pipeline largely accumulated on the internal surface of the ring-like structure that interacts with RNA. This can easily be observed when overlaying the RNA from the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> structure on the pyRBDome PNPase structure with the model predictions highlighted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B-C</xref>. Interestingly, while FTMap highlighted the PNPase active site for its high potential to bind small molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>; red coloured amino acids), this region showed relatively low RNA-binding probabilities, reflecting the nuanced contribution of FTMap results to our XGBoost model’s predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref> and EV5). The aaRNA analysis on the PNPase model structure did not yield any results and therefore these data were missing when using our XGBoost model, which was trained with aaRNA data, for predicting RBSs in this structure. Despite this, the XGBoost model yielded correct predictions for PNPase RNA-binding regions, again highlighting the degree of flexibility and robustness in the predictive capabilities of XGBoost models.</p><p id="P38">In conclusion, the pyRBDome pipeline and the analysis tools we provide in this package are versatile and valuable tools for elucidating RNA-protein interactions across varied datasets and organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P39">Here we present the pyRBDome pipeline for <italic>in silico</italic> enhancement of RBPome and RBDome proteomics data. This pipeline, which leverages both protein sequences and structural information, employs a variety of distinct prediction tools for identifying putative RNA Binding Sites (RBSs) within target proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. EV1 and EV4</xref>). It subsequently highlights the results from each prediction algorithm either within provided peptide/amino acid sequences, or entire protein sequences. The pipeline is capable of processing hundreds of proteins from large proteomics datasets or individual proteins. Significantly, the pipeline simplifies the complex data from these predictions, providing easily interpretable results that facilitate identification of residues involved in RNA-binding. The inclusion of PyMOL sessions allows users to visualise all the experimental and prediction results in 3D model structures simultaneously. Furthermore, pyRBDome includes statistical analyses to assess whether sequences obtained from RBDome studies show a significant enrichment of predicted RBSs, thus offering a quantitative measure that can improve the quality of the experimental data. Collectively, these findings underscore pyRBDome’s utility in streamlining the detection of RBSs in proteins and in effectively enhancing RBDome data.</p><sec id="S12"><title>Agreement between RBDome UV cross-linking and structural data</title><p id="P40">To demonstrate the utility of pyRBDome we analysed a data rich human RBDome dataset (RBD-ID; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), which provided, besides a list of (putative) RBPs, also an extensive list of RNA cross-linked amino acids. However, it did not contain the peptide sequences to which these cross-linked amino acids belonged. To address this, we artificially extended these amino acid sequences on both ends with varying lengths to create a peptide dataset suitable for analysis with our our pipeline. We found that both cross-linked peptides and amino acid sequences are significantly enriched in RBSs (RNA-binding sites), as predicted by individual tools or our combined XGBoost ensemble model. Surprisingly, when we compared the cross-linked amino acid data with our GT-PLIP dataset, which includes amino acids known to interact with RNA based on structural data, we observed limited overlap. While cross-linked amino acids were statistically more likely to be near RNA compared to randomly selected amino acids, only about 21% of them were actually found to bind RNA according to the available structural data. The limited overlap observed might suggest that UV cross-linking data contain a considerable amount of noise. However, it is important to note that our ground truth datasets, which were constructed solely from high-resolution structures, are also unlikely to include all possible protein-RNA contacts. Many structures contain proteins in complex with short pieces of RNA and therefore provide limited insights into the full RNA-binding capacity of the protein. Not every RNA substrate will also interact identically with an RBP and protein-RNA interactions can be highly dynamic and condition dependent. Though UV cross-linking can often capture such interactions <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in cellulo</italic>, many of these might not be represented in static structures (also see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bae <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>)).</p><p id="P41">Our comparison of the RBS-ID data with our XGBoost model predictions, suggest that sequences of cross-linked peptides are more reliable indicators of RNA-binding sites than individual amino acids. This is because they tend to include amino acids with higher RNA-binding probabilities. Thus, comparing the cross-linking data with results from predictive models may offer a more effective solution for corroborating or supporting RBDome data. This is particularly true for models that are not solely reliant on existing protein-RNA structures for training. Such models are presumably better equipped to identify amino acids interacting with RNA, including those interactions not represented in structural data.</p><p id="P42">Another potential source of noise could stem from the analysis of mass spectrometry data. The software tools employed for analysing such datasets typically offer localisation scores, which indicate the probability of an amino acid being cross-linked to RNA. If the quality of a dataset is subpar, accurately pinpointing the precise cross-linking site becomes more challenging, leading to lower localisation scores and consequently, increased noise in the data. However, in the RBS-ID dataset that we analysed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), 80% of the reported cross-linking sites (detected using MS-GF+ with a closed search; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kim &amp; Pevzner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>)) had very high localisation scores (between 0.8 and 1). While there is undoubtedly noise in the data, we would argue that the quality of this RBS-ID dataset is not a major contributor.</p><p id="P43">A recent study has also revealed that UV cross-linking does not exclusively target amino acids in direct contact with RNA; it can also affect those in indirect proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Knörlein <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Furthermore, it was found that π-stacking interactions are key to directing the cross-linking reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Knörlein <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). This may also offer an explanation for our observation that few cross-linked amino acids were found to bind RNA in our GT-PLIP ground truth dataset, and if they did they were mostly involved in π-stacking. However, a significant proportion of the cross-linked amino acids were observed to be in close proximity to RNA within protein-RNA structures. Drawing on these findings and the bioinformatics analyses conducted in this study, when using pyRBDome data to design follow-up mutational analyses, we recommend prioritising aromatic, suphur containing and positively charged amino acids that have high RNA-binding prediction scores, that have undergone cross-linking or are located in cross-linked peptides, and those that are proximal to cross-linking sites, either sequentially or in the three-dimensional (model) structures.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Developing an ensemble model for enhanced prediction RNA-binding amino acids.</title><p id="P44">The foundational concept behind the creation of the pyRBDome pipeline stemmed from our belief that combining results from multiple predictors would improve the identification of RNA-binding residues in targeted proteins. While this was not the main goal of our project, the comprehensive datasets generated by pyRBDome presented a prime opportunity to validate this hypothesis through machine learning. By leveraging the predictive data from various tools, we developed a eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ensemble models. These models discern patterns within the aggregated predictive results and aligns them with known RNA-binding amino acids in the existing structural data. The main reasons for relying on XGBoost to build these preliminary models include its frequent outperformance of neural networks when presented with tabular data (such as the data used here), its ability to handle missing data points effectively (useful in cases where a protein could not be analysed by one of the prediction tools), its competence in dealing with unbalanced datasets (our ground truth datasets are unbalanced), and its tolerance to uninformative features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Chen &amp; Guestrin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Grinsztajn <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>).

While these results are promising, there are areas where the XGBoost models could be further improved. For instance, our current models have exclusively been trained on data from human protein-RNA complexes. Therefore, their robustness could be enhanced by training the models on structurally characterised protein-RNA complexes (RNPs) from diverse organisms. It should also be noted that our training sets, in addition to AlphaFold2 models, mainly consists of structurally characterised proteins/domains. As a result RBPs with disordered RNA-binding regions are underrepresented or their disordered regions were excluded from the analyses. This underreprentation likely contributed to the less optimal performance of DisoRDPbind on our test data. However, this can be circumvented by reanalysing the data using <italic>only</italic> AlphaFold2 models, where these sequences will be represented (albeit not accurately folded). Alternatively, including a wider array of RNA-binding domains from disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>) will undoubtedly enhance DisoRDPbind’s predictions and subsequently further improve the accuracy and precision of our XGBoost models. Therefore, the analyses presented here, constrained by the current datasets, do not fully capture the true potential of DisoRDPbind.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Pipeline performance</title><p id="P46">The pyRBDome pipeline was designed to process a large number of proteins simultaneously, naturally leading to questions about the typical duration of an RBPome or RBDome dataset analysis. While there is no definitive answer, as it varies, performing the pyRBDome analysis on the RBS-ID dataset (consisting of 584 proteins) took approximately 8 days. The most time-consuming step involved submitting jobs to various servers, with tools like FTMap and aaRNA typically taking longer to yield results. The analysis duration primarily depends on factors such as the size of the proteins being analysed, the server’s computational power, and the server queue lengths. Despite these variables, we consider an 8-day turnaround to be quite reasonable for such a large dataset. Future developments of pyRBDome, as discussed in the next section, will focus on incorporating tools with shorter execution times. However, it’s important to note that faster processing does not always equate to more accurate results, presenting a constant trade-off.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Future pyRBDome pipeline developments</title><p id="P47">To develop the pyRBDome pipeline, we evaluated a wide array of distinct tools designed to predict RNA-binding amino acids, and that take into consideration various sequence and structural features of ligand-binding proteins. However, integrating these tools into pyRBDome presented several challenges. These included inactive web servers and compatibility issues such as dependency conflicts and lack of comprehensive documentation, which hindered smooth integration with our Linux servers. Moreover, not all the web servers we tested were suitable for high-throughput analysis of protein sequences and structures, and some had run times that made the analysis of hundreds of proteins excessively time-consuming. This presented a notable challenge in integrating tools that could potentially outperform those currently described. However, the pipeline is continually evolving, and our existing Python code allows for relatively straightforward incorporation of new tools and the processing of their results.</p><p id="P48">Throughout this project, numerous advancements have been made in developing improved methods for predicting RNA-binding sites (RBSs) in proteins. A notable example is DeepDISOBind, an improved model for predicting RNA-binding residues in disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). We are in the process of incorporating the stand-alone version of this tool into pyRBDome-Core and pyRBDome-Notebooks. We are also testing PST-PRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Li &amp; Liu, 2022</xref>), a deep learning model that predicts RBSs using protein surface topology. This tool outperforms aaRNA, a structure-based prediction method employed by pyRBDome. PST-PRNA has the added advantage of not relying on sequence identity and conservation for its predictions and may therefore perform better on non-classical RBPs. Preliminary data from these analyses can be found in versin 1.1.2 of our pyRBDome-Notebooks Ground truth analyses GitLab repository that details the development and analysis of our ground truth datasets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sgrannem/pyRBDome_Notebooks_Ground_truth_analyses">https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sgrannem/pyRBDome_Notebooks_Ground_truth_analyses</ext-link>). Other tools under evaluation are NCBRPred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>), a sequence-based predictor likely to replace RNABindRPlus, and HybridRNAbind, a tool trained on both structural information and available RNA-binding regions in disordered domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). We also tested HydRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Jin <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>), a deep learning method designed for detecting RNA-binding proteins and RNA-binding regions. Similar to the XGBoost model described here, HydRA functions as an ensemble classifier, utilising information from diverse prediction tools. It not only predicts a protein’s RNA-binding capacity, but can also detect potential RNA-binding regions in RBPs. Using our human GT-PLIP and GT-Distance ground truth datasets, HydRA’s performance in detecting RBSs was not as high compared to the individual tools employed by the pyRBDome pipeline or our XGBoost ensemble model (see 6.1.2_BinaryClassifierAnalysesRBDData.ipynb notebook in the pyRBDome-Notebooks Ground truth analyses repository). This is why we do not discuss the HydRA results here. This may be due to HydRA being optimised for predicting RNA-binding <italic>regions</italic>, whereas our ground truth datasets are more specific to individual RNA-binding <italic>amino acids</italic>. Despite this, we recognise HydRA’s value in identifying RNA-binding capacities in proteins and have incorporated code in version 0.2.0 of pyRBDome-Core and version 1.1 of pyRBDome-Notebooks to process and display HydRA predictions in PDF and PDB files. All the raw HydRa analysis results are also available on our pyRBDome-Notebooks GitLab repositories.</p><p id="P49">One might argue that constructing a pipeline dependent on multiple web servers, as in the case of pyRBDome, inherently invites reliability issues, as demonstrated by our experiences with inconsistent server availability. While our efforts are increasingly directed towards integrating standalone packages into the pyRBDome pipeline, it is important to acknowledge that running these prediction algorithms demands substantial computational resources. This includes the need for high-specification CPUs (Central Processing Units) and, more critically, GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). Not all research groups may have access to such computational facilities. Moreover, even for groups that do have such resources, the task of establishing and managing a pipeline comprising various stand-alone machine learning tools is very challenging as it involves dealing with numerous dependencies and configurations. Therefore, for future versions of the pyRBDome pipeline, we aim to strike a balance between utilising web servers and integrating standalone packages.</p><p id="P50">A longer-term goal is to make the results from analyses available in public databases with the aim to make the data more easily accessible for the wider public.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S17"><title>Repository content</title><p id="P51">A description of all the directories and type of files that the pyRBDome pipelines produce can be found in the README.md files in the individual repositories.

To expedite this process, we developed the script FindUniProtRNPStructure.py, which is now part of the pyRBDome-Core package. The code used for downloading these PDB files is available in the 1.0_FindRNPStructures_using_UniProt_IDs.ipynb notebook, located in the pyRBDome-Notebooks Ground truth analyses repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sgrannem/pyRBDome_Notebooks_Ground_truth_analyses">https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sgrannem/pyRBDome_Notebooks_Ground_truth_analyses</ext-link>). For each UniProt ID, we retrieved protein-RNA structures that met specific criteria: a resolution of less or equal to 5Å and the presence of at least one RNA molecule. Owing to compatibility issues with CIF files, we chose to download only PDB files from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rcsb.org">rcsb.org</ext-link>. Each PDB file corresponding to a UniProt ID was then analysed to determine the minimum distance (in Å) of each amino acid to the RNA. We also developed a Python package that utilises the PLIP code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adasme et al., 2021</xref>) to identify amino acids that interact directly with RNA in these structures. The code for conducting these analyses and a description of how to carry out such analyses is provided in the pyDRBPNA package on our repository.

This file records only the shortest distances to RNA for each amino acid in the b-factor column, as indicated in files ending with “distances_merged.pdb”. We also collated the frequency of RNA contacts by amino acids across the structures (as detected by PLIP), storing this information in the b-factor columns of files that end with “plip_merged_all.pdb”.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>pyRBDome package and pipeline description</title><p id="P54">The pipeline introduced in this paper consists of two parts: pyRBDome-Core (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sgrannem/pyRBDome_Core">https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sgrannem/pyRBDome_Core</ext-link>) and pyRBDome-Notebooks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sgrannem/pyRBDome_Notebooks">https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sgrannem/pyRBDome_Notebooks</ext-link>). The former contains all the scripts, functions, and classes that users need to execute the Jupyter notebooks. The code has been developed and tested extensively on Ubuntu Linux operating systems (OS) and can be adapted to work on Mac OS (12.7 and above). Details on how to install the packages and run the notebooks, and the required computational resources can be found in the README files on our repository. pyRBDome-Notebooks streamline the process of RNA-binding protein and cross-linking data analysis by automatically running predictions either online or locally. It then downloads, renames, and organises the results into specific directories. The pipeline stores any progress it has made as well as result from all the analyses in an SQLite database. This enables the user to keep track for which proteins (model) structures have been downloaded and whether these structures were analysed successfully by each prediction algorithm. Incorporating the SQLite database also enables the user to resume runs that may have failed or timed-out and helps avoid repeated submission of PDB files that have already been analysed. The results tables can also be easily exported to CSV files. All the notebooks can also be run sequentially in the terminal using papermill (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://papermill.readthedocs.io">https://papermill.readthedocs.io</ext-link>).

For generating model structures, this notebook first queries the Alphfold2 database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk">https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk</ext-link>) and downloads the latest model associated with that UniProt ID (PDB files ending with “_AF.pdb”). If it is unable to find any models, it submits the protein sequence to SWISS-MODEL. Only models with GMQE score higher than 0.7 were considered and their PDB files downloaded. Note that SWISS-MODELS were not used in this study. For proteins that could not be modelled by SWISS-MODEL or had a model of insufficient quality the protein sequences were blasted against the AlphaFold model organism genome (notebook 1.1_FindingPDBsViaSequence.ipynb) to identify the closest homologue (notebook 1.2_GetAlphaFoldModels.ipynb). In these cases, we only considered proteins that had a homolog with an identity of &gt;= 99%. The PDB IDs associated with each protein are then saved in the available_PDBs table in an SQLite database (pyrbdome_full.db).

In the case of FTMap data, the distances to docked molecules (in Å) were normalised to values between 0 and 1, with the highest values assigned to the shortest distances. The XGBoost model subsequently generates output files containing probabilities that indicate the likelihood of each amino acid interacting with RNA. Given that the number of RNA-interacting amino acids in the GT-PLIP and GT-Distance ground truth datasets was approximately 5-10%, we undersampled the majority class (i.e., non-interacting amino acids, labelled as ‘0’s) in our training data to address the unbalanced nature of the dataset.
