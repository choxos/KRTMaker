However, maintaining epithelial integrity during this renewal is challenging, and loss of cell polarity is a potent inducer of tumorigenesis. In this study, we used transcriptomic data from breast cancer cells at different stages of tumor development to identify molecular changes associated with the early stages of tumor transformation. We correlated these protein expression profiles with either cell polarity defects or cell progression along the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We identified plakins, namely epiplakin (EPPK1), desmoplakin (DSP) and periplakin (PPL), that were downregulated in cells that had lost their epithelial polarity and also downregulated in cells that had progressed through EMT. We further tested them experimentally by knocking down their expression in a non-tumorigenic epithelial breast cell line (MCF10A). We demonstrated their causal role in the loss of polarity, as revealed by the misorientation of the nuclear centrosome vector. We also found that vimentin, a marker of EMT, was overexpressed in plakin knocked-down cells, suggesting that plakins may have both a structural and a regulatory role in maintaining the epithelial state.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Epithelia lines the interface between organs and external environment. Their morphogenesis involves tightly regulated coordination of multiple cytoskeleton components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Schöck and Perrimon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Roignot et al., 2013</xref>). They are intensively renewed as they are exposed to numerous physical and chemical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Darwich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Okumura and Takeda, 2017</xref>). It is challenging to renew such structures in which tissue cohesion is key for their function. Defective maintenance of tissue integrity can lead to epithelial cancers called carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hinck et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The loss of epithelial cell polarity is a major cause of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Wodarz and Näthke, 2007</xref>). Cell polarity cues appeared to act as oncogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lee and Vasioukhin, 2008</xref>). Whether the loss of polarity is a cause or consequence of tumoral development has been a long-standing question in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Muthuswamy and Xue, 2012</xref>). Tumoral progression is a complex process that associates uncontrolled cell growth and tissue disorganization. To better understand its origin it is key to figure out what are the earliest signs of tumor development.</p><p id="P4">The dissemination of breast carcinoma, as for numerous cancers, proceeds through an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Brabletz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Saitoh, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Tsai and Yang, 2013</xref>). Loss of epithelial polarity is an early sign of EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Jung et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, centrosome disconnection from junctions and repositioning at the cell center precedes junction disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Burute et al., 2017</xref>). So arguably centrosome mispositioning can be considered as one of the earliest signs of tumoral development. It is unclear whether centrosome mispositioning is a consequence of earlier deleterious changes in cell organization or a cause of further downstream disorganizations. Both are likely true, since the process regulating centrosome position integrates the contributions of several cellular structures (focal adhesions and intercellular junctions, actin network, nucleus and endomembrane networks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Haupt and Minc, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jimenez et al., 2021</xref>), and, in return, the position of the centrosome will affect the spatial distribution of microtubules and thereby the transport of proteins and signals throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barlan and Gelfand, 2017</xref>). It is therefore key to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to centrosome mispositioning in early stages of tumoral transformation.</p><p id="P5">Numerous transcriptomic data sets have been obtained from cells lines at various stages of tumoral transformation and constitute a rich source of information. However, they provide measurements about the cellular content, in terms of RNAs, but nothing about the organization of cellular structures. How could we relate these molecular measurements to the architecture and polarity of cells?</p><p id="P6">The maintenance of epithelia and cell architecture under constant renewal is a complex morphogenetic process, which is multifactorial and dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Roignot et al., 2013</xref>). It is therefore difficult to manipulate it experimentally and obtain a reproducible multicellular conformation that is amenable to precise quantification in order to detect subtle changes in early stages of tissue transformation. To that end we developed a minimal polarized system made of a pair of epithelial cells, geometrically controlled in a non-moving steady state on a micropattern of fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Tseng et al., 2012</xref>). This minimal system recapitulates the epithelial segregation of cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Burute et al., 2012</xref>) and therefore direct centrosome positioning and epithelial cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Burute et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In this study, we analyzed two sets of transcriptomic data from breast cancer cell lines in order to identify potential regulators of centrosome positioning and epithelial polarity. We then tested three candidates experimentally on doublets of non-transformed human mammary epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Variation of gene expression with the loss of epithelial cell polarity</title><p id="P8">Triple negative breast cancer cells (TNBCs) are resistant to hormone treatment and thus associated with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lehmann et al., 2011</xref>). To help the identification of new treatments, the transcriptomics profiles of TNBCs were measured and made accessible to the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rody et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, a key feature of TNBCs malignancy is that they have initiated EMT and thus are prone to induce the formation of metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hudis and Gianni, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dent et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Sarrió et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jang et al., 2015</xref>). The invasion step being initiated by the dissociation and escape from the primary tumor, we hypothesized that the epithelial polarity of TNBCs was impaired. Furthermore, we thought that a quantitative description of this structural defect in various lines of TNBC would allow us to relate the degree of polarity loss to specific variations of gene transcription.</p><p id="P9">We thus first measured the epithelial polarity of 11 TNBC lines by cultivating cell doublets on H-shaped fibronectin-coated micropatterns over 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The geometry of the micropattern imposed the shape and architecture of cells, and notably the reproducible position of the intercellular junction along the vertical axis bisecting the H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Tseng et al., 2012</xref>). The position of the centrosome with respect to the nucleus and the inter-cellular junction can be taken as a proxy for the orientation of cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Burute et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). To capture the behavior of the entire population in a single metric, we measured the proportion of cells in which the centrosome was clearly off-centered toward the inter-cellular junction and named this value the “polarity score” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We measured it in three independent experiments for the 11 TNBC cell lines and the non-tumorigenic epithelial breast cell line MCF10A as a control. The polarity scores of all TNBCs were remarkably lower than in MCF10A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, these low scores were not identical for all TNBCs and variations could be related to the specific transcriptomic profile of each cell line.</p><p id="P10">For each gene, we measured the correlation coefficient between the amount of transcripts in each cell line and their polarity score. Interestingly, genes for which expression was negatively correlated with the polarity scores were enriched in cell division genes, whereas the positively correlated ones were enriched in intercellular adhesion and differentiation genes (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). As expected from literature we identified some genes whose expression level was negatively correlated to the polarity scores, ie they were less expressed in the most polarized cells, such as Aurora Kinase A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wirtz-Peitz et al., 2008</xref>), and others which were positively correlated, ie they were more expressed in most polarized cells, such as TRIM29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). For those “hits” we tested whether the value of the correlation was not influenced by their expression in MCF10A which is a bit of an outlier in the group.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Variation of gene expression as cells progress along EMT</title><p id="P11">We then searched for a second and independent way to reveal the genes involved in the maintenance of epithelial polarity. The apico-basal polarity of epithelial cells is progressively lost as cells progress along EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Moreno-Bueno et al., 2008</xref>). Cells progress in this dedifferentiation and redifferentiation pathway depending on their degree of tumoral transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Su et al., 2020</xref>). This complex landscape was clarified by a broad investigation of the variations of gene expression in a non-transformed human mammary epithelial cells (HME) in response to the over or down expression of key EMT transcription factors (Twist 1/2, Zeb1/2, TGF-β) and cancer genes (p53, Ras) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Morel et al., 2012</xref>). To relate those changes to cell progress along EMT, we calculated for each modified cell line an “EMT score” based on a molecular signature made of 150 down-regulated genes and 89 up-regulated genes that characterize the core changes common to various forms of EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Taube et al., 2010</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref>). HME cell lines were ranked based on this EMT score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Non-surprisingly, the MDA-MB-157 cell line which served as a control of highly transformed breast cancer cell line, scored high in the rank, as well as modified cell lines expressing EMT transcription factors in combination with Ras. As we did previously for TNBCs transcriptomes and polarity scores, we measured the correlation coefficient between the amounts of transcripts in each cell line and their EMT score (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). Genes for which expression is anticorrelated with EMT score are enriched in associated proteins localized in various organelles connected by the cytoskeleton (cornified envelope, cell junctions, desmosomes, mitochondrion, etc.) and participate in cadherin-binding and keratinocyte differentiation. Genes with positive correlation are enriched in associated proteins localized in focal adhesion, cytoskeleton, and endoplasmic reticulum, and participate in cell adhesion (but not cell-cell adhesion) and migration. As expected from literature, we found typical genes that were negatively or positively correlated to the EMT scores, such as Keratin15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Zhong et al., 2021</xref>) or collagen XV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Yao et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that the regulation of their expression level was part of the intra-cellular reorganization that accompanies EMT.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Plakins at the intersection of EMT, polarity and microtubules</title><p id="P12">In these two lists of selected hits, we then searched for potential candidates that would affect the internal organization of the microtubule network architecture, and thereby affect centrosome position and epithelial cell polarity. We selected a hundred of proteins, including microtubule stabilizing and destabilizing proteins (CLIP, CLASP, CAMSAP, MAP2, Tau, stathmin, katanin, spastin…), all kinesins and dynein, as well as cytolinkers such as plakins and spectrins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>). We then plotted the values of their correlation with EMT against their correlation to polarity that we measured previously. The graph showed an overall negative trend, which means that many genes that were positively correlated with EMT in HME were instead negatively correlated with epithelial polarity of TNBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This was expected and confirmed that the progression along EMT is associated with a loss of epithelial polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Moreno-Bueno et al., 2008</xref>). Several key regulators of epithelial polarity such as CAMSAP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Noordstra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Toya et al., 2016</xref>) displayed highly positive correlation with polarity and highly negative correlation with EMT. On the opposite trend, MAP1B appeared anti-correlated to epithelial polarity, consistent with its role of microtubule destabilizer and regulator of neuronal cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Tortosa et al., 2013</xref>). Kinesins were distributed all over the graph but, as previously shown, the expressions of KIFC3 and KLC3 showed high and opposite correlation with epithelial polarity: KIFC3 being negatively correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lu et al., 2023</xref>) whereas KLC3 was positively correlated to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fustaino et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, three plakins, namely epiplakin (EPPK1), desmoplakin (DSP) and periplakin (PPL) all appeared as clear outliers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The expression of each of these plakins, together with envoplakin (EVPL), were negatively correlated to the EMT score of HME and positively correlated to the Polarity score of TNBC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S1</xref>). Although a role in epithelial polarity maintenance was not completely surprising for these gigantic proteins that connects intercellular junctions to microtubules and intermediate filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bouameur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Suozzi et al., 2012</xref>), such a strong coupling of several members of the plakin family with both EMT and polarity was not expected.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Knockdown of plakins induce a loss of epithelial polarity</title><p id="P13">To directly test the role of plakins in the regulation of epithelial polarity, we knocked-down the expression of epiplakin, desmoplakin and periplakin individually. We tested several siRNA sequences and retained two for each that clearly downregulated the expression of the targeted proteins as attested by the immunostaining of western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Material and Methods</xref>). We also found a marked disappearance of their cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, knocked-down cells in culture displayed abnormal shapes, being more elongated and less cohesive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To characterize cell ability to polarize and orient the organization of their microtubule network, independently of these cell shape changes, we again used the micropatterning of cell doublets on H shapes. We measured the cell polarity index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Burute et al., 2017</xref>), ie the coordinate of the centrosome along the nucleus-junction axis for control MCF10A and knocked-down cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>). As expected for properly polarized cells, MCF10A displayed positive polarity index, with an average value of 0.5, similar to previous measurement in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Burute et al., 2017</xref>). By contrast, the polarity index of cells knock-down for epiplakin, desmoplakin or periplakin were close to zero, meaning that their centrosomes were randomly oriented around the nucleus, and independent of the position of the intercellular junction. Similar measurements were obtained by treating cells with the second siRNA sequence for each plakin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S2</xref>). These results confirmed that epiplakin, desmoplakin and periplakin are all potent regulators of epithelial cell polarity.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Impact of plakins on cytoskeleton networks</title><p id="P15">We finally measured whether cytoskeleton networks were impacted by the loss of plakins. We first analyzed the actin network and found that the loss of periplakin impaired significantly the ability of cells to form inter-cellular junctions, as attested by the shortening of these junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, we found no effect of the loss of desmoplakin or epiplakin on junction length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), which was consistent with previous reports showing that E-cadherin expression was not altered in mouse knocked-out cells, although these became invasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chun and Hanahan, 2010</xref>). This suggested that centrosome mispositioning in these cells was not due to weaker junctions but rather a downstream consequence of a defective connection between junctions and the microtubule network.</p><p id="P16">We then analyzed whether microtubule dynamics was associated to centrosome mispositioning in knocked-down cells since we have shown that microtubule stability participates to network polarization and centrosome off-centering toward inter-cellular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Burute et al., 2017</xref>). Apart from centrosome mispositioning, we found no striking effect on the overall organization of the microtubules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S3</xref>). We further tested microtubule stability by exposing cells to nocodazole for 5 min, and were surprised to found that the silencing of none of the three plakins had any effect on microtubule stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Curious to identify which other parameter might impair microtubule network organization, we looked at intermediate filaments, which binds microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Schaedel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Leduc and Etienne-Manneville, 2017</xref>). In particular vimentin filaments were shown to align with and template the spatial organization of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gan et al., 2016</xref>). We thus stained for vimentin filaments and observed a massive increase of the amount of vimentin filaments in all plakin knocked-down cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, the amount of vimentin is commonly used as a key EMT marker, suggesting that plakin knocked-down cells not only lost their epithelial polarity but might actually be engaged in a form of EMT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P18">In this work we analyzed transcriptomic data with respect to two specific metrics: the polarity score and the EMT score of cell lines. We focused our analysis on the outcome of the proteins interacting with microtubules and found that several members of the plakin family stood out. Their expression levels were positively correlated to the level of epithelial polarity and negatively correlated with the EMT stage in two banks of mammary epithelial cells. We further tested experimentally the role of three plakins, epiplakin, periplakin and desmoplakin, by knocking down their expression with siRNAs in MCF10A. We confirmed that they were all involved in epithelial cell polarization.</p><p id="P19">Because of their size and diversity of cytoskeleton partners, plakins are called “giant cytolinkers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Jefferson et al., 2004</xref>). They ensure the alignment of microtubules with intermediate filaments and bundles of actin filaments as well as their connections to cell adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bouameur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Suozzi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Prechova et al., 2023</xref>). They link them together and co-orchestrate their dynamics, notably during cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Wu et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">2011</xref>). Individually, at the interface with cell environment, or deeper within the cell cytoplasm, adhesions, actin filaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules are all essential players in the establishment of cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Ebnet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Oriolo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Li and Gundersen, 2008</xref>). Our work suggests that, by transmitting structural information from peripheral adhesions to inner cytoskeleton networks, plakins ensure a functional coherence between cell environment and cell interior in the organization of epithelial cell polarity.</p><p id="P20">Plakins not only connect cytoskeleton filaments to plasma membrane, they also bind them to the nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Liem, 2016</xref>). This connection might have a structural role in the organization of the cytoplasm, but it may also be part of a regulatory pathway, since mechanical forces on the nucleus affect gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Uhler and Shivashankar, 2017</xref>). Indeed, plakins contribute to reorganize cytoskeleton networks during embryo development and cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sonnenberg and Liem, 2007</xref>). In this study, we revealed their role in cell polarity by searching for proteins participating to the destabilization of epithelial polarity during EMT. Their expression appeared anti-correlated to EMT, but they might also have a causal role in this transition. Indeed, in all the three investigated plakins knocked-down cells, we observed an overexpression of vimentin, which is a well-established marker of the mesenchymal phenotype. So more than destabilizing the epithelial polarity, their disappearance might instruct the acquisition of the mesenchymal phenotype. This would be consistent with their frequent mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hu et al., 2018</xref>), and their decreased expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wesley et al., 2021</xref>) in various cancers. Thus, these giant cytolinkers that co-organize all cytoskeleton components, might also act as signaling platforms that instruct gene expression and direct cell differentiation. This possible regulatory role of plakins in cell differentiation raises the hypothesis that cytoskeletal organization is linked to protein expression profiles to ensure functional coherence between cell architecture and identity.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Material and Method</title><sec id="S10"><title>Transcriptomic analysis</title><p id="P21">TNBC cell lines freshly obtained from new vials of the ATCC supplier were expanded following ATCC recommendations.

The distance from nucleus center to centrosome is normalized by the nucleus radius. The graph shows the spatial distribution of centrosome position with respect to the nucleus in the reference axis represented in the scheme in the case of the BT549 cells. The red sectors correspond to cells that are further considered as “highly polarized”.</p><p>C - The histogram represents the “Polarity score”, ie the average proportion of “highly polarized cells” in each TNBC cell lines over three independent experiments. Each grey bar represents the proportion of highly polarized cells measured over more than 200 cells per experiment. The red bar represents the averaged polarity score over three independent experiments.</p><p>D - Examples of two genes whose expression level is highly correlated to the “Polarity score” of the 11 TNBC cell lines and the MCF10A. Aurora Kinase A is an example of a negative correlation, TRIM29 is an example of a positive correlation. “Correl_Polarity” indicated the value of the correlation between protein expression levels and the Polarity score. MCF10A could bias this correlation since they have a high polarity score, so we also measured the correlation coefficient without taking this cell line into account.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS189708-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Variation of gene expression as HME cells progress along EMT.</title><p>A - Calculation of the “EMT score” of HME cell lines over-expressing various transcription factors or oncogenes.
