Mice were trained to navigate towards a moveable beacon to receive a reward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> (see methods). After mice had learned this task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, we tested the necessity of different visual cues for place and grid cell firing, by removing specific subsets of these cues as mice continued to perform the navigation task (‘Cue-absent’ trials). In three different manipulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), different subsets of cues were removed: a) the walls of the virtual environment (‘Walls Off’), b) the patterned floor of the environment (‘Floor Off’), c) both the walls and the floor (‘All Off’). In the cue-absent trials, the removed cues were replaced by a plain dark grey background. In all manipulations, the beacon indicating the current reward position remained visible and moved to a pseudo-random location after the mouse had consumed the reward (see Methods for more details). For each manipulation, a baseline trial was carried out where all visual cues were present (a ‘cue-present’ trial, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Removing the wall cues alone produced a strong disruption in the spatial specificity and within-trial stability of place cells, as did removing both walls and floor cues simultaneously. By contrast, removing only floor cues had no significant effect on place cell spatial firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, 1D, 1B, 1E</xref>; Spatial information: ANOVA Cue presence*Manipulation, F(2,617) = 26.94, p &lt; 0.001, Simple Main Effects [SME] cue present vs absent, Walls Off, p &lt; 0.001, Floor Off, p = 0.305, All Off, p &lt; 0.001; Intra-trial stability: ANOVA Cue presence*Manipulation, F(2,617) = 90.36, p &lt; 0.001, SME absent vs present, Walls Off p &lt; 0.001, Floor Off, p = 0.091, All Off, p &lt; 0.001). Removing the floor cues only did, however, cause a modest degree of remapping, as measured by the across-trial stability of place cell firing between the cue-present and cue-absent trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, 1F</xref>; ANOVA Cue presence*Manipulation, F(2,617) = 114.60, p &lt; 0.001, SME absent vs present, Walls Off, p &lt; 0.001, Floor Off, p &lt; 0.001, All Off, p &lt; 0.001). This indicates a degree of saliency of floor cues to place cell firing, but only the removal of wall cues resulted in a significant decrease in place cell stability.</p><p id="P6">The effects of cue removal on grid cells paralleled those observed for place cells: removing walls only or floor and walls together resulted in a strong reduction in gridness scores and within-trial stability, while there was no significant effect of removing the floor cues alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-1C, 1G-1I</xref>; Gridness score: ANOVA Cue presence*Manipulation, F(2,109) = 32.92, p &lt; 0.001; SME absent vs present, Walls Off, p &lt; 0.001, Floor Off, p = 0.202, All Off, p &lt; 0.001; Intra-trial stability: ANOVA Cue presence*Manipulation, F(2,109) = 64.45, p &lt; 0.001; SME absent vs present, Walls, p &lt; 0.001, Floor, p = 0.972, All, p &lt; 0.001). Notably, unlike place cells, grid cells did not significantly remap between cue-present and Floor-Off trials (ANOVA Cue presence*Manipulation, F(2,109) = 99.92, p &lt; 0.001; SME absent vs present, Walls Off, p &lt; 0.001, Floor Off, p = 0.079, All Off, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p id="P7">Furthermore, the Walls-Off condition disrupted place and grid cell firing to the same extent as the All-Off condition: there were no significant differences in spatial information, gridness or intra-trial stability between these conditions (SME pairwise comparison: spatial information, p = 0.469; place cell intra-trial stability: p = 0.738; gridness, p = 0.487; grid cell intra-trial stability, p = 0.425). These results suggest that environmental walls are the cues responsible for stabilising place and grid cell firing within this virtual environment.</p><p id="P8">A subset of cells were also recorded in a second cue-present trial, directly after the cue-absent trial. Both place and grid cells restored their firing patterns after visual cues were replaced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>, see figure legend for detailed statistical results), indicating recording stability. As the Walls-Off and All-Off manipulations involved removing the visual cues from the proximal walls alongside the distal extra-maze cue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), the loss of a stable directional heading in this condition could be a potential explanation for the observed reduction of place and grid cell stability. However, the directional tuning of co-recorded mEC head direction cells was not significantly reduced in either Walls-Off or All-Off conditions, suggesting consistent heading information was retained in these ‘Cue-absent’ conditions, even in the absence of the extra-maze cue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Computational models predict that grid cells can generate regular hexagonal patterns from purely idiothetic information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Anchoring these patterns to the external world using landmark cues is thought to prevent instability arising from accrued path integration error<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. We tested whether, despite the breakdown of stable grid patterns when data were averaged over the whole trial (20 mins), grid patterns were present at short time scales in the cue-absent conditions, as this would be an indication of path integration drift. We focused on the Walls-Off and All-Off cue manipulations as these resulted in strong disruption of grid cell firing. Time-windowed auto-correlogram firing rate maps (see Methods) showed hexagonal patterns at short time intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>; peaking at 5 secs), with progressive disruption at longer durations. Gridness scores of the time-windowed rate maps increased at longer durations when cues were present but decreased at longer durations when cues were absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>; 2-way ANOVA Duration-Cue presence: SME Duration F(5, 136) = 37.34, p &lt; 0.001, interaction Duration*Cue presence F(5,136) = 13.87, p &lt; 0.001). Thus, hexagonal grid firing patterns were detectable over short time intervals in both cue-absent conditions.</p><p id="P10">Optic flow is thought to be an important source of movement information which can contribute to path integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. However, the patterned visual information provided by the floor did not significantly improve the gridness score at short time scales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>; Two-way ANOVA Manipulation-Duration: main effect of Manipulation (Walls Off vs All Off), F(5, 135) = 0.02, p = 0.904). There was no evidence, therefore, that optic flow from patterned visual information supports grid cell stability in the virtual reality environment.</p><p id="P11">In all cue-absent conditions, the animal’s movement was constrained within the same virtual boundaries as the cue-present trials, and the reward beacon remained visible at all times, with its position changing to pseudo-random locations after the animal consumed the reward. On average, the reward beacon moved approximately every 4-5 seconds, but was stable between these relocations. As the reward beacon was the only source of positional information in the All-Off condition, we reasoned that the mouse may infer the presence of the virtual boundary from the motion of the reward beacon relative to its own motor output. We tested whether such inferred boundaries could contribute to the short-time scale stability of spatial patterns we observed in the All-Off condition, by parsing the environment into boundary and centre zones, and calculating the intra-trial stability in each zone. We found that cue removal consistently reduced stability in the centre zone, relative to the boundary zone, for both place cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>; ANOVA Zone*Cue presence, F(1,611) = 6.97, p &lt; 0.01) and grid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>; ANOVA, Zone*Cue presence, F(1,106) = 34.97, p &lt; 0.001). However, the specific effects of cue removal were different across the two cell types. Place cells were equally stable across environmental boundary and centre when cues were present, but were significantly more stable near boundaries in the All-Off condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>; Paired t-test: All Off, t(611) = 6.03, p &lt; 0.001; cue-present, t(613) = 1.96, p = 0.051). These results suggest that, in a highly familiar environment, place fields can be at least partially stabilised by boundary cues even when these cues themselves are not perceptually available, but are rather inferred from the movement (relative to motor output) of other, perceptually available, cues. Grid cells, by contrast, were more stable in the environment centre when cues were present, but became equally unstable at all environmental locations in the All-Off condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>; Paired t-test: All Off, t(106) = 0.85, p = 0.40; Cue-present, t(106) = -8.41, p &lt; 0.001). Taken together, this indicates that place, but not grid representations, might benefit from the presence of the moving reward beacons to calculate location.</p><p id="P12">Following our unexpected finding that place fields can be stabilised by a boundary inferred from the movement of a discrete cue (the reward beacon), we tested whether place cell firing may be modulated by this cue. Specifically, we tested whether place cells encoded the animal’s bearing to the reward beacon, irrespective of the animal’s head orientation. We found that, in the baseline (cue present) condition, 18.6% (114/614) of place cells showed significant directional tuning towards the reward beacons (see Methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>). Directional tuning towards the beacon was reduced in the All-Off condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>; Cue-present: median = 0.12, IQR = 0.15; All-Off: median = 0.10, IQR = 0.12 for allocentric RV scores, Wilcoxon rank sum test, z = 7.30, p &lt; 0.001), but there remained a correlation between the degree of beacon tuning in baseline and All-Off trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>; r = 0.44; p &lt; 0.001, controlling for the boundary index) suggesting that beacon tuning is a cell-specific property. Moreover, the strength of place cells’ allocentric tuning (RV scores) in the All-Off condition was significantly and positively correlated with the intra-trial stability in the All-Off condition, irrespective of the relative position of place fields with respect to environmental boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>; partial correlation r = 0.19; p &lt; 0.001, controlling for the boundary index), indicating that, in our experimental paradigm, the reward beacons help to stabilise the firing patterns of place cells in the All-Off condition.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">It has long been understood that the hippocampus uses multimodal sensory information to generate spatially-tuned neural firing and support spatial cognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Disentangling the contribution of different sensory modalities can be practically difficult in a real-world setting, hence the importance of introducing virtual reality techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, which allow arbitrary manipulations of sensory stimuli. In this study, we set out to investigate how purely visual stimuli can control and support place and grid cell firing, whilst mice are exploring a virtual reality environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">We have shown that purely visual barriers, which present no somatosensory or olfactory cues to the animal (unlike real-world barriers), nonetheless support place and grid cell firing. In the absence of these barrier cues (Wall-Off and All-Off manipulations), both place and grid cell firing is severely degraded. By contrast, a virtual floor alone cannot provide stability to spatially-tuned neurons. Our results are consistent with many lines of evidence demonstrating the importance of boundaries for neural representations of space: boundaries have a strong influence on shaping firing patterns of place cells and grid cells in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, as well as neural representations in the human medial temporal lobes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">Although the importance of boundaries to shape spatial firing is well recognised, no previous study has focused on which specific sensory properties of boundaries can modulate place and grid cell firing. The reported enhanced stability of grid cells in close proximity to boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, for example, suggests that somatosensory information/physical contact with a barrier may be necessary to stabilise grid representations. Here we have shown, instead, that a purely visual boundary is sufficient for stabilising the firing of spatially-tuned neurons. Our study significantly adds to our understanding of the role of visual cues in supporting grid cell firing.</p><p id="P16">Grid cell networks display conserved internal dynamics across behavioural states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and, when recorded in the absence of visual input, grid cells maintain consistent co-activity patterns, despite spatial instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that grid cell instability may be caused by excessive accumulation of path integration error, such that the internally coherent grid network ‘drifts’ with respect to the external world. This interpretation predicts that hexagonal grid patterns should be detectable at sufficiently short time scales, with the time scale depending on the rate of error accumulation. In contrast to the previous studies where only distance tuning, not drifting hexagonal patterns, could be detected when grid cell firing was disrupted in the dark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, our study is the first to demonstrate the presence of coherent but drifting hexagonal grid cell firing during spatial exploration, and shows that, in our experimental setup, error accumulation begins to degrade grid stability from 5 seconds onwards. Surprisingly, the presence of patterned visual cues on the floor of the virtual environment does not reduce the rate of error accumulation, indicating that not all visual cues can stabilise grid firing equally, and reinforcing the privileged role that boundaries play.</p><p id="P17">In addition to this, and unexpectedly, we observe that the firing patterns of place cells are more stable in areas near environmental boundaries even in the All-Off condition, when the boundaries are not directly visible, and the only environmental cue available is the (moving) reward beacon. We therefore hypothesise that the animal can infer the presence of the boundary from the movement of the beacon, relative to the animal’s own motor output. As the animal’s progress through the virtual space is blocked when it encounters the invisible boundary, this creates a mismatch between the visually observed beacon movement, and that predicted from the animal’s own motor output. We hypothesise that the animal can use this mismatch to infer boundary position, such that this inferred boundary can enhance place cell stability. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that an ‘invisible’ boundary, whose only physical manifestation is an impediment to movement, can modulate hippocampal spatial responses. Our results therefore expand the functional definition of boundaries to encompass entities that are not solely defined by their sensory characteristics.</p><p id="P18">Furthermore, our results show that the firing of a sub-population of place cells tracks the allocentric bearing of the animal to the reward beacon (which moves approximately every 4-5 seconds, but is stable between these relocations). This result is consistent with the previously reported modulation of hippocampal place cell firing by (stable) goals and/or objects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. We observe a significant correlation between place cell stability and the degree of their allocentric directional tuning to the reward beacon, indicating that tracking the allocentric location of the visible reward beacon enhances place cell stability.</p><p id="P19">In conclusion, our results demonstrate that purely visual boundaries can stabilise hippocampal spatial representations. We show, for the first time, the existence of coherently drifting hexagonal grid representations when boundary information is absent. Conversely, we also report the first evidence that hippocampal place cell responses can be modulated by sensorimotor feedback, on the basis of our unexpected observation that place cell responses can be stabilised by invisible boundaries.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Star Methods</title><sec id="S4"><title>Subjects and Surgery</title><p id="P20">Seven C57BL/6 mice were implanted with custom-made head plates and microdrives loaded with 17μm platinum-iridium tetrodes.

Then the rotational autocorrelations of these rings were calculated and a set of gridness scores were computed as the difference between the lowest correlation observed at 60 or 120 degrees of rotation and the highest correlation at 30, 90, or 150 degrees.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Place/Grid field stability</title><p id="P27">Intra-trial stability was calculated by correlating the firing rates of spatially corresponding bins between the first and the second halves of a trial. Inter-trial stability was measured by correlating the firing rates of spatially corresponding bins between the baseline and manipulation trials.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Analysis of allocentric reward-modulated firing</title><p id="P28">Allocentric reward-bearing polar plots were constructed by first calculating, for every position sample, the angle to the current reward position in the virtual environment reference frame. Angles were then binned into 6° bins, and spikes assigned to each bin. Both position maps and spike maps were smoothed separately using a 30° wide boxcar filter and finally the smoothed spike maps were divided by the smoothed position maps. The directional tuning of the cell was measured using the length of the mean resultant vector (Rayleigh Vector; RV) of the bins of the reward-tuned directional firing rate maps. To classify cells were as reward-tuned, the actual RV lengths were compared to null distributions of RV lengths derived from two different populations of spike-shuffled data, generated by: (1) shifting the entire spike train randomly with respect to position (as for place and grid cell classification), (2) maintaining the mean firing rate in each 2-dimensional rate map bin, but reassigning the spikes which occurred in each rate map bin randomly across the total set of time points for which the animal occupied that same bin. The second shuffle controlled for artifactual reward bearing tunings which may have arisen primarily from the concentration of firing in one particular (2-dimensional) location. A cell was classified as reward-tuned if its reward bearing map RV length exceeded the higher of the 99<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the two shuffled reward bearing RV lengths described above.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Correlation between reward tuning and stability</title><p id="P29">To test whether the enhanced stability of reward tuned cells was primarily driven by their proximity to a boundary, the correlation of stability versus reward tuning was a partial correlation, controlling for a ‘boundary score’, which quantified the extent to which firing occurred near a boundary. The boundary score was calculated by assigning weights to each bin in a rate map based on its distance to the closest edge. The boundary score for each cell was defined by the sum of the firing rates within each bin multiplied by the corresponding weight from the mask.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS190451-supplement-Supplemental_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d12aAdDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S14"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by the BBSRC (BB/W007878/1 to G.C. and BB/I021221/1 to F.C.), the Royal Society (RGS\R1\221070 to G.C.), the European Union H2020 research and innovation programme (Human Brain Project #785907, SGA2 to G.C., F.C., N.B.), China Scholarship Council (X.Y., G.C.), the Wellcome Trust (Fellowship 220886/Z/20/Z to T.W.), the European Research Council (consolidator award ‘DEVMEM’ to F.C.) and the Wellcome Trust (Investigator Award, 210690/Z/18/Z).</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN3" fn-type="con"><p id="P30"><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p id="P31">G.C. and F.C. conceived the study.
