Monocytes are increased in patients after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and specifically nonclassical monocytes have been associated with disease severity, but whether COVID-19 vaccines also alter monocytic cell populations is not known.</p><p id="P6">SARS-CoV-2 infection causes mild-to-moderate disease in most people. In a subset of people with severe disease, uncontrolled inflammation known as “cytokine storm” can lead to coagulation and thromboembolic events in either the arterial or the venous systems, often leading to thrombocytopenia. Platelets are produced from progenitor megakaryocytes during hematopoietic stem cell (HPC) differentiation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> a process primarily driven by thrombopoietin made in the kidney and the liver. Platelets are versatile immune cells that can act as antigen presenting cells and mediators of thrombosis. Platelets play a key role in the internalization of invading pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, and they are known to harbor infectious virus and infect macrophages during phagocytosis of infected platelets in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Both low and high platelet counts are indicators of pathology, resulting in thrombocytopenia or thrombocythemia, respectively. Monocytes are bone marrow-derived leukocytes that participate in immune responses by engulfing pathogens (phagocytosis). In humans, monocytes are classified into three main subsets based on their expression of specific cell surface markers: classical (CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>−</sup>), intermediate (CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>) and non-classical (CD14<sup>−</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>). Classical monocytes constitute 80–95% of circulating monocytes and do not secrete pro-inflammatory mediators.</p><p id="P7">Lysine-specific demethylase 6A (UTX/<italic>KDM6A</italic>) is an X-linked gene that escapes X-inactivation and specifically removes repressive trimethylation from histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). Abnormal expression of <italic>KDM</italic> genes is known in several cancers and inflammatory diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> In mice, <italic>Kdm6a</italic> was the top sexually dimorphic gene in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and associated with autoimmunity and neuropathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> Changes in expression levels of <italic>KDM6A</italic> and several genes that encode histones can be a sign of acute inflammation and cellular stress. SARS-CoV-2 infection alters mitochondrial function in PBMCs and increases reliance on glycolysis to compensate for energy deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> SARS-CoV-2 open reading frames (ORFs) localize in host’s mitochondria,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> where they suppress hosts’ innate immunity by manipulating mitochondrial function and the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)/tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF3 and TRAF6) signaling pathways. Mitochondria are the main site of ATP production and contain their own DNA (mtDNA). Any manipulation of mtDNA can be detrimental to its function as well to the progeny, if gonadal mtDNA is altered in anyway.</p><p id="P8">Our aim was to identify potential gene targets in immune cell subtypes that might underlie mechanisms behind sex differences in COVID-19 mRNA vaccine adverse events and possibly pathways that are shared with COVID-19. To do so, we analyzed public datasets from gene expression omnibus (GEO) to investigate sex differences following vaccination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>

Due to low sample size after the first vaccine dose (only one female on Day 1 and 2 females on Days 2–21) we focused on sex differences before vaccination (Day 0) and after the second vaccine dose (Day 22, 28 and 42). Analysis was performed using the Aseesa Stars (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aseesa.com">www.aseesa.com</ext-link>) analysis tool as described below.</p><sec id="S7"><title>Data Normalization</title><p id="P10">Data was normalized using transcripts per million (TPM) because the number of increased and decreased genes was more balanced compared to transcripts per cell (TPC), transcripts per positive cell (TPPC) and percent positive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1a</xref>). TPM was calculated for every cell individually, summed, and divided by the total cell count for each sample. TPC was calculated by dividing the transcript count by the total cell count for each sample. TPPC was calculated by dividing the transcript count by the number of cells in which at least one transcript of the symbol was present. Percent positive was calculated by dividing the number of cells in which at least one transcript of the symbol was present by the total cell count. If a symbol was present in multiple cell types, the number of transcripts, cells, positive cells, and TPM were summed before normalization. Cell counts were normalized to the total included cell count. For symbols that were detected in a test group but not in a control group, the value 2<sup>−10</sup> was imputed as the normalized control average. Due to suspected cross-contamination in a small number of cells, female test groups were further restricted to cells that were positive for <italic>XIST</italic> and negative for <italic>PRKY</italic>. Male test groups were restricted to cells negative for <italic>XIST</italic>. Excluding <italic>XIST</italic>-negative female cells did not significantly affect the results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1b</xref>). Roughly 80–100% of female cells were positive for <italic>XIST</italic> depending on the cell type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref>). Unclassified Cluster 2 cells were always excluded; Platelets and Natural Killer T (NKT) cells were only included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>; 98.3% of NKT cells were positive for the platelet marker PPBP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S2b</xref>). Antibody-dependent tags (ADTs) were excluded from analysis and did not count towards total transcript counts. Female cells tended to contain more transcripts per cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S2c</xref>), but there were no significant differences in the number of transcripts per positive cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S2d</xref>). In fact, the number of transcripts per positive cell did not fluctuate by more than 5.1% in Natural Killer cells and less than 2.8% in other cell types between females and males.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Heat Maps</title><p id="P11">Heat maps were created to show several symbols in a single chart instead of multiple bar charts.

IQRs were calculated by interpolating between data points to determine empirical quantiles. Degrees of freedom were calculated using the Welch–Satterthwaite equation, and exact p-values were calculated using the cumulative t-distribution functions as p = 2 * MIN(P(x), Q(x)). Labels next to gene symbols denote the percentage of cells across all test groups in which transcripts of the symbol were detected; percentages next to other symbols (e.g. cell types) denote the percentage of samples in which the symbol was detected.

Databases that were used to search for AEs included vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS), VigiAcess, EudraVigilance (European Economic Area only), and Pfizer documents, covering a period between February 2021 and August 2022 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Nearly 67.4% of all AEs and 60% of severe AEs for COVID-19 vaccines were reported by women, which is comparable to AE rates of other non-COVID-19 vaccines such as SHINGRIX (females: 67.2% of reports, 2017–2022) and quadrivalent influenza vaccines (70.4%, 2012–2022). We observed sex differences in the incidence of myocarditis (males: 0.91% of reports, females: 0.22%) for COVID-19 vaccines in VAERS. Given that COVID-19 symptoms, AEs, and outcomes that are reported by males and females differ, it is likely that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines result in both shared and distinct immunomodulation between the sexes.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Immune cell subtype status in women and men before and after 2 doses of Pfizer’s BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine</title><p id="P19">Before vaccination (Day 0), platelets were significantly increased in females compared to males (3.63% vs 1.82%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, p = 0.0471). Although platelet counts are known to be higher in females,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> the difference was reported to be minor (7.4% more in females), and therefore these differences likely reflect individual variability in the study population rather than reproducible sex differences. B and T cells are known to be more abundant in females, whereas NK cells are known to be more abundant in males.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> In agreement with previous observations, similar trends were noted for mature B cells (12.72% vs 8.16%), naïve B cells (0.75% vs 0.34%) and NK cells (9.7% vs 17.8%) although they did not reach statistical significance likely due to low sample size and high age variability in the male group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). T cells counts were similar between sexes (44% vs 42%), with notably less naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in males (3.35% vs 7.79%) but similar numbers of mature CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (8.3% vs 7.25%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).

We found that C8 cells also expressed high levels of DNA dC-&gt;dU-editing enzyme APOBEC-3A (Supplementary Fig. S3a).

There did not appear to be any notable sex differences in the 40 most increased and decreased genes by impact score (top 10 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), although the vaccine-induced gene signature was still evident (non-significantly) only in females on Day 28. We next sought to identify sex differences in the response to vaccination and searched for genes with the greatest difference between the change in males and the change in females on Day 22 vs Day 0. Genes were sorted by differences in p-value, relative change and absolute change, and the average rank across the 3 sorting methods was calculated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table S5</xref>), with the 20 most-differing genes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>. <italic>TSC22D3, CEBPD, DDIT4</italic> and <italic>CEBPB</italic> increased in females but not in males on Days 22 and 42, whereas <italic>KCNE3</italic> increased in males but decreased in females on Days 22, 28 and 42.</p><p id="P24">We selected <italic>CEBPD, DDIT4</italic> and <italic>KCNE3</italic> for further investigation and noted baseline sex differences in all 3 genes that disappeared following the 2<sup>nd</sup> BNT162b2 dose.

The opposite trend was seen with <italic>KCNE3</italic>, which was 50% less abundant in males on Day 0 but doubled by Day 42 in males only. Finally, BRCA1-associated ring domain 1 (<italic>BARD1</italic>) was the only gene that increased significantly in males and decreased significantly in females following vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), mainly in HPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Interestingly, even though most samples contained a very small number of Cluster 8 cells there was a strong, negative correlation between Cluster 8 cells and CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>) with highly similar r, R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and p-values between sexes.

Since the female group in this dataset was younger (average age females: 29, males: 40) our findings are consistent with these results.
