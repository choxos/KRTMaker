NLRP3 inflammasome activity must be controlled as unregulated and chronic inflammation underlies inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Several findings uncovered that NLRP3 inflammasome activity is under the regulation of centrosome localized proteins such as NEK7 and HDAC6, however, whether the centrosome composition or structure is altered during the inflammasome activation is not known. Our data show that levels of the centrosomal scaffold protein pericentrin (PCNT) are reduced upon NLRP3 inflammasome activation via different activators in human and murine macrophages. PCNT loss occurs in the presence of membrane stabilizer punicalagin,suggesting this is not a consequence of membrane rupture. We found that PCNT loss is dependent on NLRP3 and active caspases as MCC950 and pan caspase inhibitor ZVAD prevent its degradation. Moreover, caspase-1 and GSDMD are both required for this NLRP3-mediated PCNT loss because absence of caspase-1 or GSDMD triggers an alternative regulation of PCNT via its cleavage by caspase-3 in response to nigericin stimulation. PCNT degradation occurs in response to nigericin, but also other NLRP3 activators including lysomotropic agent L-Leucyl-L-Leucine methyl ester (LLOMe) and hypotonicity. Our work reveals that the NLRP3 inflammasome activation affects centrosome composition and structure which may deepen our understandings of how activated NLRP3 inflammasomes are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Centrosome</kwd><kwd>NLRP3 Inflammasome</kwd><kwd>Pyroptosis</kwd><kwd>Caspases</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Inflammasome activation in macrophages is an early event occurring at the initiation of an inflammatory response. Inflammasomes, formed by sensor proteins such as NLRP3, assemble in response to pathogenic or damage signals leading to the activation of caspase-1 which is responsible for the cleavage of pro-IL1β and pro-IL18 into their active forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] as well as for the cleavage of GSDMD, which N-terminal domain forms pores in the membrane required for IL-1ß and IL-18 release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. GSDMD cleavage is also required for the induction of pyroptosis, a programmed lytic cell death induced upon inflammasome-caspase-1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Subcellular localization of NLRP3 inflammasome is important for its function. Several organelles contribute to NLRP3 regulation and activation either by acting as assembly platforms or as sensors of NLRP3 activating stimuli that mediate inflammasome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The centrosome is one of such organelles. Centrosome associated proteins MARK4, HDAC6, NEK7, PLK1 and PLK4 contribute to either the trafficking of NLRP3 to the centrosome or to regulation of NLRP3, mediating its activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. However, little is known about how changes to the centrosome composition and integrity are related to inflammasome activation.</p><p id="P4">The centrosome is a dynamic organelle which plays important roles in microtubule organisation and in cell cycle but also in stress and damage responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Centrosomes are formed by the centrioles and a cloud of proteins around them called the pericentriolar material (PCM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Pericentrin (PCNT) is one of the main components of the PCM of the centrosome. In humans it presents two main isoforms PCNT-A (220 kDa) and PCNT-B (also known as kendrin, 340 kDa) and that shares its N-terminal end with PCNT-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The composition of the centrosome is altered during the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] as well as in response to stresses such as DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] or heat shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Sensing of pro-inflammatory stimuli including the bacterial component LPS induces cell cycle arrest in G1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Moreover, LPS increases the accumulation of pericentriolar components at the PCM including PCNT and γ-tubulin reflecting an alteration of the PCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Interestingly monocytes from febrile patients with a fever or subjected to heat stress present a reversible loss of integrity of the centrosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Pyroptosis and apoptosis are different forms of programmed cell death. Pyroptosis, unlike apoptosis, does not depend on apoptotic caspases (caspase-3, -9, etc.) activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] but on proinflammatory caspases (e.g., caspase-1) and the assembly of the GSDMD pore at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Pyroptosis is a lytic cell death where contents are released to the extracellular environment and contribute to inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. It is become clear however, that in the absence of GSDMD and hence pyroptosis, caspase-1 activation triggered by NLRP3 inflammasome leads to caspase-3 activation and consequently apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. This process is followed by caspase-3 mediated cleavage of Gasdermin E, that eventually also leads to a pyroptotic event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Moreover, cells lacking caspase-1 are also able to trigger incomplete pyroptosis via caspase-3, highlighting a tight cross-regulation between these two types of cell death and caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p><p id="P6">The centrosome can assemble and disassemble in response to specific stimuli and this is essential for appropriate cell division. Here, PCNT is cleaved by separase, a member of the Cell Death family of cysteine proteases, which also includes caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. PCNT cleavage by separase occurs at R2231 (leading to a 275kDa fragment), and mutations in this site suppresses centriole disengagement and subsequent centriole duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Cleavage of PCNT can also be mediated by caspase-3 in response to apoptotic stimuli. Seo and Rhee (2018) demonstrated that treatment of HeLa cells with apoptotic agents led to the cleavage of PCNT while no cleavage of γ-tubulin was detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. The specific PCNT cleavage sites targeted by caspase-3 remain to be identified. However, it remains unclear whether the centrosome is targeted by caspase-1 in pyroptotic cells and how this is governed.</p><p id="P7">Here, we investigated the relationship between centrosome and inflammasome activation in macrophages. We found that centrosome structure and PCNT protein are lost in response to NLRP3 activators nigericin, LLOMe, and hyptonocity and that this is dependent on the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD signalling axis. This work highlights that the centrosome is altered and dysfunctional in the pyroptotic environment formed by NLRP3 inflammasome activation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p id="P8">LPS (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 026:B6); Nigericin (N7143); protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340); phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, P8139); penicillin-streptomycin (Pen/Strep, P4333); Punicalagin (P0023); Caspase-1 Inhibitor IV (YVAD, 400015); MG-132 (M7449); Bovine Serum Albumin (A7906) and Formaldehyde solution (50-00-0) were from Sigma.

We have previously shown that LPS priming has minimal effect on NLRP3 inflammasome activation in THP1 cells and to reduce complexity in the experimental system, we did not LPS-prime THP1 cells here. We found that nigericin induced cell death, caspase-1 activation as well as IL-18 release overtime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-C</xref>). We then looked at the expression of PCNT in cell lysates by Western blot. We detected three main different bands for PCNT; PCNT-A (220 kDa) and PCNT-B (340 kDa) as well as a band corresponding to the separase-cleaved PCNT-B (275kDa) in untreated cells. We found that levels of PCNT started decreasing after 15 min of nigericin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Expression of another PCM component, γ-tubulin was however unchanged as was β-actin which was used as loading control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). To determine if the decrease in PCNT levels were due to its release we concentrated the supernatants from those cells and ran western blots for the same three proteins. We could not detect PCNT in these supernatants however γ-tubulin and β-actin were present after 30 min of treatment corresponding to an increase in cell death and protein release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). To further examine that this reduction in PCNT levels was not due to the release of this protein we performed the same nigericin time-response experiment but collected lysates and supernatants together (whole well lysate). Here we found again that PCNT levels decreased over time after nigericin treatment while γ-tubulin and β-actin levels remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P25">To further investigate the effect of nigericin on centrosomal integrity we performed immunofluorescence on PMA differentiated THP1 cells, in response to nigericin treatment for 45 and 90 min, for the PCM proteins PCNT, γ-tubulin, and the centriole distal appendix protein ninein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] and ASC, to determine inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G-K</xref>). In line with our western blot data, we found that PCNT centrosomal signal was lost after nigericin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G, J</xref>). A decrease in centrosomal γ-tubulin and ninein stain was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H, I, J</xref>). We found that centrosomal loss was mainly observed in cells that presented ASC specks, indicating that the ASC-speck remains intact in cells despite loss of centrosome integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>). This indicates that nigericin treatment and inflammasome activation leads to loss of centrosomal integrity in macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Centrosomal disorganization triggered by nigericin is NLRP3 dependent</title><p id="P26">To determine if this PCNT loss was dependent on NLRP3 we treated PMA-differentiated THP1 cells either WT (parental THP1<sup>Null2</sup>) or expressing an endogenous PYD-deficient NLRP3 (THP1<sup>NLRP3-/-</sup>) with nigericin (10 μM, 45 min). We found that PCNT protein level was reduced in response to nigericin in the parental THP1 cell line and that this did not occur in THP1<sup>NLRP3-/-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). Nigericin treatment of THP1<sup>NLRP3-/-</sup> cells did not result in increased cell death, caspase1 activation or IL-18 release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A, B</xref>) after nigericin treatment unlike WT cells, confirming deficient function of NLRP3 inflammasome. These results suggest that centrosome is perturbed after the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated.</p><p id="P27">To further discount that our observation on PCNT downregulation was due to its release due to pyroptosis, we used punicalagin (50 μM, 15 min) to inhibit membrane permeability as punicalagin allows for NLRP3 inflammasome activation but not IL-18 release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. We also pre-treated THP1 cells with ZVAD a pan caspase inhibitor to prevent consequences of NLRP3 activation (caspase activation and IL-18 release). We found that, while ZVAD prevented loss of PCNT in response to nigericin, punicalagin treatment did not prevent loss of PCNT in response to NLRP3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E-G</xref>). This is despite of punicalagin and ZVAD inducing a reduction in cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>) as well as in active caspase-1 and IL-18 release in response to nigericin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C, D</xref>). We further confirmed these results by measuring PCNT signal and ASC-speck formation by immunofluorescence after nigericin treatment in the presence of ZVAD, punicalagin and the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I-K</xref>). As before we found that centrosomal loss after nigericin treatment was mainly observed in cells that presented ASC specks. We found that punicalagin treatment did not alter PCNT loss induced by nigericin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I, J</xref>). We also found that in cells treated with ZVAD, and where ASC specks were able to form, no loss of PCNT occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I-K</xref>). Finally, treatment with MCC950 prevented assembly of the inflammasome indicated by the absence of ASC specks and no loss of PCNT stain was observed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I, J</xref>).</p><p id="P28">We next tested if other NLRP3 inflammasome activators also triggered PCNT loss. First, we established that LPS priming of PMA-differentiated THP1 cells did not alter PCNT loss described in unprimed cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). We found that LPS-primed THP1 cells still lost PCNT signal after 45 min nigericin treatment and this was prevented by the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). We then assessed the effect of LLOMe on PCNT loss. LLOMe mediates NLRP3-inflammasome activation by destabilizing the lysosomal membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. We treated PMA-differentiated LPS-primed THP1 cells with LLOMe (1 mM, 1 h) and observed increased cell death and caspase-1 activity as expected. While ZVAD blocked caspase-1 activity it only partially blocked cell death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D, E</xref>). Like nigericin, LLOMe triggered PCNT loss, however, that was not prevented by treatment with ZVAD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A-C</xref>). Next, we tested the effect of NLRP3 activation via cell volume regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] in PCNT regulation. For this we treated PMA-differentiated LPS-primed THP1 cells with a hypotonic solution for 1 and 3 h. We found that, as previously described, hypotonic shock led to caspase-1 activation and cell death at these time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3I, J</xref>). This was matched by loss of PCNT levels in the cell lysates at both time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3F-H</xref>).</p><p id="P29">In order to determine if PCNT loss occurred in a different cell type, we used murine BMDMs.</p><p id="P30">As BMDMs require priming for appropriate NLRP3 inflammasome activation we treated these cells with LPS 1μg/ml for 4 h prior to nigericin treatment. We observed that as in THP1 cells, treatment of BMDMs with nigericin led to reduced PCNT expression and this was prevented by MCC950. However, unlike un-primed THP1 cells ZVAD failed to rescue the induced cell death and in these conditions PCNT levels were not recovered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). All of this suggests that PCNT loss is a general response when the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Nigericin leads to NLRP3 localization at centrosomal and non-centrosomal locations</title><p id="P31">As we had observed that nigericin triggered PCNT disruption in cells with an active inflammasome and given that the centrosome could be a place of assembly for the NLRP3 inflammasome, we next studied the relationship between the centrosome and NLRP3-location using a THP1 cell line stably expressing GFP-NLRP3 in an NLRP3 deficient background (THP1<sup>GFP-NLRP3</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Upon NLRP3-activation with nigericin 30 min, to minimise centrosomal loss, we found that GFP-NLRP3 formed NLRP3-ASC-specks indicating active inflammasome platforms as expected, mainly at non-centrosomal locations. We also observed NLRP3 accumulation at the centrosome as GFP-NLRP3 co-localised with the pericentriolar material component PCNT, however these NLRP3-structures did not co-localise with ASC, suggesting this NLRP3 is non active. Both types of NLRP3-structures could be found simultaneously within the same cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Nigericin treatment of THP1 cells expressing GFP alone in a WT background (GFP-THP1) did not lead to GFP re-location to the centrosome demonstrating that the observed effect is very likely driven by NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). We next treated THP1<sup>GFP-NLRP3</sup> cells with nigericin in the presence of the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 and ZVAD. We found that MCC950 prevented assembly of non-centrosomal NLRP3-ASC specks however did not alter the ability of NLRP3 to move to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD did not prevent assembly of NLRP3-ASC-specks or NLRP3-association to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). In this experimental system we also detected PCNT loss after inflammasome activation as shown by quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-D</xref>). Quantification of a time course of nigericin treatment in this cellular system showed similar results to those obtained in wild type THP1 cells indicating an increase in PCNT loss proportional to NLRP3-ASC-speck formation that was prevented by MCC950 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). In these conditions, accumulation of NLRP3 at the centrosome occurred in the presence and absence of MCC950 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E, F</xref>). These data confirm that NLRP3 can be directed to the centrosome although in apparently a non-functional state, and that this directed localization occurs in parallel to inflammasome activation.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>PCNT loss induced by NLRP3 inflammasome is dependent on caspase-1 activation</title><p id="P32">Having shown that PCNT loss depends upon NLRP3 activation and that it can be prevented by pan caspase inhibitor ZVAD in THP1 cells we next considered the specific effect of caspase-1 in PCNT loss, initially using the caspase-1 inhibitor YVAD (36). YVAD pre-treatment blocked caspase-1 activity and IL-18 release but only partially decreased cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D-F</xref>) induced by nigericin. This is reflected in YVAD treatment partially rescuing the downregulation of PCNT induced by nigericin in vehicle treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-C</xref>). To further confirm the contribution of caspase-1 to PCNT degradation we used THP1 cells deficient for caspase-1 (THP1<sup>Caspase1-/-</sup> cells). We found that nigericin treatment of these cells did not induce pyroptosis or IL-18 release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4H-J</xref>). When looking at PCNT expression we found that in the absence of caspase-1 PCNT levels were not reduced in response to nigericin. However, we detected a cleaved band of around 200kDa that would correspond to the size of caspase-3 mediated cleavage of PCNT previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] since nigericin triggered activation of caspase-3 in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). Our data suggest that caspase-1 activation contributes to PCNT degradation when NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by nigericin in THP1 cells.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Proteasomal and lysosomal activity does not affect NLRP3-induced PCNT loss</title><p id="P33">We next wanted to understand what controlled the described loss of PCNT. As proteasome inhibition regulates levels of PCM proteins including PCNT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] we first tested the role of the proteasome in PCNT loss. For this we treated THP1 PMA differentiated cells with proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 μM) for 2 h prior to nigericin treatment. We found that nigericin treatment increased proteasome activity, and that this was blocked by MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>). We found that total PCNT levels were increased when cells were treated with MG132 alone, indicating PCNT regulation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). However, when treated with nigericin, these cells still lost PCNT in the presence of MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that PCNT degradation induced by nigericin is not mediated by proteasomal regulation.</p><p id="P34">We next explored the links between lysosome and PCNT loss. Lysosomal cathepsins have been linked to inflammasome activation mediated by nigericin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. We tested the role of cathepsins by using the cathepsin inhibitor E-64-D (20 μM) for 2 h, the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074 (50 μM) for 15 min, or the cathepsin D inhibitor pepstatin A (10 μM) for 15 min before nigericin stimulation. We confirmed activity of these inhibitors as we found that E-64-D and CA-074 decreased cathepsin B activity, and pepstatin A reduced cathepsin D activity in THP1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B-D</xref>). We found that these inhibitors did not affect cell death, caspase1 activity or IL-18 release levels induced by nigericin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F-H, J-L, N-P</xref>). Similar to what was observed with MG132 treatment, nigericin stimulation resulted in PCNT degradation even in the presence of these inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E, I, M</xref>) suggesting that cathepsins are not required for the PCNT degradation.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>GSDMD is required for PCNT disruption triggered by pyroptosis but not by apoptosis</title><p id="P35">Caspase-1 activation triggered by NLRP3 inflammasome results in GSDMD cleavage and consequently assembly of GSDMD pores in the plasma membrane triggering pyroptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. These pores have also been described as conduits for release of IL-1β. To examine the link between GSDMD and pyroptosis in PCNT loss we compared expression of PCNT in THP1<sup>WT</sup> and THP1<sup>GSDMD-/-</sup> cells pre-treated with vehicle or ZVAD and followed by nigericin activation (10 μM, 45 min). GSDMD deficiency led to reduced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>) and extracellular caspase-1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>) compared to WT cells, as caspase-1 release was prevented in these cells. Despite the presence of active caspase-1, nigericin treatment of THP1<sup>GSDMD-/-</sup> did not lead to PCNT loss as in WT cells, but to PCNT processing indicative of caspase-3 mediated cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>) (as in caspase-1 deficient THP1 cells) given that GSDMD deficiency leads to a switch from pyroptosis to apoptosis in response to nigericin with activation of caspase-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Activation of caspase-3 and caspase-1 was confirmed in the lysates of WT and GSDMD deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). We confirmed that the observed caspase-3 mediated PCNT cleavage was prevented by ZVAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>) and that was also blocked by caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DVED confirming this processing is caspase-3 dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E-G</xref>). Furthermore, nigericin treatment in the presence of Z-DVED not only prevented caspase-3 mediated PCNT cleavage, but partially recovered the PCNT loss as observed in WT cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P36">In recent years the centrosome has been proposed as an important player in NLRP3 inflammasome activation by acting as a cellular location for inflammasome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] as well as for regulating activation via centrosomal proteins like PLK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] and PLK4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Our data adds to this knowledge by showing that the centrosome is disrupted after inflammasome activation. Here we have found that NLRP3 inflammasome activation by different triggers, nigericin, LLOMe and hypotonicity, leads to loss of centrosomal proteins and centrosomal disorganization. This disruption is dependent on caspase-1 and GSDMD and we show that pyroptosis, but not membrane rupture, is driving this centrosomal loss in human and murine macrophages.</p><p id="P37">Pyroptosis is a characteristic type of cell death driven by inflammasome activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. GSDMD and ninjurin-1 are two important mediators in this cellular mode of cell death. GSDMD cleavage and pore formation in response to inflammasome activation are required for IL-1β and IL-18 release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>], as well as driving pyroptotic cell death, while ninjurin-1 is responsible for the plasma membrane rupture that follows GSDMD pore formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Our observation that treatment with the membrane stabiliser punicalagin did not prevent centrosomal loss or inflammasome activation, but just cytokine release, suggests that this PCNT loss is intrinsically associated to the pyroptotic process and not membrane rupture. GSDMD deficient cells treated with nigericin, are still able to form an active inflammasome, like cells treated with punicalagin. However, GSDMD deficient cells do not die of pyroptosis but apoptosis mediated by caspase-3 despite caspase-1 still being active. In these conditions, PCNT was prevalently cleaved by caspase-3 suggesting that although caspase-1 is involved in centrosomal disruption, this is not directly mediating PCNT loss.</p><p id="P38">We observed that, except in the case of punicalagin or GSDMD deficient cells, PCNT-loss was proportional to the release of LDH that occurred after activation. This was more obvious after the use of ZVAD or YVAD. We found that in LPS-treated cells (THP1 and BMDMs) ZVAD was active and able to block IL-18 and IL-1β release, however, had no major effect on LDH release. This differential effect of YVAD and ZVAD has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Here the authors showed that these compounds fail to block the cleavage of the effector molecule GSDMD by caspase-1 and hence prevent LDH release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] while still able to block cleavage of IL-1β and IL-18. This provides yet another link between the pyroptotic process and PCNT loss. Why we mainly observed this in LPS treated cells we still do not understand and would require further studies.</p><p id="P39">We have found that nigericin treatment leads to the accumulation of non-active GFP-NLRP3 at the centrosome and active NLRP3-GFP at non-centrosomal locations. These observations agree with a recent report showing that NLRP3 tagged with neon Green (NLRP3-mNG) aggregate at both centrosomal and non-centrosomal localizations in THP1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. The centrosome acts as a signalling hub where proteins come in and out to tightly regulate cellular processes such as DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] or cell cycle entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Hence one could think that NLRP3 accumulates at the centrosome before becoming fully functional as a way of controlling unwanted excessive activation. Whether NLRP3 is then degraded or released to form an active inflammasome is currently unknown. When we looked at endogenous ASC-speck formation we found that the centrosome was not the predominant ASC-speck localization, although could be observed in some cells. Although this differs from the reports of Li [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] and Magupalli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], this is consistent with our data using GFP-NLRP3 as well as recent work from Liu Y, et al. (2023), which found that although ASC-specks are closer to the microtubule organizing centre (MTOC), they do not co-localize with this organelle markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. It is possible that localization of ASC-specks at the centrosome is very transient and considering the disruption of the centrosome described here it might be difficult to detect such cellular positioning.</p><p id="P40">Centrosome plasticity is manifested during inflammation. LPS priming of macrophages induces recruitment of PCM components such as PCNT and γ-tubulin to the centrosome and is important for cytokine secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. This process reminds of centrosome amplification but occurs during interphase and independently of PLK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Similarly in microglia LPS leads to the recruitment of microtubule nucleating material to the centrosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. This might be linked to the ability of LPS to arrest cells in G0/1 state, altering cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] and hence centrosomal composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Centrosomal restructuring has also been reported in monocytes from febrile patients. This occurred by proteasomal mediated degradation at the centrosome induced by heat shock. Interestingly, this process mediated by Hsp70, was reversible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Although authors propose that this is a process important for the immune response, whether macrophages function during inflammation is affected when centrosome is re-structured remains to be assessed. Heat shock induced centrosomal disruption resembles what we have observed in macrophages after inflammasome activation. Our study adds to the evidence that alterations on centrosomal composition occur during the inflammatory response. In our experimental conditions we observed an increase in proteasome activity after nigericin treatment that was prevented by proteasome inhibitor MG132. However, this did not prevent centrosomal disruption indicating that the mechanisms of regulation between these two processes are different. Proteasomal proteins can traffic in and out of the centrosome and can be degraded via other pathways such as autophagy and lysosomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. However, we failed to impair centrosomal loss or inflammasome activation by blocking either proteasome or lysosomal cathepsins. This suggests that there must be an alternative mechanism of degradation or compensatory pathways.</p><p id="P41">Microtubules are important for inflammasome function. Trafficking along microtubules to different locations in the cells, including the centrosome, is important for inflammasome activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Microtubule remodelling is also an important event in cell death. During apoptosis, microtubules are reformed organizing an apoptotic microtubule network important for maintaining plasma membrane integrity and cell morphology during the execution phase of apoptosis. Disruption of this network is however linked to secondary necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Disorganization of the cytoskeleton also occur during pyroptosis. Infection with Salmonella typhimurium induced loss of cytoskeletal marker α-tubulin, which was prevented in caspase-1 knock out cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Calcium entry triggered by inflammasome activation leads to calpain-mediated vimentin cleavage and release and disruption of intermediate filaments contributing to loss of cytoskeleton stability in THP-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. However, neither calpain inhibition nor EGTA treatment to chelate calcium prevented loss of actin filaments, microtubules, or nuclear lamina indicating that these proteins are regulated by a different mechanism that occurs in parallel to vimentin cleavage. Our data add to this showing that not only microtubules, but also the main microtubule organising centre is disrupted upon pyroptosis, suggesting that maybe centrosome disruption is the first step leading to cytoskeletal disassembly and rupture. This centrosomal disorganization could facilitate release of ASC-speck to the extracellular environment to propagate inflammation to neighbouring cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>].</p><p id="P42">Despite the importance of the centrosome in cell homeostasis and recent advances around inflammasome activation and the centrosome, little is known about the role of this organelle in macrophage function during inflammation. Here we have reported the disruption of the centrosome upon NLRP3-inflammasome activation. However, when does this centrosome remodelling commences and how this is regulated, we still do not understand. Additionally, how LPS, or other priming signals, alter centrosomal composition and how this contributes to different priming events, have not yet been explored. Moreover, the implications for NLRP3 presence at the centrosome after sensing NLRP3-activators are not understood and this deserves further studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS191525-supplement-Supplemental_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d209aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by a Presidents Doctoral Scholarship (The University of Manchester) to Siyi Bai, a Wellcome Trust and Royal Society Henry Dale Fellowship to G.
