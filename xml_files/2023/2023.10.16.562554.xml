We show here that 2HB directly inhibits branched-chain aminotransferase enzymes, and that this inhibition in turn triggers a SIRT4-dependent shift in the compartmental abundance of protein ADP-ribosylation. The 2HB-induced decrease in nuclear protein ADP-ribosylation leads to a C/EBPβ mediated transcriptional response in the branched-chain amino acid degradation pathway. This response to 2HB exposure leads to an improved oxidative capacity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo,</italic> with the latter mimicking the effects of exercise training on whole body metabolism. Thus, we show here that 2-HB production by skeletal muscle represents a novel mechanism for the modification of metabolism by exercise.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Physical exertion is a metabolic challenge that requires physiological responses throughout the body, including a dramatic change to metabolic flux patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. During exercise, metabolic end products accumulate and are released into the circulation; prototypical examples of such molecules include hypoxanthine and lactate. Metabolic intermediates of pathways with increased flux during exercise may also exhibit increased levels in the circulation post-exercise, particularly as an indication of pathway saturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Accumulation of individual exercise-induced metabolites may lead to a diverse range of cellular responses in different tissues, with acute and lasting effects on physiology. Such mechanisms have been defined for succinate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, lactate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, hypoxanthine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, and other exerkines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, demonstrating that the exercise-induced metabolome includes factors with significant physiological effects.</p><p id="P3">Exercise-induced lactate and succinate exert effects on physiology despite a relatively rapid return to baseline levels during recovery post-exercise. Conversely, 2-hydroxybutyrate (2HB, also known as α-hydroxybutyrate) is an exercise-induced metabolite with plasma concentrations that continue to increase for at least 3 hours after exertion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Production of the majority of 2HB in circulation has been attributed to the liver, although 2HB accumulates in many other tissues post-exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. 2HB is also present in disease states, as untargeted metabolomics analyses have identified 2HB as a metabolic marker for infection severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and as an indicator of metabolic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Cellular responses to accumulated 2HB have not been characterized to date, although Sato, et al., report that exogenous administration of 2HB caused an acute shift in mouse whole body metabolism, including a reduction in the respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and increased blood glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>; indicating that 2HB has the potential to alter metabolism.</p><p id="P4">2HB is the product of a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-mediated reduction of 2-ketobutyrate (2KB), which itself is a byproduct of endogenous cysteine synthesis via the transsulfuration pathway. Oxidation of 2KB is not well characterized beyond isolated enzyme assays; these show it to be a substrate for the branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. BCKDH converts 2KB to propionyl-CoA, which can be re-carboxylated by propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), producing the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate succinyl-CoA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Mammalian cells are not capable of reverse transsulfuration, i.e., production of methionine from cysteine; thus, the metabolic fate of 2KB is driven by the balance between mitochondrial oxidation or reduction to 2HB. Importantly, the metabolism of exogenous 2HB has not been described. Based upon the current literature, the fate of 2HB depends on the capacity for LDH-dependent oxidation of 2HB, and thus, 2KB metabolic homeostasis.</p><p id="P5">2HB is an alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acid similar to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). The latter is a dicarboxylic acid, and an established physiological competitor of α-ketoglutarate (αKG). Both the <italic>S</italic>- and <italic>R-</italic> enantiomers of 2HG are known to competitively inhibit αKG-dependent enzymatic reactions, including the branched chain amino-transferase (BCAT) enzymes, and the much broader family of αKG-dependent dioxygenases (αKGDD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. αKGDDs include regulators of the cellular responses to hypoxia, the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) and factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), and epigenetic regulators such as lysine demethylases (KDM), among others. Regulation of these targets by endogenous or exogenous <italic>S</italic>-2HG is sufficient to alter numerous cell fate decisions, e.g., the differentiation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. <italic>R</italic>-2HG inhibition of BCAT is reported to reduce metabolism of branched chain amino acids (BCAA), leading to reduced levels of glutamate and glutathione<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. As an alphahydroxy acid, we hypothesised that 2HB may be a novel competitive inhibitor of αKGDDs or BCATs.</p><p id="P6">In this work we investigate the physiological and molecular role of 2HB. We find that cells treated with 2HB demonstrate a metabolic response that leads to transcriptional regulation of BCAA degradation enzymes via a BCAT2 and SIRT4-dependent shift in compartmental protein ADP-ribosylation (ADPr). The reduced ADPr in the nuclear compartment following 2HB treatment promotes binding of the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) to the promoters of BCAA degradation genes. We find that repeated administration of 2HB to mice increases oxidative capacity in exercise tests that replicates the effect of exercise training. Finally, we find repeated 2HB treatment gives rise to an improved resistance to fatigue in oxidative skeletal muscle, consistent with the improvement to oxidative metabolism. Overall, we find that 2HB induces a range of cellular responses that are consistent with it being a feedback signal from exertion, one that leads to increased capacity in the BCAA degradation pathway and improved exercise performance.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Daily 2HB treatment accelerates the metabolic response to exercise in mice</title><p id="P7">As described above, physical exertion induces a persistent increase to circulating 2HB. To investigate the role of 2HB in whole animal metabolism, we first subjected mice to daily incremental exhaustive exercise tests for five consecutive days. Immediately following each test, mice were injected with 1 mmol/kg of Na2HB, or an equivalent dose of NaCl as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>). Mouse basal VO<sub>2</sub>, maximum ΔVO<sub>2</sub> (change in VO<sub>2</sub> relative to basal VO<sub>2</sub>), RER, and ΔVO<sub>2</sub> throughout exercise were similar across treatment groups on the first day, prior to group randomization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B-D</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig.1A</xref>). Median mouse ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max was 507 mL/kg/hr on the first day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>) and mice tended to reach exhaustion during the 21 m/min phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>). Beyond 18 m/min, mice either further increased their VO<sub>2</sub> or reached exhaustion. This is demonstrated by the lack of correlation between ΔVO<sub>2</sub> during 18 m/min and time-to-exhaustion, but a significant correlation between either ΔVO<sub>2</sub> during 21 m/min or maximum ΔVO<sub>2</sub> and time-to-exhaustion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig.1B</xref>). These data demonstrate that increased oxidative capacity predicts improved performance in incremental exercise tests.</p><p id="P8">Mouse ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max tended to increase with subsequent exercise tests and had significantly improved to a median of 877 mL/kg/hr in the control group by day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>). Accordingly, progressively more mice reached the 24 m/min phase before exhaustion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>). Mice treated with 2HB showed improvement to ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max in subsequent exercise tests as early as day 3, and increased ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max up to 930 mL/kg/hr on day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>). These data demonstrate a benefit to exercise performance from a brief one-week protocol of exercise training in mice and suggest that combination with exogenous 2HB may accelerate this effect.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Daily 2HB treatment recapitulates the benefits of exercise training on oxidative capacity</title><p id="P9">We next investigated the effects of exogenous 2HB alone. Firstly, we assessed the effects of acute administration of 1 mmol/kg of Na2HB. For mice at rest, we observed no effect of exogenous 2HB on oxygen consumption or RER compared with NaCl control over the first 60 minutes, consistent with previous reports for this dose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig.1C,D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. We next administered 2HB 2 hours prior to an exhaustive exercise test. Both 2HB-treated and control mice reached a ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max of approximately 500 mL/kg/hr, with no difference in RER, time-to-exhaustion, resting VO<sub>2</sub>, or ΔVO<sub>2</sub> during the exercise tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig.1E,F</xref>). These data indicate that exogenous 2HB at a dose of 1 mmol/kg does not acutely alter resting metabolism or oxygen consumption during exercise.</p><p id="P10">Next, we investigated whether treatment with 2HB would alter exercise performance on subsequent days. First, a cohort of mice was treated with 2HB 24 hours prior to an exhaustive exercise test. In these mice there was again no difference between groups in terms of resting VO<sub>2</sub>, ΔVO<sub>2</sub> or RER during the exercise test, time-to-exhaustion, or ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig.1E,F</xref>). When mice were treated with 2HB each day for four days with the exhaustive exercise test on the fifth day, 2HB-treated mice exhibited an increased ΔVO<sub>2</sub> during the exercise test, with differences more apparent at greater treadmill speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1H</xref>). Oxygen consumption at higher treadmill speeds correlated with greater time-to-exhaustion, indicating effective oxidative capacity as opposed to metabolic inefficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig.1G</xref>). Mice treated with 2HB exhibited a greater ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max and greater time-to-exhaustion, but had similar basal VO<sub>2</sub> and RER levels throughout exercise, relative to exercising NaCl-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig.1E,F</xref>). Control mice exhibited a median ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max of 572 ml/kg/hr. However, 2HB-treated mice exhibited a median ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max of 828 mL/kg/hr, similar to exercise-trained mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C,H</xref>). These data indicate that repeated 2HB treatment replicates the improvement to mouse oxidative capacity and exercise performance produced from daily exercise training.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>2HB levels are correlated with metabolic indicators of BCAA degradation in murine datasets</title><p id="P11">To determine which metabolic pathways 2HB may affect, we were next interested in determining which metabolites are most correlated with 2HB post-exercise. We analyzed two published datasets reporting untargeted metabolomics in mice subjected to a treadmill-based exercise protocol, or sham control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Both studies observe a strong increase to 2HB in the circulation and in all assessed organs post-exercise (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig.2A</xref>). A correlation analysis demonstrates a reliable positive correlation between circulating 2HB and markers of BCAA metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2A</xref>). Overrepresentation analysis of BCAA-related metabolites positively correlated with 2HB post-exercise yielded p values of 3.8x10<sup>-5</sup> and 1.6x10<sup>-2</sup> for the two studies. These data suggest that accumulation of 2HB is correlated to the metabolic flux through the BCAA degradation pathway.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Human exercise studies demonstrate the persistence of serum 2HB post-exercise</title><p id="P12">We further investigated this pattern by assessing the plasma metabolomics of human subjects in a previously published dataset from our group. In this study, blood was sampled prior to exercise, immediately post-exercise, and then one-hour post-exercise. Few markers of BCAA degradation are available in the human dataset, so we focused on the amino acid, the keto acid, and the hydroxy acid versions of leucine, isoleucine, valine, and 2HB. Transamination of BCAA to the respective keto acid is the first step towards mitochondrial oxidation. In line with this, BCAA levels are reduced immediately post-exercise compared with pre-exercise levels, while keto acids and hydroxy acids are increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B</xref>). The accumulation of 2HB alongside increased BCAA degradation is consistent with a model wherein BCAAs compete with 2KB for early oxidation steps, e.g., the BCKDH and PCC-mediated reactions.</p><p id="P13">Indicating a return to homeostasis, one-hour after completion of exercise, BCAAs increase and keto acids decrease towards pre-exercise levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B</xref>). The hydroxy acids are intriguing, as these remain significantly greater than pre-exercise levels even one-hour after completion of exercise, suggesting slow clearance of all members of this metabolite group, including 2HB. Among the hydroxy acids, 2HB is the standout, with the greatest fold-increase at the one-hour time point and the greatest absolute abundance in both human and mouse datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Collectively, these data describe a positive correlation for the production of 2HB in proportion with production of branched chain keto acids (BCKA) during exercise. The slow clearance of 2HB and the branched chain hydroxy acids (BCHA) represent a possible indication of saturation in the capacity for the oxidation of 2KB and BCKAs.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Repeated 2HB treatment alters BCAA metabolite balance following exercise</title><p id="P14">We next investigated whether repeated treatment of 2HB for four days would alter BCAA metabolism during an exercise test on the fifth day. To limit mouse dropout from exhaustion, the exercise protocol increased speed only up to 18m/min. This speed was held for 30 minutes for all mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2C</xref>). There was no effect of 2HB treatment on basal VO<sub>2</sub>, or on RER throughout the exercise protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2D-F</xref>). 2HB-treated mice tended to spend more time running on the treadmill, indicated by an increased ΔVO<sub>2</sub> during the 18m/min segment of the exercise protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2D,G</xref>). These data demonstrate again that repeated 2HB treatment increases oxidative capacity during exercise.</p><p id="P15">We hypothesized that the change to exercise performance, in both the incremental exercise tests to exhaustion and moderate exercise tests, was in part due to a change in skeletal muscle metabolism during exercise. Untargeted metabolomics of mouse serum, red gastrocnemius, and white gastrocnemius collected immediately post-exercise shows modest clustering of mice based on treatment group in the serum, separating vehicle-treated sedentary controls from other treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2H</xref>). Conversely, we observe strong clustering in the red and white gastrocnemius, delineating each experimental group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2I,J</xref>). These data begin to suggest that skeletal muscle is a site of metabolic regulation by 2HB.</p><p id="P16">When we visualize the data trends in the BCAA metabolic pathway within each tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2K,L</xref>), a shift in the BCAA, BCKA, and BCHA appears to be exercise and 2HB dependent; specifically 2HB treatment appears to reduce BCAA levels in red gastrocnemius at rest and during exercise, but increase BCKA and decrease the hydroxy acids during exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2L</xref>). The levels of intermediates within the BCAA degradation pathway increase in each compartment with exercise, with no strong effect of 2HB. These data suggest a shift in red gastrocnemius BCAA homeostasis induced by 2HB treatment.</p><p id="P17">To compare the effects of 2HB given the quantifiable difference in exercise performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2D-G</xref>), we adjusted metabolite values based on VO<sub>2</sub> measures during the exercise protocol or sham control. This adjustment yields values that indicate whether the levels of a given metabolite were high or low relative to the matching VO<sub>2</sub> measures for each mouse. We observed a number of differences and trends in the red gastrocnemius muscle: reduced levels of BCAA at rest and post-exercise, increased BCKA post-exercise, reduced BCHA post-exercise, and reduced 2HB post-exercise (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig.2B</xref>). In white gastrocnemius we only observe a reduction to BCAA and the BCHA post-exercise (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig.2C</xref>). Each of these effects are weaker in the serum VO<sub>2</sub>-adjusted data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig.2D</xref>). These data demonstrate that 2HB treatment alters muscle BCAA metabolic balance in excess of the changes to mouse VO<sub>2</sub> during exercise.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>2KB is a fuel for oxidative metabolism</title><p id="P18">The metabolomics analysis led us to hypothesize that physiological 2HB accumulation is associated with competition for the BCAA degradation pathway, limiting oxidation of 2KB. However, despite validation as a substrate for BCKDH in isolated enzyme assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, 2KB has not been validated as a potential fuel for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Thus, we next aimed to investigate the potential of 2HB and 2KB as fuel for oxidative metabolism <italic>in vitro</italic> and dependency of 2KB oxidation on the BCAA degradation pathway. We subjected cells to Seahorse assays monitoring the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) during a standard ‘mitochondrial stress test’ protocol following acute administration of 500-5000 μM of either Na2HB, Na2KB, or NaCl control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A,B</xref>). With C2C12 myoblasts, we found a modest increase to OCR immediately following 2KB addition, with no response to 2HB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A,B</xref>). Presence of 2HB or 2KB provided a small increase to the maximum OCR. We hypothesized that the standard assay media saturated cells with fuel, leaving little capacity for 2HB or 2KB as a fuel. We therefore repeated the assays with no pyruvate in the medium. Similarly, an acute uptick in OCR was observed upon addition of 2KB, but not 2HB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A,B</xref>). There was now a dose-dependent increase to maximal OCR in cells treated with 2KB, up to a similar magnitude when pyruvate was included. Addition of 2HB was not able to recapitulate the maximum OCR observed when pyruvate was present in the media. These trends could be replicated with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), although with a lower magnitude (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig.3A</xref>). These data demonstrate that 2KB is a substantially greater fuel for oxidative metabolism than 2HB.</p><p id="P19">It is possible that the increase to maximal OCR induced by 2KB is due to 2KB promoting glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, instead of 2KB being used as a fuel. To investigate the importance of the BCAA degradation pathway for 2KB metabolism, we repeated these experiments in cells transfected with siRNA against <italic>BCKDHA, PCCA,</italic> and <italic>HPRT</italic> as an off-target control, or non-targeting siRNA control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig.3B</xref>). Transfection alone had insignificant effects on maximum OCR, as demonstrated by cells treated with NaCl. Addition of 500 μM 2KB increased maximum OCR as before, however, this was inhibited in cells transfected with siRNA against <italic>PCCA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3C</xref>). These data suggest that an intact BCAA degradation pathway is required for 2KB promotion of maximal OCR <italic>in vitro,</italic> indicating that 2KB can be used as a fuel for oxidative metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>2HB is slowly metabolized by LDH</title><p id="P20">The poor suitability of 2HB as a fuel relative to 2KB suggests slow conversion to 2KB. Interconversion between 2HB and 2KB is proposed to occur via LDH. Thus, we aimed to quantify the relative rate of 2HB oxidation and 2KB reduction. We conducted activity assays using LDH isolated from bovine skeletal muscle or bovine heart. The former is enriched for LDH isoenzymes with M subunits from <italic>LDHA</italic> expression, while the latter is enriched for LDH isoenzymes with H subunits due to predominant <italic>LDHB</italic> expression. As previously reported, 2KB was an efficient substrate for both LDH enzymes, with a maximum relative reaction rate greater than pyruvate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, 2HB exhibited a maximum reaction rate that was only ~30% that of lactate using bovine heart LDH, and ~15% of lactate using bovine skeletal muscle LDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3D</xref>). These data support a mechanism for the efficient production of 2HB from 2KB, leading to long-lasting 2HB accumulation post-exercise.</p><p id="P21">Further, we found very low reaction rates for reduction of the BCKA, with a rate between ~2-10% the reaction rate of pyruvate. The greatest reaction rate observed was for the keto acid of valine, 2-oxo-3-methylbutyrate, using bovine heart LDH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig.3C</xref>). No signal was detected above background for the oxidation reaction of any BCHA. These data would be consistent with the relatively low abundance of BCHA, and their slow rate of clearance.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>2HB metabolic feedback occurs via BCAT inhibition</title><p id="P22">The slow metabolic processing of 2HB makes it likely to accumulate in cells and trigger a functional response. Based on the effects of 2HB treatment on BCAA, BCKA, and BCHA levels post-exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2</xref>), we hypothesized that 2HB provides metabolic feedback to the BCAA degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3E</xref>). As an initial test, we found that culturing C2C12 myoblasts with 500 μM of 2HB increased gene expression of multiple factors involved in BCAA degradation, including those involved in 2KB oxidation such as <italic>BCKDHA,</italic> and <italic>PCCA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3F</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Based on the structural similarities between 2HB and 2HG, we hypothesized that 2HB may act as a competitive inhibitor of BCAT enzymes. To test this possibility, we conducted activity assays of recombinant human BCAT2 (rhBCAT2) using leucine as a constant substrate and αKG as a varied concentration substrate. In these assays we find a dose dependent reduction to maximal rhBCAT2 activity with increasing concentrations of 2HB in the reaction well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4A</xref>). We conducted similar assays using rhGOT1, an aspartate-oxaloacetate aminotransferase, but found no effect of 2HB on the reaction rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig.4A</xref>). Given the modification of BCAT activity, it seemed plausible that 2HB may compete with αKG for active sites in αKGDDs. However, in assays of isolated HIFP4H1 and HIFP4H2, no more than 5% inhibition was observed for concentrations of 2HB up to 10 mM, and similarly little inhibition was observed for assays of isolated KDM6A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">STable.1</xref>).

That we observe reduced levels of muscular BCHA despite the increase to BCKA levels, without an increase in release of BCKA to the serum, suggests an increase to the oxidative muscle capacity for BCKA oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2</xref>).</p><p id="P39">Together, these data form a logical feedback loop where accumulation of 2HB provides negative feedback to reduce BCAA degradation at the stage of BCAT.

Briefly, one unit of isolated LDH enzyme or 5 μg of tissue lysate was added to a solution of substrate with 2 mM NAD+ for oxidation reactions or substrate with 0.5 mM NADH for reduction reactions, in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0. Activity of BCAT was assessed using recombinant human BCAT2 (rhBCAT2; R&amp;D Systems)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Briefly, the reaction catalyzed by BCAT2 transferring an amino group from leucine (Leu) to αKG, producing ketoisocaproate (KIC) and glutamate (Glu) respectively, is coupled to the NADH-consuming reaction catalyzed by leucine dehydrogenase from <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (LeuDH; Sigma), which converts KIC back to Leu. The reaction mixture consisted of 5 μM pyridoxal phosphate, 50 mM ammonium sulfate, 5 mM DTT, a range of αKG, 10 mM Leu, 0.5 mM NADH, and a range of Na2HB in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4. One unit of LeuDH along with 100 ng of rhBCAT2 was added to the reaction mixture to initiate the reaction. Upon addition of enzyme, reaction plates were immediately transferred to a plate reader (Synergy Biotek) set at 37°C and absorbance at 340nm quantified every 30 seconds for ten minutes. The initial maximum rate of reaction following any present lag phase was abstracted as the reaction rate.</p><p id="P57">Activity assays for human KDM6A and the prolyl hydroxylases, HIFP4H1 and HIFP4H2, were conducted as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Skeletal muscle <italic>ex vivo</italic> contractile function and fatigue</title><p id="P58">Skeletal muscle was prepared and assessed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Briefly, the soleus and EDL muscle were excised under dissection microscope from the right hindlimb with proximal and distal tendons kept intact. Excess adipose tissue was manually cleaned from the muscles and tendons were tied with a braided silk thread and mounted in a 15 mL stimulation chamber between a force transducer and an adjustable holder (World Precision Instruments). Muscles were submerged in a Tyrode solution containing (in mmol/L): 121 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 EDTA, 0.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5.5 glucose, and 24 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. The force stimulation chamber was set to 31°C and gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub> 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for a pH of 7.4. Each mounted muscle was adjusted to the length at which the highest twitch force was recorded and then allowed to rest for 15 minutes. The force frequency relationship was determined through stimulations at the following frequencies: 1 (twitch), 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 70, 100, and 120 Hz for soleus, and 1, 20, 30, 40, 50, 70, 100, 120, and 150 Hz for EDL. The stimuli were interspaced by one minute of rest. Upon completion, the muscle was allowed to rest for seven minutes before starting a fatigue protocol consisting of 100 stimulations (70 Hz, 600 msec train duration, 2 sec interval duration) for the soleus or 50 stimulation (100 Hz, 300 msec train duration, 2 sec interval duration) for the EDL. Muscle recovery was determined at 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes after the final tetanic stimulation at the same stimulation frequency. Absolute force was expressed in millinewton (mN). Specific force (kN/m<sup>2</sup>) was calculated by dividing the absolute force by the muscle cross sectional area, the latter determined by dividing the muscle mass (with tendons removed) by muscle length and density, assuming a density of 1.06 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P59">Data was visualized and statistical analyses conducted in Prism 9 (GraphPad).
