A few studies have recently used these tests to argue for the presence of emotion-like states in insects. However, the results from most of these studies could have other explanations, including changes in motivation and attention. To control for these explanations, we therefore developed a novel judgment bias test, requiring bumblebees to make an active choice indicating their interpretation of ambiguous stimuli. Bumblebees were trained to associate high or low rewards, delivered in two different reward chambers, with distinct colors. Two groups of bees were then physically stressed by shaking or trapping, while the third group served as a control. We subsequently presented the bees with ambiguous colors between the two learnt colors and noted which reward chamber they chose. When presented with ambiguous colors, stressed bees were less likely than control bees to enter the reward chamber previously associated with high reward. We modelled bee behavior using signal detection and drift diffusion models and showed that control bees and stressed bees were, respectively, more likely to respond optimistically and pessimistically to ambiguous cues. The signal detection model further showed that the behavior of stressed bees was explained by a reduction in their prior expectation of high rewards. Our findings thus provide strong evidence for emotion-like states in bees and suggest that their stress-induced pessimistic behavior is explained by a reduced expectation of higher rewards.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bumblebee</kwd><kwd>judgment bias</kwd><kwd>emotion</kwd><kwd>signal detection theory</kwd><kwd>drift diffusion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The presence of emotions in non-human animals is much debated and can have important societal implications. While most research on animal emotions has focused on vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), a handful of recent studies have explored analogous states in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). In these studies, emotions are defined as valenced brain states triggered by both internal and external stimuli and comprising subjective, behavioral, physiological and cognitive components. Research on emotion-like states in insects has primarily relied on judgement bias tests, a method initially developed for assessing affective states in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). These tests assess how animals respond to ambiguous stimuli. An animal typically is trained to associate one stimulus with a reward and another with a lack of reward or punishment. It is then tested with an ambiguous stimulus that is in-between the two learnt stimuli. Animals that respond as if this stimulus indicates a reward are considered optimistic, while those that respond as if the stimulus indicates a lack of reward or punishment are considered pessimistic.</p><p id="P3">Judgement bias tests have been used in five studies on insects, including on honeybees, bumblebees and fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Some of these studies showed that physical agitation can reduce the response of bees and flies to ambiguous odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Others showed that bees are quicker to fly towards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) and more likely to choose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) ambiguous visual stimuli after encountering an unexpected reward of sucrose solution, suggesting optimistic behavior. While these results parallel results from studies of emotions in vertebrates, other explanations have also been suggested, including changes in motivation or the ability to learn training cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P4">One factor that complicates the interpretation of these results is that the majority of insect studies so far have utilized a go/no-go type of judgment bias task. Here, the animal is trained to respond to a positive stimulus (“go”) and suppresses the response to a negative one (“no-go”). When faced with an ambiguous stimulus, responding (“go”) or suppressing (“no-go”) a response is thought to reflect optimistic and pessimistic judgements, respectively. While this approach has been successfully used in many studies across taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), there are concerns associated with this paradigm. Firstly, the suppression of a response could result from a general reduction in activity and motivation rather than a judgment bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). A reduction of responses could also indicate merely an absence of response (omission) rather than a deliberate choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Finally, an animal may fail to attend to or detect a stimulus, and in such cases, the lack of a response could be mistakenly attributed to a pessimistic judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Without a test that can address these issues, we currently do not have strong evidence of emotion-like states in insects. In addition, we lack models for the mechanisms underpinning the observed behaviors – though recent work has proposed that judgement biases in bees can arise from shifts in stimulus-response curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P5">One way of reducing the likelihood of confounds is to use an active choice judgment bias test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). In contrast to the go/no-go task, the active choice paradigm requires the animal to make an active choice between two alternative responses. Animals might, for example, learn to move to one location in response to one stimulus and to another location when they see another stimulus. Since the animal must make a choice as a response, this type of judgment bias test eliminates the possible confounding factors of the “go/no-go” paradigm, increasing validity and ease of interpretation.</p><p id="P6">We therefore used an active choice type of judgment bias test to rigorously assess judgement biases in bumblebees <italic>(Bombus terrestris)</italic>. Bees had to choose between two rewarding locations depending on the stimulus displayed, clearly signaling their judgement when faced with ambiguous stimuli by moving to one of the two locations. To induce negative affective states, we used two types of manipulations simulating predatory attacks - shaking and trapping by a robotic arm. These manipulations have previously been shown to be associated with cognitive and physiological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). In addition, to further understand the mechanisms underlying our behavioral results, we applied drift diffusion and signal detection modelling frameworks to the data. We used these frameworks to test whether physical agitation affected the prior expectation of a reward in bees or their ability to distinguish between stimuli due to shifts in stimulus-response curves.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animals and experimental set-up</title><p id="P7">All experiments were run on female worker bumblebees (<italic>Bombus terrestris</italic>) obtained from a commercial supplier (Koppert, UK). We transferred the bumblebees to one chamber of a bipartite plastic nest box (28.0 × 16.0 × 12.0 cm). We covered the other chamber of the nest box with cat litter to allow bees to discard refuse. The nest box was connected via a transparent acrylic tunnel (56.0 × 5.0 × 5.0 cm) to a flight arena (110.0 × 61.0 × 40.0 cm) with a UV-transparent Plexiglas® lid and lit by a lamp (HF-P 1 14-35 TL5 ballast, Philips, The Netherlands) fitted with daylight fluorescent tubes (Osram, Germany). When not part of an experiment, bees were fed with ~ 3 g of commercial pollen daily (Koppert B. V., The Netherlands) and provided sucrose solution (20% w/w) ad libitum. Although invertebrates do not fall under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 (ASPA), the experimental design and protocols were developed incorporating the 3Rs principles. Housing, maintenance, and experimental procedures were non-invasive and were kept as close as possible to the natural living conditions of the animals.</p><p id="P8">Visual stimuli were solid colors covering the entire display of an LED monitor (Dell U2412M, 24”, 1920 x 1200 px) and controlled by a custom-written MATLAB script (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) using the PsychToolbox package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). We measured the spectral reflectance of all colors used in the experiment using an Ocean Optics Flame reflectance spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics Inc., Florida, USA). The perceptual positions of the colors in the bee color hexagon space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) were calculated using the spectral reflectance measurements and spectral sensitivity functions for <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic> photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We positioned two vertical panels (40.0 × 8.0 cm) 8.5 cm in front of the right and left sides of the LED monitor, leaving the central area of the monitor open and visible. Each panel was equipped with an opening to place a reward chamber (7 ml glass vial, 10 mm inner diameter) 7 cm above the arena floor. Bees thus needed to fly from the arena entrance to the panels before entering the reward chamber. On each visit to the arena, the reward chambers were changed to ensure that pheromones and scent marks were not available during the next visit. In preparation for the next experimental day, all used chambers were washed in hot water and 70% ethanol and left to dry.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Training procedure</title><p id="P10">Before the onset of training, bees were familiarized with both reward locations. A plastic cup was used to gently capture each bee. The opening of the cup was positioned so that it aligned with the entrance to the reward chamber, inside which the bee found a droplet of sucrose solution (0.2 ml, 30% w/w). We repeated the procedure equally on each side (left and right) without displaying any color on the LED screen. Individual bees that learnt the location of the reward and performed repeated foraging bouts were tagged for later identification using number tags (Thorne, UK). Tagging involved trapping each bee in a small marking cage, gently pressing it against the mesh with a sponge, and affixing the tag to the dorsal thorax with a small amount of superglue (Loctite Super Glue Power Gel).</p><p id="P11">In each training trial, we presented bees (n = 48) with one of two colors on the LED screen. The two colors used were green (RGB= 0, 255, 75) and blue (RGB= 0, 75, 225). When one of the colors was displayed, the bee was provided a high-value reward of 0.2 ml 50% (w/w) sucrose solution in one of the two chambers (e.g., on the left), and an equal amount of distilled water in the other chamber (e.g., on the right). In different trials, when the other color was displayed the bee was provided a low-value reward of 0.2 ml 30% (w/w) sucrose solution in the chamber opposite (e.g., on the right) to the one where, in the other trials, a high-reward was presented. Here again, an equal amount of distilled water would be present in the other chamber (e.g., on the left). Thus, on any given trial, the bee saw only one color and could encounter either the high or low reward (not both), with water on the unrewarding side. In addition, the locations of the high and low rewards were on opposite sides in their respective trials.</p><p id="P12">Across bees, the combinations of each color (green or blue), reward location (right or left) and reward type (high or low) were counterbalanced. Each bee encountered only one possible combination of each during training (e.g., green indicating a high reward on the left on half the trials, and blue indicating a low reward on the right on the other half). Trials presenting colors associated with high and low rewards were presented an equal number of times in a pseudorandom order, ensuring that no color was repeated more than twice in a row. To ensure that the bee entered the reward chamber fully to sample its content, we placed the droplets of solutions at the very end of the reward chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In all cases, the reward quantity of 0.2 ml allowed bees to fill their crop within a single reward chamber visit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). We recorded a single choice on each trial, with a choice defined as a bee entering a chamber far enough to sample its content. Incidences of landing or partial entering (less than 1/3 of the body length) were not considered choices. Bees that reached the learning criterion (80% accuracy in the last 20 trials) continued to the test phase. 11 bees did not pass the initial conditioning test due to strong side biases. The last ten training trials were video recorded using a camera on a mobile phone (Huawei Nexus 6P phone 1440 × 2560 px, 120 fps) placed above the arena.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Predatory attack simulation</title><p id="P13">We randomly assigned individual bees (n=48) that reached the learning criterion in the training phase to one of the three treatment groups. Two groups were subjected to manipulations which simulated predatory attacks and were predicted to change their affective state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). One of these two treatments involved shaking the bee on a Vortex shaker (<italic>Shaking</italic>, n=16), while the other involved trapping the bee with a custom-made trapping device (<italic>Trapping</italic>, n=16). A third unmanipulated group served as a control (<italic>Control</italic>, n=16). The manipulations were applied to a bee before entering the arena for each test. Bees in the Control treatment were allowed to fly out into the flight arena without hindrance as in the training phase.</p><p id="P14">Each bee in the Shaking treatment was allowed to enter a custom-made cylindrical cage (40 mm diameter, 7.5 cm length). After entering, the bee was gently nudged down with a soft foam plunger until the distance between the plunger and the bottom of the cage was reduced to ~3 cm. Once the plunger was secured, the cage with the bee was placed on a Vortex-T Genie 2 shaker (Scientific Industries, USA) and shaken at a frequency of 1200 rpm for 60 s. After shaking, the bee was released into the tunnel connecting the nest box and experimental arena via an opening on the top of the tunnel. The bee was released into the flight arena for testing as soon as it was ready to initiate a foraging bout.</p><p id="P15">Each bee in the Trapping treatment was trapped using a trapping device. This consisted of a soft sponge (3.5 × 3.5 × 3.5 cm) connected to a linear actuator system (rack and pinion). A micro-servo initiated the linear motion of the trapping device (Micro Servo 9g, DF9GMS), powered, and controlled by a microcontroller board (Arduino, Uno Rev 3). A custom-written script written in the Arduino Software (IDE) triggered an initial plunging movement of the trapping device, followed by release after three seconds. This permitted consistent trapping across all tested individuals. As in the Shaking treatment, the bee was released into the flight arena for testing as soon as it was ready to initiate a foraging bout.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Judgement bias testing</title><p id="P16">The test phase consisted of five trials, each with a cue of a different color presented on the screen. The test colors were the two conditioned colors (green and blue), and three ambiguous colors of intermediate value between the two conditioned colors (near blue (RGB=0, 140, 150); medium (RGB= 0, 170, 120); near green (RGB= 0, 200, 100) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We classified the ambiguous colors as near-high, medium, and near-low cues depending on their distance to the high or low rewarding color for each bee. The color presentation order was pseudorandomized between all bees, so that the first test color was always one of the three ambiguous color cues. Within the test phase, all color cues (ambiguous and learnt) were not rewarded, i.e., both chambers contained 0.2 ml of distilled water. We classified the entry of a bee into a reward chamber as a choice. After it made the first choice, we gently captured the bee with a plastic cup and returned it to the tunnel connecting the nest and the arena. Between presentations of each of the five test cues, bees were provided refresher trials consisting of two presentations of each conditioned color with the appropriate reward at the correct location. All trials were video recorded for later video analysis using the camera of a mobile phone (Huawei Nexus 6P, 1440 × 2560 px, 120 fps). We obtained the latencies for the choices from the video analysis (see below).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Measuring foraging motivation using ingestion rate</title><p id="P17">To assess if our manipulations changed feeding motivation in bees, we measured sugar reward ingestion rates. A separate group of bees (n=36) were pre-trained to forage from an elevated feeder consisting of the reward chamber used above with a 1.5 mL Eppendorf placed inside. After learning this location and completing five consecutive foraging bouts, bees were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups as in the above experiment for the ingestion test (Control: n=12, Shaking: n=12, Trapping: n=12). The test consisted of a single foraging bout on a feeder with sucrose solution (~1 ml, 50% w/w). The feeder was weighed before and immediately after the test bout to determine the mass of ingested solution using a Kern Weighing Scale ADB100-4 (Resolution: mg±0.001, Kern &amp; Sohn, Balingen, Germany). The feeding bouts were recorded using a mobile phone camera (Huawei Nexus 6P, 1440 × 2560 px, 120 fps). The recordings were used to determine the time taken for ingestion. Ingestion time was defined as the time from when the bee first touched the sucrose solution with its proboscis until the bee stopped drinking. For each bee, we calculated the absolute ingestion rate i (mg/s): <disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>m</mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext>m</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mtext>t</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where i is the absolute ingestion rate of a bee, m1 is the mass of the feeder before the foraging bout, m2 is the mass of the feeder after the foraging bout, and t is the ingestion time of the bee. Upon the completion of the test, the bee was sacrificed by freezing and stored in 70% ethanol at -20°C. We measured the intertegular distance (ITD) and the length of the glossa of each bee with a digital calliper (RS PRO Digital Caliper, 0.01 mm ± 0.03 mm) under a dissecting microscope. We then adjusted the absolute ingestion rate i to account for individual size variability using the formula: <disp-formula id="FD2"><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>I</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>iW^</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mtext>G</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where i is the absolute ingestion rate of a bee, G is the length of the glossa and W is the intertegular distance. This is an adaptation of the formula developed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) with intertegular distance instead of weight, as it has been shown to be precise at estimating bumblebee weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To control for evaporation, we located an additional Eppendorf with 50% sugar solution on the opposite side of the test chamber and recorded its weight pre-and post-test for an individual bee. This loss of mass due to evaporation was subtracted from the mass of the test feed after the foraging bout.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Video analysis</title><p id="P19">Video analysis was done using BORIS© (Behavior Observation Research Interactive Software, version 7.10.2107 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). In the judgment bias experiment, we coded two behaviours for each bee. The first behaviour, “Choice”, indicated bee entry into a reward chamber and was classified as a point event, an event which happen at a single point in time. The second coded behaviour, “Latency to choose”, was the time of making the choice and was classified as a state event, i.e., an ongoing event with a duration. For the foraging motivation experiment, we coded a single behaviour, “Drinking duration”, which was classified as a state event that indicated ingestion time.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P20">Our hypothesis and statistical analyses of the main active choice experiment were preregistered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://aspredicted.com">aspredicted.com</ext-link> (#62198). The data were plotted and analyzed using RStudio v.3.2.2 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</ext-link>) and custom-written scripts. To determine the final sample size needed, we used a Bayes Factor approach implemented with the brms package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Prior beliefs about the parameters were specified using a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Data collection was stopped when the Bayes Factor ≥ 3 (indicating moderate support for HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>)). All subsequent statistical models for the data were fit by maximum likelihood estimation and, when necessary, optimized with the iterative algorithms BOBYQA. In each analysis, several models were run and compared using the model.sel function in the MuMIn package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) to select the most appropriate model based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) scores. We considered the model with the lowest AIC score the best model, i.e., the model that provides a satisfactory explanation of the variation in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). We used the package DHARMa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) for residual testing of all models.</p><p id="P21">For the judgment bias analysis, we used the probability of an optimistic choice as the dependent variable, coding choices of reward chambers previously associated with high-value and low -value cues as 1 and 0 respectively. We fit a generalized linear mixed-effect model (GLMM) using the <italic>glmer</italic> function of the <italic>lme4</italic> package with binomial errors and a logit link function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). The explanatory variables included in the model were “<italic>Treatment</italic>” (categorical: <italic>Control, Shaken, Trapped</italic>) and “<italic>Cue</italic>” (continuous: 1-5, where 1 = high and 5 = low value cue) which refers to the color displayed on the screen. The identity of the bee (“<italic>ID</italic>”) was included as a random intercept variable.</p><p id="P22">For the analysis of the choice latency in the judgment bias test, we fit a linear mixed-effect model (LMEM) using the <italic>lmer</italic> function of the <italic>lme4</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). To normalize the error distribution, latency data were natural log-transformed and latencies greater than 1.5 times the Inter Quartile Range were excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). The explanatory variables included in the model were “<italic>Treatment</italic>” (categorical: <italic>Control, Shaken, Trapped</italic>) and “<italic>Cue</italic>” (continuous: 1-5, where 1 = high and 5 = low value cue). In addition, since we expected that optimistic responses would be faster, we also included “<italic>Response Type</italic>” (coded as 1 for optimistic responses, and 0 for pessimistic responses) as an explanatory variable in the model selection process. Bee identity (“<italic>ID</italic>”) was included as a random intercept variable.</p><p id="P23">In addition to the above models, we ran other statistical tests for some analyses. Data for these tests were first tested for normality and the appropriate tests were subsequently employed for analysis. We ran a one-way ANOVA on the adjusted body size ingestion rate data to test for differences between treatment (Control, Shaking, Trapping). We also used Kruskal-Wallis tests to compare the average number of trials to the criterion in the training phase for different treatment groups, and to investigate the potential impact of the side and color associated with a high-value cue on learning.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Signal Detection Theory model</title><p id="P24">We examined whether the behavior of the bees could be modelled with standard signal detection theory, and what could then be inferred about the underlying mechanisms. We assumed that bees learn to make their foraging decisions during training based on the value of an internal signal that is affected by noise. When this signal exceeds an internal decision boundary, the bees behave appropriately for the low reward situation and when it is less than the boundary, they behave appropriately for the high reward situation. We modelled the distribution of the noisy signal and derived the probability of an optimistic response. We fit this model to our data and obtained the decision boundary and the noise for an optimal response given the reward values we used. We compared this decision boundary to the middle value of our response variable. If the boundary was shifted to the right or left of the middle, this would indicate optimistic or pessimistic behavior respectively.</p><p id="P25">We assumed that bees learn to make their foraging decision during training based on the value of an internal signal x which indicates whether they are in a high or low reward situation. We specified x as a “low reward signal” which has a high value when the cue indicates a low reward.

The estimate of 6.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) for the intercept in the control condition implies that the decision boundary in this condition is 3.38. Bees in the Control treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) are thus equally likely to make the optimistic or pessimistic response when the cue is a little closer to “near low” than medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The fact that the intercept drops by -1.49 for the Shaking treatment and -1.26 for Trapping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) implies that the boundary shifts leftward to 2.55 and 2.68, respectively, in these conditions.

In the Control treatment, the shift of the decision boundary reflects the greater weight given to the high reward. Quantitatively, the extent of the shift, together with the fitted noise level, implies that the high reward is given 3.6 times the weight of the low reward. This result also cannot be explained merely by the bees not perceiving the medium colour as midway between blue and green since both the high and low reward trials combine data from trials where the cue was blue and trials where it was green. Instead, this result might, for example, indicate that the bees understand that both rewards are equally likely (P<sub>Hi</sub> = 50%) and find the 50% sucrose solution 3.6 times as rewarding, relative to water, as the 30% solution.</p><p id="P43">The fact that the decision boundary is to the left of neutral in the Shaking and Trapping treatments indicates that here, greater weight is given to the low reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Assuming we can discount the possibility that the reward value has inverted (i.e., that stressed bees find 30% sucrose more rewarding than 50%), this must represent a shift in the priors, such that stressed bees now consider high-reward trials less likely. To match the extent of the leftward shift, given the noise level inferred from our GLMM fit, the low reward must be weighted 4.6 times as much as the high reward. If the reward ratio were 3.6, this would imply that the bees behave as if the perceived probability of the high reward was 6%. However, if stressed bees find 50% and 30% sucrose equally valuable, i.e., the stress has removed the difference in reward utility, then the observed shift in decision boundary could be produced with a less dramatic shift in the priors, with perceived probability of the high reward being 18%.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Drift diffusion model</title><p id="P44">Drift diffusion models generate estimates of the time taken to accumulate sensory evidence for a particular response and the evidentiary threshold at which the response decision is made. By applying this framework to our experiment, we attempted to see if we could identify which of these two criteria (or both) were changed due to our stress manipulations. Our best model (as indicated by the Akaike Information Criterion) was obtained by allowing the time prior to making a decision and the value of the drift rate for Cue = 3 (v3) to vary between treatments, while fitting all data with the same values for the diffusion constant s, start point zr, the dependence of drift rate on cue, vGradient, and noise on the drift rate, sv. The drift diffusion model predicts not only the bees’ choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) but also the latencies for both optimistic and pessimistic choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). There are not enough trials to accurately estimate the latency distributions (just 16 trials for each Cue/Treatment combination, thus &lt; 16 for each choice). The model for latencies is, therefore, not a good fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), and it would be unwise to draw too strong conclusions from this fitting effort. Nevertheless, the fitted model implies a few key points.</p><p id="P45">Firstly, by default, bees tend to be biased towards the more rewarding choice. The start point for the decision variable is not midway between the two boundaries, 0.5, but closer to the boundary for the optimistic choice, 0.56. As noted in the signal detection theory model, being biased towards the high-reward condition helps to maximise the expected reward. Secondly, stress did not affect sensory noise. As in the logistic regression model, we found that the best model was obtained by assuming that sensory noise, here represented by the diffusion constant s, was the same for all groups. Thirdly, stressed bees spend less time on non-decision activity: the model fitted more time on non-decision activity (e.g., flying across the arena) for the control bees than for the shaken or trapped bees. This could perhaps suggest that stressed bees might not want to spend time exploring what could potentially be a dangerous environment. Finally, this model also confirms that the stressed bees are more pessimistic. This is shown by the fitted drift rate for the medium cue, Cue = 3. In the absence of bias, the drift rate should have been zero in this case, since the cue was designed to be exactly midway between the high and low reward cues (and counterbalancing ensured that it was on average). Control bees nevertheless showed a small positive drift rate for this cue, indicating that they took it as weak evidence for a high reward. As noted above, this bias towards high reward helps maximise expected reward. However, shaken and trapped bees both showed a small negative drift rate, indicating perceived weak evidence for low reward. This is what accounts for the leftward shift in the response curves for stressed bees. Note that even though, according to the model, all bees start slightly biased towards a high-reward response (z = 0.55), in stressed bees, the negative drift rate for the medium cue is enough to bias responses towards the pessimistic response.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P46">We developed a novel task to assess emotion-like states in bees. Using an active choice judgment bias task, we demonstrated that physically stressed bees are more likely to make pessimistic choices when faced with ambiguous stimuli. A signal detection model of our data suggests that this behaviour is explained by a reduced expectation of rewards. We thus provide strong evidence for bee judgement biases and a possible explanation for bee behaviour in judgement bias tasks.</p><p id="P47">Most studies of judgement bias tests have used a go/no-go paradigm. The results of these studies can be challenging to interpret due to confounds from other factors that do not involve stimulus judgements such as, for example, motivation. Our active choice design avoids these complications. Motivation alone cannot therefore explain the observed shift in responses in the manipulated bees in our experiment. This is further supported by the results of our ingestion rate experiment, where we do not find differences in feeding motivation. Only one previous study has used an active choice design to study judgement biases in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). In that study, flies had to choose between two odours, one associated with a reward and another with punishment. Rather than using reward and punishment, we developed a novel paradigm for insects that uses two rewards of different quality. This allowed us to investigate the mechanisms underlying the judgement bias in further detail and test how negative states modulate expectations and perceptions of reward. Using previous paradigms involving reward and punishment as the expected outcome can make it easier to detect affect-dependent judgement bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). We, however, find a bias in bee behaviour when using two rewards and an active choice paradigm, providing stronger evidence for affect-dependent processing in insects.</p><sec id="S19"><title>Bees learnt the stimulus-outcome associations</title><p id="P48">When performing an active choice task, it is important to ensure that the rewards used to condition the animals’ responses are not perceived as equally favourable. If so, the results of tests using ambiguous stimuli would reflect the animal’s colour preferences rather than its interpretation of the outcome associated with a particular colour. Bumblebees, however, can use colour cues to discriminate between rewards of varying value and prefer higher concentrations of sugar solution, including the colours and concentrations we used in our experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). In our experiments, too, the bees chose high rewards significantly faster than lower rewards at the end of the training phase. In the tests, bees in all treatment groups also made slower choices as the cue value moved further away from the one indicating a high reward. The shorter choice latency towards the high reward cue suggests that bees maintain their preference for higher rewards even after experiencing stress. This demonstrates that the bees distinguished between the high and low rewards, regardless of the associated colour.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Physical stress was not detrimental to bee sensory perception</title><p id="P49">Manipulations in judgement bias tasks need to change decision-making without impairing sensory perception or discrimination. In one previous test of judgement biases, shaken honeybees showed a decreased response not only to ambiguous odour mixtures but also to the conditioned negative odour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). This decrease has been suggested to indicate an improved ability to differentiate odours rather than a negative bias in judgement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). In our experiment, however, the bees were perfectly accurate when responding to both conditioned cues (high and low) in the tests. The drift diffusion model further indicates that the stress treatments did not change the sensory noise. Our manipulations thus did not impair the colour discrimination abilities and memory of the bees. The preservation of high colour discrimination abilities is not surprising, as previous studies on Drosophila have successfully used shaking in aversive learning paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Similar trapping mechanisms to the ones we used have also been employed in aversive learning tasks in bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Active choices are better indicators of judgments than latencies</title><p id="P50">Latency is often used in go/no-go judgment bias tests to evaluate the emotional states of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). When evaluating an emotional state, it is important to determine whether it is positive or negative (known as valence). However, relying solely on latency as a measure of valence is not always reliable, as it can be affected by other factors unrelated to emotions. An increase in approach latency may be associated with a general increase in reactivity and arousal, for example, due to the increased energetic demands after experiencing stressful events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). It may also indicate a shift in the perceived value of the reward and differences in motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Relying solely on latency can therefore make it challenging to interpret the results of judgment bias tests. For instance, exposure to a positive event has been reported to cause both longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) and shorter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) response times to ambiguous stimuli.</p><p id="P51">Only one study has used latencies to measure emotion-like states in bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). This study used a go/no-go type of judgment bias test to demonstrate an optimistic bias in bumblebees after receiving an unexpected reward of sugar solution. As predicted, unexpected rewards reduced the latency with which bees approached ambiguous stimuli. However, the treatment also caused an increase in thoracic temperature which has been linked to increased motivation for foraging in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Further experiments did indicate that optimism was a more plausible explanation, but choice latency clearly could be influenced by motivational changes as well as judgements. Our results showed that after trapping, bees had shorter latencies than the control bees. This could, in principle, have indicated a positive state, again demonstrating the difficulty of using latencies alone to interpret judgement bias data. However, since our study was an active choice design, we could more reliably use the choices made by the bees rather than their latencies. Choices can better indicate affective valence, showing that the trapped bees were in a pessimistic state in our study. This makes a strong argument in favour of active choice judgement bias tasks such as the one we used in our study.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Pessimistic choices by bees are related to a significant change in prior expectations</title><p id="P52">To unravel the potential mechanisms underlying the choices made by the bees, we employed a signal detection approach, which has been previously suggested as a valuable tool for investigating affective biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). A recent study has suggested that judgement biases in bees may be caused by a shift in stimulus-response curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). However, this study did not investigate the underlying causal mechanisms of this shift. In our model, the estimation of future outcomes combines estimates of the probability of an outcome occurring and the magnitude of the payoff from an outcome. Both the signal detection and drift diffusion analyses demonstrate that control bees exhibit a higher probability of responding optimistically to ambiguous cues, indicating an expectation of high rewards.</p><p id="P53">Such a bias would not be suboptimal as it is in fact what is predicted by a rational, fully informed strategy which optimises expected reward. Even if the bees are estimating the priors correctly as 50-50, the difference in reward utility will still shift the decision boundary towards the cue indicating low reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Our model shows that the control bees are behaving as if 50% sucrose is 3.6 times more valuable, relative to water than 30% sucrose. Thus, the data admit the possibility that the bees’ behaviour is completely rational and unbiased, and the 50% sucrose is much more rewarding.</p><p id="P54">However, the decision boundary and drift rate for the stressed bees are harder to interpret. Here, the decision boundary is to the <italic>left</italic> of neutral and the drift rate is negative. Previous studies have shown that acute stress can increase an animal’s sensitivity to the reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). However, the observed left shift of the decision boundary in stressed bees cannot plausibly reflect such a change in reward sensitivity since a leftward shift could only be produced if the value of high and low rewards were swapped, i.e., if 50% sucrose became less rewarding than 30%. However, it could reflect a pessimistic bias in expectations, i.e., that the stressed bees behave as if high-reward priors are less likely (<italic>P</italic><sub>Hi</sub> &lt; <italic>P</italic><sub>Lo</sub>), perhaps because in nature high rewards are indeed scarcer when conditions are stressful. This can account for a leftward shift, but the large quantitative extent of the shift is still surprising. Since the noise remains relatively small, as indicated by the perfect performance for high and low cues, we have to postulate enormous changes in the priors to produce the observed shift. To obtain the decision boundary of 2.55 inferred for shaken bees, we would have to postulate that shaken bees estimate P<sub>Lo</sub> = 94%, i.e., they expect a high reward to be available on only one trial in 20. This assumes that the reward utility remains the same, with a high reward 3.6 times as valuable as a low. If the relative utility of the high reward increased, e.g., because of an increased need for sucrose after stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), the priors would have to shift even further from 50%. However, one possibility is that, contrary to the assumptions of our model, the noise was not uniform for all cues, and there was more sensory noise on intermediate values of the cue. If this were so, the change in priors would not need to be as dramatic, although the basic result of changed priors would remain true.</p><p id="P55">By employing an active choice judgment bias task, our results further support the possibility of emotion-like states in bees and suggest that these states could be found across very different animals. By implementing a more demanding active choice design, we provide robust evidence that neither motivational factors nor colour discrimination alone can account for the observed cognitive biases. Importantly, our modelling indicates that the pessimistic-like behaviour displayed by bees in a negative state represents a significant shift in their prior expectations of rewards. These insights offer the first analytical models of the underlying causal mechanisms of state-dependent judgment biases in insects, opening up new avenues for exploring state-dependent decision-making in insects.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS189361-supplement-Supplemental_Tables.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d30aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work is supported by a BBSRC David Phillips fellowship BB/S009760/1 to VN.

The three vertices correspond to maximum excitation of photoreceptors sensitive to blue, green and ultraviolet (UV) light. The distance from the center to any vertex is 1 and the distance between points represents hue discriminability, with 0.1 being easily distinguishable. <bold>C)</bold> Judgement bias testing. The test phase consisted of five trials with different colors presented on the screen in a pseudorandom order (cue value: H, high; NH, near high; M, medium; NL, near low; G, low). The colors included the two conditioned colors and three ambiguous colors of intermediate value. In our example here, the screen shows the medium color with blue as the high-reward color (H) and green as the low-reward color (L), but this was counterbalanced across bees.
