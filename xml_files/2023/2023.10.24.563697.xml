CTCF/cohesin-binding sites (CBSs) present at the loop anchors and TAD boundaries are frequently mutated in cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this remain unclear. Here, we investigate whether the binding of CTCF/cohesin on DNA imposes constraints on DNA replication, leading to replication stress and genomic instability. Our results reveal that CTCF and cohesin remain co-bound to DNA during replication (S phase) in cancer cells (HeLa). Further, examination of replication stress through ChIP-seq of the DNA damage response/repair proteins (MRE11, STN1, γH2AX, and RAD51) showed high enrichment of these proteins at CBSs (as compared to their immediate flanking regions and control sites) and positively correlated with the binding strength of CTCF/cohesin at CBSs in the S phase. Moreover, analysis of somatic mutations from cancer genomes supports that the enrichment of mutations at CBSs is significantly higher in samples harbouring somatic copy number deletion in MRE11 and STN1 compared to wild-type samples. Together, these results demonstrate that the co-binding of CTCF/cohesin on the DNA during the S phase causes replication stress and DNA strand breaks, and this could lead to genome instability at CBSs observed in cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CTCF/cohesin-binding sites (CBSs)</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>replication stress</kwd><kwd>DNA damage and repair</kwd><kwd>mutations</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Chromatin regulates the accessibility of DNA to various biological processes, including DNA replication, DNA damage and repair, and gene expression[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. In eukaryotes, chromatin is organised into distinct structural units called topologically associating domains (TADs)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. TADs are composed of genes and their cis-regulatory elements that show frequent physical interactions between them through chromatin looping. This looping is mediated by two main architectural proteins: CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) – a zinc finger protein that binds to its highly conserved motif sequences on the DNA; and cohesin – a ring-shaped protein complex that extrudes the chromatin loop until it encounters convergent CTCF bound motifs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Thus, CTCF binding and its motif orientation on the DNA determine the positioning of cohesin to create loop anchors and TAD boundaries[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Moreover, the binding of CTCF at TAD boundaries can act as an insulator, limiting the chromatin interactions between genes and their regulatory regions predominantly within the TAD, thereby controlling expression of genes within the TAD[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Previous studies have shown that the CTCF/cohesin-binding sites (CBSs; i.e., DNA regions bound by both CTCF and cohesin), enriched at the boundaries of chromatin-loops and TADs, exhibit an increased somatic mutation rate in multiple tumour types[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this observation is not well understood. Since the somatic mutations observed at CBSs are predominantly generated by the mutational processes active in the respective tumour type[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], we hypothesise that this enhanced activity of mutational processes at the CBSs could be influenced by the interplay between endogenous process (DNA replication) and binding of CTCF/cohesin to DNA. Recent studies have shown that the boundaries of chromatin-loops and TADs experience topological stress and undergo DNA double-strand breaks due to the activity of Topoisomerase II beta (TOP2B)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Moreover, increased cohesin loading on chromatin affects replication fork progression[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and causes replication stress in a CTCF-dependent manner in oncogenic c-MYC induced conditions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Similarly, in yeast, cohesin has been shown to induce topological stress-dependent DNA damage during replication[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. While these findings point to the topological stress imposed by the binding of CTCF and/or cohesin on the DNA, their association with replication stress and genomic instability locally at CBSs remains uncharacterized.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we found that CTCF and cohesin remain co-bound to the DNA during the replication (S) phase and are associated with replication stress in cancer cells (HeLa). Further, we show that the DNA damage response (DDR) proteins, MRE11, STN1 and FANCD2, associated with fork-stalling are enriched at CBSs during the S phase, with and without external replication stress. Moreover, we observed an enrichment of γH2AX, RAD51 and ATM at the CBSs, indicating that these sites undergo DNA double-strand breaks and repair. Finally, by using somatic mutation data from whole-genome sequencing of patient tumours (PCAWG[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] cohort), we demonstrate an elevated mutation rate at CBSs, particularly in tumours harbouring somatic copy number deletions in DDR genes (such as MRE11 and STN1) as compared to tumours without deletions in those genes. Taken together, our results reveal that the binding of CTCF/cohesin proteins to the DNA during the replication phase imposes constraints on the progression of the DNA replication fork, leading to fork-stalling and DNA strand breaks. The subsequent activation of error-prone replication or repair could lead to increased somatic mutations at CBSs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CTCF/cohesin co-bound to DNA during the replication phase</title><p id="P5">Although the dynamics of cohesin loading onto the chromatin has been studied during various stages of the cell cycle[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], the binding of CTCF to DNA and its association with cohesin during DNA replication or synthesis (S) phase is less understood. To determine whether the CTCF and cohesin proteins are bound to the DNA during S phase, we used cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) to measure the expression level of the above proteins and their genome-wide binding. Initially, HeLa cells were synchronised to get cells at different stages of cell cycle (G1/S, Early S, Mid S, Late S, Mitotic) by using thymidine arrest/release or nocodazole block method (see Methods). The extent of synchronisation under each stage was verified by assessing the cell cycle profiles using flow cytometry with Propidium Iodide (PI) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>, see Methods). In addition, S phase synchronisation of the cells was verified through immunostaining for the replication marker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], which exhibited a distinct staining pattern at various S phase stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1A</xref>). The PCNA staining showed a punctate signal in 86% of the Mid S phase synchronised cells, as compared to 21% in asynchronous cells (in which the majority of the cells are in the G1 phase; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1B</xref>). We also assessed cyclin expression levels in each synchronised cell population. As expected, Cyclin A showed high expression throughout the S phase, whereas Cyclin B was predominantly present in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1C</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Further, we performed chromatin fractionation followed by western blotting to check the endogenous level of chromatin-bound CTCF and RAD21 (a cohesin subunit) at different stages of cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). This showed that both CTCF and RAD21 were enriched in the chromatin-bound fraction (insoluble) at various time points of the replication phase (Early S, Mid S and Late S), similar to asynchronous cells, suggesting that CTCF and cohesin are consistently bound to chromatin across cell cycle phases, including S phase. Further, to check if binding dynamics of CTCF in S phase is different from asynchronous cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], we performed Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) on GFP-tagged CTCF (CTCF-eGFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>, see Methods). We observed that the fluorescence recovery rate of CTCF in the S phase (median half-time recovery t<sub>1/2</sub>= 3.45 seconds, IQR = 1.8 seconds) was similar to that in the asynchronous cell population (median t<sub>1/2</sub> = 3.46 seconds, IQR = 1.7 seconds) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1D</xref>), suggesting that CTCF dynamics does not change in S phase.</p><p id="P7">Next, to determine which genomic regions are bound by CTCF/cohesin during replication, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) for CTCF and RAD21 in the Mid S phase HeLa cells. We identified 87,734 and 43,567 DNA binding sites (peaks) for CTCF and RAD21, respectively, in the Mid S phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S1F-S1G</xref>, see Methods). Interestingly, the majority (80%) of RAD21 peaks overlapped with CTCF peaks in the S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1E and 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S1E, S1H and S1I</xref>). Moreover, around 83% of RAD21 and 62% of CTCF peaks in the S phase overlapped with RAD21 and CTCF peaks from the asynchronous (G1 enriched) cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S1J and S1K</xref>), suggesting that the genome-wide binding of CTCF and cohesin is broadly consistent across interphase. Of the additional CTCF peaks seen in the S phase, around 45% were proximal (&lt; 5 kb) to existing peaks from the asynchronous cells, whereas the remaining were distributed distally, likely due to the redistribution of CTCF binding during replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1L</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To obtain the specific DNA regions bound by both CTCF/cohesin (henceforth, CBSs) in the S phase, we focused on CTCF peaks which have a CTCF motif (see Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1M</xref>) and also have a RAD21 peak within 100 bp from the CTCF motif. This resulted in 26,948 CBSs (out of the total 34,996 CTCF and RAD21 overlapping peaks) in the S phase of HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>). Around 88% of these CBSs in the S phase overlapped with the CBSs in asynchronous cells of HeLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1G</xref>). Also, when we compared the CBSs from HeLa S phase with interphase CBSs of other cell lines (different tissue-of-origins, from ENCODE[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]), we observed 62% to 84% overlap, indicating that these sites are consistently bound by CTCF and cohesin across multiple tissue types. Taken together, our results suggest that the CTCF and cohesin remain co-bound to the DNA throughout the interphase, including the replication phase.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Enrichment of replication stress markers at CTCF/cohesin-binding sites in the replication phase</title><p id="P9">Next, we asked whether the binding of CTCF/cohesin on the DNA can affect the replication fork progression, leading to fork stalling and replication stress. To check this, we examined the enrichment of DNA replication stress-associated proteins (MRE11 and STN1) at the CBSs by using co-immunostaining and ChIP-seq approaches. MRE11 is a component of the MRN (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) complex which acts as an initial DNA damage sensor and regulates DNA repair activity in response to replication fork stalling and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. STN1 (a part of the human CST: CTC1-STN1-TEN1 complex) is known to protect the stalled replication fork from excessive MRE11-mediated degradation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p><p id="P10">At first, we performed co-immunostaining of CTCF with MRE11 and STN1 separately in asynchronous and Mid S HeLa cells to check for their colocalization by using super-resolution microscopy imaging (LSM980 with Airyscan 2, see Methods) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S2A-S2H</xref>). The colocalization was measured using two different approaches: Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient (PCC)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] which measures the linear relationship between the signal intensities of two proteins, and Mander’s Colocalization Coefficient (MCC; tM1 for channel 1 and tM2 for channel 2)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] which measures the co-occurrence of signals in one channel with another[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Both approaches revealed that the CTCF and MRE11 colocalization was significantly higher in the S phase as compared to asynchronous cells (Mann-Whitney U test, two-sided, P = 2.21×10<sup>-07</sup>, 1.05×10<sup>-22</sup>, 1.44×10<sup>-24</sup> for PCC, tM1 and tM2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S2B-S2D</xref>). Similarly, CTCF and STN1 colocalization was significantly higher in the S phase as compared to asynchronous cells (PCC: P=6.99×10<sup>-03</sup>, tM1: P=2.35×10<sup>-10</sup>, tM2: P=4.31×10<sup>-19</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S2F-S2H</xref>). Moreover, the colocalization of MRE11/STN1 with RAD21 was also higher in the S phase than in asynchronous cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S2I-S2P</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Further, to test the protein overlap seen by immunostaining to chromatin level (genome-wide enrichment of MRE11 at the CBSs), we performed ChIP-seq of MRE11 in Mid S HeLa cells. We examined the MRE11 coverage signal at a 10kb (+/-5kb) window centred on the CBSs in the S phase and control sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). To check if this signal is non-random, we used two different control sites for comparison: a) CTCF-unbound (that is, CTCF motif predictions without ChIP-seq signals) to match for GC content, and b) random sites, where genomic regions (without CTCF motif or ChIP-seq signals) were randomly sampled with size equal to the CBSs. Interestingly, MRE11 displayed a higher enrichment at positions near CBSs while CTCF-unbound and random regions showed a lower and evenly distributed binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2Q</xref>). For STN1, due to the unavailability of ChIP-grade antibody, we used the publicly available ChIP-seq data of STN1 with Myc-tag in the HeLa cells during the S phase upon replication damage with Hydroxyurea (HU)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Similar to MRE11, we observed high enrichment of STN1 at CBSs relative to flanking regions and control sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2R</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Given that the MRE11 and STN1 proteins are also involved in DNA repair, we performed the ChIP-seq analysis of another replication stress-associated protein called Fanconi anaemia D2 (FANCD2). FANCD2 is a key component of the Fanconi anaemia (FA) pathway which is crucial for interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair and also for replication stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Similar to MRE11 and STN1, FANCD2 occupancy was enriched at CBSs as compared to the control sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2S</xref>). To determine if this enrichment at CBSs is related to chromatin accessibility, we compared the ChIP-seq signals at CBSs with the DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs or open chromatin regions). This showed that MRE11, STN1 and FANCD2 ChIP-seq signals were higher at the centers of CBSs compared to the DHSs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S3A-S3C</xref>). However, this was not the case in the flanking regions. This suggests that the relative increase in MRE11 (STN1 and FANCD2) signals in the flanking regions of CBSs, as compared to control sites, can be attributed to chromatin accessibility around CBSs.</p><p id="P13">We then inquired whether the individual binding of CTCF or cohesin (RAD21), or their combined presence, could influence the replication stress. For this, we checked the MRE11, STN1, and FANCD2 ChIP-seq signals at CTCF-alone and RAD21-alone sites compared to CBSs (where CTCF and RAD21 co-bound). This showed a higher signal for these proteins at CBSs compared to CTCF-alone sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2C-2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2T</xref>), indicating that the stress at the CBSs could be associated with CTCF and cohesin co-binding. We further extended this analysis by checking the occupancy at CBSs based on the binding strength of CTCF and RAD21 together (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S3D and S3E</xref>). For this, we ranked the CBSs based on the binding strength of both CTCF and RAD21 at CBS and considered the top and bottom tertiles as high-binding and low-binding CBSs, respectively (see Methods). For all these proteins (MRE11,STN1 and FANCD2), we observed a relatively higher enrichment at high-binding CBSs compared to low-binding CBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2E-2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2U</xref>), suggesting the binding strength of CTCF and cohesin (RAD21) is positively associated with the level of replication stress.</p><p id="P14">In addition, as compared to CBSs, RAD21-alone binding sites exhibited a higher signal for MRE11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>), STN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>) and FANCD2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2T</xref>). Majority of these RAD21-alone sites are located in distal intergenic regions (42%) and intronic regions (27%), and they are located far (&gt;10 Kb) from CTCF binding sites (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S3F-S3H</xref>). We then asked whether the DNA sequence composition at these sites are likely to affect replication fork progression, such as non-B DNA-forming sequence motifs or chromosomal fragile sites (CFS) (see Methods). This showed that indeed a substantial portion of RAD21-alone sites (88%) overlapped with non-B DNA-forming sequence motifs or CFS, in contrast to CBS (42%) or control sites (CTCF-unbond - 41% and random sites - 39%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3I</xref>). Further analysis based on the binding strength of RAD21 revealed that specific forms of non-B DNA-forming sequence motifs were enriched in high- and low-binding subsets of RAD21-alone sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3J</xref>). Together, this suggests that the increased ChIP-Seq signal of MRE11 and STN1 at the RAD21-alone sites could be explained by their underlying DNA sequence features that are susceptible to replication stalling and the cohesin complex could be recruited there to aid in DNA repair. Whereas at CBSs, the replication stalling could be influenced by the co-binding of CTCF and cohesin, along with the underlying DNA sequence features.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Enrichment of DNA double-strand breaks at CTCF/cohesin-binding sites in the replication phase</title><p id="P15">Persistent replication stress leads to replication fork collapse and DSBs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. To check whether the CBSs undergo DSBs, we measured the enrichment of γH2AX (phosphorylation of Histone variant H2AX)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], a known marker associated with DSBs, through ChIP-seq in the Mid S phase HeLa cells. We also measured the levels of H2AX in the Mid S phase (through ChIP-seq) as a baseline control. An overall enrichment of γH2AX (normalised to H2AX signal) at positions around CBSs was observed as compared to control sites (CTCF unbound and random sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A</xref>). A similar signal of γH2AX was observed at RAD21-alone sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>) suggesting DSBs at RAD21 binding sites. Further analysis demonstrated that the increased γH2AX enrichment observed at CBSs is mainly from the regions with high CTCF and RAD21 co-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3E</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Broken replication forks are repaired by Homologous recombination (HR) repair[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>].

We asked if the HR repair proteins are recruited at CBSs in the S phase. For this, we performed a ChIP-seq of RAD51 in the Mid S phase HeLa cells. Strikingly, our ChIP-seq profile of RAD51 in the S phase displayed a higher signal at CBSs relative to its flanking regions as well as control sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4F</xref>). In addition, the RAD21-alone sites also showed high enrichment of RAD51 (similar to MRE11 and γH2AX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>), suggesting a preferential repair at these sites. Further, the enrichment of RAD51 signals at CBSs positively correlates with CTCF/RAD21 binding strength at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3F</xref>).</p><p id="P17">As DSB marker and repair proteins are highly enriched at CBSs, we tested the occupancy of the central DSB sensor kinase, ATM at CBSs in the Mid S phase of HeLa cells.

Moreover, the enrichment of ChIP-Seq signals of above proteins (γH2AX, RAD51 and ATM) at CBSs was relative higher than the DHS (open-chromatin regions), suggesting the enrichment is not biased by the chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S4J-S4L</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Together, our results support that the co-binding of CTCF/cohesin imposes replication stress, and CBSs are vulnerable to DNA damage.

For this, we performed ChIP-seq of DDR proteins in drug-induced replication stress conditions in HeLa cells through HU (which causes fork stalling) and Etoposide (ETO, which inhibits the re-ligation activity of topoisomerase II) treatments, separately. Overall, the enrichment of DDR proteins upon HU treatment was similar to the above results which were without exogenous stress in the Mid S phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S5</xref>). γH2AX signal at CBSs and other regions followed the same pattern after the induction of replication stress by 2 mM HU (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S5A and S5B</xref>). γH2AX enrichment was more prominent in prolonged HU treatment (16 hours) compared to that in the Mid S phase for 3 hours. MRE11, FANCD2 and ATM also displayed a higher signal at CBSs compared to control sites in HU-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S5D, S5E, S5I and S5J</xref>). However, we observed a decrease in RAD51 binding at CBSs on HU treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5G</xref>) likely due to the persistent DNA damage and slower or impaired repair.

For this, we first asked whether the CBS sites that are persistent (or common) between HeLa and normal cell lines show similar DNA damage response. To test this, we considered the following normal cell lines: RPE-1 (retinal pigment epithelial cells), IMR90 (normal lung fibroblast cell line) and H1 (human embryonic stem cells), for which the CTCF and cohesin (RAD21/SMC1) data was previously available to define CBSs (see Methods). Of the 26,948 CBSs in HeLa Mid S, 12,517 (46%) overlapped with CBSs of all three normal cell lines (referred as normal-shared CBSs). We plotted the DNA damage response signals from HeLa Mid S at these normal-shared CBSs as well as the CBSs specific to HeLa or normal cell lines. This showed that the normal-shared CBSs have high DNA damage response and DNA repair (MRE11, STN1, gH2AX, and RAD51) signal at the CBSs center as compared to immediate flanking region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4A-4D</xref>). However, this signal is relatively lower than HeLa-specific CBSs, but higher than the normal-specific CBSs, likely due to the cell-type specificity.</p><p id="P21">To further confirm this observation, we performed ChIP for MRE11, FANCD2, gH2AX and RAD51 in Mid S synchronised hTERT RPE-1 cells followed by qPCR at a few selected CBSs and CTCF-unbound sites (as a control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4E-4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S6A-S6B</xref>, see Methods). Interestingly, we observed relatively higher enrichment of these proteins at CBSs compared to CTCF-unbound sites, suggesting that CBSs undergo replication stress/stalling even in normal cells. To check whether the removal of cohesin at these sites can reduce the replication stress or DNA damage, we performed RAD21 knockdown using siRNA(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6C</xref>) followed by ChIP-qPCR for gH2AX and RAD51 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S6D and S6E</xref>). Although the DNA damage was lower at these CBSs sites, the signal was not stronger as compared to the control sites, and this is likely due to the global changes in the chromatin structure or additional DNA damages induced upon the RAD21 knockdown[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Further studies are required to explore this in detail. Taken together, this result suggests that many of the CBSs are persistent across cell-types, and thus the replication stress and DNA response observed at the CBSs are also seen persistent in cancer and normal cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Increased somatic mutations at CTCF/cohesin-binding sites in tumours with loss of MRE11/STN1 genes</title><p id="P22">The association of DNA damage response proteins (MRE11 and STN1) with CTCF/cohesin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>) in the S phase indicates that these proteins might be protecting CBSs from replication stalling and genomic instability. We wondered whether the rate of somatic mutations at CBSs would increase upon perturbations in MRE11 and STN1 (gene names MRE11A and OBFC1, respectively). Therefore, we explored somatic mutations at CBSs in patient tumours harbouring somatic copy number deletion in MRE11 and/or STN1 from the PCAWG[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] cohort. We computed the somatic substitutions at +/-1kb region centred around CBSs, CTCF unbound sites, CTCF-alone sites and RAD21-alone sites in tumour types with at least four samples in the following conditions: a) both MRE11 and STN1 wild-type (no alterations), b) either MRE11 or STN1 deletion, and c) both MRE11 and STN1 deletions. To account for the influence of DNA sequence composition on the mutation rate, we computed the expected mutation frequency based on the probabilities of each tri-nucleotide to be mutated (specific to each sample group) and calculated mutation fold change (fc: ratio of observed mutations by expected mutations at the centre +/-20bp) (see Methods). This showed that the enrichment of somatic mutation at CBSs in wild-type samples appeared to be high compared to flanking regions and control sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>), as shown previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Strikingly, we noticed that the tumours with deletions in MRE11-STN1 displayed a greater incidence of mutations at CBSs than wild-type samples in certain tumours (stomach, esophageal, liver, and breast cancers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5B and 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P23">For instance, in esophageal adenocarcinoma, samples with deletions in both MRE11 and STN1 genes exhibited a dramatic increase (fc=16.7, P=0) in somatic substitution rate compared to MRE11-STN1 wild-type samples (fc=6.3, P=0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5A and 5B</xref>). Interestingly, neither the MRE11-STN1 wild-type or deletion samples showed any increase in mutations at CTCF-unbound sites (both wild-type: fc=0.93, P=0.25; both deletion: fc=1.01, P=0.895) or RAD21-alone sites (both wild-type: fc=1.42, P=0; both deletion: fc=1.52, P=0.068). CTCF-alone sites and other transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) displayed a slight increase in mutation rate in MRE11 and STN1 deletion tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S7A and S7B</xref>), suggesting that the mutations are accumulated specifically at CBSs upon MRE11 and STN1 gene deletion. Moreover, the increase in mutation rate at CBSs was relatively higher in samples with both MRE11 and STN1 deletion as compared to samples with either MRE11 or STN1 deletion and sample with both wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref>), especially in liver, breast, esophageal and stomach cancers (Fisher exact test, P &lt;= 0.01). For example, stomach adenocarcinoma samples with either MRE11 or STN1 deletion (fc=3.41, P=0) exhibited a 1.8-times increase in mutations, while samples having both MRE11 and STN1 loss (fc=9.37, P=0) showed a 5-times increase in mutations at CBSs compared to MRE11 and STN1 wild-type samples (fc=1.86, P=0) of the same tumour type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref>). In contrast, mutations at control sites in MRE11-STN1 deletions were similar to that of wild-type samples in most tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S7C</xref>).</p><p id="P24">As enrichment of DDR proteins at CBSs was associated with CTCF/RAD21 binding strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), we wondered whether the mutation rate at CBSs also follows the same trend. As expected, the high CBSs displayed an increased mutation rate compared to low CBSs across tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S7D</xref>). Analysing mutations at low and high CBSs in MRE11-STN1 wild-type and deletion samples revealed a drastic increase in mutation rate at high CBSs in MRE11-STN1 deletion samples in many tumours suggesting the functional significance of DNA damage response proteins enrichment at CBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>). Together, this suggests that the sequence compositions or binding of CTCF or RAD21-alone do not determine the elevated mutation rate at CBSs. Instead, the co-binding of CTCF and RAD21 contributes to a high mutation rate at CBSs and the mutation rate is strongly associated with their binding strength.</p><p id="P25">Mutation in the TP53 gene was previously associated with an increased somatic mutation rate at CBSs in colorectal cancers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. We wondered whether the increased mutation rate in esophageal cancer is influenced by TP53 mutation status. Towards this, we checked the mutations in samples having TP53 deletion ensuring that those samples do not have any alterations in MRE11 or STN1 genes (i.e. MRE11 and STN1 wild-type). Interestingly, the eso-adenocarcinoma samples with TP53 deletion did not show any increase in mutations at CBSs, suggesting that irrespective of the TP53 gene status, MRE11 and STN1 deletion leads to accumulation of mutations at CBSs in esophageal cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S7E and S7F</xref>). However, we noticed biliary adenocarcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma displaying high mutations at CBSs in samples with TP53 deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S7G</xref>). We further explored these samples to see whether they harbour heterozygous (shallow deletion) or homozygous (deep deletion) in TP53 deletion. Interestingly, samples with homozygous TP53 deletion exhibited a higher mutation rate at CBSs compared to heterozygous condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S7H-S7J</xref>). Together, this suggests that the perturbation in DNA damage sensing/response genes could lead to increased somatic mutation rate at CBSs, because these sites experience high levels of DNA damage/DSBs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">CTCF and cohesin are involved in diverse functions like genome folding, transcriptional regulation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], DNA replication[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], DNA damage response[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] and repair[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Despite these roles in the maintenance of genomic integrity, the local DNA regions bound by both CTCF and cohesin (CBS) are found to be a hotspot for genomic instability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] and somatic mutations in multiple cancers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. In particular, the CBSs at the TAD boundaries and late replicating regions showed high somatic mutations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. In some cases, mutations at TAD boundaries have been shown to disrupt TAD insulation, leading to the activation of proto-oncogenes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanism underlying high somatic mutation rates at the CBSs remains unclear. Here, we show that the CBSs experience a higher amount of replication stress compared to the immediate neighbouring sites. This is associated with increased DNA double-strand breaks and enrichment of somatic mutations in cancer genomes.</p><p id="P27">Though the binding of CTCF and cohesin to chromatin are extensively studied in the G1 phase and mitosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>], the presence of these proteins during the S phase and the hindrance posed by them to DNA replication are not yet fully understood. We find that the CTCF and cohesin proteins are present in chromatin-bound nuclear fraction throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). FRAP experiments revealed that the dynamics of CTCF present in the nucleus during S phase are similar to that of asynchronous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1C and 1D</xref>). This result is in line with the CTCF-FRAP experiment by Hansen et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>] in mESCs. However, the cell cycle synchronisation method in our study ensures the selection of cells undergoing DNA replication, as compared to the aforementioned study where the S and G2 cells cannot be distinguished (due to the FUCCI system). Further, to map the genome-wide binding of CTCF and RAD21 in the S phase, we generated ChIP-seq data in synchronised HeLa cells. This revealed that most of the CTCF and RAD21 binding sites in G1, including the persistent or constitutively bound CTCF/cohesin sites in all cell types[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>], are occupied in the S phase too, providing independent validation of CTCF/cohesin binding in the replication phase. This is consistent with the previous observations based on HiC analysis that the global chromatin architecture is largely unchanged across interphase[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>].</p><p id="P28">Next, we tracked the genome-wide binding of replication stress and DNA repair-associated proteins in the S phase to monitor endogenous stress at CBSs. Previous studies that performed ChIP-seq of DDR proteins were mainly in the exogenous stress conditions or enzyme-induced break scenarios. For instance, Chastain et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] uncovered that the STN1 is recruited to GC-rich fragile genomic regions upon replication stress (induced by exogenous HU treatment) to promote fork progression. Given that CTCF binding sites have a high GC content, we utilised their STN1 ChIP-seq dataset and observed that not only STN1 signal is high at CBSs but also correlated with the binding strength of CTCF/cohesin, suggesting that the CTCF/cohesin binding cause replication fork stalling. Complementing this, our MRE11 and FANCD2 ChIP-seq data also showed a high enrichment at CBSs in the replication phase with and without any exogenous damage, confirming replication stress/fork stalling at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). This high enrichment of MRE11 at CBSs could be partly explained by the physical interaction between CTCF and MRE11 at DNA damage sites as shown previously by Hwang et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Further, our γH2AX ChIP-seq data revealed persistent endogenous DSBs during replication at CTCF/cohesin binding sites. Although γH2AX signals enrich differently at various genomic sites depending on the kind of exogenous replication stress[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>], we find a consistent occupancy of γH2AX at CBSs upon external replication stress induced by HU and ETO. In addition, we observed that the enrichment of DNA damage response/repair protein is higher in RAD21-alone sites, followed by CBSs (both CTCF and cohesin binding) and CTCF-alone sites, suggesting that the binding of RAD21 is associated with replication fork stalling and DNA repair. This complements the previous finding that cohesin (RAD21) binding is associated with TOP2B-mediated DNA double-strand breaks at chromatin-loop anchors in asynchronous cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. Also, the recent study by Peripolli et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] showed that increase in cohesin-loading, through oncogenic MYC induction, cause DNA replication stress in a CTCF-dependent manner in both normal and cancer cell lines at the global scale. Our study further compliments these findings by probing replication stress and DNA damage response specifically at the CTCF/cohesin binding sites as these sites exhibit unique features, both structurally and architecturally.</p><p id="P29">Finally, we analysed the essentiality of replication stress-associated proteins at CBSs by assessing the somatic mutation rates at CBSs in patient tumours harbouring MRE11 and STN1 gene deletion or not (wild-type) from the PCAWG[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] cohort. We found that MRE11 and STN1 deletion is associated with increased mutation rates at CBSs in certain tumours (stomach, esophageal, liver and breast cancers), suggesting that this mechanism is specific to those cell types. Loss of DNA damage sensors like MRE11 and STN1 leads to inefficient replication stress response and repair that increases the likelihood of mutation rate across the genome. However, the control sites used in this study (CTCF unbound, CTCF-alone and RAD21-alone sites) did not show any drastic increase in mutations relative to CBSs in MRE11-STN1 deletion samples even after correcting for background mutations, highlighting the requirement of CTCF and cohesin together to cause genomic instability. This further supports the previous findings which showed that the enrichment of somatic mutations at CBSs is relatively higher as compared to CTCF- or RAD21-alone sites[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] and the recurrent mutation at CBSs is associated with chromosomal instability in the nearby regions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>].</p><p id="P30">During replication, DNA-binding proteins ahead of the fork are temporarily removed from the DNA to ensure the proper propagation of the replication fork[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. Recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>] have shown that the CTCF can be bound back to its motif sites post-replication to facilitate the nucleosomal position in the neighbouring regions. On the other hand, the binding of transcription factors to DNA damage has been shown to impair DNA repair activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>]. Based on these, we speculate that at CBSs (i.e., CTCFcohesin co-bound sites), the rapid re-binding of CTCF could impair the repair of errors (DNA mismatches) introduced during DNA replication, resulting in the accumulation of mutations at these sites, particularly in MRE11/STN1 deleted conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref>). At CTCF-alone sites, this was not the case due to less replication stress and DSB observed at these sites and this can reduce the chance of DNA mismatches at these sites. Though the RAD1-alone sites showed high replication stress, the higher repair activity observed at these sites (likely due to the involvement of cohesin in DNA repair activity as well) could probably reduced the source of DNA mismatches or the nature of cohesin binding (non-sequence-specific) not affected the DNA repair activity at these sites.</p><p id="P31">However, the limitations of the study include: a) the DNA replication fork stalling and DNA strand breaks were measured indirectly through the ChIP-seq of DNA damage sensing/repair proteins, but this can be further improved with proximity ligation assay involving replication complex protein and cohesin, or with replication dynamics assays specifically focused on CBSs; b) the overall ChIP-seq signal of above DNA damage sensing/repair proteins was weak, as compared to CTCF or RAD21. This is likely due to the non sequence-specificity and transient binding of the DNA repair proteins. However, despite this weak signal, we observed a strong enrichment at CBSs, as compared to control regions; c) given that the genome organisation and chromatin loops are correlated with the replicating timing[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>], the DNA strand breaks (and enrichment of histone marks associated with that) around CBSs could be partly associated with the replication initiation; d) whether the activity of error-prone replication (e.g., break-induced replication) or error-prone repair (e.g., translesion synthesis) that underlies the source of DNA mismatch at CBSs remains to be characterised; e) the somatic mutations analysed here were predominantly from primary tumours, thus extending our analysis to normal tissues could help to understand the baseline rate of these events, and to metastatic tumours (which undergone topoisomerase inhibitor or other chemotherapy treatment) to study the impact of treatment induced stress at CBSs.</p><p id="P32">In summary, our study demonstrates that binding of the CTCF/cohesin on DNA imposes constraints on the DNA that affect the progression of replication fork, leading to fork stalling and DSBs. This could be a potential source of mutations at CBSs, and the likelihood of this is higher in cells lacking DNA damage sensing/repair proteins (such as MRE11 and STN1). This finding has important implications in understanding how chromatin architecture influences the somatic mutational processes across the genome and also for the development of better background mutation models to predict non-coding cancer drivers.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p id="P33">HeLa cells (obtained from ATCC) were grown in High Glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco, ThermoFisher, #10569044), supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Gibco, Invitrogen #16000044) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, Invitrogen #15140163). hTERT RPE-1 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 (Gibco, Thermofisher #10565042) with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.

Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE (stacking 4% and resolving (8% top and 15% bottom)) and the protein-resolved gel was transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, #IPVH00010) in a 1X transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, pH 8.3 and 20% methanol) at 20 V for 1 hour. The membrane was blocked in 5% skimmed milk (Santa Cruz, sc-2324) prepared in 1x TBS-T at RT for 1 hour on the rocker.

Cells were washed thrice with ice-cold PBS, scraped and pelleted down at 2000 rpm at 4°C for 5 minutes. The cell pellet was either stored at -80°C or directly used in further steps. First, the cells were lysed with L1A buffer (10 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.9, 95 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8 and 1% NP-40) for 10 minutes on ice and centrifuge at 3500 rpm for 5 minutes. Nuclei were obtained by adding a nuclear lysis buffer (L2) (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% SDS and 10 mM EDTA pH 8) supplemented with 1x PIC, to the pellet for 10 minutes on ice. The chromatin was fragmented to an average size of 400-500 bp by 22 cycles of 30 seconds ON and 30 seconds OFF pulses using a Diagenode Bioruptor sonicator. Fragment size was visualised by running the chromatin on 1% Agarose gel. The DNA concentration was checked in NanoDrop. Chromatin lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12000 rpm at 4°C for 12 minutes. One hundred μg of chromatin lysate was diluted in the Dilution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA pH 8 and 0.5% Triton X-100) in a 1:1.5 ratio and 10% of chromatin lysate was taken as input. The antibody was added and incubated overnight at 4°C with a constant rotation. Antibodies used are: CTCF (D31H2: Cell Signaling Technology, 1μg), RAD21 (ab992: Abcam, 1μg), MRE11 (ab208020: Abcam, 2μg), γH2AX (ab81299: Abcam, 2μg), H2AX (ab11175: Abcam, 2μg), ATM (ab201022: Abcam, 2μg), FANCD2 (NB100-180: Novus Biologicals, 2μg) and RAD51 (ab176458: Abcam, 2μg).</p><p id="P43">The next day, Protein A/G Dynabeads (Invitrogen, #10001D and #10003D) which were blocked in 1% BSA (Invitrogen, #AM2616) for 1 hour, were added (15μl per tube) for 4 hours at 4°C at 12 rpm. This was followed by washes with wash buffer I (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM EDTA pH 8 and 1% Triton X-100), wash buffer II (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA pH 8 and 1% Triton X-100), wash buffer III (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 250 mM LiCl, 1% NP40, 1 mM EDTA pH 8 and 10% Sodium deoxycholate) and 1xTE buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8, 1 mM EDTA pH 8) in sequence for 5 minutes at 4°C. Flow through was discarded after each wash step. Then the protein-DNA complex was eluted in 200μl of Elution Buffer (100 mM NaHCO3, 1% SDS) at 37°C. Decrosslinking was performed by adding 14 μl of 5M NaCl (Sigma, #746398) to the eluate at 65°C overnight. The DNA was purified using the Phenol:Chloroform:IAA (Invitrogen, #AM9732) method followed by ethanol precipitation.

Library preparation was done using the NEBNextⓇUltra™ II DNA Library preparation kit (NEB, #E7103L). Libraries were sequenced on single-end 50 bp (1×50 bp) reads on the HiSeq 2500 Illumina platform. ChIP-seq data were analysed using the nf-core/ChIPseq[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>] pipelines. The command used was ‘nextflow run nf-core/ChIPseq −r 1.2.1 -profile docker --input design.csv --genome GRCh37 --single_end --narrow_peak’ for narrow peaks. Briefly, the pipeline trims the adapters (Trim Galore!), aligns the reads to reference genome (BWA), marks duplicates (picard), filters (SAMtools and BEDTools), performs alignment-level QC and library complexity estimation (picard, Preseq), creates normalised bigWig files (BEDTools, bedGraphToBigWig) and calls peaks (MACS2). For CTCF and RAD21 ChIP, MACS2 peak calling was run by specifying ‘narrowpeak’ while all other ChIP peaks were called by ‘broadpeak’. Overlapping ChIP-seq peaks between the biological replicates were computed with BEDTools[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>] intersect by keeping the fraction of overlap as 0.5.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>ChIP-qPCR</title><p id="P46">A qPCR reaction was prepared in triplicates using the SYBR™ Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, #4309155).

Samples with mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLE were excluded from the analysis. Single base substitution mutations were extracted and intersected with each of the regions (i.e., CBSs, CTCF unbound sites, CTCF-alone sites, RAD21-alone sites and TFBS) spanning 1000 bp upstream and downstream (+/-1kb) from the motif/peak centre, using BEDTools intersect to compute the rate of substitutions at respective sites. The samples were grouped into three categories according to the SCNA values of MRE11 (MRE11A) and STN1 (OBFC1) genes (samples with SCNA value of zero for both MRE11A and OBFC1 was considered as wild-type or no alterations; and samples with SCNA value less than 0 was considered as deletion). Samples with amplifications (SCNA &gt;0) in MRE11 or STN1 were not considered for the analysis. Also, tumour types with less than four samples in any of the groups were excluded. Similarly, samples with TP53 gene deletion were classified as above. Further, the samples with SCNA values -1 and -2 were categorised as likely heterozygous and homozygous deletion, respectively.</p><p id="P48">To assess whether the mutations observed at CBSs (or other TFBS) are due to the local DNA sequence contexts, we calculated the background mutations based on the probability of each trinucleotide to be mutated (as described in Frigola et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>]). Briefly, for each sample group (wild-type or STN1-MRE11 deletion samples), we computed the mutation probability by using the frequency of mutations observed in the specific tri-nucleotide context normalised by the abundance of that tri-nucleotide context in the genome. Fold change (fc) or the enrichment of mutations over background was computed as the ratio of observed mutations over expected mutations at +/-20bp from midpoint (core region). The significance value was calculated by using G-test goodness-of-fit (frequency of observed mutations in core and flanking regions were compared to the frequency of expected mutations in those regions).</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Predicting CBS in the S phase</title><p id="P49">To identify the CTCF/cohesin binding sites in the S phase (CBSs Mid S), we first performed motif analysis in 87,734 CTCF peaks (from HeLa Mid S phase) to check the presence of CTCF motif using MOODS (Motif Occurrence Detection Suite)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>] in Python with a p-value cut-off of 0.0001.

In case of a peak region with multiple CTCF motif matches, the one with maximum motif match score was retained. Further, we defined CTCF/cohesin-binding sites (CBSs, n=26,948) as those CTCF peaks with CTCF motif match and have a RAD21 peak within 100 bp from the CTCF motif centre (calculated using BEDTools closest function). We separated the CBS Mid S into 3 quantiles; low, medium and high based on CTCF and RAD21 ChIP-seq signals. Those CBSs with both CTCF and RAD21 low binding strength were defined as Low CBS and both CTCF and RAD21 high binding strength were considered as High CBS. CBSs from other cell lines were also obtained by following the same method as above on the ChIP-seq data obtained from ENCODE (see “External datasets” section below).</p><p id="P50">Control sites were defined as follows: CTCF unbound sites were obtained by taking the CTCF prediction sites from JASPAR[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>] and removing all overlapping CTCF ChIP-seq sites in the S phase.

Whereas cohesin-only bound sites are enriched with DNA sequence susceptible to genomic instability and replication stalling. This can lead to error-prone replication; however, faithful repair post-replication prevents the enrichment of somatic mutations at these sites. However, at CTCF/cohesin-binding sites (CBSs), CTCF and cohesin co-binding induced stress can lead to replication stalling and error-prone replication. Moreover, the immediate re-occupancy of CTCF post-replication at these sites could interfere with mismatch recognition and repair, leading to an elevated mutation rate at CBSs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS190271-f006"/></fig></floats-group></article>
