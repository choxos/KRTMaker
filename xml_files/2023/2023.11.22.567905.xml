Known cancer dependency on IRE1 entails its enzymatic activation of the transcription factor XBP1s and of RNA decay. We discovered that some cancer cells require IRE1 but not its enzymatic activity. IRE1 knockdown, but not enzymatic inhibition or XBP1 disruption, increased DNA damage and chromosome instability while engaging the TP53 pathway and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and attenuating cell cycle progression. IRE1 depletion downregulated factors involved in chromosome replication and segregation and in chromatin remodeling. Immunoelectron microscopy indicated that endogenous IRE1 can localize to the nuclear envelope. Thus, cancer cells can require IRE1 either enzymatically or nonenzymatically, with significant implications for IRE1’s biological role and therapeutic targeting.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Eukaryotic cells rely on a labyrinth-like membrane-surrounded organelle known as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to fold newly synthesized transmembrane and secreted proteins. Inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (ERN1, herein IRE1) plays a central role in maintaining ER proteostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The IRE1 protein displays structural evolutionary conservation from yeast to primates, comprising an ER-lumenal domain, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic kinase-endoribonuclease module<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Perturbations in ER-mediated protein folding drive IRE1 enzymatic activation by direct and indirect mechanisms that lead to its homo-oligomerization, kinase-mediated trans-autophosphorylation, and allosteric RNase engagement. In turn, IRE1’s RNase triggers generation of the transcription factor XBP1s, through endomotif-based mRNA intron excision followed by nonconventional splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Furthermore, IRE1 conducts RNase-based degradation of select mRNAs through endomotif-specific RNA cleavage—a process called regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. IRE1 also performs a more promiscuous RNA decay—dubbed RIDD lacking endomotif (RIDDLE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In addition to mediating phosphate transfer between neighboring protomers within homo-oligomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, IRE1 can trans-phosphorylate other protein substrates, such as the RNA-binding proteins Pumilio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and FMRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore, IRE1 physically interacts with specific cellular proteins, including BiP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, ERDJ4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, PDIA6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, Sec61/63 translocon complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, ribosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>; TRAF2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>; non-muscle myosin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>; and Filamin A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In higher eukaryotes, IRE1 cooperates with two other ER resident mediators, namely PERK and ATF6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, to orchestrate the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). The UPR helps maintain cellular proteostasis by acting to balance the ER’s protein-folding capacity with its biosynthetic load, as well as by inducing ER-associated degradation of misfolded or unfolded proteins.</p><p id="P3">Cancer cells can co-opt the UPR to mitigate ER stress caused by altered protein-folding requirements, mutations, aneuploidy, and harsh tumor microenvironments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.

Studies to date have attributed this dependency to IRE1’s enzymatic activation of XBP1s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>; and/or RIDD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.

This finding has important potential implications for IRE1’s biological role as well as its therapeutic targeting.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The growth of some cancer cell lines requires IRE1 but not its enzymatic activity</title><p id="P4">During an investigation of human AMO1 multiple myeloma (MM) cells we were surprised to find a clear growth dependency on IRE1 without a significant requirement for XBP1. We transduced AMO1 cells with plasmids directing Doxycycline (Dox)-inducible expression of short hairpin (sh) RNAs aimed to silence either IRE1α or XBP1 mRNA transcripts. Consistent with other models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, Dox-induced expression of IRE1 shRNA (shIRE1) led to a dose-dependent depletion of both IRE1 and XBP1s, while induction of XBP1 shRNA diminished XBP1s but not IRE1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). As also expected, IRE1 silencing upregulated the RIDD target CD59<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, whereas XBP1 knockdown decreased CD59 levels below baseline, consistent with a known enhancement of RIDD in the absence of XBP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Strikingly, Dox-induced IRE1 silencing strongly attenuated AMO1 cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and caused a marked regression of pre-established AMO1 tumor xenografts <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas XBP1 silencing had little effect in both settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A and 1B</xref>). This differential dependency on IRE1 <italic>vs</italic>. XBP1 suggested that AMO1 cells require IRE1 either for another enzymatic function such as RIDD—or nonenzymatically. To discern this, we blocked IRE1’s catalytic activity with an IRE1-specific small-molecule kinase inhibitor (KI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> or RNase inhibitor (RI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. In validation experiments, <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment of AMO1 cells with either inhibitor depleted the mRNA and protein levels of XBP1s while increasing mRNA abundance of the RIDD target DGAT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>—similar to Dox-induced IRE1 silencing, while non-targeted control shRNA (shNTC) had no effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B and S1C</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment of mice bearing AMO1 tumors with either IRE1 KI or RI decreased tumoral XBP1s levels and repleted DGAT2 mRNA—comparably to Dox-induced IRE1 depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D and S1E</xref>). Also as seen <italic>in vitro</italic>, XBP1 knockdown <italic>in vivo</italic> depleted XBP1s protein and mRNA and suppressed DGAT2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1F and S1G</xref>). Nevertheless, despite the effective blockade of IRE1’s enzymatic activity, neither IRE1 KI nor RI attenuated proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> or tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> of AMO1 cells—similar to the non-targeted shRNA control, and in sharp contrast to a robust growth disruption by IRE1 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C and 1D</xref>). Furthermore, the combination of either one of two different IRE1 KIs plus the IRE1 RI also did not affect AMO1 cell growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1H and S1I</xref>). Experiments with human KMS27 MM cells also revealed a dependency on IRE1 but not on XBP1 or on IRE1’s enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E − 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1J − S1M</xref>). Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with human JJN3 and L363 MM cells and with HCT116 colon carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1N − S1S</xref>) provided additional examples of differential requirement for IRE1 <italic>vs</italic>. XBP1 in MM and non-MM cancer cells. In contrast, knockdown of either IRE1 or XBP1 attenuated proliferation of OPM2 MM cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1T and S1U</xref>), which were previously shown to depend on IRE1’s enzymatic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, certain cancer cell lines can possess a nonenzymatic growth dependency on IRE1.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>IRE1 depletion induces cell cycle arrest independently of apoptosis</title><p id="P5">Growth deficiency due to IRE1 depletion could result from less cell proliferation or more cell death. To discern this, we stained AMO1 cells with propidium iodide (PI) to track DNA content and analyzed cell cycle progression and apoptosis by flow cytometry. Knockdown of IRE1, but not XBP1, increased the proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle while decreasing abundance in the S and G2/M phases by 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), suggesting a failure to progress from G1 to S (G1 arrest). Kinetic studies revealed that most of the G1 accumulation occurred already by 24 h after Dox addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Albeit with some delay, IRE1 knockdown also increased the incidence of cells with a subdiploid DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A and 2B</xref>), suggesting some apoptosis activation. Consistent with the proliferation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), neither XBP1 silencing nor enzymatic IRE1 inhibition disrupted cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B and 2C</xref>). Flow cytometry of CSFE-stained cells to track the number of completed cell divisions indicated that by 48 h a vast majority of control cells had completed two divisions, reaching generation 3 (green peak), while more IRE1-depleted cells had completed one division (orange peak) <italic>vs</italic>. two (green peak) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Confirming apoptosis induction, IRE1- but not XBP1-silenced cells showed significant cleavage of caspase-3 by 48 h, which could be blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor QVD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Importantly, QVD addition during IRE1 silencing did not prevent cell cycle disruption, nor did it restore proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A</xref>). Knockdown of IRE1, but not XBP1, induced G1 accumulation and apoptosis also in KMS27, JJN3, L363 and HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B − S2E</xref>). QVD addition blocked caspase-3 processing in KMS27 cells but did not restore proliferation and cell cycle progression by IRE1 silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F − S2H</xref>). Nor did QVD substantially recover proliferation of JJN3 or HCT116 cells undergoing IRE1 depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2I and S2J</xref>). By contrast to the differential dependency of these cell lines on IRE1 vs XBP1, OPM2 cells displayed a comparable cell cycle inhibition upon silencing of either IRE1 or XBP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2K</xref>). Flow cytometry of AMO1 cells stained with Annexin V and 7-AAD confirmed the induction of apoptosis, blocked by QVD, upon silencing of IRE1 but not inhibition of its RNase activity or knockdown of XBP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2L and S2M</xref>). Apoptotic signaling upon ER stress can lead to caspase-mediated cleavage of IRE1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. To verify the uncoupling of the cell cycle inhibition from apoptosis, we generated AMO1 cells with CRISPR-mediated gene disruption of caspase-8—a protease implicated in apoptosis initiation by ER stress that is functionally suppressed by IRE1 through RIDD against DR5 mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. As expected, caspase-8 knockout strongly dampened caspase-3/7 and apoptosis activation upon IRE1 knockdown; however, it afforded only a modest growth restoration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2N − S2P</xref>). Thus, IRE1 silencing causes cell cycle inhibition independently of apoptosis activation.</p><p id="P6">IRE1’s enzymatic activity regulates secretory function through XBP1s as well as via RIDD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. To interrogate whether a disruption of secretion contributed to the observed dependency on IRE1, we tested whether conditioned media (CM) collected from IRE1-proficient cells could rescue the proliferation of IRE1-depleted cells. Addition of CM from IRE1-expressing AMO1 cells to naïve cells during subsequent IRE1 silencing led to a minor increase in confluence during a 7-day proliferation study; however, most of the growth inhibition persisted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2Q</xref>). Conversely, media from IRE1-silenced cells did not significantly attenuate growth of IRE1-proficient cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2R</xref>). This suggested that the principal requirement for IRE1 in AMO1 cells is independent from secretion of extracellular factors.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>IRE1 silencing downregulates expression of multiple cell cycle genes</title><p id="P7">To seek further insight into the specific molecular alterations conferred by IRE1 silencing, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of AMO1 cells subjected to IRE1 <italic>vs</italic>. XBP1 knockdown (2 clones per gene in triplicates). We collected cells at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h after Dox addition and characterized them by bulk RNA sequencing. IRE1 or XBP1 silencing showed expected effects on the IRE1 and XBP1s proteins and their encoding mRNAs, as well as on the XBP1s transcriptional targets SEC61A and SYVN1 and the RIDD mRNA targets DGAT2 and BCAM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A − S3C</xref>). Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated two major ontological categories that were most notably downregulated by IRE1 silencing: Protein Processing in the ER, and Cell Cycle Control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Further dissection of the Cell Cycle category revealed markedly attenuated expression of genes involved in mediating the S as well as G2/M phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B − 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D − S3E</xref>). In keeping with the flow cytometry data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), many of the transcriptional changes related to cell cycle control occurred already within 24 h of Dox addition. Indeed, Hallmark GSEA further revealed significant <underline>down</underline>regulation of E2F, Myc, G2/M, and mitotic spindle targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis further indicated depletion of mRNAs linked to DNA Replication, Chromosomal Region, Chromosome Centromeric Region, and Chromosome Segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Thus, silencing of IRE1, but not of XBP1, decreased the transcription of many cell cycle genes involved in chromosome replication, organization and segregation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>IRE1 depletion upregulates the p53 pathway and specific CDK inhibitors</title><p id="P8">Amongst gene-sets that were significantly <underline>up</underline>regulated by IRE1 silencing was the TP53 (p53) tumor suppressor pathway, which showed elevated expression of most of its target-gene clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A</xref>). To obtain additional insights, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of AMO1 cells during knockdown of IRE1 <italic>vs</italic>. XBP1 (2 clones each). We collected cells at 0 and 24 h after Dox addition and characterized proteolytic digests of cell lysates by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Several proteins involved in cell cycle control displayed selective downregulation upon IRE1 silencing, including KIF22, UHRF1, KITH and KIFC1 (p &lt; 0.05). Additional proteins that did not reach statistical significance but were notable nonetheless included AURKB, SAS6, TPX2, CCNA2, CCNB1, NUF2 and CDCA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Conversely, the cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor CDKN1A (p21) showed significant mRNA and protein upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B and 4C</xref>). Immunoblot (IB) analysis indicated upregulation of the p53 protein as early as 6 h after Dox addition, while p21 showed accumulation by 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). The gain in p53 was accompanied by its phosphorylation on Ser15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>), indicating functional engagement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. RT-qPCR analysis further revealed that the upregulation of p53 was non-transcriptional, whereas p21 induction was evident both at the mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D and 4F</xref>), consistent with the known transcriptional activation of p21 by p53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. The proteomic data also suggested that IRE1 silencing upregulated the CDK inhibitor CDKN1B/p27 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>). This upregulation appeared to be non-transcriptional based on RNAseq and RT-qPCR analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4C and S4D</xref>), and was confirmed by IB at the protein level for both AMO1 and KMS27 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4E</xref>). Because DNA damage often drives p53 activation, we interrogated specific markers of the DNA damage response (DDR) that act upstream to p53 in response to DNA double-strand breaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Indeed, knockdown of IRE1 but not XBP1 induced time-dependent upregulation and phosphorylation of histone H2AX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4F</xref>); it also increased 53BP1 levels in concert with engagement of p53 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4G</xref>), suggesting that IRE1 depletion augments DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>IRE1 silencing increases chromosome instability</title><p id="P9">To investigate the effect of IRE1 silencing on chromosomal integrity, we examined Hoechst-stained AMO1 cells for the presence of micronuclei by fluorescence microscopy. Over 24 − 48 h of Dox addition, IRE1 silencing increased the relative frequency of micronuclei as compared to XBP1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A and 5B</xref>), suggesting exacerbated chromosomal instability in IRE1-depleted cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. In concert, IRE1 silencing also decreased the relative frequency of mitotic cells at 24 and 48 h and increased the incidence of apoptotic nuclei at 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A and 5B</xref>). Treatment with QVD did not significantly alter the frequency of micronuclei or mitotic figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), confirming the increase in micronuclei caused by IRE1 knockdown and suggesting an independence of this feature from caspase activation. Furthermore, IRE1 depletion in the context of QVD treatment led to a significant decrease in DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>), suggesting a specific loss during cell division. Together, these results indicate that IRE1 silencing promotes DNA damage and chromosome instability, at least in this context of aneuploidy. In keeping, GSEA of the proteomics data indicated that ontologies most significantly impacted by IRE1 silencing included: Metaphase-Plate Congregation, Mitotic Sister Chromatid Segregation, and Mitotic Cell Cycle Arrest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>). Additional notable ontologies included Cyclin-Dependent Protein Ser/Thr Kinase Inhibitor Activity and Regulation of Cell Cycle G1/S Transition.

Both the transcriptomic and proteomic data indicated a decrease of approximately 4 − 5-fold in UHRF1 levels by 24 h of IRE1 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). IB analysis confirmed a substantial downregulation of UHRF1 protein in response to IRE1 silencing in both AMO1 and KMS27 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). To further examine UHRF1 modulation, we interrogated tumor samples from AMO1 xenografts. Dox-induced IRE1 silencing but not enzymatic IRE1 inhibition led to a marked downregulation of UHRF1, in concert with upregulation of p53, p21 and p27 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>). Similarly, tumor samples from KMS27 xenografts showed strong UHRF1 downregulation and p27 upregulation upon IRE1 knockdown, but not under enzymatic IRE1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">UHRF1 plays a key role in maintenance of DNA methylation and in chromatin modification during DNA replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. We therefore examined the effect of IRE1 silencing on DNA methylation. As a control, we used the cytosine analog 5-azacytidine (5-aza), which displaces cytosine within newly synthesized DNA thereby blocking methylation. A 5-methylcytosine ELISA indicated that 5-aza treatment maximally attenuated global DNA methylation by approximately 60%, while IRE1 knockdown alone decreased this modification by about 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). In presence of higher 5-aza concentrations, IRE1 deletion did not further decrease DNA methylation, suggesting convergence of the two interventions. We also interrogated histone H3 methylation by IB against H3 and H3K9me3. Although H3K9 was not detected at baseline, treatment with 5-aza increased relative H3K9me3 levels in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6C</xref>), consistent with earlier findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>; IRE1 knockdown substantially attenuated this elevation in H3K9me3. Furthermore, whereas 5-aza alone had a weak anti-proliferative effect on AMO1 cells, its combination with silencing of IRE1 but not XBP1 led to a more complete growth inhibition than did IRE1 disruption by itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6D</xref>). Since 5-aza inhibits DNA methylation while increasing H3K9me3 marks, the disruption of both events by IRE1 depletion may enable stronger growth inhibition.</p><p id="P12">To further interrogate the impact of IRE1 knockdown on chromatin, we examined nuclear morphological features of AMO1 cells by electron microscopy (EM). Based on electron density and distribution features, we could readily discern heterochromatin, evident from clusters of electron-dense material; nucleoli; and euchromatin, indicated by dispersed patches of relatively electron-lucent material. At 24 h after Dox addition, IRE1-silenced cells showed a marked reduction in heterochromatin, whereas XBP1-depleted cells showed similar heterochromatin density to that of baseline controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6E</xref>). Quantification of multiple fields (excluding dead cells and cells with no visible nuclei) indicated that IRE1 knockdown equalized the proportion of cells displaying dense heterochromatin or dispersed euchromatin; in contrast, baseline control and XBP1 silencing resulted in higher ratios of cells with heterochromatin vs. euchromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>). We performed an independent EM study at a different laboratory (University of Utrecht), in which the investigators were unaware of the latter results. Their study yielded similar data, indicating a decrease in cells with heterochromatin and a corresponding increase in cells with euchromatin in response to IRE1 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6F</xref>). It further provided evidence of decreased mitotic figures and increased apoptotic figures within 24 − 48 h of Dox addition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6G − S6I</xref>).

To further decipher these molecular changes, we synchronized AMO1 cells in the G1 phase by treatment with an established CDK4/6 inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. We then washed out the inhibitor to allow the cells to resume cycling more synchronously. At t=0 after CDK4/6 inhibitor washout, over 80% of control cells appeared in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7C</xref>)—as compared to the 60% we detected without synchronization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).

IRE1 knockdown during the synchronization period increased the proportion of cells in G1 to approximately 90% at t=0, and markedly impaired progression from G1 into S and further into G2 and M. Relative to controls, IRE1-silenced cells showed an upregulation of γH2AX and p21 at t=0, possibly due to the depletion of IRE1 during synchronization, and an attenuated accumulation of UHRF1 over time. IRE1 knockdown also altered the kinetic profiles of several proteins involved in G1/S, including CCNA2, Rb, pRb, E2F2 and TK1; as well as proteins involved in G2/M, namely CCNB1, CDC20, CDCA5, CDCA8, AURKB, Geminin, Securin, KIF22 and pH3.</p><p id="P14">Next, we synchronized AMO1 cells in late G2 by treatment with an established CDK1 inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>, followed by inhibitor washout to allow mitotic progression.

Of note, the synchronization in G2/M was associated with somewhat increased levels of apoptosis overall. By 90 min post washout the proportion of cells in G1 began to increase, indicating completion of mitosis and re-entry into G1. IB analysis during the first 90 min after CDK1 inhibitor washout indicated a lower level of CDC20, CDCA8, AURKB, Geminin, and pCDC25c in IRE1-depleted cells vs. controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that IRE1 coordinates both early and late events during cell cycle progression.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Endogenous IRE1 protein can localize to the nuclear envelope</title><p id="P15">We reasoned that the regulation of cell cycle events by IRE1 might be facilitated by its localization to the nuclear envelope (NE), which has an outer membrane contiguous with ER membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. Supporting this hypothesis, subcellular fractionation of AMO1 cell lysates followed by IB revealed detectable IRE1 protein in the nuclear compartment, which contained the nuclear protein Lamin B1 but lacked the Golgi marker 58K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>). IRE1 knockdown depleted the protein in the nuclear fraction to a level below detection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8A</xref>), confirming specificity. Furthermore, in contrast to Lamin B1, proteins containing the ER-localized epitope KDEL, and the ER-resident protein REEP5 were not detectable in the nuclear fraction, excluding the possibility that IRE1 detection in this compartment is due to ER contamination. To further investigate IRE1 localization, we leveraged a previously validated U2OS cell line expressing an endogenous IRE1 allele marked by CRISPR/CAS9-mediated gene editing with a C-terminal HaloTag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Immuno-fluorescence microscopy using anti-HaloTag antibody suggested that, although most of the IRE1-HaloTag signal appeared to be associated with the ER, IRE1 protein could be detected in some proximity to Lamin B1, which marks the nuclear-matrix on the inner side of the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>). This proximity was further supported by integrated Z-stack analysis of 30 sections, each 300 nm thick (inset). To obtain more precise localization, we developed a sensitive immuno-EM technique to detect endogenous IRE1 similarly gene-edited with a HaloTag in AMO1 cells harboring Dox-inducible IRE1 shRNA. IB analysis of the modified AMO1 cells confirmed complete labeling of the endogenous IRE1 protein by the HaloTag, and its depletion upon Dox addition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8B</xref>). Immuno-EM staining with the anti-HaloTag antibody and protein A Gold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> produced a relatively sparse signal; nevertheless, gold particles could be detected not only in association with ER membranes, but also with the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8C</xref>).

Our present results demonstrate that some cancer cells can display a surprising nonenzymatic dependency on IRE1, without a significant requirement for XBP1s or RIDD. For certain tumor models, namely AMO1 and KMS27, IRE1 dependency was particularly strong, as evident by robust growth inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic> and complete tumor regression <italic>in vivo</italic> upon IRE1 silencing. We observed a nonenzymatic IRE1 requirement in both MM and colorectal carcinoma cells, suggesting that this phenotype is not restricted to one type of cancer. Aneuploidy and chromosomal instability are frequent hallmarks of malignancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Accordingly, it is conceivable that certain genome abnormalities, for example chromosomal translocations or other alterations, give rise to a unique dependency on IRE1 and a corresponding vulnerability to its disruption. The nature of such genomic alterations remains to be investigated.</p><p id="P18">Regardless, our data suggest that an as yet unidentified scaffolding role of IRE1—perhaps mediated by one or more of its known protein-protein associations, or through as yet unknown interactions—helps coordinate cell cycle progression. The ER plays important roles during the cell cycle, for example during mitotic breakdown and reassembly of the nuclear envelope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. Strikingly, our immuno-EM study of the endogenous IRE1 protein—to our knowledge the first such visualization—revealed that some IRE1 molecules can associate with the NE. Future studies should interrogate whether IRE1 fulfills a specific structural or scaffolding role in that location to facilitate ER-to-nucleus coordination during cell cycle progression. Intriguingly, previous IP-MS studies already suggested that IRE1 may directly interact with proteins involved in cell cycle regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">IRE1 silencing led to a G1 cell cycle arrest as well as to apoptotic caspase activation, the former occurring independently of the latter. IRE1 depletion augmented DNA damage and chromosome instability, evident by an increased abundance of specific DDR markers and of micronuclei and a subsequent loss of DNA. These events may engage the p53 pathway to inhibit cell cycle progression across the G1-S as well as the G2-M checkpoints. CDKN1A/p21, found to be upregulated both at the mRNA and protein levels on IRE1 silencing, is a major transcriptional target of p53 that mediates cell cycle inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. The p53 pathway also may contribute to the observed induction of apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. Indeed, proapoptotic transcriptional targets of p53 such as BAX and DR5/TNFRSF10B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup> were upregulated upon knockdown of IRE1 but not XBP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). Furthermore, the non-transcriptional upregulation of CDKN1B/p27 may provide additional cell cycle inhibition. A distinct interaction between the DDR and IRE1 has previously been reported based on evidence that DNA damage augments IRE1 activation and RIDD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. Furthermore, BRCA1—an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in DNA repair—has been reported to promote proteostasis by ubiquitinating IRE1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. Together, these findings suggest a reciprocal connection between IRE1 and the DDR: while DNA damage enzymatically activates IRE1, IRE1 nonenzymatically promotes DNA integrity.</p><p id="P20">Another notable outcome of IRE1 silencing was the downregulation of UHRF1— a protein that acts as a key epigenetic regulator by bridging DNA methylation and chromatin modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. UHRF1 specifically recognizes and binds hemimethylated DNA at replication forks and recruits the methyltransferase DNMT1 to ensure faithful propagation of DNA methylation patterns during S phase. UHRF1 also plays a key role in chromatin modification, binding to H3K9me3 and recruiting several chromatin-associated proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. IRE1 silencing decreased DNA methylation and attenuated 5-aza-induced H3K9me3 modification as well as heterochromatin abundance. Whether and how these phenotypes are connected to the downregulation of UHRF1 remains to be investigated.</p><p id="P21">Our data suggests that IRE1 fulfills a nonenzymatic structural function to support cell cycle progression, which is critical in certain cancer cells. More specifically, our transcriptomic and proteomic analyses indicate that IRE1 regulates cell cycle events that promote DNA replication, chromosome segregation, as well as chromatin maintenance. IRE1 silencing downregulated mRNA transcripts and/or proteins involved in advancing S phase as well as mitosis. It is possible that the inhibition of S-phase by IRE1 depletion causes mitotic disruption within the same cell cycle. Alternatively, perturbations of DNA integrity may lead to G1 arrest of afflicted daughter cells during the subsequent cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. Perhaps related to our present findings is published evidence that IRE1 supports mitotic fidelity of chromosome segregation in the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>.

Additional evidence with potential relevance to the present results include the translocation of proteolytic IRE1 fragments from the ER to the nucleus through cleavage by Presenilin-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>, and the genetic demonstration of a critical nonezymatic IRE1 requirement for VDJ recombination and B-cell receptor generation in mouse pre-B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">Perhaps the most significant translational implication of this study is that enzymatic IRE1 inhibition does not suffice to realize IRE1’s full potential as a therapeutic target for cancer. Earlier work has shown that enzymatic inhibition of IRE1, either at the kinase or the RNase level, or XBP1 disruption, can be efficacious in models representing diverse cancers. Herein we reveal that enzymatic IRE1 inhibition or XBP1 knockdown fails to restrain malignant growth of certain cancer models that are nevertheless attenuated by IRE1 silencing. This generates a strong conceptual rationale to explore novel disruptive strategies for IRE1 at the gene, mRNA, or protein level, <italic>e.g</italic>., gene therapy, antisense oligonucleotides, small-interfering RNAs, or protein degraders. Such interventions may be more broadly effective than IRE1 kinase or RNase inhibition and should be considered for cancer and perhaps for other pathologies that may involve nonenzymatic IRE1 function. Furthermore, specific biomarker strategies are needed to better predict IRE1 dependency in order to guide optimal IRE1-disruptive therapy for the individual patient.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p id="P23">Parental AMO1, KMS27, JJN3, L363, HCT116 and OPM2 cell lines were obtained from ATCC and authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) profiles.
