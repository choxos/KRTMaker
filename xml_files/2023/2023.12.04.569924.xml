Despite its severity, there remain no treatments for this disorder, with little understanding of cellular mechanisms of pathogenesis. Recent research using the <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutant zebrafish model has suggested that microglia − brain-resident phagocytes − may be the drivers of neuroinflammation in this disorder, due to their failure to digest apoptotic debris during early development. As such, the current study aimed to develop a strategy for microglial replacement and test the effects of this intervention on <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutant zebrafish pathology. We developed a strategy for microglial replacement through transplantation of adult whole kidney marrow-derived macrophages into embryonic hosts. Using live imaging, we revealed that transplant-derived macrophages can engraft within host brains and express microglia-specific markers, suggesting adoption of a microglial phenotype. Tissue clearing strategies revealed the persistence of transplanted cells in host brains beyond embryonic stages We demonstrated that transplanted cells clear apoptotic cells within the brain, as well as rescuing overactivation of the antiviral response otherwise seen in mutant larvae. RNA sequencing at the point of peak transplant-derived cell engraftment confirms that transplantation can reduce the brain-wide immune response, and particularly the antiviral response, in <italic>rnaset2</italic>-deficient brains. Crucially, this reduction in neuroinflammation resulted in behavioural rescue - restoring <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutant motor activity to wild type levels in embryonic and juvenile stages. Together, these findings demonstrate the role of microglia as the cellular drivers of neuropathology in <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants, and that macrophage transplantation is a viable strategy for microglial replacement in the zebrafish. Therefore, microglia-targeted interventions may have therapeutic benefits in RNaseT2-deficient leukodystrophy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Microglia</kwd><kwd>transplantation</kwd><kwd>white matter disease</kwd><kwd>leukodystrophy</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">As the resident immune cells of the brain, microglia are essential to the development and function of a healthy nervous system. These highly specialised tissue-resident phagocytes have a host of functions involved in CNS homeostasis, including phagocytosing debris and dying cells, mediating the immune response through release of carefully balanced pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, and supporting the health of neurons and other glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. It is perhaps unsurprising, therefore, that microglial dysfunction has been linked to a multitude of disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and white matter diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Although white matter is composed predominantly of myelin - an insulating protein produced and stored within the expansive membranes of oligodendrocytes - it is becoming increasingly apparent that microglial dysfunction can contribute to such diseases, both by directly impacting myelin health and indirectly, by promoting neuroinflammation.</p><p id="P3">One family of white matter diseases in which the contribution of microglia is becoming more apparent are the leukodystrophies - a family of monogenic white matter disorders, many of which present during infancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. These devastating conditions are associated with extensive psychomotor impairment, the formation of white matter lesions, neuroinflammation and, in many cases, limited life expectancy. Although the mechanisms of pathology are, in many instances, specific to the gene affected in each leukodystrophy, microglial dysfunction has begun to emerge as a common theme - even in disorders in which the mutation is thought to affect a gene primarily associated with the function of other glial cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. In particular, microglial activation has been suggested to be the first marker - and therefore potential driver - of pathology in animal models of multiple leukodystrophies, which has been corroborated by several post-mortem reports from patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. In addition, haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation − which may act to replace microglia − is a clinically established therapy in several leukodystrophies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. As such, microglia-targeted approaches may represent a promising therapeutic avenue in the leukodystrophies.</p><p id="P4">Here, we show that the addition of healthy microglia reduces both neuropathology and symptom presentation in a zebrafish model of RNASET2-deficient leukodystrophy − a disorder which sits at the intersection of leukodystrophies, lysosomal storage diseases and a family of autoinflammatory disorders characterised by upregulation of the interferon response, known as interferonopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that a failure of <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutant microglia to clear developmental apoptosis contributes to downstream pathology - leading to an elevated antiviral response, behavioural abnormalities and reduced survival in the zebrafish model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. We therefore hypothesize that microglia are the cellular drivers of neuropathology in this disorder, and that replacing these deficient cells will rescue <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutant phenotypes. In this study, we develop a methodology to replace deficient microglia by macrophage transplantation and demonstrate that transplantation of macrophages can replenish the microglial population in both healthy and <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutant zebrafish. Moreover, replacing deficient microglia in <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants is sufficient to rescue cell death, antiviral immune responses and defects in locomotion during embryonic stages. RNA sequencing and behavioural assays confirmed the therapeutic effect of transplanted cells in later stages, with complete rescue of neuroinflammation and impaired swimming. As such, our findings provide further evidence that microglia are central to RNASET2-deficient leukodystrophy pathology and support a targeting of microglia as a potential therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animal models</title><p id="P5">All procedures involving zebrafish followed the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 under the Home Office Project Licence (PPL P254848FD).

Zebrafish embryos were maintained in Petri dishes of approximately 60 embryos in E3 media in light cycling incubators at 28°C until 5 days post-fertilisation (dpf).

Animals were culled by schedule 1 methods: first, animals were supplied with terminal anaesthesia in a tricaine bath (1.33g/L in aquarium water) followed by destruction of the brain. Culled animals were then secured on an agarose dissection plate with the abdominal cavity exposed via a deep incision along the ventral midline. To retrieve the kidney, internal organs were removed (including any egg debris) and the exposed kidney was peeled from the dorsal surface using forceps. Each kidney was then placed in 200μl of cold live sorting buffer (L15 media, 20% foetal bovine serum and 5mM EDTA) and mechanically separated using repeated pipetting by P1000 and P200 pipettes, to encourage dissociation of cells from connective tissue. Samples from each fish were kept separate, and on ice, until immediately before flow cytometry to prevent cross-reactivity or immune activation. Finally, samples were filtered through FACS tubes and pooled for sorting.</p><p id="P9">To isolate GFP-positive cells, samples were loaded into the BD FACSMelody™ cell sorter (BD Biosciences) at 4°C. GFP-negative samples were sorted first to determine thresholds for GFP-fluorescence, and TO-PRO™3 (ThermoFisher, R37170) was used to facilitate removal of dead cells. GFP-positive cells were sorted into an Eppendorf tube containing 500μl live sorting buffer and placed on ice before transplantation. Cell yields of approximately &gt;500,000 cells were optimum for transplantation.</p><p id="P10">After FACS, GFP-labelled cells can become photobleached, making visualisation and quantification of transplanted cells challenging in host embryos for several days post-transplantation.

Cells were suspended in 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in live sorting buffer, before final centrifugation and resuspending at a concentration of approximately 20–30 cells per nanolitre.</p><p id="P12">Transplants were performed on 2dpf embryos with their endogenous microglia and macrophages labelled with mCherry (<italic>Tg(mpeg1:mCherry CAAX)sh378</italic>). Where required, these embryos had undergone microglia depletion via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of <italic>irf8</italic> (described below). On the day of transplantation, hosts were dechorionated, anaesthetised with 4.2% tricaine and lined up on a moist 28°C agarose plate for injection. Sorted cells were injected into the systemic circulation via the duct of Cuvier. Hosts were then rescued from anaesthesia in fresh E3 and returned to the incubator for recovery. As a negative control, approximately 60 embryos received a sham transplant containing only 1% PVP in live cell sorting buffer, without any cells present.</p><p id="P13">Following transplantation, embryos were sedated with 4.2% and screened using a Zeiss Axioscope to confirm the presence of GFP-positive cells. For longitudinal quantification of transplanted cells, positive embryos were screened at 3dpf and transferred to individual wells of 48-well plates for follow-up. For all other assays, embryos were screened at 5dpf and those with 10 or more GFP-positive cells in their brain were taken forward for subsequent assays. For raising until 8dpf, embryos were transferred to fresh Petri dishes containing E3 media and returned to the light cycling incubator. Media was changed daily, along with the addition of fresh food and removal of any unhealthy larvae for culling by schedule 1.

To achieve maximum depletion, two guides targeting <italic>irf8</italic> expression (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) were injected at a final concentration of 50μM each by creating an injection mix of 0.5μl of each guide at 100μM, 1μl of 50μM tracer and 1μl Cas9 nuclease (New England Biolabs, MO386M). As a control, scrambled crRNA was used at 50μM in the place of <italic>irf8</italic>-targe ting guides. For each embryo, 2μl of injection mix was injected into the yolk sac at the single cell stage.

Fish were checked weekly to observe any potential side effects of transplantation, and to maintain fish health. At the desired timepoint, fish were culled by decapitation with each head placed into 2ml 4% PFA and gently inverted to ensure the entire tissue was fully submerged, before leaving at 4°C overnight to ensure fixation of the tissue. Samples were then rinsed in autoclaved PBS and brains dissected in a Petri dish containing PBS placed on ice under a light microscope. Dissected brains were then gradually dehydrated using sequential 30-minute washes in methanol: 25% MeOH: 75% PBS; 50% MeOH: 50% PBS; 75% MeOH: 25% PBS; 100% MeOH).

For samples 28dpf and older, brains were then submerged in 1ml 50:50 CUBIC-1:dH<sub>2</sub>O for up to six hours. Following full equilibration of the sample (confirmed by checking that the sample has sunk to bottom of the tube), 50:50 CUBIC-1:dH<sub>2</sub>O was removed and 1ml CUBIC-1 was added.

This quantification pipeline began by converting the ND2 file from the Spinning Disk into an Arivis compatible SIS file. The optic tectum was manually identified as the region of interest from each whole brain image, as processing the whole image was beyond the capabilities of the analysis computers available in the Wolfson Light Microscope facility. The optic tectum was chosen as a region of interest to allow alignment with the embryonic data sets from other transplant assays (TUNEL etc.), and because this area remained robustly intact after dissection, immunohistochemistry and clearing while other more peripheral regions (such as the olfactory bulb or hindbrain and spinal cord) were frequently damaged. To begin quantification, a closing morphology filter was applied in other to smooth the appearance of otherwise highly ramified and irregular microglia to create a more uniform structure that can be better identified by subsequent segmentation tools. The ‘blob finder’ segmentation tool was then performed − an analysis tool suited to finding irregular, rounded objects. The parameters of this blob finder segmentation were adjusted to most accurately capture the relevant cell population, using an average diameter of 30μm for objects in the GFP channel, and 15μm for 4C4-positive cells. Diameters were established by using manual measurement of cells in the raw image as a starting point, then adjusting the value until the segmentation most accurately mapped visible cells. The differing diameters set for each channel − despite labelling the same cell type − are attributed to the different cellular localisation of the marker proteins: <italic>fms:GFP</italic> being a cytoplasmic marker distributed throughout the cell, while the 4C4 antigen may be more discrete. Using these parameters, the blob finder segmentation was able to identify cells in three dimensions.</p><p id="P29">To remove any analysis artefacts, the resulting segments were filtered to exclude any objects with a volume larger than 5000μm<sup>3</sup> or less than 300μm<sup>3</sup>. These values differ to those used for the Imaris segmentation − however, this is because Imaris requires spherical estimations of volume to provide a threshold, while Arivis is better able to calculate the volume of irregular objects and filter accordingly. At the final stage, objects were manually filtered by intensity to account for differing staining efficiencies between timepoints to ensure the final object count best reflected the true number of cells.</p><p id="P30">To establish the co-localisation of 4C4 and GFP signal, a parent-child analysis was performed to quantify the number of GFP-positive objects that contained a 4C4-positive object, with a minimum overlap of 20%.

As such, we sought to replace these dysfunctional microglia using transplantation of healthy macrophages. Although HSC transplantation is used clinically in hereditary leukodystrophies and may act to replace microglia, transplanted macrophages may represent a quicker route to repopulation of the brain − minimising the need for HSC engraftment and instead migrating directly to the central nervous system (CNS). To this end, healthy macrophages were isolated from whole kidney marrow (WKM) from <italic>Tg(fms:GFP)</italic> adult fish and purified by FACS. Purified macrophages were injected at 2 days post-fertilisation (dpf) into embryos with endogenous macrophages depleted by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the transcription factor <italic>irf8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Transplanted macrophages were able to robustly engraft within host embryos and reach the brain within three days of transplant in microglia-depleted animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b, c</xref>). The numbers of transplanted cells in the brain increased in the days post-transplant, with timelapse imaging confirming that transplanted macrophages were able to divide following engraftment in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary video 1</xref>). Conversely, transplantation of CD41-positive haematopoietic stem cells was less efficient therefore confirming the suitability of WKM-derived macrophages as a graft resulting in a more direct repopulation of the microglial niche (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Depleting the host of endogenous microglia using <italic>irf8</italic> crRNA CRISPR/Cas9 injection promoted transplanted cell engraftment, highlighting the importance of emptying the niche before transplantation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1a,b</xref>).</p><p id="P48">Transplanted macrophages displayed a highly microglia-like morphology, with multiple branches surveilling the CNS environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>).

Using colocalisation with the microglia marker 4C4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], we showed that up to 80% of transplant-derived cells express microglia-specific proteins - suggesting that these WKM macrophages are able to adapt to their host environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e,f</xref>). Crucially, transplantation was associated with reduced abundance of apoptotic cells in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating the ability of transplant-derived cells to phagocytose dying cells within the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>).

As <italic>rnaset2</italic> microglia are deficient in their ability to clear apoptotic cells accumulating during development − known to be one of the key drivers of microglial infiltration into the developing brain − we investigated whether endogenous microglia depletion was necessary for complete engraftment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Interestingly, we found significantly more transplant-derived cells in the brains of microglia-depleted hosts compared to non-depleted controls, suggesting that transplanted macrophages compete with dysfunctional endogenous microglia cells for brain engraftment, as found in WT brains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1 and Sup Figure 2</xref>). However, we also noticed that a greater proportion of transplanted cells expressed the microglia-specific marker 4C4 in microglia-depleted animals − suggesting that these cells are able to take on a microglial-like phenotype in <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants when endogenous microglia are absent, but retain aspects of their macrophage identity when host microglia are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). This failure to express microglia-specific markers was found in transplanted cells in non-depleted brains both 3- and 5-days post-transplant − suggesting this is not due to a delay in cells entering the brain where they may undergo reprogramming, but rather due to an overall failure to adopt a microglia-like phenotype.</p><p id="P50">After demonstrating that transplanted macrophages are able to engraft in <italic>rnaset2</italic> embryos, we next sought to investigate whether this intervention could rescue neuropathology observed in our disease model. As a failure to digest dying cells during development is thought to be one of the initiating factors in <italic>rnaset2</italic> pathology, we first investigated the ability of transplanted macrophages to clear apoptotic debris in <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants. Indeed, TUNEL staining revealed that transplanted animals exhibited significantly fewer uncleared apoptotic cells at 5– and 8dpf, with a complete rescue to wild type levels at 8dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). Interestingly, this clearance of apoptotic cells was comparable across transplanted animals regardless of endogenous microglia depletion at both ages. We had previously hypothesised that this bottleneck of apoptotic cell digestion may trigger downstream neuropathology - in particular, the antiviral response which is prominently upregulated in mutants during larval and adult stages. As such, we next investigated the impact of transplantation on antiviral responses in the heads of 8dpf animals. qPCR revealed an approximately four-fold downregulation of the interferon response gene <italic>isg15</italic> in transplanted mutants − a correlate of the antiviral response significantly upregulated in the <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). A similar pattern of rescue was observed for other antiviral genes, including <italic>mxa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>). This normalisation of the antiviral response could not be explained by elevated levels of functional, transplant-derived rnaset2, as <italic>rnaset2</italic> transcript levels remained downregulated in transplanted mutants compared to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, these findings suggest that the presence of phagocytosis-competent macrophages in the CNS can stabilise the antiviral cascade in <italic>rnaset2</italic> brains.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Long-lasting transplanted macrophages rescue neuroinflammation beyond embryonic stages</title><p id="P51">To assess whether transplanted cells persisted in the brain to provide long lasting therapeutic effects, we used tissue clearing followed by immunohistochemistry on brains from WT transplanted animals to quantify endogenous versus transplanted cell number over time. We found that transplant-derived cells initially expand − peaking at 4 weeks post-fertilisation (wpf) − but were no longer detectable by 14wpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a–c</xref>). This reduction in transplanted cell number appeared to be accompanied by a gradual reduction in the percentage of remaining transplant-derived cells which express the microglial-specific marker 4C4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). Interestingly, like in microglia-depleted wild type hosts, we saw a robust engraftment of transplanted cells maintained in microglia-depleted <italic>rnaset2</italic> brains until 4wpf, which was also cleared by 14wpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e-g</xref>). However, in non-depleted <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants, transplanted cells were largely absent by 4wpf - suggesting that these cells are cleared more quickly when host microglia are present. Together, these data suggest that transplant-derived cells are able to maintain engraftment for the first few months of life in hosts lacking endogenous microglia during early development, regardless of genotype. Therefore, in order to investigate the impact of transplantation on <italic>rnaset2</italic> pathology beyond embryonic stages, we utilised microglia-depleted 4wpf hosts for our subsequent experiments.</p><p id="P52">We performed RNA sequencing on bulk brains from <italic>rnaset2</italic> microglia-depleted transplanted animals compared with microglia-depleted sham controls (n=4 brains per group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a–c</xref>).

Interestingly, immune-related pathways were not enriched in <italic>rnaset2</italic> non-depleted transplanted animals compared with non-depleted sham controls, likely due to a lack of transplant-derived cells in host brains at this timepoint (n=3 brains per group) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 5, 6</xref>). Nonetheless, this suggests that adding phagocytic competent healthy macrophages at early stages in brain development can rescue the brain-wide immune response, specifically suppressing the antiviral immune response, in <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Transplantation rescues rnaset2 motor impairment and survival beyond embryonic stages</title><p id="P53">After demonstrating that transplantation rescued many of the hallmarks of <italic>rnaset2</italic> neuropathology, we next sought to investigate whether these changes in pathology translated to altered disease behaviour. Larval swimming analysis revealed that transplanted mutants swam greater distances over a 20 minute period at 8dpf compared to non-transplanted controls, which themselves were hypoactive relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a,b</xref>). This rescue was mirrored at 4wpf, with transplanted, microglia-depleted <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants showing greater motor activity over a 10-minute period of free-swimming, compared with sham controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). Notably, at this timepoint, non-depleted transplanted <italic>rnaset2</italic> animals were not assayed due to a failure of persistent engraftment in these animals by 4wpf (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e,f</xref>). Interestingly, in microglia-depleted transplanted hosts, the extent of motor recovery was similar between juveniles which had persistent cell engraftment and those which did not − suggesting that there may be some residual benefits of transplantation shortly after these cells disappear from the brain. Strikingly, this behavioural improvement appeared to be accompanied by an increase in survival of transplanted <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants at 4wpf relative to microglia-depleted sham controls. As such, macrophage transplantation has therapeutic benefits beyond embryonic stages lasting into juvenile stages in <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P54">In this study, we have demonstrated that replacement of diseased microglia with healthy macrophages can rescue <italic>rnaset2</italic> pathology at a molecular, cellular and behavioural level. We have demonstrated that transplanted macrophages can reach embryonic brains, adopt a microglia-like phenotype and maintain engraftment for four to ten weeks post-transplantation. Transplanted macrophages compete with host microglia for filling of the microglial niche, even when host microglia are deficient in their ability to clear inflammatory debris in the brain. Nonetheless, the presence of transplanted cells was able to normalise the antiviral response, clear apoptotic debris and rescue the behavioural phenotypes shown by <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants. RNA sequencing confirmed that macrophage transplantation rescues antiviral responses in <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants at 4wpf juvenile stages. As such, this work supports the hypothesis that supplementation of healthy microglia improves aspects of pathology in RNASET2-deficient leukodystrophy, and that therapeutic targeting of the microglia may represent a future avenue for the development of novel treatments.</p><p id="P55">We have previously demonstrated that microglia-specific rescue of <italic>rnaset2</italic> expression can restore aspects of microglial function in <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants − improving clearance of developmental apoptosis and restoring normal microglial morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. The current study extends this finding − showing that the presence of healthy phagocytes in the brain can not only clear apoptotic debris but rescue the neuroinflammatory response and restore motor function through larval and juvenile stages. Indeed, multiple other studies have supported the finding that microglial replacement can improve aspects of pathology − including behavioural rescue − across various neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Additionally, treatment of neurological disorders with a cellular − rather than gene-based − therapy is particularly appealing in the context of microglial dysfunction, as many viral vehicles for gene delivery fail to efficiently target microglia at a whole-brain level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Our study therefore identifies a cellular mechanism whereby deficient microglia drive pathology in <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants and supports a cellular approach to targeting microglia dysfunction in RNASET2-deficient leukodystrophy, beyond the genetic strategies previously explored.</p><p id="P56">Our data also evidence the ability of whole kidney marrow-derived macrophages to infiltrate the brain, divide and express microglia-specific markers. In the zebrafish, these cells are most similar to human bone marrow-derived macrophages and so may mimic peripheral blood cells following transplant. These cells have previously been demonstrated to infiltrate the brain following microglia depletion, during periods of inflammation or during embryogenesis (before the formation of the blood brain barrier) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Due to the early timepoint at which our transplants were performed in the <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutant embryos, it is likely that all three of these factors contributed to successful engraftment in our intervention. However, the true extent to which transplant-derived macrophages become microglia-like remains unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated that, although macrophages derived from bone marrow and peripheral blood were able to engraft within the brain and express some microglia-specific markers, these transplant-derived cells remained transcriptionally distinct to host microglia even following robust engraftment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. As such, it seems our results mirror the findings that transplant-derived macrophages can adapt to their new CNS environment and adopt key microglial phenotypes − but that they may remain distinct from their endogenous counterparts.</p><p id="P57">It is possible that the potential failure of these HSC-derived macrophages to fully adopt a microglial identity contributes to their lack of longevity in the host brain. However, it is interesting to note that there are two distinct populations of microglia in the zebrafish throughout development − with embryonic microglia derived from yolk sac progenitors gradually replaced throughout juvenile stages by a distinct population of adult HSC-derived macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. This replacement is thought to be dependent on the arrival of the adult kidney marrow-derived second wave − with embryonic microglia persisting when HSC-derived microglia are genetically depleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, this clearance of embryonic microglia follows a similar time course to that seen with our transplant-derived cells − despite these whole kidney marrow-derived cells being more similar in ontogeny to the HSC-derived adult microglia than the yolk sac embryonic progenitors. As such, it is possible that our transplant-derived cells undergo such extensive reprogramming following engraftment that they are recognised as self and follow the same trajectory as host embryonic microglia. It remains unclear whether this gradual decrease in transplant-derived cell number is due to cell intrinsic processes (such as cell death) or interactions with infiltrating host adult microglia. Transplantation of our macrophage graft into animals lacking this adult HSC-derived microglia population could, therefore, result in life-long engraftment of transplant-derived cells in the brain and potentiate their therapeutic effects.</p><p id="P58">It is interesting to note that, in order to achieve robust engraftment in <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants, transient depletion of the embryonic microglial niche via knockout of <italic>irf8</italic> − a transcription factor required for the development of early microglia and macrophages − was required. We had initially speculated that the failure of rnaset2-deficient microglia to clear developmental apoptosis (among the first triggers to attract circulating monocytes to the CNS) would be sufficient for recruitment of transplanted macrophages to the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. However, without depletion of the embryonic microglial niche, the number of transplant-derived cells engrafted within host brains and the expression of microglia markers by these cells was much poorer than those with endogenous microglia depletion. This may have clinical implications, suggesting that myeloablation might be required in the context of transplantation in humans. However, despite these differences, the extent of pathology rescue was comparable between depleted and non-depleted hosts during larval stages, in terms of clearance of apoptotic debris, normalisation of the antiviral response and behavioural recovery. As such, it seems the presence of any additional healthy phagocytes in the brain can have benefits in <italic>rnaset2</italic> larvae, regardless of microglial identity. Additionally, even in microglia-depleted hosts, the mean number of transplant-derived cells remained much lower than the number of microglia which might be expected in a healthy age-matched embryo − suggesting transplant-derived cells may be particularly potent in their ability to clear neuropathology. Previous work has demonstrated that circulation-derived myeloid cells have an enhanced phagocytic ability relative to endogenous microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Therefore, it seems that transplanted macrophages may be well suited to clearing apoptotic debris and restoring neuroinflammatory response regardless of their expression of microglial markers in <italic>rnaset2</italic> hosts.</p><p id="P59">Microglia replacement was sufficient to rescue the pathological antiviral and behavioural phenotypes of <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants - however, future work is needed to assess the impact of this intervention of myelin structure and function. By 8dpf (the earliest timepoint used in this study), zebrafish show robust myelination which has been demonstrated to impact some behavioural functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. As such, our finding that microglia replacement rescues <italic>rnaset2</italic> locomotion presents two possible explanations. The first is that transplantation supports myelin integrity in <italic>rnaset2</italic> mutants. Such a hypothesis could be explored in future studies using myelin- and oligodendrocyte transgenic report lines, electron microscopy and MRI to investigate white matter function on a broader scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. An alternative hypothesis is that <italic>rnaset2</italic> locomotion defects are independent of myelination state at the ages investigated. While myelination has been linked to time-sensitive escape responses following startle stimuli in the zebrafish, a multitude of other factors can impact free swimming behaviours, including neuroinflammation and viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Therefore, the interplay between transplant-derived cells, oligodendrocytes and myelination remains unclear. Nonetheless, the rescue of locomotion in transplanted animals suggests that the microglia are an attractive target for the development of future interventions in RNaseT2-deficient leukodystrophy.</p><p id="P60">In summary, our study highlights a cellular mechanism whereby microglia are the drivers of RNASET2-deficient neuropathology and suggests microglia-directed approaches may have therapeutic benefits in leukodystrophy. We demonstrate that adult whole kidney marrow macrophages can engraft in host brains and undertake microglial phenotypes, both in wild type animals and our disease model. Restoring microglia function by macrophage transplantation was sufficient to rescue brain-wide autoimmune phenotypes and restore locomotor activity from larval to embryonic stages. In particular, this work suggests cellular replacement strategies may have substantial impact in targeting the microglia, such as macrophage or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure</label><media xlink:href="EMS192577-supplement-Supplementary_Figure.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d144aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Andrew Grierson for providing comments on the manuscript, David Drew, Catherine Loynes and the staff from the flow cytometry facility at the University of Sheffield, The Wolfson Light Microscopy Facility and the BSU Zebrafish for their technical help and support.
