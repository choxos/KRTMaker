The release of aldosterone is typically controlled by the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, situated in the adrenal glands, kidneys, and lungs. Here, we reveal that the class A scavenger receptor MARCO, expressed on alveolar macrophages, negatively regulates aldosterone production and suppresses angiotensin converting enzyme (Ace) expression in the lungs of male mice. Collectively, our findings point to alveolar macrophages as additional players in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and introduce a novel example of interplay between the immune and endocrine systems.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The scavenger receptor MARCO (macrophage receptor with collagenous structure), a class A scavenger receptor, is primarily expressed on macrophages including tumour-associated macrophages, and lung macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. MARCO, upregulated in response to pathogenic challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, has been implicated in defence against pathogens in the lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, phagocytosis and clearance of tumor cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, internalisation of exosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, and has been touted as a potential target in anti-cancer immunotherapy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The class A scavenger receptors have a broad ligand specificity and similar domain structures, comprising a cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane region, spacer region, α helical coiled domain, collagenous domain, and a C-terminal cysteinerich domain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Known endogenous ligands for the receptor include, like other class A receptors, modified forms of low-density lipoprotein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> indicating that this receptor could be involved in the modulation of cholesterol availability. Scavenger receptors have previously been implicated in corticosteroid output from the adrenal gland. Specifically, Scavenger Receptor BI (SR-BI) was shown to regulate glucocorticoid responses via binding of serum cholesterol, the necessary substrate for adrenal corticosteroids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Aldosterone, the other major adrenal cortex-derived corticosteroid, is known to be regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is situated in the adrenals, lung, and kidney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. While a role for scavenger receptors in regulating glucocorticoid responses has been demonstrated, the role of macrophage-expressed scavenger receptors in the regulation of adrenal corticosteroid output at steady state has not yet been explored.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P3">It is known that statins, cholesterol-lowering drugs have been shown to reduce aldosterone levels in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that cholesterol supplementation boosts the production of aldosterone from cultured cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Given that the adrenal-derived mouse corticosteroids, most notably corticosterone and aldosterone, derive from cholesterol as the common precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) we hypothesised that cholesterol binding scavenger receptors could modulate adrenal corticosteroid output by regulating the availability of cholesterol that could feed into the steroid hormone biosynthetic pathway. To test this hypothesis, we measured the concentrations of aldosterone and corticosterone in the plasma of Marco<sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type mice. We found that male Marco<sup>-/-</sup> mice had significantly elevated levels of plasma aldosterone relative to wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, plasma corticosterone levels were not significantly altered in male mice lacking Marco (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Marco-deficient female mice did not have altered levels of aldosterone relative to WT, but plasma corticosterone was increased relative to WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d, e</xref>). We observed that the adrenal glands from Marco-deficient male mice were significantly lighter than WT controls in male but not female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f, g</xref>). To establish whether cholesterol could explain the elevated plasma aldosterone we observe in Marco-deficient male mice, we measured the levels of total serum cholesterol and intra-adrenal cholesterol in males. We found that Marco<sup>-/-</sup> mice had reduced serum cholesterol relative to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>), while the normalised levels of intra-adrenal cholesterol were similar between both mouse strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). Taken collectively, these findings suggest that, while Marco-deficient male mice have elevated plasma aldosterone concentrations, this is not dependent on systemic or intra-adrenal cholesterol availability. For the purposes of this paper we focused on the phenotype evident in male mice, namely the increase in plasma aldosterone concentrations.</p><p id="P4">We next hypothesised that adrenal gland-derived <italic>Marco</italic> could play a role in modulating aldosterone output. Analysis of publicly available Single cell sequencing data from murine adrenal glands shows that adrenals do contain a substantial population of macrophages expressing <italic>Ptprc</italic> (CD45), <italic>Adgre1</italic> (F4/80), and <italic>Cd68</italic> (CD68). However, we did not detect Marco expression in this cluster of cells, nor any other cluster identified in our analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). This finding was corroborated by immunostaining of male murine adrenal glands, which showed CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the adrenal zona fasciculata and zona glomerulosa that did not stain positively for MARCO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Given that the lung is another site in the RAAS axis, we postulated that Marco-expressing cells in the lung could be involved in mediating the aldosterone phenotype we observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>. Indeed, single cell RNA seq analysis of the murine lung shows that <italic>Ptprc</italic> (CD45), <italic>Adgre1</italic> (F4/80), and <italic>Cd68</italic> (CD68) expressing cells (Alveolar Macrophages) also express <italic>Marco (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>), a finding corroborated by immunostaining in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). To further validate our single cell sequencing and immunofluorescence data, we carried out qPCR for <italic>Marco</italic> in the lungs and adrenal glands from male WT and Marco<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which further demonstrated that the lung is the primary site of Marco expression in the RAAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Aldosterone is a potent blood pressure-regulating hormone, the dysregulation of which can cause severe hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk. It therefore follows that its production is tightly regulated. Aldosterone biosynthesis is fundamentally regulated intra-adrenally by cytochrome P450 family members in the corticosteroid biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We therefore tested whether altered expression of enzymes in this pathway could explain the hyperaldosteronism observed in Marco-deficient mice. Marco<sup>-/-</sup> male and female mice showed similar expression of aldosterone biosynthetic enzymes (<italic>Star, Cyp11a1. Hsd3b1, Cyp11b1, Cyp11b2)</italic> as wild type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, b</xref>). While <italic>Cyp11b2</italic> (aldosterone synthase) is only expressed in the adrenal zona glomerulosa, other biosynthetic enzymes essential for aldosterone production are expressed in the zona fasciculata.</p><p id="P6">CYP11B1 catalyses the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone. Corticosterone can be catalysed to aldosterone by CYP11B2. In this sense, the route via CYP11B1 is a bona fide route for the generation of aldosterone, as evidenced by the fact that <italic>Cyp11b1</italic> deletion in mice results in a significant reduction in aldosterone production <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. This route is one that is suppressible via the suppressive action of dexamethasone on ACTH and <italic>Cyp11b1</italic> expression. Moreover, ACTH is a known stimulator of aldosterone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Dexamethasone-mediated suppression of the zona fasciculata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) (Finco et al. 2018) was used to test whether the elevated aldosterone phenotype was zona fasciculata-dependent. Marco-deficient mice fed dexamethasone-supplemented drinking water had plasma aldosterone concentrations comparable to vehicle-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), indicating zona fasciculata activity does not contribute to elevated aldosterone levels in Marco<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Taken collectively, these findings indicate that elevated aldosterone observed in Marco-deficient mice arises extra-adrenally and can therefore be considered a form of secondary hyperaldosteronism. Kidney-derived renin is the initiating hormone in the enzymatic cascade that generates angiotensin II, a potent stimulator of adrenal aldosterone production. We therefore compared plasma renin activity between male WT and Marco<sup>-/-</sup> mice, finding no significant differences between the two strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Next, we investigated whether lung-derived angiotensin converting enzyme (<italic>Ace</italic>) could explain the elevated aldosterone levels observed in Marco<sup>-/-</sup> mice. ACE in the lung catalyses the conversion of Angiotensin I to the aldosterone-stimulating peptide Angiotensin II. We carried out a qPCR test for <italic>Ace</italic> in the lungs of WT and Marco<sup>-/-</sup> mice in both sexes, finding that Marco-deficient male animals had elevated levels of lung <italic>Ace</italic> relative to WT controls in male mice only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Immunofluorescent staining of WT and Marco<sup>-/-</sup> lungs revealed a substantially higher level of ACE protein in Marco-deficient male mice, while myeloid presence, as measured by CD68 staining, remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). While low levels of ACE expression could be detected in CD68<sup>+</sup> cells (data not shown), the vast majority of ACE was outside of monocytes and macrophages. We used image analysis software to quantify these changes, finding that ACE median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was significantly increased in male Marco-deficient lungs, while CD68<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells were present in wild type and knock-out animals at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c, d</xref>). Myeloid cell numbers and lung ACE expression were similar in WT and Marco-deficient female lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e, f</xref>). We also measured the levels of plasma potassium and sodium levels in male and female WT and Marco-deficient animals, but observed no differences between the genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g-j</xref>). Since aldosterone is a known regulator of blood pressure via regulation of blood fluid balance, we also measured blood pressure using the tail-cuff method. We observed that Marco-deficient male mice had marginally reduced diastolic blood pressures, but systolic and mean blood pressure were no different between the two strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4k-m</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We then turned back to analysis of single cell RNA-seq data to identify the cells in the lung that could be mediating this effect. In the lung, unsupervised cluster analysis revealed a total of 12 cell clusters with distinct gene expression signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). We determined the identity of each cell cluster based on the expression of established cell type-specific marker genes, aided by the marker genes identified and outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>. We next used dot plots to visualize expression of <italic>Marco</italic> and <italic>Ace</italic> across the different cell clusters. We observed notable <italic>Marco</italic> expression only in alveolar macrophages amongst the different cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). <italic>Ace</italic> was shown to be primarily expressed by lung endothelial clusters 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>), in agreement with what is known about lung <italic>Ace</italic> expression. To test whether alveolar macrophages are capable of suppressing endothelial cell <italic>Ace</italic> expression, we co-cultured the MPI alveolar macrophage cell line <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, with or without deletion of Marco, with HUVECs endothelial cells for 24 hours, and measured <italic>Ace</italic> expression via qPCR. We observed an increase in <italic>Ace</italic> expression in the Marco-deficient MPI co-cocultures but not WT, though this did not reach statistical significance. Taken collectively, these data suggest a model whereby Marco-expressing alveolar macrophages may, in responses to an as-of-yet unidentified factor, inhibit <italic>Ace</italic> expression at the gene and protein level, and thereby negatively regulate the cleavage of Angiotensin I to form Angiotensin II, and thereby aldosterone production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>).</p><p id="P9">In conclusion, we hereby demonstrate that Marco is a negative regulator of aldosterone production, associated with a suppression of angiotensin converting enzyme expression in the lungs of male mice. We propose a model in which extra-adrenal Marco expressing alveolar macrophages, through tissue crosstalk with lung endothelial cells, actively inhibit Ace expression and thereby inhibit the production of aldosterone from the adrenal glands.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P10">Multiple studies over preceding decades have shown that macrophages are much more than simply immune and inflammatory cells. Macrophages have been shown to mediate a wide variety of physiological functions and support homeostasis in virtually every tissue they are found <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Our original hypothesis centred on the regulation of corticosteroid output via modulation of cholesterol availability. While we ended up disproving this hypothesis, we did provide a novel example of the non-immune functions of tissue macrophages. It was recently shown that tissue infiltrating macrophages cause neuronal cell death and effective denervation, which disrupts normal melatonin secretion in a model of cardiovascular disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to report that macrophages are involved in the regulation of hormonal output <italic>in vivo</italic> at steady state. It is known that immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine can increase blood pressure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> yet the mechanism remains incompletely understood. This observation is consistent with our data showing macrophage-mediated negative regulation of the blood pressure-controlling hormone aldosterone. Additionally, the fact that higher ACE/ACE2 ratios have been linked to hypertension and worse outcomes in Covid-19 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> could implicate MARCO in the susceptibility to severe disease.</p><p id="P11">Secondary aldosteronism (SA) is distinguished from primary aldosteronism through renin – SA is characterised by high aldosterone and high or non-suppressed renin levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. By this definition, Marco-deficient mice exhibit SA, due to their high aldosterone and normal renin levels. SA is also defined as elevated aldosterone that originates outside of the adrenal gland – in this case from ACE in the lung. This finding raises the intriguing possibility that aldosteronism could be triggered or aggravated by MARCO-binding ligands. The fact that blood pressure and plasma electrolytes are not substantially modulated by Marco deletion, despite elevation in plasma aldosterone concentrations, indicate that this mechanism has not evolved to regulate systemic physiology. However, ACE and Angiotensin II are pleiotropic molecules. In addition to their physiological roles, they are also exhibit immunomodulatory functions. <italic>In vitro</italic>, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of the HUVECs endothelial cell line or human primary endothelial cells causes a reduction in ACE activity, mRNA and protein levels. Similarly, ACE expression in human lung tissue is reduced in sepsis patients relative to control tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Supernatant from LPS or TNFα-treated endothelial cells shows a high proportion of ACE<sup>+</sup> endothelial microparticles (EMPs). ACE<sup>+</sup> EMPs are also increased in plasma of mice undergoing experimental lung injury and in human septic patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, indicating shedding of lung endothelial ACE in the context of inflammation. Ace and AngII have been shown to enhance inflammation in a variety of contexts. It may therefore be that Marco-expressing alveolar macrophages exert an immune-modulatory function within the murine lung via controlling tissue <italic>Ace</italic> expression. Alveolar macrophages, which use MARCO to bind and uptake bacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, could serve to enhance lung immunity in a pathogen and ACE-dependent manner. Pharmacologic ACE inhibition was previously shown to dampen pro-inflammatory immune cell inflammation in radiation-induced pneumonitis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Future experiments could therefore explore whether Marco regulates lung tissue Ace expression in the context of inflammation and/or pathogenic challenge. While acute increases of plasma aldosterone have varying effects on endothelial function in humans and animal models, chronic (i.e. genetic) elevations of plasma aldosterone are virtually universally associated with endothelial dysfunction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. This is frequently characterised by reduced endothelial NOS activity from, and acetylcholine action on, endothelial cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. It would therefore be logical to test whether vascular dysfunction is present in the endothelia of Marco-deficient mice relative to wild type mice.</p><p id="P12">While the data presented here indicate that Marco deletion is a positive regulator of aldosterone and lung Ace expression, important questions remain to be answered, such as the precise mechanism by which Marco-expressing alveolar macrophages suppress Ace expression, and the ligand(s) responsible for stimulating this effect via the receptor. Additionally, the mechanisms mediating the sex differences observed here remain unexplored. Our findings nevertheless introduce a novel immune paradigm the renin angiotensin aldosterone system.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Mice</title><p id="P13">C57BL/6J, Marco<sup>-/-</sup>, and hCD68<sup>GFP/GFP</sup> mice were bred and housed in individually ventilated cages in specific pathogen-free conditions at the University of Oxford.
