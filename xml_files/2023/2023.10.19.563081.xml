A remarkable feature of invertebrate <italic>Dscam</italic> is massive alternative splicing generating thousands of different isoforms from three variable clusters of alternative exons. <italic>Dscam</italic> expression and diversity arising from alternative splicing have been studied during development, but whether they exert functions in differentiated brains has not been determined. Here, using honey bees, we find that Dscam expression is critically linked to memory retention as reducing expression by RNAi enhances memory after reward learning in adult worker bees. Moreover, alternative splicing of <italic>Dscam</italic> is altered in all three variable clusters after learning. Since identical Dscam isoforms engage in homophilic interactions, these results suggest a mechanism to alter inclusion of variable exons during memory consolidation to modify neuronal connections for memory retention.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dscam</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>learning and memory</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Memory consolidation is the process through which memories are stabilized and stored into long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kandel et al., 2014</xref>).

During transcription, splicing out of introns allows to alter coding content through alternative splicing, which is particularly abundant in the brain in genes coding for ion channels and cell adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Soller, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Vuong et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Ule and Blencowe, 2019</xref>). From some of these genes, hundreds of different proteins can be made leading to a substantial increase of the coding capacity of the genome. However, the functional consequences of diversity generated by alternative splicing remain poorly understood.</p><p id="P3">In honey bees, an invertebrate model species for the study of learning and memory processes, requirement of transcription and the neuronal RNA binding protein ELAV during memory consolidation further suggest important roles for alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lefer et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Villar et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Ustaoglu et al., 2021</xref>). Accordingly, alternative splicing events in a number of cell adhesion molecules and ion channels among other genes have been linked to learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Demares et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Demares et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Beffert et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Poplawski et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Sengar et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Ustaoglu et al., 2021</xref>). Likewise, ELAV itself is substantially alternatively spliced in bee mushroom bodies (brain centers for learning and memory) and its expression pattern differs between individuals, likely reflecting differences in individual experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Ustaoglu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The <italic>Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam)</italic> gene from invertebrates is the most extreme example for alternative splicing generating a mere 36’012 different proteins from a single gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and this likely is still an underestimate as new exons are still discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hemani and Soller, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). The main part of diversity in the <italic>Dscam</italic> gene originates from three clusters containing an array of variable exons of which only one exon is included. These clusters are in exon 4 with 12 variables, exon 6 with 48 variables and exon 9 with 36 variables in the extracellular domain and in exon 11 in the transmembrane domain with two variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Schmucker et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p id="P5"><italic>Drosophila Dscam</italic> is expressed in the nervous system where its variability is used during development for neuronal wiring, and in the immune system as a pattern recognition receptor for pathogen clearance by phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hemani and Soller, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Watson et al., 2005</xref>). The main roles in the nervous system comprise establishment of overlapping dendritic fields in the peripheral nervous system and to branch neurites in neuronal tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hughes et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Matthews et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Soba et al., 2007</xref>). Key to these functions of Dscam are homophilic repulsive properties of individual identical Dscam isoforms, but not to other splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wojtowicz et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wojtowicz et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, dendrites of neurons can overlap if they express different Dscam isoforms and neuronal tracts such as the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body containing hundreds of neurons can split into two lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Wang et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Matthews et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Mechanistically, it has been proposed that individual neurons adopt a unique set of variables stochastically to comply with their fate in branching in the peripheral nervous system and in the mushroom bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Neves et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Miura et al., 2013</xref>). This model further implies that <italic>Dscam</italic> alternative splicing is maintained in individual neurons. In the immune system, however, exposure to different pathogens altered inclusion of variables to generate variants with higher affinity in mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dong et al., 2006</xref>). Accordingly, both stochastic as well as deterministic rules have been found to govern dendritic branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Palavalli et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the homophilic interaction of identical Dscam isoforms could also be converted to attraction at low levels and in this way build novel connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wojtowicz et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Although vertebrate <italic>Dscam</italic> does not have the molecular diversity generated by alternative splicing as found in invertebrates, the homophilic properties of Dscam are a conserved molecular function required for neuronal wiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Schmucker and Chen, 2009</xref>). Since the <italic>Dscam</italic> gene in humans has been associated with intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Vacca et al., 2019</xref>), we examined its role in learning and memory in honey bees, where memory consolidation involves changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lefer et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Villar et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Ustaoglu et al., 2021</xref>) and neuronal connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hourcade et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we discovered that down-regulated <italic>Dscam</italic> during learning enhances memory consolidation in bees. To characterize alternative splicing in bees we sequenced <italic>Dscam</italic> cDNAs of the variable regions to comprehensively update previous annotation from comparing genomic sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Graveley et al., 2004</xref>). This analysis reveals that bees have 9 exon 4, 52 exon 6 and 19 exon 10 variables. Unlike <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we find intra-cluster splicing in bee <italic>Dscam</italic>. When we analysed alternative splicing during the course of memory consolidation, we discovered that alternative splicing significantly changed within variable clusters. Our results indicate that changes in <italic>Dscam</italic> splicing can be induced upon experience likely to establish new neuronal connections associated with memory consolidation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Dscam is required for memory consolidation in bees after olfactory reward conditioning</title><p id="P8">To detect bee Dscam, we used a polyclonal anti-serum raised against <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dscam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Watson et al., 2005</xref>). In honey bees this polyclonal antibody recognizes proteins at the size of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dscam of 222 and 270 kDa and three shorter bands of 100, 110 and 130 kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 1A</xref>). To validate that the larger band recognized by the antibody is indeed bee Dscam, we injected dsRNA against bee <italic>Dscam</italic> into the central brain for knock-down by RNAi. A substantial reduction of 72±5% and 79±10% (n=3 each) is achieved after 48 h and 64 h of the expected bands at 222 and 270 kDa, respectively, but not of the shorter bands of 100, 110 and 130 kDa suggesting that these bands in bees are unspecific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To assess whether Dscam has a role in learning and memory, bees were individually trained in an associative olfactory conditioning task two days after injection of <italic>Dscam</italic> or <italic>GFP</italic> control dsRNA to then measure short-term and long-term memory 1 hour and 1 day after training, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). Both groups showed significant learning over the successive trials (RM-ANOVA, <italic>Trial</italic> effect: F=46.55, p&lt;0.001), without significant effect of the treatment (F=2.28, p=0.135, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref> left). We then tested short-term (1h following conditioning) and long-term (24h) memory to ask whether <italic>Dscam</italic> downregulation could impact on memory formation despite preserved learning capacities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). Here, at 1 hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref> middle) bees from the <italic>Dscam</italic> group responded significantly more to the conditioned stimulus (CS) than those from the <italic>GFP</italic> group (Fischer’s exact test: χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.72, p=0.044), while the proportions of specific responses did not differ either (χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.37, p=0.118, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref> middle and left). Yet, while both groups clearly responded more to the CS than to the novel odorant 1 hour after training, the difference was not significant in either case (McNemar test, <italic>GFP:</italic> χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.88, p=0.090 : <italic>Dscam:</italic> χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.0588, p=0.808). The proportions of individuals displaying specific responses (i.e. responses to the CS but not the novel odour, N) did not differ either between the groups (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.56, p=0.125, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref> middle). Thus, down-regulated Dscam levels enhanced memory performance without affecting its specificity.</p><p id="P10">At 24 hours after conditioning, only a portion of bees survived and could be tested (<italic>GFP</italic>: n=22, <italic>Dscam:</italic> n=15). Both groups responded more to the CS than to the novel odorant, although the difference was not significant in the <italic>Dscam</italic> group due to a smaller sample size (McNemar test, <italic>GFP:</italic> χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.84, p=0.028; <italic>Dscam:</italic> χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.048, p=0.827, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref> right). Again, the proportions of specific responses did not differ between the groups (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.3.37, p=0.118), but bees from the Dscam group showed a marginally significantly higher response rate to the CS than those form the GFP group (Fischer’s exact test: χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.36, p=0.050). Thus, down-regulated Dscam levels enhanced CS-N specific long-term memory performance.</p><p id="P11">To reject the possibility that loss of <italic>Dscam</italic> impacts on long-term memory retrieval per se due to a prolonged downregulation of <italic>Dscam</italic>, we performed an additional experiment in which injection was done shortly after training, so that RNAi would be effective at the time of retrieval (24 hours) rather than at consolidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). As expected, this treatment did not affect learning (<italic>Trial effect</italic>: F=48.48, p&lt;0.001; <italic>Trial x Treatment</italic> interaction: F=0.697, p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref> left). More importantly, long-memory retrieval was intact and two days after training both groups responded similarly to the CS (Fischer’s test: χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.729, p&gt;0.05) and responded significantly less to the novel odorant (GFP: χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.23, p&lt;0.05; elavl2: χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.47, p&lt;0.01), thus indicating a preserved memory of the CS-US association and no enhancement of memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref> right).</p><p id="P12">These results thus argue that down-regulation of <italic>Dscam</italic> during memory consolidation enhances storage of memories.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Alternative splicing analysis of honey bee <italic>Dscam</italic> reveals novel isoforms and intra-cluster splicing</title><p id="P13">Since <italic>Dscam</italic> in invertebrates is abundantly alternatively spliced, we wanted to analyze Dscam alternative splicing after training, but this required evaluation of the gene annotation.

To directly address alternative splicing in <italic>Dscam</italic> variable clusters 4, 6 and 10 in bees, we RT-PCR amplified the variable clusters and Illumina sequenced the amplicons.

It is most prominently elaborated in the invertebrate <italic>Dscam</italic> gene making about three times as many proteins than genes present in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hemani and Soller, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Soller, 2006</xref>). Here, we characterize in depth the alternative splicing landscape of the honey bee <italic>Dscam</italic> gene and identify novel isoforms including an increased use of alternative 5` and 3` splice sites and intra-cluster splicing further expanding the diversity and shedding light on its unusual splicing regulation. <italic>Dscam</italic> mis-regulation has been associated with intellectual disabilities in humans associated with an additional copy of chromosome 21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Vacca et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, an extra copy of <italic>Dscam</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> causes strengthening of synapses and in a mouse model leads to excessive GABAergic synapses in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Liu et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lowe et al., 2018</xref>). When we analysed learning and memory in honey bees upon reducing Dscam levels by RNAi we find enhanced memory storage. In addition, we find that alternative splicing of <italic>Dscam</italic> changes in the variable clusters during memory consolidation. Since Dscam homophilic interaction could stabilize existing connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chen et al., 2006</xref>), down-regulation of specific isoforms could loosen existing neuronal connections to stimulate formation of new ones, essentially recapitulating down-regulation of <italic>Dscam</italic> as obtained by RNA interference. To store individual memory traces in the mushroom bodies, likely only few neurons are involved. It is thus surprising that Dscam alternative splicing changed substantially, such that significant changes could be detected in central brains. It will be of interest to follow up which neurons exactly change splicing upon learning, which might be possible with the development of long-read sequencing technology for single cell analysis to overcome current limitations in alternative splicing analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Decio et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Decio et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Zaharieva et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Memory consolidation requires transcription and implicates that alternative splicing can impact on the process of memory storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kandel et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Ustaoglu et al., 2021</xref>). In honey bees, a first transcriptional wave occurs at the beginning of memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lefer et al.,2012</xref>). Of note, it is during this phase that also <italic>Dscam</italic> alternative splicing changes. And importantly, bees have displayed strikingly different splicing patterns depending on whether they actually learn or not during training. The most prominent changes occur in the exon 6 cluster, which compared to <italic>Drosophila</italic> has expanded by additional isoforms but also more frequent use alternative 5` and 3` splice sites, which is constituent with the more sophisticated neuroanatomy and behavioral performance of bees compared to <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In contrast, exon 4 and 10 clusters in bees have less isoforms. Lower diversity in these two clusters has been suggested to be associated with Dscam’s role as a pathogen receptor in the immune system as flies are extensively exposed to pathogens due to their life in a decomposing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Graveley et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P27"><italic>Dscam</italic> diversity has been shown to change in mosquitos towards isoforms that recognize pathogens with higher affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dong et al., 2006</xref>). Our finding that <italic>Dscam</italic> splicing changes upon learning further supports that the <italic>Dscam</italic> splicing pattern is not fixed and can change on demand. In fact, levels of Dscam have been found critical to neuronal function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> affecting nerve growth, synaptic targeting and neuronal physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cvetkovska et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lowe et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hernández et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Dscam</italic> has also been identified as a target of Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (Fmr1) that together with mRNA modification pathways impacts on local translation important for neuronal functions such as learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cvetkovska et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Haussmann, 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Anreiter et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Consistent with subtle changes in Dscam expression being effective in altering nerve growth, synaptic targeting and neuronal physiology, we find changes in alternative splicing during memory consolidation. In particular, skipping of the entire variable cluster occurs for exon 4 and 10 shortly after training resulting in removal of part of the homophilic interaction domain concomitantly reducing cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wojtowicz et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Dynamic regulation of Dscam expression in the nervous system is somewhat unexpected based on Dscam’s role in mediating axonal bifurcation for exit from axonal tracts or spreading in dendritic fields based on Dscam’s homophilic repulsive properties. Potentially, Dscam’s repulsive homophillic properties could only apply during development of the nervous system and convert to attraction to expand connectivity in mushroom bodies to consolidate memories. In fact, attractive properties of Dscam have been found with lower Dscam concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wojtowicz et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, Dscam has been shown roles in directed wiring of PNS neurons to innervate the ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). Likewise, whether homophilic binding of Dscam turns into repulsive or attractive cues is also dependent on interacting partners such as Netrins, Robo and Slit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alavi et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Andrews et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Liu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P30">How <italic>Dscam</italic> mutually exclusive alternative splicing is regulated is still poorly understood. Initially, it has been proposed that base-pairing of a constant region at the beginning or end of the cluster with sequences in front of variable exons would direct inclusion of variable exons, but compelling sequence conservation is only present in the exon 6 cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Haussmann et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Graveley, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Ustaoglu et al., 2019</xref>). Our finding that inclusion of alternative exons from the variable clusters changes upon memory consolidation further suggests that there is a mechanism to alter inclusion of specific variables possibly to change neuronal connections for enhancing memory. Given an increasingly aging human population, deciphering the molecular mechanism underlying memory enhancement is of great interest in light of cognitive disfunctions associated with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson and other age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Stern and Alberini, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Noyes et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Honey bees, treatment and behavioral assays</title><p id="P31">For initial molecular analysis of honey bee Dscam, bees (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) were collected from local bee hives in the UK (worker bees were used unless otherwise specified).
