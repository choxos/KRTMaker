Presently, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are the mainstay for stroke diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. These modalities are often limited in terms of accessibility as well as their ability to map brain perfusion with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution, particularly in the context of preclinical studies, thus calling for development of new brain perfusion techniques featuring rapid imaging speed, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use. Herein, we report on cortex-wide perfusion imaging in murine ischemic stroke with large-field multi-focal illumination fluorescence microscopy (LMI). We attained quantitative readings of hemodynamic and structural changes in cerebral vascular network and pial vessels at capillary level resolution and 80 Hz frame rate fully transcranially. The <italic>in vivo</italic> perfusion maps accurately delineated the ischemic core and penumbra, further exhibiting strong correlation with <italic>ex vivo</italic> triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Interestingly, monitoring of therapeutic effects of thrombolysis in stroke has revealed that early recanalization could effectively save the penumbra whilst reducing the infarct area. Furthermore, cross-strain comparison of perfusion dynamics affirmed that C57BL/6 mice, benefiting from more extensive pial collateral recruitment, feature a larger penumbra and smaller infarct core as compared to BALB/c mice which have few or no collaterals. Finally, we apply LMI to show that sensory stimulation-based treatment enhances blood flow and abolish perfusion deficit in the ischemic core and penumbra regions. The simple, cost-effective and minimally invasive nature of the proposed approach offers new venues for brain perfusion research under various disease conditions such as stroke, neurodegeneration or epileptic seizures.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>perfusion imaging</kwd><kwd>penumbra</kwd><kwd>fluorescence microscopy</kwd><kwd>widefield imaging</kwd><kwd>blood flow index</kwd><kwd>time to peak</kwd><kwd>mean transient time</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Acute ischemic stroke is the second cause of death and first cause of morbidity worldwide <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]</sup>. Emerging evidence indicates that best outcomes are achieved when recanalization therapy is performed as soon as possible after the stroke onset. During this short period, known as the “Golden Hour”, rapid determination of both reversibly (penumbra) and irreversibly (core) injured tissue is paramount <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]</sup>. Without early recanalization, the penumbra becomes infarcted whilst late recanalization may increase the rate of intracerebral bleedings and mortality <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]</sup>. Hence, fast identification of the ischemic penumbra and its expansion over time is crucial for assessing treatment benefits for stroke patients. However, precision techniques for imaging the penumbra and brain perfusion alterations are still lacking.</p><p id="P3">X-Ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the mainstay for stroke diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring in both preclinical and clinical settings. CT has a proven track record for assessing acute ischemic stroke and ruling out hemorrhage, yet it uses ionizing radiation and suffers from inferior sensitivity and soft tissue contrast <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]</sup>. While MR angiography (MRA), diffusion-(DWI) and perfusion-weighted (PWI) imaging can provide comprehensive multiparametric assessment of the brain parenchyma and circulation <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]</sup>, those diagnostic procedures are not widely and immediately accessible. Furthermore, when it comes to small animal studies, preclinical imaging modalities are generally limited in their ability to map brain perfusion with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution.</p><p id="P4">Optical imaging techniques have been explored as an accessible and cost-effective alternative for stroke studies in rodents. Although <italic>ex vivo</italic> histological imaging of brain sections allows for detailed evaluation of stroke injury, including neuronal apoptosis, necrosis and death, this technique lacks dynamic temporal information, requiring post-mortem indirect inferences <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]</sup>. Conventional <italic>in vivo</italic> widefield fluorescence imaging suffers from poor spatial resolution due to strong light scattering in the skull and brain tissue, making the assessment of perfusion and single vessel circulation unattainable. On the other hand, point scanning microscopy techniques, such as laser scanning confocal microscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT) or multi-photon microscopy (MPM), can achieve superior spatial resolution but commonly involve highly invasive craniotomy procedures <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]</sup>. Those techniques further suffer from restricted field of view (FOV), making them unsuitable for monitoring the vascular structural change on a brain-wide scale. There is an increasing number of studies exploring the potential of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) due to its relatively deep penetration and non-invasiveness <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]</sup>. Although NIRS can partially map superficial cerebrovascular responses, its value for acute stroke imaging is greatly limited by poor spatial resolution and low specificity. Other optical imaging techniques such as time-resolved absolute quantification methods<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]</sup>, ICG-based perfusion assessment<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]</sup> and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]</sup> have been exploited in intra-operative applications. However, these techniques provide poor spatial resolution due to strong scattering or otherwise limited functional information in terms of blood flow and perfusion constant for assessing acute ischemic stroke.</p><p id="P5">In this work, we introduce large-field multi-focal illumination (LMI) fluorescence microscopy for transcranial cortex-wide imaging of microvasculature, functional dynamics, and perfusion maps in ischemic stroke with high spatial and temporal resolution. <italic>In vivo</italic> assessment of ischemic core and penumbra and monitoring of recanalization therapies is performed with the method, depicting the process of rescuing the penumbra via reperfusion by thrombolysis. The <italic>in vivo</italic> data is validated with corresponding triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining of brain infarctions. Furthermore, we performed cross-strain comparison of post-stroke perfusion dynamics in mice with different vascular architectures (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) and revealed different core and penumbra sizes as well as collateral recruitment. Finally, sensory stimulation-based treatment for stroke, as a proof of concept, is performed and monitored with the proposed method to check its therapeutic effect.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> transcranial fluorescence microscopy allows noninvasive brain-wide perfusion imaging in ischemic stroke</title><p id="P6">The LMI technique capitalizes on the fast scanning based on an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and a beam-splitting grating to generate a uniform illumination grid of 17×17 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). By rapidly scanning the illumination grid and synchronizing data acquisition with a high-speed camera, a combination of a large FOV of 7×7 mm<sup>2</sup> and high spatial resolution of 14.4 μm and high frame rate of 80 Hz was achieved, thus exceeding imaging performance as compared to previously reported implementation <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]</sup>. The complete experimental procedure included several steps. First, ischemic stroke is induced by injecting thrombin into the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) as described previously <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]</sup>. Subsequently, time-lapse LMI images are acquired and compared with the images recorded with the well-established LSCI technique. For the LMI imaging, Sulfo-Cyanin-5.5-carboxylic-acid (Cy5.5) dye is administrated intravenously through the tail vein. For treated animals with thrombolysis, t-PA (0.9 mg/kg) was administered as described previously <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]</sup>after LMI imaging, i.e., 60 min post-stroke. For sensory stimulation treatment, hindpaw electrical stimulation was performed (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P7">An offline data processing pipeline was developed to facilitate stroke assessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). LMI images were first reconstructed and subsequently co-registered with the LSCI images. Pixel-wise time to peak (TTP), blood flow index (BFI) and mean transient time (MTT) maps were calculated from the LMI image stack. Principle component analysis (PCA) was performed to the image stack to distinguish the skull vessels and brain vessels (arterial and venous vessels) based on their different perfusion profiles. Blood flow velocity and cerebral blood volume were calculated based on regions of interest (ROIs) in different vessels. For more details on the calculation, please check the Methods section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>. Infarct core and penumbra regions were obtained after applying thresholds to the BFI signal changes by comparing the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. Note that the cortical blood flow from the contralateral hemisphere remained unchanged from the baseline following the stroke surgery, as verified with fluorescence localization microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), which is also in line with previous reports <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]</sup>. ROIs including core and penumbra were selected to perform further statistical analysis on perfusion constants and vessel fill fraction. Finally, validation of the <italic>in vivo</italic> measurement was performed by TTC staining which measures ischemic infarction in the isolated brains.</p><p id="P8">Mouse brains were imaged (n = 3 C57BL/6 mice) with LMI microscopy pre- and post-stroke onset to map the cerebral microcirculation (Supplementary videos 1, 2). PCA results prior to the stroke induction corroborated anatomical information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) on the cerebral vascular network and revealed clear perfusion differences between arteries and veins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Post-stroke PCA corroborated the occlusion of MCA while other vessels such as anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2k</xref>). BFI, MTT and TTP maps in a representative dataset showed clear perfusion deficit after stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2b-d, h-j</xref>). These results were further validated by independent measurement with LSCI which showed similar patterns of perfusion deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2f, l</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>LMI fluorescence microscopy allows the prediction of therapy success in stroke</title><p id="P9">After the stroke induction, ischemic lesion boundaries detection, including discrimination between the core of lesion and penumbra, could be accomplished with LMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3a,b</xref>). To demonstrate the precision of our proposed method, we further assessed the effect of a thrombolytic drug tPA, which allows CBF recovery and penumbra salvage. Mice were categorized into two different groups: stroke + tPA versus stroke controls (n=3 BALB/c mice per group). Before treatment, fluorescence intensity, BFI as well as fill fraction did not differ significantly between the two groups of mice. After tPA infusion, statistics on fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), BFI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), LSCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>), lesion size estimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>) and vessel fill fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>) clearly show improved reperfusion both in the core and penumbra regions post-treatment. Interestingly, in the mice treated with tPA, TTC staining revealed the infarction area was highly correlated with the core region detected by LMI, meaning the penumbra was saved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Furthermore, in the control mice, TTC staining revealed a large infarct combining both core and penumbra detected by LMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Compared to LSCI, correlation coefficients between the in vivo assessed core region and the TTC stained infarct tissue reveal that LMI has significantly higher diagnostic accuracy (86.1 ± 4.5% versus 75.4 ± 5.2%, MEAN ± STD, p = 0.0032) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). These data confirm the precision of LMI microscopy in discriminating penumbra from the core.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>LMI fluorescence microscopy reveals strain-related perfusion patterns post-stroke</title><p id="P10">Individual susceptibility to ischemic injury as well as the size of the ischemic penumbra vary greatly among different strains of mice due to the differences in their number of leptomeningeal collaterals. In this experiment, we aimed to perform LMI in animals with different core/penumbra ratio. To do so, we induced stroke in mice with different collateral networks, namely, BALB/c having poor collaterals and C57BL/6 having rich collaterals (n = 3 in each group). BFI, MTT and TTP maps show clear difference between these two strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4a vs 4b</xref> and Figs. S3). Specifically, BALB/c mice were more susceptible to the ischemic injury induced by stroke than C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, BALB/c mice showed significantly reduced blood circulation in the infarct region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) with partially reduced blood flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) and higher time latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4e</xref>) observed in the infarct region of C57BL/6 mice. Such discrepancy is congruent with previous reports and can be attributed to the lack of collateral vessels in BALB/c mice <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P11">The above observations are generally corroborated by the LSCI results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4a, b</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> column). However, in comparison to LSCI, the core and penumbra regions inferred from the LMI measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4a and 4b</xref>, 3<sup>rd</sup> column) manifested significantly higher correlation with the TTC stained brain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4a and 4b</xref>, 4<sup>th</sup> column, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). This is arguably ascribed to the unspecific signal contrast mechanism of LSCI which chiefly represents a non-linear dependence between tissue scattering and blood flow velocity <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]</sup>. Note that TTP and MTT maps also manifest a clear boundary between the healthy and infarcted tissue. This is of importance since the infarcted areas have prolonged TTP and MTT values due to impaired microcirculation, which can serve as additional criteria for stroke assessment without requiring a priori information about blood circulation or comparison with the other brain hemisphere. Yet, TTP and MTT maps are inferior in distinguishing the infarct core and penumbra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S5 and S6</xref>). Quantitative assessment of perfusion alterations was further performed for both LSCI and LMI images in the infarct core and penumbra regions. Statistics on fluorescence signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), BFI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>), and LSCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>) show that BALB/c mice exhibited reduced perfusion post-stroke as compared to C57BL/6 mice whilst C57BL/6 mice had longer perfusion duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Consequently, BALB/c mice had larger infarct core size than C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). Structural information analysis on vessel fill fraction also reveals that C57BL/6 mice had higher vessel perfusion rate at all sampling time instants as compared to BALB/c mice, which is consistent with aforementioned observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>LMI fluorescence microscopy captures dynamic collateral recruitment</title><p id="P12">To understand the impact of collaterals in maintaining brain perfusion after stroke, we compared the collateral circulation between C57BL/6 mice and BALB/c mice. Time-lapse images from a selected ROI covering both ACA and MCA were recorded from one representative mouse of each strain. Under baseline healthy conditions, collateral recruitment was not observed suggesting that collateral flow was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a, b</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> row). Following stroke induction, collateral flow became pronounced in C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> row) but remained unapparent in BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> row). Note that all the experimental parameters were kept the same for the assessment of both strains.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Sensory stimulations, delivered within one hour of the stroke onset, protect the cortex from perfusion deficits</title><p id="P13">We finally investigated whether a sensory stimulation-based treatment can be exploited to improve cortical reperfusion after stroke. To this end, a sensory stimulation trial was performed immediately after the stroke onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). The same experimental procedure was followed for animals from both the intervention (n = 7) and the control (n = 4) groups (see more details in the Methods section). Prior to inducing stroke, cortical activity and blood flow in the S1HL cortical region were assessed with intrinsic signal optical imaging (IOI) and LSCI, respectively, whilst brain perfusion was measured with LMI. To test the effect of sensory stimulation on post-stroke brain perfusion, LMI and LSCI were repeated immediately after stroke (0h) and at the end of the sensory-stimulation-based treatment (1h post-stroke).</p><p id="P14">BFI and LSCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>) displayed decreased hypoperfused area in the stimulated mice; however, the brain perfusion deficit was not different between the 0 h and 1 h post stroke time points in the non-stimulated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Note that the perception of the lesion size from BFI map may be affected by the display of the image after contrast adjustment. Instead, ameliorating brain perfusion was evident when evaluating the BFI changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). In contrast, the perfusion deficit has intensified at 1 h post-stroke for control mice by evaluating the BFI changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Statistics on the lesion size and its relative deviation from the intervention group show a clear contraction of the core region (p = 0.0247) and a tendency for size reduction in the penumbra (p = 0.2295) whilst the lesion sizes of both core and penumbra remained nearly unaltered in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6f, g</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">In ischemic stroke, both vascular morphology as well as blood flow information are crucial for accurately discerning the infarct core and penumbra. LMI imaging brings major advantages for the detection and quantification of the structural and functional alterations after stroke, as well as for precise assessment of the core and penumbra regions. The method attains a powerful combination between high (capillary-level) spatial resolution, millisecond temporal resolution, transcranial imaging capacity and whole-cortex coverage. It is observed that blood flow in the infarct core is impaired to a greater extent as compared to the penumbra. Interestingly, the technique has been used to predict the success of thrombolytic therapy and a sensory stimulation-based treatment. Furthermore, our study shows how LMI can be used to quantify differences in brain perfusion dynamics between mice with different stroke severities. Collateral recruitment, serving as an alternative blood supply to the infarct region, is of great interest in stroke as it crucially determines infarct severity, treatment efficacy and recovery. In this work, by real-time monitoring of cortex-wide microcirculation, collateral recruitment was observed in C57BL/6 mice post-stroke while no similar phenomenon was seen in the baseline (pre-stroke) measurements or in BALB/c mice.</p><p id="P16">In preclinical stroke research, LSCI has been widely adopted to provide brain-wide microcirculation mapping in real-time and can indicate abnormal blood flow in different brain regions. However, the spatial resolution of LSCI is insufficient for accurately determining alterations in specific vessels. Furthermore, the overall ability of LSCI to provide quantitative readings of absolute blood flow, velocity, or tissue perfusion remains questionable <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]</sup>. Interestingly, LMI provides superior performance by achieving higher spatial and temporal resolution as evinced by high resolution mapping of the cerebral vascular network and corresponding perfusion dynamics recorded at a frame rate of 80 Hz. More importantly, unlike LSCI whose imaging contrast mainly stems from scattering and is indirectly related to blood flow, the LMI approach can image the blood flow directly thus ensuring a higher interpretation power of the results and providing a higher correlation to the TTC staining which further correlates well with immunohistochemistry using NeuN and DAPI staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). BFI, TTP and MTT values obtained with the proposed LMI approach were further validated with dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging using superparamagnetic iron dioxide nanoparticles (SPION) injected through the tail vein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S8 and S9</xref>). By applying the same data analysis to ROIs in different types of vessels, i.e., MCA, drainage veins, superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and rostral rhinal vein (RRV), no significant difference was found in the BFI/TTP/MTT values from each vessel type between LMI and MRI, except BFI and MTT from SSS, where fluorescence data presented lower BFI and prolonged MTT arguably caused by the fluorescence signal integration across different depths in the cortex and skull (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To this end, CT and MRA have successfully been employed both in pre-clinical and clinical stroke studies. However, X-Ray CT angiography suffers from low spatio-temporal resolution and has been shown to result in overestimation of the infarct size <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]</sup>. CT perfusion studies can produce high spatial resolution quantitative mapping of cerebral blood volume, flow, and TTP at the expense of longer acquisition time, radiation dose and contrast agent dose <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]</sup>. MRA can identify the location and extent of occlusive thrombus and identify tandem lesions at the cervical level <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]</sup>. Yet, its outcomes are often compromised by the prolonged scanning times and other well-known safety issues exacerbated in the acutely unwell stroke patients. Although NIR fluorescence imaging suffers from limited penetration as compared to CT and MRI, it has been adopted for various surgical interventions, including vascular, gastrointestinal, cardiac, and reconstructive surgery <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]</sup>. The proposed method could potentially improve the quality of NIR fluorescence imaging and gain additional information for better perfusion assessment in stroke studies.</p><p id="P18">The ischemic penumbra has been in the center of stroke research for the last 40 years. The success for stroke therapy, including mechanical thrombectomy and/or intravenous thrombolysis, is based on a careful selection of patients that had salvageable penumbra. Therefore, stroke assessment studies might greatly benefit from a rapid and accurate tool for quantification of the ischemic penumbra. Despite major improvements in imaging methodology and instrumentation, it is widely accepted that the discrimination between penumbra and core regions is challenging with the existing imaging approaches. This is chiefly due to the considerable variability of CBF thresholds used for delineating these regions. For instance, the classical penumbra has been defined as a region of 20-40% of residual CBF <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]</sup>. However, other studies defined the penumbra as a region with 30-50% CBF decrease <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]</sup> whilst some studies even considered regions with blood flow up to 60-70% as the penumbra region <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]</sup>. In this work, BFI residuals of &lt;40 % and 40-60 % were considered for delineating the core and penumbra regions, respectively.</p><p id="P19">As an alternative to this hemodynamic concept, additional studies defined the penumbra as the tissue doomed to infarction in the absence of early reperfusion. Our data confirm that the penumbra detected with LMI can be saved from tissue necrosis with reperfusion, otherwise it turns necrotic over time and merges into the infarct core. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the clinical benefits of salvaging the penumbra in stroke patients <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]</sup>, underscoring the importance of imaging tools capable of predicting patient’s response to thrombolytic treatments. It has also been shown that patients with a favorable imaging-based profile have strong collaterals and moderate infarct progression <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]</sup>. The size of core and penumbra is underpinned by the collateral supply to the tissue. In line with these clinical data, we have shown that LMI can accurately predict the differences between infarcted areas in animals with rich and poor collaterals within the first minute after occlusion. Importantly, since our imaging system allows for transcranial imaging across the entire cortex, it was possible to perform multiparametric characterization of the pial vessels including perfusion dynamics and collaterals recruitment. Clinically, this information will aid in monitoring the role of pial collaterals in infarct development and recovery. Note that the effective imaging depth of LMI is limited by the ability to maintain a focused beam pattern as it propagates through turbid brain tissues, which typically corresponds to 0.5–1 mm usable depth range depending on the wavelength selection. The penetration depth can potentially be improved by performing imaging in the second near-infrared spectral window (NIR-II window, 1000-1700 nm), which benefits from reduced scattering, absorption, and negligible autofluorescence <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]</sup>. However, the currently available fluorescent contrast agents in the NIR-II window offer inferior performance in terms of fluorescence quantum-yield and biocompatibility as compared to their counterparts in the visible and NIR-I windows <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P20">Given that evoked neuronal activity from paw stimulation is linked to an increase in blood flow, we further tested whether a potential treatment approach based on sensory stimulation may enhance brain perfusion thus eliminating reperfusion deficits in the core and penumbra regions. It has been shown that sensory stimulation reduces the infarcted region both in the core and penumbra. Enhancing brain reperfusion with sensory stimulation is a particularly promising strategy for stroke treatment because it is non-invasive, nonpharmacological, rapid, and has no side effects. Peripheral sensory stimulation during the hyperacute phase of stroke was reported to significantly recover neural activity <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]</sup>. Likewise, sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation has been shown likely to improve functional outcome of acute ischemic stroke patients clinically <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]</sup>. Note that when the activated cortex is within a critical range of ischemia, somatosensory activation of peri-infarct cortex may aggravate the situation by increasing the supply-demand mismatch and triggering peri-infarct depolarizations <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]</sup>. In the current study, the S1HL region was carefully selected such that it is able to redirect blood flow from ACA to MCA, yet located far enough from the peri-infarct region. The stroke treatments with sensory stimulation were accordingly only performed with mice having rich collateral vascularization.</p><p id="P21">In summary, we present a high-speed fluorescence microscopy technique for transcranial stroke imaging in mice that allows to (1) confirm ischemic stroke diagnosis, (2) localize the site of vascular occlusion, (3) detect hemodynamic changes and perfusion deficit and (4) identify ischemic core and penumbra with high sensitivity. The method is unique in its ability of localizing brain perfusion changes and accurately assessing the ischemic penumbra. LMI can directly render images of diverse mouse models with local CBF variations. Overall, LMI is simple and cost-effective and may be used to improve our understanding of vascular responses under pathologic conditions, ultimately facilitating clinical diagnosis, monitoring and development of therapeutic interventions for cerebrovascular diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>LMI fluorescence microscopy system</title><p id="P22">The LMI fluorescence imaging method has been adapted from the originally reported system <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]</sup> to provide high spatial resolution and accelerated imaging performance. It is based on a beam-splitting grating and an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) synchronized with a high-speed camera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To generate the multifocal illumination, a CW laser at 660 nm (gem 660, Laser Quantum, UK) together with a 17×17 beamsplitting grating (DER243, Holoeye, Germany) were employed. The resulting mini-beam pattern was focused by a scan lens (CLS-SL, Thorlabs, USA) to form an illumination grid upon the mouse brain. After passing through the dichroic mirror, the emitted fluorescence signal was collected by an AF micro-Nikkor 60 mm objective (Nikon, Japan) and focused onto the sensor plane of the high-speed CMOS camera (pco.dimax S1, PCO AG, Germany) after passing through a 671 nm longpass filter (F76-671, Semrock, USA) behind the objective. By raster scanning the laser beam with the AOD (DTSXY-400-532, AA Opto-Electronic, France) at a high speed up to hundred kilohertz, high resolution LMI images can be acquired in real-time.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Animal models</title><p id="P23">Six BALB/c mice (8 to 9 week-old, Charles Rivers) and fourteen C57BL/6 mice (8 to 9 week-old, Charles Rivers) were used in this work.

In brief, mice were fixed in a stereotactic frame, the skin between the left eye and ear was incised and the temporal muscle was retracted. A small hole was drilled in the temporal bone to access the MCA while the skull was kept intact. To induce the formation of a clot, 1 μl of purified human alpha-thrombin (1UI; HCT-0020, Haematologic Technologies Inc., USA) was injected into the MCA with a glass pipette. The pipette was removed 10 min after thrombin injection. Ischemia induction was considered stable when cerebral blood flow (CBF) rapidly dropped to at least 50% of baseline level in the MCA territory by checking the LSCI images <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]</sup>.

Immediately after stroke, perfusion imaging with LSCI and LMI was performed. Mice in the intervention group received electrical hindpaw stimulation for 100 s (pulse duration 1 ms, repetition frequency 4Hz, pulse amplitude 1 mA) with a time interval of 10 min and a duration of 1 hour. Mice in the control group did not receive any stimulation while all other factors (e.g., air supply, heating, and physiological status monitoring) were kept the same as for the stimulated group. During the experiment, an oxygen/air mixture (0.2/0.8 L.min<sup>-1</sup>) was provided through a breathing mask. The body temperature was kept around 37 °C with a feedback-controlled heating pad.

The scalp was removed to reduce light scattering. To obtain the cerebral vascular network and the perfusion pattern post-stroke and pre-tPA treatment, each mouse was administrated the Sulfo-Cyanin-5.5-carboxylic-acid (Lumiprobe GmbH, Germany) fluorescent dye solution in PBS (50 μl, 2 mg/ml) through a tail-vein injection while recording with the LMI system, followed by LSCI measurement.

For LMI fluorescence microscopy, data were recorded right after fluorescence dye injection and lasted for 20 s. Each LMI image was acquired through 30×30 raster scan with the AOD at ˜11 μm step size, which corresponded to an effective frame rate of 80 Hz.

Hindpaw stimulation (600 μA, 4 Hz, 1 ms pulse duration, 16 pulses) was delivered to the right hindpaw using subcutaneous needle electrodes. Hemodynamic signal was measured by imaging reflected light intensity using a CCD camera (Pixelfly, PCO) coupled to a Leica MZ16FA microscope.

Quantification of blood flow information was performed based on pixel-wise fluorescence signal time course. BFI was defined as a slope of the rising fluorescence intensity signal plotted against time for 10 s after intravenous injection. The background fluorescence signal was removed resulting in the baseline signal starting from 0. The fluorescence signal profiles were normalized against the maximum intensity within each ROI time traces to compensate for any differences in actual injection dose. Linear fit was performed through the rising point and the first peak value in the time profile of each pixel, and its slope (in % s<sup>−1</sup>) was used to represent the BFI. TTP maps in the infarcted hemisphere were calculated as the time delay between the signal peak in each pixel with respect to the time point when the MCA became pronounced in the healthy hemisphere. The MTT maps, representing the average time of fluorescent dye perfusion in each pixel, were calculated by dividing cerebral blood volume (CBV) by BFI. CBV was calculated by the integration of fluorescence intensity over time between the wash-in and wash-out time point which were defined as the time corresponding to 10% of maximum intensity before the first peak and 40% of maximum intensity after the first peak, respectively. Quantitative flow velocity was calculated based on two points of interest in the same blood vessel as the distance between these two points divided by the latency time of their peak values in the corresponding signal time courses. Subsequently, CBV was calculated by multiplying the velocity with the respective cross-sectional area of the vessel segment. An illustration of this calculation can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>. PCA was also performed to check the dynamic contrast-enhanced images. An image stack lasting 5 s post-injection including 400 frames were loaded into MATLAB software and analyzed with the embedded “princomp” function to perform PCA. The positive values from the second component were assigned a red color to represent arterial vessels. The negative values from the third component were assigned a blue color to represent veins. To better extract skull vessels, PCA was performed on the image stack within a time window between 4 – 8s and the negative values from the second components were assigned a green color.</p><p id="P32">To assess the infarct core and penumbra regions, BFI ratio between the ipsilateral and the contralateral hemispheres was calculated pixel by pixel with a sliding window of 30×30 pixels. A residual of BFI lower than 40 % was set as the threshold for the core region and 40˜60 % was set for the penumbra. Subsequently, core and penumbra regions were selected as the ROIs for functional and structural statistics. Fluorescence intensity, BFI, TTP, MTT as well as LSCI intensity were calculated as the mean pixel value inside the ROI in the corresponding functional maps and then normalized based on the contralateral side. Lesion sizes of the core and penumbra were calculated as the planar area in the corresponding regions. Vessel fill fraction or density was calculated pre- and post- treatment from the core and penumbra in the LMI time-lapse images, which was characterized as the number of pixels occupied by the cerebral vessels divided by the total number of pixels in the ROI. Before vessel density estimation, a multiscale vessel enhancement was used to differentially boost signals from small versus large vessels to remove the non-vessel background.
