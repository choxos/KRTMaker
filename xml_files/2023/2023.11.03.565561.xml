In mice, the decision to escape from imminent threats is implemented by a feed-forward circuit in the midbrain, where excitatory VGluT2<sup>+</sup> neurons in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) compute escape initiation and escape vigour from threat evidence. Here we show that GABAergic VGAT<sup>+</sup> neurons in the dPAG dynamically control this process by modulating the excitability of excitatory escape neurons. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> patch-clamp and <italic>in vivo</italic> neural activity recordings in freely behaving mice we found that VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons fire action potentials tonically in the absence of synaptic inputs and are a major source of synaptic inhibition to VGluT2<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons. Activity in these spontaneously firing VGAT<sup>+</sup> cells transiently decreases at escape onset and increases during escape, peaking at escape termination. Optogenetically increasing or decreasing VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG activity bidirectionally changes the probability of escape when the stimulation is delivered at the time of threat onset, and the duration of escape when delivered after escape initiation. We conclude that the activity of tonically firing VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons sets a threshold for escape initiation and controls the execution of the flight locomotor action.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Escape behaviour is a set of locomotor actions that move an animal away from threat. While these actions can be reflexive and stereotyped to ensure short reaction times and fast movements, it is equally important for survival that they are flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). For example, the probability of initiating escape depends on predation risk and threat history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), as well as on the internal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). In environments where predators abound, it is more likely that ambiguous sensory stimuli might signal the presence of predators and thus the probability of initiating escape should increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Likewise, when faced with a competing motivation, such as hunger, the probability of defensive behaviour decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Beyond flexibility in escape initiation, it is equally important that the execution of escape is flexible. The flight to safety should not be ballistic (i.e., along a pre-determined trajectory with fixed kinetics) but instead should allow for continuous adjustments of vigour and trajectory to deal with variability in the terrain, adjust escape to unexpected events and terminate escape at the appropriate place and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Accordingly, recent work has shown that mice on a fast shelter-directed escape trajectory can slow down and navigate around an obstacle that suddenly appears, while maintaining the goal of reaching safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). This degree of flexibility in escape initiation and execution suggests the presence of modulatory components acting on the neural circuits controlling instinctive escape. In particular, the ability of decreasing the sensitivity to threat and slowing down locomotion during escape suggests the presence of a regulatory inhibitory network.</p><p id="P4">In mammals, the key circuit for commanding escape behaviour is the periaqueductal gray (PAG), located in the midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). The PAG is an interface between the forebrain and central pattern generators in the hindbrain and spinal cord that acts as a critical neural circuit node for integrating sensory and state-dependent information, as well as for executing instinctive behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). In the dorsal PAG (dPAG), excitatory VGluT2<sup>+</sup> neurons receive information about imminent visual and auditory threats from the superior colliculus through a feed-forward excitatory connection, and their activation determines the onset of escape and controls escape vigour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). While modulation of threat processing and escape behaviour can be accomplished through a variety of different circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), the network of excitatory neurons in the dPAG stands out as a key control node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Previous work has demonstrated the presence of an inhibitory tone in the PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>) that could in principle control the excitability of the excitatory network to modulate escape. For example, local application of a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist in the PAG elicits responses to a previously sub-threshold stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Disinhibition of the PAG has been suggested as a mechanism for initiating other instinctive behaviours, such as vocalisations and freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), with inhibitory long-range projections from forebrain regions inhibiting local GABAergic circuits within the PAG. Also, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> single-unit recordings from GABAergic neurons in the lateral and ventral PAG have shown that their baseline firing rates are higher than excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Here we have tested the hypothesis that local GABAergic neurons within the dPAG control escape behaviour by setting the excitability of the dPAG escape network.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>GABAergic neurons in dPAG fire tonically in the absence of synaptic input</title><p id="P5">To investigate how inhibitory neurons in the dPAG might control the excitability of the local excitatory neurons, we performed patch-clamp recordings from identified VGAT<sup>+</sup> and VGluT2<sup>+</sup> neurons in acute midbrain slices <italic>in vitro</italic>. While whole-cell recordings of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons showed biophysical and synaptic input properties similar to those of VGluT2<sup>+</sup> dPAG cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1</xref>, for comparison to VGluT2<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>)), recordings in loose-seal cell-attached configuration to monitor spiking non-invasively showed a marked difference between these two cell populations. VGAT<sup>+</sup> neurons fired action potentials spontaneously at a mean firing rate of 4.7 ± 0.70 Hz, which was not significantly altered after pharmacological block of glutamatergic and inhibitory synaptic transmission (mean firing rate = 6.2 ± 0.84 Hz; P = 0.21, Mann-Whitney test between control and blockers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S2</xref> for anatomical locations). Using inter-spike interval (ISI) analysis and a measure of variability based on the coefficient of variation (CV<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>), we found the firing of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons to be highly regular, as expected from a dominant cell intrinsic mechanism (CV<sub>2</sub> = 0.33 ± 0.03; Poisson firing statistics have a CV<sub>2</sub> of 1 and a perfectly regular neuron has a CV<sub>2</sub> of 0; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S3A, B</xref>). In contrast, the majority of VGluT2<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons were not spontaneously active both in control conditions (92.8 %, 39 out of 42 cells, firing rate &lt; 0.04 Hz; mean firing rate across all neurons = 0.11 ± 0.068 Hz) or after block of inhibitory synaptic transmission (mean firing rate in picrotoxin = 0.039 ± 0.033 Hz; P = 0.85, Mann-Whitney tests between control and picrotoxin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). These data show that VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons are well positioned to provide sustained inhibition to the local network through synaptic input-independent action potential firing.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>VGluT2<sup>+</sup> neurons in dPAG are phasically inhibited by local GABAergic neurons</title><p id="P6">To assess the impact of local tonically active GABAergic neurons on dPAG excitability, we performed whole-cell recordings from VGluT2<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> and first isolated spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) by blocking glutamatergic synaptic transmission. We found frequent phasic inhibition (mean IPSC frequency = 6.5 ± 0.83 Hz) that was selectively blocked by a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist (SR-95531: mean fraction = 0.13 ± 0.05; control: mean fraction = 1.17 ± 0.3, P = 0.002, Mann-Whitney test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Phasic inhibitory currents had a peak conductance of 0.94 ± 0.16 nS and a unitary IPSC charge of 0.28 ± 0.04 pC, generating a continuous average charge over time of 2.12 ± 0.68 pC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). These data show that VGluT2<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons receive sustained phasic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition with an inhibitory charge transfer that should in principle be large enough to regulate their input-output function <italic>in vivo</italic> (as e.g. shown for cerebellar granule cells that have a similarly high input resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>)).</p><p id="P7">Next, we tested the contribution of local VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons to inhibition of VGluT2<sup>+</sup> dPAG cells. We used a combined opto- and chemogenetic strategy to co-express an inhibitory DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs, hM4Di-mCherry) and channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2-YFP) in the dPAG of VGAT-Cre mice to selectively and bidirectionally change the activity of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons while recording inhibitory currents in excitatory dPAG cells. We first optogenetically activated VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons and found monosynaptic inhibitory inputs in 85 % of glutamatergic dPAG neurons (mean latency = 2.0 ± 0.15 ms), with a mean evoked IPSC amplitude of -62.58 ± 18.31 pA and a facilitating paired pulse ratio (1.17 ± 0.16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G, H</xref>). We then chemogenetically blocked synaptic transmission from VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons with Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO, 10 μM), which reduced the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs onto glutamatergic neurons by 70 % in comparison to control recordings (normalized change in spontaneous IPSC frequency for CNO: mean = 0.59 ± 0.14; control: mean = 1.29 ± 0.17; P = 0.01, unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1I, J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S3A</xref>). Application of CNO also significantly reduced the amplitude of ChR2-evoked IPSCs (normalized peak amplitude CNO = 0.39 ± 0.16; control = 1.35 ± 0.33; CNO vs. control: P = 0.042, unpaired t-test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S3C, D</xref>) further confirming the efficacy and specificity of our chemogenetic inhibition approach. It is important to note that since these experiments rely on small targeted injections and co-expression of two viral constructs within the same cells, our quantification of the contribution of local VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG to spontaneous inhibition is likely to be an underestimate. Together these data show that VGAT<sup>+</sup> neurons in the dPAG provide phasic and sustained monosynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition onto VGluT2<sup>+</sup> dPAG cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons are spontaneously active in vivo and modulated during escape behaviour</title><p id="P8">We next measured the activity of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> to determine whether they are a source of sustained inhibition as suggested by our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, and how their activity relates to escape behaviour. Given the characteristic firing profile of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons <italic>in vitro,</italic> we first performed chronic silicon probe recordings from the dPAG of freely moving mice to determine whether there are single units with similar activity. Analysis of firing rates for periods when mice were spontaneously exploring the behavioural arena revealed the existence of neurons with high baseline firing rates across the recorded population (9/19 neurons with mean firing rates above 8 Hz; mean frequency = 32.2 ± 7.0 Hz; N = 3 mice; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S3E–G</xref>). This is consistent with previous reports of high baseline firing rates of VGAT<sup>+</sup> neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> in other subdivisions of the PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), and with synaptic input driving neurons to higher firing rates than <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p id="P9">To directly record neural activity from molecularly-identified VGAT<sup>+</sup> neurons, we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons expressing GCaMP6s in freely moving mice using a head-mounted miniature microscope (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S4</xref>). In line with the <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-attached and <italic>in vivo</italic> single-unit recordings during exploration, we found that VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons were active while naïve animals freely explored the arena (median calcium event rate = 0.1 Hz, IQR = [0.090, 0.11 Hz], 209 neurons, N = 8 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S5A</xref>). To test whether this activity was correlated with the locomotor state of the animal, we calculated a locomotion modulation index for each neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>), and found that only a small fraction of cells was significantly modulated by movement (4.5 % of cells positively, 4.5 % of cells negatively modulated; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S5B</xref>). Together with the previous results, these data consolidate the view that VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons provide a sustained inhibitory tone on the dPAG network.</p><p id="P10">To understand how local VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG activity might contribute to threat-evoked escape, we presented threatening overhead looming or ultrasound stimuli in the presence of a shelter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). During stimulus-evoked escape to shelter, more than half of all active cells showed escape-related activity (median across mice = 54%, IQR = [46%, 76%], 123 neurons, N = 8 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D</xref>, S5C–F). To compare the activity profiles of neurons across trials, where the escape sequence is stereotyped but has a variable duration, we linearly time warped each neuron’s activity to the median time-series of discrete events in the escape sequence to generate an average over trials (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). Across the recorded population, the neuronal activity profiles were best described by two clusters identified by K-means clustering using scores from principal component analysis on the pooled mean time-warped responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S5D</xref>). Neurons belonging to both clusters were present in all animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S5E, F</xref>): the first cluster showed a gradual increase in activity from threat stimulus onset, peaking at escape termination (mean z-score between startle and escape stop = 0.69 ± 0.05 Z, n = 74 neurons, vs 0.06 ± 0.07 Z for same period in trials where stimulus failed to elicit escape, n = 41 neurons; two-tailed t-test, P = 1.1 x 10<sup>-11</sup>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E-G</xref>); whereas the second cluster exhibited a transient decrease in activity with the trough coinciding with escape onset (mean z-score between startle and escape stop -0.43 ± 0.06 Z, n = 49 neurons, vs -0.13 ± 0.09 Z for same period in trials where animals failed to escape, n = 37 neurons; P = 0.006; 100 trials, N = 8 mice; 2E–H). To further test whether the activity of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons was specifically modulated during escape, we compared activity profiles between fast spontaneous runs outside the threat stimulus context with slow escapes, where the average locomotor speed was lower than the spontaneous runs. We found that VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG activity did not change during exploratory runs (<italic>cluster 1, runs during exploration</italic>, mean signal -0.12 ± 0.12 Z and -0.2 ± 0.13 Z in the 2 s before and after run onset respectively, two-tailed paired t-test, P = 0.66; n = 21 neurons, 66 trials, N = 4 mice) but changed significantly during slow escapes (<italic>cluster 1, slow escapes</italic>, mean signal -0.18 ± 0.20 Z before and +0.39 ± 0.17 Z after, two-tailed paired t-test, P = 0.047, n = 18 neurons, 15 trials, N = 4 mice; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S5G, H</xref>). In addition, cluster population activity was not correlated to the peak speed, acceleration or deceleration of the escape movement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S6</xref>). Together this indicates that in the behavioural context tested, changes in the activity of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons are highly specific for the escape action. These results suggest that VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons contribute to escape initiation by decreasing their activity in response to threat, thereby releasing the excitatory dPAG neurons from inhibition and facilitating their recruitment to initiate escape. In addition, the gradual increase in activity during escape indicates that VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons might also participate in shutting down the excitatory drive in the dPAG network to terminate the escape movement.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Activity manipulations of VGAT<sup>+</sup> neurons bidirectionally modulate escape initiation and termination</title><p id="P11">The neural activity profiles of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons recorded <italic>in vivo</italic> predict that: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) manipulating their activity at the time of threat presentation should bidirectionally affect escape initiation, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) modulating activity during the escape action should perturb the duration of the escape action. We tested these predictions using bilateral, optogenetic manipulations of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons during instinctive escape (activation with ChR2 and inactivation with iChloC, a chloride-conducting ChR; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7A–C</xref>). First, we tested the effect of activity manipulations on escape initiation. Optogenetic activation of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons at the time of threat presentation strongly reduced escape probability (mean escape probability = 0.88 ± 0.04 for threat only vs. 0.13 ± 0.05 for threat with laser on, P = 0.0005, paired two-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, C</xref>), but had no effect when it preceded the threat stimulus (end of the laser pulse train coincident with threat stimulus onset; mean escape probability = 0.92 ± 0.08 for threat with laser preceding stimulus onset vs. threat only, P = 0.44, Mann Whitney test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7F</xref>). Conversely, optogenetic inhibition of VGAT<sup>+</sup> neurons during presentation of a weakly-threatening, low contrast stimulus, increased escape probability significantly (mean escape probability = 0.28 ± 0.06 for threat only, 0.78 ± 0.1 for threat with laser on; P = 0.0014, paired two-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B, D</xref>). These results confirm that activity of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons plays an important role in setting the escape threshold.</p><p id="P12">We next tested the role of VGAT<sup>+</sup> neurons in escape execution. Optogenetic stimulation of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons with ChR2 after escape initiation often led to premature termination of escape, with the animal stopping before reaching the shelter (normalized mean escape termination distance from shelter, laser off = -0.10 ± 0.01, laser on = 0.09 ± 0.01; P &lt; 0.001, paired two-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Inactivation of VGAT<sup>+</sup> neurons during escape had the opposite effect, with animals frequently overshooting their preferred target location of the arena shelter, resulting in a significant increase in total escape distance (laser off = 49.9 ± 4.6 cm, laser on = 69.4 ± 4.8 cm, P = 0.0097, unpaired t-test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S8</xref>). Importantly, neither manipulation affected the mean speed during baseline exploratory locomotion (ChR2: P = 0.41, iChloc: P = 0.88; two-tailed paired t-tests; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7D–H</xref>). These data show that the firing rate of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons is a key variable that controls the execution of escape behaviour.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">We have described a population of GABAergic neurons in the dPAG that tonically fire action potentials and provide monosynaptic inhibition to dPAG excitatory neurons through activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. In contrast with the sparse connectivity between VGluT2<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), we find that these glutamatergic neurons receive input from local GABAergic dPAG neurons with a high connectivity rate, resulting in frequent inhibitory synaptic events that generate a sustained barrage of inhibition. The presence and role of a tonic inhibitory mechanism in the PAG was postulated decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) and recent work has described both long-range and local disinhibitory motifs as a main element of instinctive behaviour initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). Our results add to the emerging view that sustained inhibition is a key property inherent to the functional architecture of the PAG and demonstrate its role in instinctive escape behaviour.</p><p id="P14">Our neural activity recordings from freely behaving mice show that VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG are active as animals explore the environment, and that approximately half of the recorded population shows a transient decrease in activity before escape onset. We think that this could serve to disinhibit the VGluT2<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons that drive escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>) and facilitate escape initiation. This view is strongly supported by the optogenetic silencing experiments, in which inhibition of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons increased escape probability. Together with the finding that optogenetic activation of the same neuron population can decrease escape probability, these results show that VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons are a key node for determining the escape initiation threshold, in addition to the synaptic properties between the threat input circuits and the dPAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). The existence of a sustained source of inhibition in the dPAG might be important for dampening the excitability of the excitatory neurons and prevent initiation of escape behaviour in the absence of threat input, while also providing a means for fast, bidirectional modulation of escape. It will be interesting in the future to determine whether changes to the baseline firing of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons are a mechanism to support plastic changes to the escape threshold, such as during learned suppression of escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). It will also be important to establish whether the function of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons in escape is exclusively mediated by intra-PAG inhibition or whether they also directly modulate other targets, such as the cuneiform nucleus of the mesencephalic locomotor region, which has been previously reported to play a role in defensive behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>).</p><p id="P15">In addition to setting a threshold for initiating escape behaviour, our results suggest that VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons are also important for the ongoing execution of escape, in particular for terminating the flight action. A large fraction of this population shows a gradual increase in activity between escape onset and escape termination at the shelter, and optogenetically increasing or decreasing their activity can cause animals to undershoot or overshoot their target, respectively. Given the known role of glutamatergic dPAG neurons in locomotor initiation and speed control during escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>), these data can be interpreted as VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons acting to shut down firing in the excitatory neurons that drive escape. These results are in line with the previous finding that VGAT<sup>+</sup> neurons in the lateral PAG have a role in both the initiation and execution phases of hunting behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). An important unanswered question is whether there are distinct subsets of VGAT<sup>+</sup> dPAG neurons, one for controlling initiation and the other for execution. Our analysis identified two broad clusters based on the activity profile during escape, which may arise if there are groups of VGAT<sup>+</sup> neurons integrating different input pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). It will be interesting to determine if such input segregation exists. The observation that we were able to change both escape initiation and execution by manipulating activity of the entire population is consistent with the main output of the two clusters being glutamatergic dPAG neurons, with the timing of VGAT<sup>+</sup> neuron activation being the main determinant of the effect on escape behaviour.</p><p id="P16">While the activity of glutamatergic dPAG neurons is positively correlated to escape speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), we found that the population activity of GABAergic neurons is not significantly modulated by speed but instead peaks at escape termination. This observation supports a general framework for locomotor-correlated activity in brainstem regions, where glutamatergic neurons are the key population for regulating speed and are under the control of local inhibitory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). The finding that GABAergic cells in the dPAG mediate the termination of escape behaviour further adds to the view that the dPAG is an integral part of the supraspinal circuits for the coordination of goal-directed locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Studies of escape behaviour in the wild have highlighted how flexible the flight action must be since animals often engage in a complex series of stop-and-go events while computing and executing escape trajectories directed to safe locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>).

The hair on the forehead was shaved using a trimmer (Contura, Wella), and the skin disinfected. Isoflurane (0.5–1.5 % in oxygen, 1 L/min) was used to maintain anaesthesia. The skin was then cut to expose the skull, and a large craniotomy was made using a hand-held dental drill using a 0.5 or 0.7 mm stainless steel burr (Fine Science Tools) to expose an area between the confluence of transverse and sagittal sinus, and the anatomical border between the superior and inferior colliculi (AP from lambda: +0.1 to -1.0 mm; ML: ± 0.6 mm). A durotomy was performed using a 30G hypodermic needle. The connective tissue covering the confluence of sagittal and transverse sinus was gently pulled forward anteriorly using fine forceps to reveal the underlying superior colliculi. Viral vectors were delivered using a pulled cut glass pipette (10μl Wiretrol II with a Sutter P-1000) that was mounted on a stereotaxic injector (Janelia Research Campus, Ronal Tool Company) coupled to an oil hydraulic micromanipulator (MO-10, Narishige) on a stereotaxic frame (Model 963, Kopf Instruments), at ~20 nl/min. After injection, the needle was kept at the site of injection for 10–20 min, before being retracted. Fibre optic and GRIN lens cannula implants were first slowly lowered to 50 μm beyond their final location, and then retracted. For lens cannula implants, a single 400 μm diameter fibre optic with a 60° conical tip was pre-inserted at the desired location and withdrawn, to allow for easier successive insertion of the 500 μm lens implant. The craniotomy was covered with a silicone sealant (Kwik-Cast, WPI) before implants were secured using light-cured dental cement (RelyX Unicem 2, 3M). The skin wound was glued (Vetbond, 3M) or sutured (6-0, Vicryl Rapide).

The input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>) was calculated from the steady-state voltage measured in response to a hyperpolarising test pulse (-40 pA, 500 ms duration) at holding potential of -60 mV. The membrane time constant was calculated by fitting a single exponential to the decay of the test pulse (y = y0 + Ae<sup>(-(x-x0)/τ)</sup>). The mean action potential firing frequency of VGAT neurons in response to current injection of increasing strengths (20–140 pA, 20 pA increments) was calculated from two consecutive repetitions per cell. Spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) onto glutamatergic dPAG neurons were detected using a threshold algorithm, and their frequency and peak amplitude were analysed from a continuous 30 s time window every 1 min or continuously and binned by minute. The peak phasic conductance was calculated from the cell’s mean peak current amplitude divided by the holding potential (G = I / V<sub>hold</sub>). The mean unitary charge was calculated from the average spontaneous IPSC for each cell, integrating the area over a 50 ms window from IPSC onset. The average charge was estimated by multiplying the unitary charge by the frequency of events for that cell.

Pharmacological effects of each drug were statistically assessed in comparison to time-matched controls (see above). Mean peak amplitudes of evoked postsynaptic currents were calculated from averages of a minimum of 5 sweeps both for baseline and drug conditions (where applicable). The paired pulse ratio of a synaptic input was calculated by dividing the mean peak amplitude of the second pulse by the first pulse.

Laser intensities were calibrated during exploratory movement to ensure no escape-like movements were elicited with too high laser power. To test for a bidirectional behavioural effect of VGAT neuron activation and inhibition, two separate behavioural paradigms were used to adjust the initial escape probability by changing the intensity of the visual (contrast) and auditory (dB) stimuli. Since we predicted that escape probability would decrease with VGAT neuron activation, we adjusted the sensory stimuli for each mouse during this experimental set to yield a high escape probability of ~ 80%. Conversely, predicting an increase of escape probability with VGAT neuron inactivation, we used low intensity stimuli to achieve a baseline escape probability of ~ 20–40%. To test the effect of optogenetic activation of VGAT neurons on escape termination, the laser was triggered manually immediately after the onset of stimulus-evoked escape runs. To test whether in-activation of VGAT neurons causes an increase in the escape distance, we moved the shelter away from the end wall into the middle of the arena. The shelter is open front and back to allow animals to pass through. The animals were allowed to explore the new shelter location, before a sensory stimulus was delivered to elicit escape.

A 500 μm diameter GRIN lens imaging cannula (Model L, Doric Lenses Inc.) with an 80 μm working distance was slowly inserted, with the final tip position ~100 μm above the centre of the viral injection site. At least 19 days after surgery, the microscope was attached to the snap-in cannula implant on the mouse’s head without anaesthesia and the mouse placed in the behavioural arena. Behavioural recordings were performed only after ensuring a clear field-of-view (FOV) was present (mean first session = 35.1 ± 5.3 days, mean last session = 62.2 ± 9.3 days after surgery; range = 19–104 days, N = 8 mice). Data were acquired with a resolution of 630 × 630 pixels at 10–20 Hz, with an excitation power of 150–300 μW and with a gain of 1 or 2. Sensory stimulation was delivered as described above.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="P35">Fluorescence movies were down-sampled from 630 × 630 to 126 × 126 pixels and then flat-field corrected. To obtain an estimate of the movie’s flat-field, we calculated the average intensity across time and applied a gaussian blur to the resulting image. The flat-field was centred around zero by subtracting its mean and this image was then subtracted from all frames of the movie. The movies were cropped to remove vignetting at the edges of the recorded FOV. The open-source analysis pipeline CaImAn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>) was used for motion correction and component extraction and curation. Briefly, movies were motion corrected using the NoRMCorre algorithm that corrects non-rigid motion artifacts, and source extraction was performed using constrained non-negative matrix factorization to extract components with overlapping spatial footprints. The extracted components were manually curated (merged, rejected or added) after visual inspection and the components’ spatial shapes saved as cell masks. These masks were used to extract the background-subtracted (rolling-ball, 10px radius) raw fluorescence signal over time from the motion-corrected videos, and linearly interpolated to 30 Hz to match the behaviour camera frame-rate. Imaging sessions were almost always intermittent (mean 16 days between sessions with 1–3 sessions per 8 animals, range 1–72 days, one animal with three consecutive days), and precluding FOV registration between imaging sessions and repeated cell identification. Each FOV was therefore treated as an independent sample. Delta F/F and Z-scored activity was used as the basis of all further analysis. Traces with a Z-score above 1.96 at any time during the recording session were considered active neurons.</p><p id="P36">To analyse VGAT<sup>+</sup> neuron activity in the freely-moving animal in the absence of threat, single neuron activity traces acquired during the baseline period of each session (before the first threat stimulus, mean duration 548 s, range 339–1046 s, n = 209 neurons, from 17 sessions in 8 animals) were Z-scored and Savitzky-Golay filtered (2 s window, polyorder = 2, <italic>scipy</italic>). Events were then detected using the <italic>scipy.find_peaks</italic> function (prominence = 0.3) to calculate the mean event rate per mouse. Neurons were further sorted by whether they were active during escape or not (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">methods</xref> below), and whether events were coincident with animal movement, defined as the centre-of-mass of the animal exceeding 2 cm/s. For quantifying locomotion, movement periods were defined by timepoints when the animal’s speed was greater than 1.5 cm/s and stationary periods as less than 1.5 cm/s while the animal was outside the shelter in the arena, in the baseline period before the first threat stimulus. A locomotion modulation index (LMI) and significance tests were calculated after Henschke et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). The LMI was defined as the difference between the mean F/F<sub>0</sub> during locomotion (R<sub>L</sub>) and stationary (R<sub>s</sub>) periods, normalized by the sum, for each neuron as LMI = (R<sub>L</sub> – R<sub>s</sub>)/(R<sub>L</sub> + R<sub>s</sub>). To determine significance for the modulation indices, bootstrapping with replacement was used to estimate the error for each neuron. The data was binned into 1 s periods of continuous locomotion or stationary periods. The mean ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was taken for each bin and regarded as a single sample. The average correlation between consecutive samples was found to be R = 0.57. We then randomly selected a reduced number of samples (43% = 1-R, to reflect the fact that samples are not completely independent) of ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> with replacement from the original set of samples, repeating this 1000 times to obtain 95% confidence intervals for individual significance tests for each neuron. If a neuron’s 95% confidence interval was significantly different from an LMI of 0 and its absolute LMI value exceeded 0.2, indicating &gt;50% change in F/F<sub>0</sub> between locomotion and stationary states, it was considered significantly locomotion responsive.</p><p id="P37">To identify neurons active during escape trials, Z-scored activity traces were first baselined by subtracting the mean value of 500 ms preceding stimulus onset. For each neuron, the distribution of activity slopes for each trial event (linear regression to a 660 ms window of activity starting at the following event onsets: <italic>stimulus, first stimulus-reaction response, escape turn, escape run, shelter entry, escape stop</italic>) over all trials in a session, was compared to the distribution of activity slopes in the 660 ms baseline periods preceding stimulus onset (two-tailed t-test with Bonferroni correction, P = 0.05) to determine whether there was a statistically significant change in signal for any event in the stimulus-escape sequence for that neuron, followed by a manual inspection and curation. 39 neurons showed a motion artefact (sharp symmetrical downward deflection) as the microscope cables contacted the roof of the shelter during escape running, which was removed by cubic interpolation 500 ms either side of the artefact trough. To compare neural activity across all escape-to-shelter trials and all animals, where the sequence of behavioural events is stereotyped but inter-event intervals are variable, the median inter-event intervals for each behavioural event relative to stimulus onset was calculated and the median of these distributions was used to construct a template with a 2 s window added after escape-end. Z-scored calcium traces were then linearly interpolated to the template and the mean calcium trace calculated for each escape-active neuron (n = 123) for escape trials and fail-to-escape trials. As experiments were acquired at 10–20 Hz, all traces were identically low-pass FFT filtered to remove high-frequencies that were present in a subset of sessions. To cluster neurons by their activity profile, the mean calcium over time traces of all neurons (escape trails only) were first ternarized by double thresholding of activity (y &lt; -0.2 Z = -1, y &gt; 0.2 Z = 1, otherwise y = 0), transformed by principal component analysis, then K-means clustering was performed on the first 3 principal components (cumulatively explaining 86% of the dataset before thresholding into ternary traces) using n = 2 clusters, indicated as optimal by silhouette scores and elbow method. The timing of calcium activity relative to escape end was calculated using the time of peak or trough activity over the time warped mean trace for each neuron.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Histological quantification of virus expression and fibre location</title><p id="P38">For <italic>in vitro</italic> electrophysiological recordings, the expression of virus was visually confirmed for each slice using 490 nm or 568 nm LED illumination (for green and red fluorescent proteins, respectively) prior to experimentation on the upright microscope. Slices from animals with clear infection of the deeper layers of the superior colliculus were discarded. For histological confirmation of fibre placement and injections site of <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging and optogenetic experiments, mice were anaesthetized with pentobarbital (400–800 mg/kg, final volume: 0.1 ml per 10 g, diluted 1:1 in sterile 0.9 % NaCl solution) and decapitated. To remove optic fibres and GRIN lenses without damage to the brain, the dorsal skull was cut in a circle around the cemented fibres and was carefully removed together with the fibres. Brains were then extracted from the base of the skull and fixed in 0.1 M PBS containing 4% PFA overnight at 4° C. Slices of 100 μm thickness were cut in 0.1 M PBS on a HM650V vibratome (Microm), mounted using SlowFade Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (ThermoFisher) and imaged on a wide-field fluorescence microscope (AxioImager, Zeiss). The placement of optic fibres and GRIN lenses was assessed based on their tract and tip location. Tip locations are illustrated in the respective sections of the Paxinos mouse brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figures S4 and S7</xref>). The expression of viruses was visually confirmed. For AAV2/2-DIO-ChR2 injections, only animals with expression localised to the dPAG were used. Animals with expression in the deeper layers of the SC were excluded. For AAV-DIO-iChloC injections (AAV2/1 or AAV2/9), experiments were included based on fibre tip location in the dPAG. Animals with tip locations outside the caudal dPAG (&lt; -4.6 mm or &gt; -5 mm from bregma) or tip locations not aligned with the virus injection were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Chronic silicon probe recordings <italic>in vivo</italic></title><sec id="S32"><title>Surgery</title><p id="P39">Mice were anaesthetised in an isofluorane induction chamber (3–4 % isofluorane, 1 L/min) before being transferred to a nose cone (2 % isofluorane, 1 L/min). Surgical procedures were performed under anaesthesia using isofluorane (1.5–2 %, 1 L/min). Protective gel was applied to the eyes (Puralube Vet Ointment), analgesia was given subcutaneously (Metacam 25 μl/10g) and the temperature was maintained at 36° Celsius using a heating pad and temperature probe. The mouse was then secured on a stereotaxic frame (Angle Two, Leica Biosystems. After incision, the skull was roughened and a small craniotomy was made away from the site of implantation and a ground pin inserted. Next a ~1 mm diameter craniotomy was made behind lambda using a dental drill (Osada Electric, Japan) to expose the transverse sinus. Connective tissue and dura were removed and the vessel pushed forwards. A silicon probe (4-shank Neuropixels 2.0, IMEC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>), coated with DiI (Invitrogen), was slowly inserted at a 30° angle, ~1 μm / s for 3 mm using a micromanipulator (Luigs and Neumann). Once in place, the probe was attached to the skull using UV-curing dental cement (RelyX Unicem 2 Automix, 3M), reinforced with dental cement (Super Bond C&amp;B, Sun Medical). The ground was then connected to the pin and the implant reinforced with dental cement. A protective casing was attached and cemented in place using UV-curing cement. Following surgery, the mouse was returned to its home cage to recover on a heat pad. Following recovery, the mouse was briefly anaesthetised and the headstage connected and fixed in place.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Data acquisition and visual stimulation</title><p id="P40">We used the same behavioural arena and testing protocols as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Briefly, each mouse was transferred in their home cage to the experimental room and given at least 5 min to acclimatise to the room under low light conditions, before being temporarily anesthetised to connect the Neuropixels interface cable to the headstage. A rotary joint was used to allow cable de-rotation during recording (AHRJ-OE_1x1_PT__FC_24, Doric Lenses). Mice were allowed to explore their home cage to acclimatise to the attachment and recover from anaesthesia, before being transferred to the behavioural arena (red Perspex with a white opaque floor, L:50 cm × W:20 cm × H:28 cm) with a red dome (10 cm diameter) or rectangular shelter (10 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm, both red Perspex). For chronic silicon probe recordings, data were acquired at 30 kHz using Neuropixels probes connected to a PXIe-1000 card (IMEC) housed in a PCIe-1071 chassis together with a PXIe-8398 remote control module connected to a PCIe-8398 host interface card (National Instruments).

Right: example traces of spontaneous calcium activity (Z-scored) of the indicated cell masks during baseline exploration. The speed of the animal is indicated in yellow and time windows of locomotor activity are shaded in light yellow. <bold>C.</bold> Summary of the mean spontaneous event frequency per animal. <bold>D.</bold> Fraction of cells active during escape. <bold>E.</bold> Heatmaps of the Z-scored calcium signal of all recorded neurons (mean calcium signal across trials) where each trial is time warped to the median temporal sequence of behavioural events of the cohort. Neurons are clustered on their activity from startle until escape stop (cluster 1, n = 74 neurons, left; cluster 2, n = 49 neurons, right; N = 8 mice). <bold>F.</bold> Activity of two example cell for cluster 1 (left) and cluster 2 (right) for 4 trials of the same recording session (rows). Calcium signal is coloured by Z-score and the animal’s distance from the shelter over time is shown in red. Markers show the onsets of the stimulus and behavioural events. All traces are aligned to stimulus onset without time warping. <bold>G.</bold> Left: average time warped signal of all cluster 1 neurons for trials where animals escaped (orange) and failed to escape (grey) to threat.
