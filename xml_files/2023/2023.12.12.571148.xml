Permanent growth arrest is a potent cell-intrinsic tumor suppression mechanism comparable to apoptosis, whereas SASP mediates crosstalk with the microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. It has become increasingly clear that senescence phenotypes, particularly <italic>in vivo</italic>, are highly heterogeneous depending on the initial stimuli, affected cell type, and spatiotemporal context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Senescent cells can arise at every stage of life and positively contribute to embryonic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, tissue repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and tumor suppression in a temporary manner.

Thus, this tissue provides one of the most powerful systems to investigate how distinct tissue-resident stem/progenitor cell populations orchestrate both intrinsic and extrinsic regulators during tissue regeneration, aging, and pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Notably, muscle stem cells (MuSCs), which are indispensable for muscle regeneration, become senescent during aging, which largely accounts for their functional decline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Importantly, ablation of senescent cells or suppression of senescence induction has been shown to improve muscle regeneration in old mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Interestingly, muscle injury induces an acute senescence response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and we previously demonstrated that senescence promotes cellular plasticity during reprogramming in muscle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.

Using the <italic>Cdkn1a<sup>-/-</sup>;Cdkn2a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model, we found that blunt senescence induction was associated with delayed muscle regeneration. Through single-cell transcriptomic profiling, we found that fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are a major senescent cell type in regenerating muscles. Notably, senescent FAPs upregulate Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) to acquire resistance to apoptosis. Furthermore, the pharmacological inhibition of Mcl-1 eliminates senescent FAPs and delays muscle regeneration. Hence, these findings indicate that senescent stromal cells promote muscle regeneration by creating a pro-regenerative niche to support myogenic functions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Muscle injury induces a transient senescence response</title><p id="P5">We first determined the dynamics of senescence induction during the muscle regeneration. The <italic>Tibialis Anterior</italic> (TA) muscles from mice of 8-12 weeks old were injured using cardiotoxin (CTX) and collected on different days post-injury (DPI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We co-stained the muscle sections with SAβGal and F4/80, a pan-macrophage marker, to distinguish macrophages from other cell types. SAβGal signal was first detected at 3DPI, peak at 5DPI, and became non-detectable after 14DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Of note, most SAβGal+ cells were positive for F4/80 at 3DPI and 5DPI, while SAβGal<sup>+</sup>/F4/80<sup>−</sup> cells became more apparent at 10DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Next, we used C<sub>12</sub>FDG, a fluorogenic substrate for β-galactosidase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, in combination with the macrophage marker CD64 to quantify and isolate cells via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with immunohistochemical staining, a non-macrophage C<sub>12</sub>FDG<sup>+</sup> population emerged at 5DPI and persisted till 10DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D and 1D</xref>’).</p><p id="P6">Given that macrophages exhibit increased lysosomal activity independent of senescence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, we determined whether C<sub>12</sub>FDG+ macrophages are senescent in our system. Firstly, most C<sub>12</sub>FDG+ macrophages at 5DPI were Ly6C<sup>low</sup>, a marker associated with the pro-regenerative phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). Secondly, we observed an increase mRNA expression of Glb1 and Cdkn1a, but a reduction mRNA expression of Cdkn2a, in C12FDG+ vs. C12FDG- acrophage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>). Thirdly, loss of LaminB1 expression is a marker associated with senescence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, and there was a significant reduction of LaminB1 intensity in the non-macrophage C<sub>12</sub>FDG+ cells, while no difference was observed within macrophage subpopulations regardless of C<sub>12</sub>FDG intensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1F and 1G</xref>). Finally, we isolated both C<sub>12</sub>FDG+ and C<sub>12</sub>FDG- macrophages and cultured them with M-CSF to stimulate survival and proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, there was a comparable percentage of EdU+ cells in both populations, indicating that C<sub>12</sub>FDG+ macrophages retained their proliferative capacity, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, upon mitogenic stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that C12FDG positivity might reflect a feature of macrophages independent of senescence, consistent with the report that elevated β-galactosidase activity is associated with polarized macrophage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, in the current study, we focused on the non-macrophage populations.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Delayed muscle regeneration correlates with senescence reduction in Cdkn1a<sup>-/-</sup>; Cdkn2a<sup>-/-</sup> mice</title><p id="P7">Next, we explored the functional impact of senescence during muscle regeneration using mouse models lacking p16 and/or p21 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). p21 and p16 can act redundantly in mediating senescence induction in certain <italic>in vivo</italic> contexts, such as wound healing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and tumour suppression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Therefore, we compared the senescence levels in the regenerating muscles of <italic>Cdkn1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, and <italic>Cdkn1a<sup>-/-</sup>/Cdkn2a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (DKO) mice with WT. Interestingly, we found a significant reduction in SAβGal+ cells in <italic>Cdkn1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and DKO mice, but not in <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, compared to WT at 10DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, DKO exhibited a consistent reduction of SAβGal+ cells at earlier time points of 5 &amp; 7DPI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>).

Notably, there was a slight yet significant reduction in p57 expression, but no difference in p27, and a marked increase in p15 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>), indicating potential compensatory mechanisms with other cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) in DKO.</p><p id="P8">We next evaluated the muscle regeneration capacity of mutant mice. Embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMyHC) is a specific marker of immature fibers that is exclusively expressed in newly regenerating myofibers, indicating early muscle regeneration. At 10DPI, WT samples contained a limited number of eMyHC+ fibers. Interestingly, there was more eMyHC+ fibers in the DKO compare to the other samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Besides, we observed a trend of increased eMyHC+ fibers in the Cdkn1a<sup>-/-</sup> but not in the Cdkn2a<sup>-/-</sup> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Of note, delayed muscle regeneration has been reported in the Cdkn1a<sup>-/-</sup> mice previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, myofiber growth, measured by the cross-sectional area (CSA), was greatly retarded in the DKO compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C &amp; 2D</xref>). Moreover, there was increased expression of the immature fiber marker, Myh8, and decreased expression of the mature fiber marker, MyoZ1, in DKO muscle extracts compared to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>). Notably, there was no difference in the number of Pax7+ MuSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2E</xref>) between WT and DKO at 10DPI. Finally, there was no difference in fiber size between DKO and WT at 21DPI, when the muscle was fully regenerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D &amp; 2E</xref>). Taken together, we concluded that muscle regeneration was delayed in DKO mice compared to WT mice, highlighting a correlation between reduced senescence and delayed muscle regeneration in mice lacking both Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a loci.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Transcriptomic analysis of the senescence program during muscle regeneration</title><p id="P9">To determine the causal role of senescence in muscle regeneration and better understand the senescence program <italic>in vivo</italic>, we characterize the senescence program during muscle regeneration using both bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We focused on 10DPI, a later time point during muscle regeneration, based on two considerations: 1/SAβGal+ cells are readily detectable at 10DPI; 2/ minimized non-senescence-specific staining of C12FDG. For bulk RNA-seq, we compared the transcriptomes of two populations, C12FDG+ &amp; F4/80-(S2) <italic>vs.</italic> C12FDG-(S1). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a clear separation between S1 and S2, indicating distinct biological properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Volcano plot analysis identified 1164 genes with significant differential expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), using a recently established gene set that identifies senescent cells across tissues (SenMayo_Mouse)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, showed significant enrichment of senescence-associated genes in S2 compared to S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). A heatmap was generated containing a collection of senescence-associated genes that were found to be significantly upregulated in S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, GSEA using the hallmark gene sets revealed that several pathways that are frequently associated with senescence, including coagulation, protein secretion, and inflammatory response, were significantly enriched in S2 compared to S1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To determine the senescent cells’ transcriptional heterogeneity during muscle regeneration, we performed scRNA-seq on two populations: pooled C12FDG- (S1) and C12FDG+; F4/80+ (S0) populations (refereeing as new S1), and C12FDG+; F4/80- (S2), to enrich non-macrophage C12FDG+ cells while retaining the C12FDG+; F4/80+ population. After quality control and data filtration, we obtained 1077 cells from S1 and 3174 cells from S2 for subsequent analysis. Eleven clusters were identified by cluster analysis and visualized using the uniform manifold approximation and project (UMAP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). All the cell types described in the regenerating muscle were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We also identified sub-cluster 9, which was positive for several proliferation markers. However, owing to the low cell number, we were unable to determine its identity.</p><p id="P11">We checked the distribution of S1 and S2 populations across cell types. The S2 population contained most of the clusters, except T (cluster 8) cells, and macrophages were exclusively detected in S1 due to arbitrary redistribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3E</xref>). Notably, FAPs, tenocytes, and fibroblasts were more enriched in S2 than in S1 (&gt; 10 folds, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>’, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3E</xref>). Next, we examined the expression of p16 and p21 in the scRNA-seq dataset. Consistent with a previous report <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, we found that p16 was only detected in very few FAPs and muscle stem cells (MuSCs), whereas p21 was evident in most cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Notably, we observed a substantial increase in the number of cells expressing higher levels of p21 in S2 than in S1 in multiple cell types, including FAPs, fibroblasts, tenocytes, MuSCs, and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), which correlated with the elevated expression levels of other senescence-associated genes, such as IL-6 and Pai1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Taken together, both bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets indicate that multiple cell types acquire senescence-like features during muscle regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>FAPs is a major senescent cell type in regenerating muscle</title><p id="P12">To understand the direct impact of senescence on muscle regeneration, we focused on FAPs, which are the dominant cell type in S2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3E</xref>). scRNA-seq analysis indicated that FAPs from S2 upregulated the expression of various senescence-associated genes compared with FAPs from S1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). To validate the scRNA-seq results, we examined various senescence markers using freshly isolated FAPs from PDGFRa-H2B::eGFP reporter mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Given that the number of FAPs peaks around 3-4DPI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and the C<sub>12</sub>FDG+/F4/80- population peaks around 5DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), we isolated FAPs from TAs of both non-injured (NI) and 5DPI. After 24 hours of culturing <italic>in vitro</italic>, FAPs were stained with several markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Compared to the NI control, the 5DPI FAPs exhibited an increase in SAβGal+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and γH2AX+ cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4D</xref>), and a decrease in LaminB1+ and BrdU+ cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4B &amp; 4C</xref>). Therefore, FAPs acquire senescence in a DNA damage-dependent manner in regenerating muscle.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Mcl-1 inhibitor eliminates senescent FAPs during muscle regeneration</title><p id="P13">Next, we sought to eliminate senescent FAPs by using small molecules to directly evaluate their impact on muscle regeneration. As senescent cells can acquire apoptosis resistance via upregulation of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic family members <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, we compared the gene expression of Bcl2, Bcl2xl, BclW, and Mcl-1 in the FAPs cluster. Interestingly, we observed a marked increase in Mcl-1 expression but not in Bcl2, BclxL, and BclW (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4E</xref>). Importantly, we found that FAPs from 5DPI expressed higher levels of Mcl-1 protein compared to NI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). It has recently been reported that Mcl-1 is an alternative target for killing senescent cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Therefore, we explored whether inhibition of Mcl-1 could eliminate senescent FAPs during muscle regeneration. We treated regenerating muscle with S63845, a specific Mcl-1 inhibitor, for six days and harvested the TAs at 7DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). We found a significant reduction in SAβGal+/F4/80- cells in S63845 treated TAs compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Importantly, there were more apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>) and fewer FAPs in the treated TAs group than in the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). Notably, numerous F4/80+ macrophages surrounded the SAβGal+ cells upon S63845 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting a robust response to apoptotic cells. Analysis of whole muscle extracts revealed upregulation of the pro-apoptotic genes BAX and NOXA, further confirming the elevated apoptosis in S63845-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). Curiously, we observed a decrease in Mcl-1 and an increase in Bcl2 and Bcl2-xL expression, suggesting a potential compensation among Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). Collectively, inhibition of Mcl-1 induces apoptosis in senescent FAPs during muscle regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Reduction of senescent FAPs impairs muscle regeneration</title><p id="P14">We next evaluated the impact of eliminating senescent FAPs on muscle regeneration. Histological examination revealed that S63845-treated TA muscles contained persistent inflammatory infiltration, necrotic myofibers, and cellular debris, which were largely absent from control samples at 7DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). S63845-treated TA muscles exhibited widespread eMyHC expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), retarded myofiber growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>), and altered gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Both proliferation and differentiation media were reconstituted with conditioned medium (CM) of FAPs isolated from either NI or 5DPI muscles to assess the paracrine impact of senescent FAPs on myogenic properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>).

This discrepancy could be explained by the known compensation effect of germline knockout of Cdkn2a <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, which yields much weaker phenotypes than acute disruption of gene function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Of note, we observed a strong reduction in SAβGal+ cells in the regenerating muscles of <italic>Cdkn1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Cdkn1a<sup>-/-</sup>; Cdkn2a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To determine the role of senescence in muscle regeneration, we first found that muscle regeneration was delayed in DKO mice compared to that in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Second, the direct elimination of senescent FAPs, the major senescent cell type revealed by scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2E</xref>), using a Mcl-1 inhibitor, delayed muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E-4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-C</xref>). Third, CM derived from senescent FAPs promoted myogenic differentiation and fusion without altering MuSC activation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F &amp; 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5D</xref>), which agrees with the timing of senescence induction upon injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B &amp; 1D</xref>). The discrepancy between Moiseeva et al. and our results could potentially be explained by the heterogeneity of the <italic>in vivo</italic> senescence program. It is known that susceptibility to certain senolytic is cell type-dependent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. However, it is currently unknown which cell populations are being eliminated. We found that both FAPs and endothelial cells were markedly reduced following Mcl-1 inhibitor treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>). However, we do not know whether dasatinib and quercetin, used by Moiseeva et al., target the same cell types. Moreover, neither study was able to completely eradicate senescent cells during muscle regeneration. Therefore, different senescent cell types may play distinct roles in muscle regeneration. Future investigations are warranted to elucidate senescence heterogeneity during muscle regeneration.</p><p id="P20">Collectively, we characterized the senescence program during muscle regeneration and found that senescent stromal cells, particularly FAPs, promoted optimal muscle regeneration. These findings will further our understanding of senescence heterogeneity and its functional relevance to tissue regeneration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS192768-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d218aAdDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S11"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are indebted to Jun Zhang for his excellent technical support in the image analysis.
