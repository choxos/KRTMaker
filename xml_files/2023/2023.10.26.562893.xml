One striking example is found in more than sixty plant lineages where compartmentation of photosynthesis between cell types allowed the evolution of the efficient C<sub>4</sub> pathway from the ancestral C<sub>3</sub> state. The molecular events enabling this transition are unclear. We used single nuclei sequencing to generate atlases for C<sub>3</sub> rice and C<sub>4</sub> sorghum during photomorphogenesis. Our analysis revealed that initiation of photosynthesis gene expression is conditioned by cell identity. In both species a conserved cistrome defines each cell type, and photosynthesis genes switching expression from mesophyll in rice to bundle sheath in sorghum acquire hallmarks of bundle sheath identity. The sorghum bundle sheath has also acquired gene networks associated with C<sub>3</sub> guard cells. We conclude C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is based on rewiring in <italic>cis</italic> that exapts cell identity networks of C<sub>3</sub> plants.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Multicellularity has evolved repeatedly such that it is now found in multiple lineages of bacteria and fungi, as well as the metazoans, algae and land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Grosberg and Strathmann, 2007</xref>). In all cases it allows particular cells to become specialized to carry out specific functions. In land plants, the division of labor between different cell types underlies many important agricultural traits such as water and nutrient uptake in roots and photosynthesis in shoots. In the case of photosynthesis, for the majority of land plants, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation occurs primarily in mesophyll cells and is dependent on the enzyme Ribulose-1,5-Bisphosphate Carboxylase-Oxygenase (RuBisCO). Since the first fixation product of RuBisCO is the three-carbon metabolite 3-phosphogylceric acid, this pathway has been termed C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bassham, Benson, Calvin 1950</xref>). It is found in bacteria and algae as well as land plants and so is considered ancestral. In land plants, although mesophyll cells are fundamental for photosynthesis, the specialization of other cell types is equally important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Haberlandt, 1884</xref>). For example, the xylem transports water and nutrients, guard cells mediate the flow of water and CO<sub>2</sub> in and out of the leaf, while the epidermis protects from the external environment. Similarly, once sugars are synthesized in the mesophyll, the bundle sheath cells deliver them to the phloem for allocation to other tissues.</p><p id="P3">Although most land plants use the C<sub>3</sub> pathway, RuBisCO is not able to completely discriminate between CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>. In addition to loss of carbon fixation, when RuBisCO carries out oxygenation reactions it generates the toxic intermediate phosphoglycolate that needs to be rapidly metabolized via the energy-intensive photorespiratory cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bowes et al., 1971</xref>). At higher temperatures the proportion of oxygenation reactions increases, and so the efficiency of C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bauwe et al., 2010</xref>). In multiple plant lineages, including staple crops such as maize and sorghum, evolution has reconfigured the functions of mesophyll and bundle sheath cells such that CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by RuBisCO is repressed in the mesophyll and activated in the bundle sheath. These species are known as C<sub>4</sub> plants because the first committed step of the pathway requires substantial activities of phospho<italic>enol</italic>pyruvate carboxylase in mesophyll cells and produces the C<sub>4</sub> acid oxaloacetate. Reduction or transamination of oxaloacetate to malate and aspartate in the mesophyll allows C<sub>4</sub> acids to accumulate to high concentrations and diffuse into bundle sheath cells prior to decarboxylation in close proximity to RuBisCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hatch and Slack, 1966</xref>). This process leads to a tenfold increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in bundle sheath chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Furbank, 2011</xref>), which reduces the frequency of oxygenation reactions so that photosynthetic as well as water and nitrogen use efficiencies are optimized (Ghannoum et al., 2010). As a result, C<sub>4</sub> plants grow particularly well in hot and dry climates and constitute some of the most productive crop species in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Jordan and Ogren, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sage and Zhu., 2011</xref>). Crucially, in both C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants, photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on mechanisms that pattern and maintain differential gene expression between each cell type of the leaf. However, it is not clear how strict partitioning of photosynthesis between cells is established and maintained, nor how these patterns change to allow the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis from the ancestral C<sub>3</sub> pathway.</p><p id="P4">In eukaryotes, the regulation of gene expression in distinct cell types and in response to endogenous and environmental signals is encoded by <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, the binding sites of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Marand et al., 2017</xref>). In C<sub>4</sub> leaves mechanical and cell digestion approaches have provided insight into the patterning of gene expression in mesophyll and bundle sheath strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Markelz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Covshoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">John et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Burgess et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Borba et al., 2023</xref>) and a small number of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mechanisms controlling cell specific expression of C<sub>4</sub> genes have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gowik et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Williams et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Reyna-Llorens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Burgess et al., 2019</xref>). However, in almost all studies of C<sub>4</sub> leaves, only bundle sheath strands have been examined, which contain phloem and xylem cells as well as the bundle sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Burgess et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Borba et al., 2023</xref>). Separation of bundle sheath cells from C<sub>3</sub> leaves has been even more challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aubry et al., 2014</xref>) and so molecular mechanisms allowing the rewiring of gene expression during the evolution from C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis are poorly understood. We reasoned that the advent of single nuclei sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Grindberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Tian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cervantes-Perez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Guillotin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Nobori et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Sun et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Wang et al., 2023</xref>) may remove this substantial roadblock by allowing the transcriptional identity of each cell type in C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species to be defined. To achieve this, we selected rice and sorghum that use the C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> pathways respectively to generate single nuclei atlases for gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Both species are models and diploid crops of global importance representing distinct clades in the monocotyledons that diverged approximately 81 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). Molecular signatures of each cell type that are shared by rice and sorghum may therefore also be found in these cells in the ~11,000 species derived from their last common ancestor.</p><p id="P5">To define how patterning of photosynthesis gene expression is established we sampled nuclei after transfer of seedlings from dark to light, a stimulus that induces photomorphogenesis and thus activation of photosynthesis gene expression. In both species gene expression was rapidly induced by light in all cell types. However, our data show that prior to the perception of light, the expression and chromatin accessibility of many photosynthesis genes is conditioned by cell identity. Thus, cell identity defines the extent to which cell types can respond to light. Furthermore, we found that between species, changes in transcriptional cell identity are the most dramatic in the bundle sheath, allowing the C<sub>4</sub> bundle sheath to change its response to light. This is driven in part by the C<sub>4</sub> bundle sheath gaining cell identity markers from mesophyll and guard cells of C<sub>3</sub> leaves. While transcriptional cell identities can change across species, we found that the underlying <italic>cis</italic>-elements that define cell identity are conserved. Genes that rewire their expression to become bundle sheath specific in C<sub>4</sub> sorghum acquire ancestral <italic>cis</italic>-elements such as DNA-binding with One Finger (DOF) motifs that direct bundle sheath expression in both the C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> bundle sheath. The simplest explanation from these findings is a model in which the evolution of photosynthesis is based on C<sub>4</sub> genes acquiring <italic>cis</italic>-elements associated with bundle sheath identity that then harness a stable patterning of transcription factors between cell types of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> leaves.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Single-nuclei gene expression and chromatin accessibility atlases for rice and sorghum shoots during de-etiolation</title><p id="P6">To understand how different cell types in rice and sorghum shoots respond to light, we grew seedlings of each species in the dark for 5 days and then exposed them to a light-dark photoperiod for 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, shoot tissue underwent photomorphogenesis during this time. For example, leaves emerged from the shoot and chlorophyll accumulated within the first 12h of de-etiolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed that leaves uncurled in response to light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and that etioplasts in both mesophyll and bundle sheath cells contained prolamellar bodies before light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Within 12h of light etioplasts had converted into mature chloroplasts with assembled thylakoid membranes. Compared with rice, chloroplast development was more pronounced in the bundle sheath of sorghum, and clear differences in thylakoid stacking in chloroplasts from mesophyll and bundle sheath of sorghum were evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Underlying this cellular remodeling and activation of the photosynthetic apparatus during photomorphogenesis are changes in gene regulation. However, to date these have been described in bulk tissue samples and so how each cell type responds is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boffey et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Sullivan et al., 2014</xref>; Armarego-Marriott et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Armarego-Marriott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Singh et al., 2023</xref>). To better understand how cells respond to light we generated single nuclei atlases of transcript abundance for both rice and sorghum shoots as they undergo photomorphogenesis. To achieve this, shoot tissue at nine time points during de-etiolation was harvested and nuclei sequenced using 10X and sci-RNA-seq3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cao et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, 1D</xref>). By combining nuclei sampled over the time course from both sequencing approaches we generated gene expression atlases derived from 190,569 and 265,701 nuclei from rice and sorghum respectively. Using the 10X-multiome workflow (combining RNA-seq and ATAC-seq) we also assayed cell specific changes in chromatin accessibility at 0h and 12h after light exposure by sequencing 22,154 and 20,169 nuclei from rice and sorghum respectively.</p><p id="P8">These outputs were visualized using uniform manifold approximation projection (UMAP) and nineteen distinct clusters were identified for each species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). Using the expression of previously described marker genes and their orthologs, cell types were assigned to each main cluster. This included mesophyll, guard, epidermal, xylem parenchyma and phloem cells (including parenchyma and companion cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Gene Ontology (GO) terms derived from cluster-specific genes reflected previously documented functions for each cell type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). For example, mesophyll nuclei showed high expression of genes involved in photosynthesis, and clusters containing nuclei from epidermis cells were enriched in genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and export, consistent with the role of this tissue in cutin production (Suh et al., 2005). Moreover, nuclei from phloem and xylem primarily expressed genes for transport of water and solutes and the synthesis of cell wall components respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Each cluster contained nuclei sampled from all time points, indicating that clustering was driven predominantly by cell type rather than time after exposure to light (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We identified cells of the sorghum bundle sheath through expression of C<sub>4</sub> cycle genes such as NADP-Malic Enzyme (<italic>NADP-ME</italic>) and Glycine Decarboxylase (<italic>GDC</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, to our knowledge there are no such markers for the bundle sheath in rice undergoing photomorphogenesis. To address this, we generated a stable reporter line in which bundle sheath nuclei were labelled with a fluorescent mTurquoise2 reporter under control of the <italic>PHOSPHOENOLCARBOXYKINASE</italic> promoter from <italic>Zoysia japonica</italic> (Nomura et al., 2005). Confocal laser scanning microscopy of these plants confirmed the presence of mTurquoise2 specifically in nuclei of rice bundle sheath cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). A preparation of nuclei from whole leaves was enriched in bundle sheath nuclei obtained after fluorescence activated sorting of nuclei from this reporter line. Sequencing and clustering produced fourteen clusters, with the largest specifically expressing mTurquoise2, thus identifying nuclei from the rice bundle sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Within this cluster we detected specific expression of genes such as <italic>PLASMA MEMBRANE INTRINSIC PROTEIN (PIP1.1), SULFITE REDUCTASE</italic> (<italic>SIR)</italic> and <italic>ATP SULFURYLASE (ATPSb)</italic>, which have previously been shown by laser capture microdissection to be expressed in the bundle sheath from mature rice leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hua et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Using marker genes from this cluster it was then possible to annotate nuclei with bundle sheath identity in our de-etiolation dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Complementing this atlas describing cell-type gene expression, the multiome assay (RNA-seq and ATAC-seq) allowed changes in chromatin accessibility during photomorphogenesis to be detected. After cross-validation with the single nuclei transcriptional atlases, the multiome atlases identified six cell types from each species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>). Between 1,820 and 3,016 accessible peaks in promoter regions were specific to each cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). As would be expected, these peaks were upstream of genes associated with the GO terms enriched in each cell type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). Peaks were also detected upstream of canonical marker genes for each cell type. For example, the promoters of RuBisCO small subunit (<italic>RbcS4)</italic> from rice and <italic>NADP-ME</italic> from sorghum were most accessible in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The C<sub>4</sub> bundle sheath acquires a new transcriptional identity from C<sub>3</sub> mesophyll and guard cells</title><p id="P11">C<sub>4</sub> evolution has repeatedly repurposed the bundle sheath to perform photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hibberd and Covshoff 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Langdale 2011</xref>). However, because it has not previously been possible to define gene expression in bundle sheath cells from C<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>4</sub> plants, the extent to which this cell type has been altered is not known. Using our single nuclei atlas from rice and sorghum we therefore tested whether transcriptional rewiring of C<sub>4</sub> bundle sheath cells is driven only by acquisition of photosynthesis networks associated with mesophyll cells of C<sub>3</sub> plants, or whether more substantial transcriptional changes are involved. To understand how the transcriptional identities of each cell type from rice and sorghum differ, we generated a pan-transcriptome atlas of photosynthetic tissue sampled at 48h after light exposure. Despite the evolutionary distance between rice and sorghum, most cell types from these species co-clustered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). In contrast, nuclei from bundle sheath cells in rice and sorghum did not co-cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Supporting this observation, GO enrichment analysis indicated that cells of the C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> bundle sheath carry out distinct functions - while genes expressed in the bundle sheath of rice were predominantly associated with transport and localization, those of sorghum were associated with organic acid metabolism and generation of precursor metabolites and energy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">More than 180 genes that were specific to bundle sheath cells of sorghum had orthologs that were either poorly expressed or were not specific to any cell type in rice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). For example, the canonical C<sub>4</sub> gene <italic>NADP-ME</italic> was strongly and specifically expressed in the sorghum bundle sheath but was poorly expressed in rice in a non cell type specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similar patterns of high and localized expression were evident in the sorghum bundle sheath for other genes involved in photosynthesis, photorespiration and chloroplast functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). The bundle sheath of C<sub>4</sub> sorghum also lost expression of genes associated with this cell type in rice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). Interestingly, this included genes involved in hormone signaling and biosynthesis including gibberellic acid, ethylene, and auxin pathways, as well as genes encoding sugar and water transporters. We next investigated how conserved cell type specific gene expression patterns were across species. While most cell types showed conserved patterns of expression between rice and sorghum, this was not the case for the bundle sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). In fact, transcripts from only 28 orthologs (including genes involved in sulfur metabolism and transport) were specific to the bundle sheath of both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). The C<sub>4</sub> bundle sheath of sorghum had also obtained patterns of gene expression from other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Indeed, bundle sheath cells of sorghum were transcriptionally more similar to mesophyll and guard cells of rice, whereas the bundle sheath of rice was most similar to the phloem of sorghum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Similarities between sorghum bundle sheath and rice mesophyll or guard cells were primarily driven by changes in the expression of genes involved in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham Cycle and starch metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). Thus, to transcriptionally rewire the C<sub>4</sub> bundle sheath it appears that this cell type (<bold><italic>i</italic></bold>) gained genes not found specifically or highly expressed in rice shoot tissue, (<bold><italic>ii</italic></bold>) lost specific expression of genes transcribed in the C<sub>3</sub> bundle sheath, and (<bold><italic>iii</italic></bold>) gained genes preferentially expressed in other cell types of C<sub>3</sub> rice including mesophyll and guard cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p id="P13">As a difference in expression of photosynthesis genes between bundle sheath and mesophyll cells (hereafter partitioning) is considered crucial for the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hibberd and Covshoff 2010</xref>) we examined this phenomenon in sorghum and rice. Pairwise comparison of gene expression in response to light revealed that in each species transcripts from more than one thousand genes were partitioned between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells and included 225 orthologous gene pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>). Of these, 126 were partitioned identically between the same cell types in both rice and sorghum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Those consistently partitioned to the mesophyll in both species were associated with oxidation and reduction processes as well as carbohydrate and small molecule metabolism, while bundle sheath partitioned genes were involved in transport of solutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>). Interestingly, an additional 99 orthologs showed opposing patterns in the two species, i.e. they were ‘differentially’ partitioned. 43 orthologs that had swapped from strong expression in the mesophyll of rice to strong expression in the bundle sheath of sorghum included genes encoding proteins of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle as well as organic acid and nitrogen metabolism. 56 genes that swapped from strong expression in the bundle sheath of rice to the mesophyll of sorghum were associated with transport of metabolites and solutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To investigate how conserved partitioning was between all cell types, we assessed the degree of cross-species overlap between each pair of the six cell types annotated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). This revealed that the mesophyll and bundle sheath had the smallest set of partitioned genes across species, as well as the weakest statistical overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). In addition to mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of rice showing the lowest conservation in terms of transcript partitioning, it was also noticeable that a large proportion of the genes that were partitioned between these cells had in fact swapped cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). This suggests that the swapping of functions or ‘identity’ between other cell types is a rare event genome-wide but occurs relatively frequently between the mesophyll and bundle sheath.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Pervasive acquisition of light regulation within the bundle sheath of sorghum</title><p id="P15">Since light induces photomorphogenesis we next investigated how individual nuclei from each cell type responded to this stimulus. When rice mesophyll and sorghum bundle sheath nuclei were analysed they naively clustered by time of sampling, indicating that light was a dominant driver of transcriptional state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Canonical marker genes showed the expected induction, for example, <italic>RbcS</italic> and <italic>NADP-ME</italic> were activated by light in mesophyll cells of rice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) and bundle sheath cells of sorghum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) respectively. We detected global cell-type specific differential gene expression responses to light by fitting statistical models to pseudo-bulked transcriptional profiles. Then, to find dominant expression trends in gene regulation, we clustered differentially expressed genes using Pearson correlation. In rice each of the six cell types examined showed a distinct and cell type specific response to light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>). Apart from the bundle sheath and epidermal cells in rice, hundreds of cell type-specific light-responsive genes were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Notably, while genes in rice mesophyll cells showed a steady increase in expression, those in other cells showed a more complex response with multiple phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C &amp; 5D</xref>). In both species, mesophyll and bundle sheath specific genes were enriched in photosynthesis and chloroplast-related functions, consistent with the rapid greening of shoots and the conversion of etioplasts into chloroplasts during de-etiolation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>). Bundle sheath cells from rice and sorghum showed the greatest difference in their response to light. This change in behavior appears to be due to at least two phenomena. First, some genes expressed in bundle sheath cells of sorghum showed the same response to light as those expressed in the mesophyll (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Second, some transcripts partitioned to bundle sheath cells of sorghum showed a strong increase in abundance from 6 hours of light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p id="P16">A more detailed interrogation of the data showed an increase in transcript abundance of the light signaling transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lee et al., 2007</xref>), with a particularly strong response in guard cells of both rice and sorghum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>). Moreover, PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR (PIF) transcription factors that repress photomorphogenesis in the dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Moon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gommers &amp; Monte, 2018</xref>) were rapidly downregulated in response to light in all cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>). Light-induced partitioning of canonical photosynthesis genes between mesophyll and bundle sheath was also apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S8</xref>). In rice, photosynthesis genes were most strongly induced in the mesophyll although a similar but weaker response was also seen in bundle sheath, guard, phloem, epidermis and xylem nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). SEM confirmed that in the dark etioplasts were pressent in vascular and epidermal cells, and after exposure to light thylakoid-like membranes were evident (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>). This supports the observation that photosynthesis can be weakly induced in these cell types. In sorghum, light strongly induced photosynthesis genes in both mesophyll and bundle sheath cell types, and included genes important for the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis as well as the Calvin-Benson-Bassham and C<sub>4</sub> cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). As expected, Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle genes and <italic>NADP-ME</italic> were highly induced in sorghum bundle sheath, while <italic>CARBONIC ANHYDRASE</italic> and <italic>PYRUVATE,ORTHOPHOSPHATE DIKINASE</italic> were induced in mesophyll cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S8</xref>).

These data indicate a pervasive gain of light regulation by photosynthesis genes in the bundle sheath of sorghum likely facilitated by increased chromatin accessibility.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Cell identity conditions partitioning of photosynthesis gene expression in the dark</title><p id="P17">In both rice and sorghum differences in expression of photosynthesis genes between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells increased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E &amp; 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11</xref>). As would be expected, in rice these genes were preferentially expressed in mesophyll cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) whilst in sorghum some were preferential to mesophyll cells and others were more highly expressed in the bundle sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). This is exemplified by the <italic>GLYCOLATE OXIDASE</italic> gene, whose transcripts showed greater partitioning to mesophyll cells of rice and bundle sheath cells of sorghum in response to light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). After 12h of light exposure 72 photosynthesis genes in rice and 77 in sorghum were partitioned between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, for some photosynthesis genes differences in expression between cells were evident in the dark. This suggests that cell identity conditions light responses. Specifically, in the dark 29% and 58% of photosynthesis transcripts in rice and sorghum respectively were significantly partitioned between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). For example, at 0 hours <italic>Rbcs2</italic> transcripts were already more abundant in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of rice and sorghum respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). This finding is consistent with the fact that promoters of photosynthesis genes contained regions of open chromatin in the etiolated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>). Indeed, differences in accessible chromatin between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells at 0 hours were also evident in promoter regions of <italic>GLYCOLATE OXIDASE</italic> and <italic>RBCS2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). In fact, in the etiolated state many photosynthesis genes showed differences in chromatin accessibility between cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). In the dark open chromatin upstream of photosynthesis genes was predominantly found in mesophyll cells of rice and this was reinforced after exposure to light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). In sorghum open chromatin was evident upstream of canonical photosynthesis genes as well as those of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle in both mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, and as in rice this was strengthened by light. We conclude that intrinsic differences in cell identity contribute to the partitioning of photosynthesis gene expression between cells in both C<sub>3</sub> rice and C<sub>4</sub> sorghum, and that differential partitioning is not driven exclusively by light signaling.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Photosynthesis genes in C<sub>4</sub> sorghum acquire a <italic>cis</italic>-code associated with the C<sub>3</sub> bundle sheath of rice</title><p id="P18"><italic>Cis</italic>-regulatory DNA sequences drive the patterning of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Marand et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kaufmann et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we next searched for <italic>cis</italic>-elements that underlie our observed cell identity - and light-dependent patterns of gene expression in rice and sorghum. When regions of open chromatin specific to each cell type were assessed for over-represented transcription factor binding sites, this identified the same motifs in the same cell types of both rice and sorghum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S9</xref>). Thus, both species share a conserved cell-type specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory code. For example, motifs bound by Myeloblastosis (Myb)-related and NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2 (NAC) transcription factors defined accessible chromatin regions in mesophyll nuclei from both rice and sorghum, while the DOF motif was enriched in bundle sheath and phloem-specific peaks of both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S12</xref>). Further, xylem-specific peaks were enriched in MYB and ANAC transcription factor motifs while peaks associated with epidermis and guard cells contained binding sites for the homeodomain GLABROUS 1 (HDG1), Zinc finger-homeodomain (ZHD) and AT-hook motif nuclear-localized (AHL) families of transcription factors. In contrast, when we examined motifs in chromatin that were differentially accessible in response to light, we found that the same motifs were enriched, regardless of cell type. These motifs comprised the light-responsive circadian clock related basic leucine zipper (bZIPs) and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S10</xref>). These findings suggest that cell-type specific patterning of gene expression is defined by cell-identity <italic>cis</italic>-elements, whereas light-responsive gene expression is regulated by similar <italic>cis</italic>-elements across all cell types.</p><p id="P19">We next investigated whether the cell-type specific <italic>cis</italic>-code regulates genes that are differentially partitioned. To this end, we examined genes that were strongly expressed in the rice mesophyll, and whose orthologs were partitioned to the sorghum bundle sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Among the 40 orthologs in this category were the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle genes <italic>FRUCTOSE BISPHOSPHATE ALDOLASE</italic> and <italic>GLYCERALDEHYDE 3-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE</italic> (<italic>GAPDH)</italic>, photorespiration genes such as <italic>GLYCOLATE OXIDASE</italic>, and light reaction genes including the <italic>LHCII</italic> subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). To find accessible chromatin associated with these peaks, we correlated changes in gene expression with changes in accessibility. Strikingly, among these differentially partitioned genes, we found that associated chromatin was enriched in cell-type specific Myb-related, Auxin Response Factor 4 (ARF4) and REVEILLE 5 (RVE5) binding sites in mesophyll-specific genes in rice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>), but enriched in cell-type specific DOF and JACKDAW (JKD) / Indeterminate Domain (IDD) binding sites in bundle-sheath specific orthologs in sorghum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S14</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S11</xref>). This indicates that these orthologs swapped their partitioning from mesophyll to bundle sheath through changing identity-associated <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motifs. Specifically, our data suggest that DOF transcription factor motifs were acquired by genes that swap expression from the mesophyll of C<sub>3</sub> rice to the bundle sheath of C<sub>4</sub> sorghum.</p><p id="P20">To investigate further, we examined canonical photosynthesis genes that were differentially partitioned from rice mesophyll to the sorghum bundle sheath for the prevalence of DOF motifs. This showed that accessible chromatin upstream of <italic>GAPDH</italic> in sorghum was enriched in DOF motifs compared to rice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). A similar enrichment of DOF motifs was seen in accessible chromatin of the sorghum bundle sheath for <italic>FRUCTOSE BISPHOSPHATE ALDOLASE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>) and for <italic>NADP-ME</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S15</xref>). Furthermore, DOF family transcription factors were typically more strongly expressed in bundle sheath cells of both rice and sorghum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>) suggesting that the patterning of these transcription factors has not changed during the transition from C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>4.</sub> Curiously, we found that while differentially partitioned genes in rice displayed large differences in chromatin accessibility between mesophyll and bundle sheath cell types, these differences were much smaller in sorghum.

Our data provide a new level of granularity that allows us to explore the transcriptional identity of each cell type within a leaf and across two species. Our findings highlight the differences in functions that each cell type carries out. For example, specific gene expression in epidermal cells provides evidence for their role in the biosynthesis and export of cutin molecules used in the formation of the protective cuticle at the leaf surface, while cells associated with the phloem show high expression of genes involved in the transport of sugars and solutes. These data are consistent with previous single-cell RNA sequencing studies focusing on leaf tissues from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Procko et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Berrío et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). By comparing transcriptional identities between cell types of rice and sorghum leaves, we found that the C<sub>4</sub> sorghum bundle sheath has simultaneously gained novel expression of many genes, and as would be expected this included C<sub>4</sub> genes. However, it was also apparent that the sorghum bundle sheath cells have lost expression of genes specific to the C<sub>3</sub> bundle sheath. Notably, the sorghum bundle sheath acquired specific gene expression from other C<sub>3</sub> cell types, with the C<sub>3</sub> mesophyll and guard cells being prominent cell types that have swapped gene expression with the C<sub>4</sub> bundle sheath. These findings have important implications for ongoing efforts to engineer C<sub>3</sub> plants with C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Ermakova et al., 2021</xref>) and suggest that the C<sub>3</sub> bundle sheath undergoes a broad change in transcriptional identity to achieve a functional C<sub>4</sub> pathway. Our data also suggest that other cell types, such as the phloem and the guard cells, have been re-functionalized such that they carry out functions to support C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in leaves.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Establishing photosynthesis in specific cell types</title><p id="P24">In contrast to mammals, plant transcriptomes are highly dynamic in response to external environmental cues. To capture such changes, our gene expression atlases not only explore transcriptional identity, but also how cell transcriptional states change after the perception of light. Previous analysis of de-etiolation has proved a powerful system to understand the complex dynamics associated with photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boffey et al., 1980</xref>; Sullivan et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Armarego-Marriott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Armarego-Marriott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Singh et al., 2023</xref>). Such studies have highlighted the extensive transcriptional and translational changes required for the assembly of chloroplast membranes and the photosynthetic apparatus, which in turn have elucidated the central role that light signaling plays in both chloroplast and seedling development. Moreover, several transcription factors, including positive regulators such as Hy5 and negative regulators such as PIFs, have been shown to play critical roles in regulating the expression of photosynthesis genes during de-etiolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Moon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Shin et al., 2009</xref>; Leivar &amp; Quail, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gommers &amp; Monte, 2018</xref>). However, bulk analysis of leaf tissue has occluded the multitude of light-induced responses taking place in each cell type. By mapping gene expression at single cell resolution in rice and sorghum shoots at different time points during de-etiolation, we captured how the transcriptional state of each cell type responds to light and discovered both shared as well as unique gene expression responses. We found that all cell types activated photosynthesis gene expression to some extent and that light signaling-related <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements bZIP and CCA1 were differentially accessible in each cell type in response to light. However, there were clear differences in the magnitude and dynamics of photosynthesis gene induction. For example, vasculature cell types typically displayed weak activation, whereas the mesophyll in rice and both the mesophyll and bundle sheath in sorghum reacted strongly to light exposure. This indicates that light responsive gene expression is a generic feature of all cell types in a leaf, but it appears that the amplitude of the light response is conditioned by cell identity.</p><p id="P25">There is clear evidence that transcriptional reprogramming is critical after perception of light to induce chloroplast development and photosynthesis (Arsovski et al., 2012). Despite this, some studies show that cell identity can also affect photosynthesis gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Langdale 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Wang et al., 1993</xref>). For example, transcripts of both the large and the small subunits of RuBisCO in the C<sub>4</sub> plant <italic>Amaranthus hypochondriacus</italic> were found to be localized preferentially to the bundle sheath cells in cotyledons of dark-grown seedlings, while RuBisCO, PEPC and PPDK proteins were present in a cell type specific manner in the absence of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Wang et al., 1993</xref>). Our observations support and expand these early reports to other members of the photosynthesis pathway. While light responses in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells in both rice and sorghum played an important role in the regulation of photosynthesis, our data show that partitioning of photosynthesis, both at the gene expression and chromatin level, was already present in the dark (i.e. in a light-independent manner). From these data, we conclude that light-independent, cell identity-driven partitioning of photosynthesis genes in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells occurs in both C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants and is a common phenomenon associated with many photosynthesis genes.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>C<sub>4</sub> gene expression exapts gene regulatory networks associated with cell identity in C<sub>3</sub> plants</title><p id="P26">Previous studies have identified a small number of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory mechanisms that control the specific expression of C<sub>4</sub> genes in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells (Marshall et al., 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gowik et al., 2004</xref>; Akyildiz et l., 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Williams et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Reyna-Llorens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Borba et al., 2023</xref>). The expression patterns driven by these <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences in C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species suggest that rewiring of ancestral gene regulatory mechanisms underlies the evolution of cell type specific gene expression required for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. However, until this point, efforts to understand cell type specific gene expression in leaves have primarily focused on C<sub>4</sub> species, and so little is known about the ancestral <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences and transcription factors that regulate gene expression in mesophyll or bundle sheath cells of genes from C<sub>3</sub> species. To our knowledge a MYC and MYB bipartite transcription factor module is the only known gene regulatory mechanism that drives bundle sheath expression in a C<sub>3</sub> plant (Dickinson et al., 2020). Here, a comparison between six major leaf cell types of rice and sorghum revealed that most cell types held distinct cell identity related <italic>cis</italic>-elements. Notably, there was a high degree of conservation of cell identity-associated motifs between rice and sorghum. For example, DOF transcription factor binding sites were enriched in chromatin regions that were specifically accessible in bundle sheath cells of both rice and sorghum. Supporting this, transient expression assays in C<sub>4</sub> maize have shown that DOF transcription factors are able to activate the expression of <italic>NADP-ME</italic> and <italic>PEPCK</italic>, two genes that are specifically expressed in the bundle sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Borba et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, in contrast to the low level of conservation of transcriptional identities detected for the bundle sheath between C<sub>3</sub> rice and C<sub>4</sub> sorghum, it appears that the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory landscape regulating cell-type specific expression is conserved between the two species. These results suggest that to change spatial patterns of gene expression within a leaf, genes recruit ancestral cell-type specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mechanisms to re-direct gene expression to a new cell type. Our findings suggest that the bundle sheath specific regulation of C<sub>4</sub> genes by DOF transcription factors might be a mechanism employed by several C<sub>4</sub> species, and that this gene regulatory mechanism was recruited from the ancestral C<sub>3</sub> state, a hypothesis that is supported by the observed enrichment of DOF motifs in bundle sheath specific accessible chromatin of C<sub>3</sub> rice.</p><p id="P27">Various models have been proposed to explain the repeated evolution of the complex C<sub>4</sub> phenotype.

Nuclei were aggregated across various time points (ranging from 0 to 48 h) and methods (10X and sci-RNA-seq3). The integrated dataset was subjected to clustering, employing the top 2000 variable features that were shared across all datasets. Subsequent UMAP projections were constructed using the first 30 principal components. To analyse the rice bundle sheath specific mTurquoise line, we integrated two treatment replicates into a unified dataset. For this dataset, we clustered utilising the first 30 principal components. Cluster-specific markers were identified using the FindMarkers() command (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.01). To determine the correspondence between the mTurquoise-positive cluster and clusters within the rice-RNA atlas, we compared the lists of cluster-specific markers (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.01, specificity &gt; 2) to those obtained from the rice-RNA atlas. For the 10X-multiome (RNA+ATAC) clustering we employed Signac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Stuart et al., 2021</xref>). Biological and technical replicates for each species were integrated, and clustering was conducted using the first 50 principal components derived from expression data. Following the initial peak calling using cellranger (10X genomics), peaks were subsequently re-called using MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Differentially accessible peaks between cell types were identified using the FindMarkers() command (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05, percent threshold &gt; 0.3).</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Orthology Analyses</title><p id="P40">We determined gene orthologs between rice and sorghum using OrthoFinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Emms &amp; Kelly, 2019</xref>). We constructed pan-transcriptome atlases by selecting expressed rice and sorghum genes that had cross-species orthologs. Ortholog conversions were performed in a one-to-one manner, meaning that if multiple orthologs for a gene were found across species, only one was retained. We integrated these datasets with Seurat using clustering approaches described above. To assign cell identities, we drew upon cell type labels that were previously assigned to each species separately and mapped them onto the pan-transcriptome clusters. To assess specific transcriptional differences in gene expression between the bundle sheath clusters of sorghum and rice within this dataset, we used the FindMarkers() command (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05). To examine the overlap of cell type-specific gene expression markers between the two species, we identified cell type markers from our main transcriptional dataset using FindMarkers() (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05, min.pct &gt; 0.1). We note that some genes were found to be significant across multiple cell types. To assess the significance of this overlap, we compared their orthogroups and conducted a Fisher Exact Test, with the total number of orthogroups in the dataset as the background. Next, we assessed consistent and differential partitioning of gene expression patterns among each cell type pair (15 pairs total). To do this, we first calculated differentially expressed genes for each cell type pair by pseudo bulking transcriptomes of individual cell types across 0 - 12 h time points. Next, we identified partitioned expression patterns between cell types using an ANCOVA model implemented in DESeq2 (adj. <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). To perform cross-species comparisons of cell type pairs, we first converted differentially expressed genes to their Orthogroup. We then overlapped each cell type pair across species and evaluated the significance of these overlaps using the Fisher Exact Test. Finally, to distinguish whether a gene displayed consistent or differential partitioning in a particular cell type, we examined whether its fold change expression was higher or lower compared to its counterpart in the corresponding cell type of the other species.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Differential Expression and Accessibility Responses to Light</title><p id="P41">We discovered cell-type specific differentially expressed genes during the first 12 h of light by pseudo-bulking transcriptional profiles. For each cell type, we then calculated the first and second principal component of these bulked profiles and found differentially expressed genes through fitting linear models to each of these principal components, as well as those that responded linearly with time using DESeq2 (adj. <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). To this list of differentially expressed genes, we also included genes that were differentially expressed between time point 0 and 12 in a pairwise test (adj. <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Next, to uncover the different trends of gene expression among differentially expressed genes, we clustered genes using hierarchical clustering; choosing clustering cut offs that resulted in 10 rice and 18 sorghum clusters that contained at least 10 genes. To visualize the expression of these clusters, we scaled the expression of these clusters and fit a non-linear model to capture the dominant expression trend. Accessible chromatin within canonical photosynthesis genes were found through pseudo-bulking accessible chromatin by cell type. Accessible peaks needed to be within 2000 bp of the gene body and only 1 peak per gene is displayed. To compare peak accessibility across species, reads per peak were normalized between 0 and 1. Significant differences in accessibility between cell types of this group of genes were assessed using a paired t-test.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title><italic>cis</italic>-Element Analyses</title><p id="P42">To analyze over-represented cis-elements, we first calculated position frequency matrices using the JASPER2020 plant taxon group (Castro-Mondragon et al., 2021) with BSGenome assembled genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Pagès 2023</xref>). We found cell type specific accessible motifs per clustering using the RunchromVar function in Signac. This same approach was used for light responsive <italic>cis</italic>-elements, using light and dark treated nuclei within each cell type. We overlapped these cis-regulatory element lists by first sub-setting by the top 25 most significantly overrepresented motifs (adj. <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05), before computing a Fisher Exact Test using all computed motifs as background. We clustered motifs using Tobias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bentsen et al., 2020</xref>). To find differentially partitioned orthologous genes within our multiome gene expression dataset, we found mesophyll and bundle sheath specific genes in rice and sorghum respectively using the FindMarkers() command, with a p-value threshold cut off of 0.01 and a specificity above 1.25. To find overrepresented motifs within these genes, we correlated peak accessibility with gene expression using the LinkPeaks() command and kept only those peaks which were significantly associated with gene expression. We identified enriched cis-elements within these peaks using the FindMotifs() command; ranking by significance (adj. <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05). We iterated the FindMotifs() command over 100 permutations to rank motifs that were consistently reported as enriched. Finally, to find DOF binding sites within accessible chromatin, we took the sequence underneath peaks upstream of target genes; ignoring areas that were inside gene bodies. We then used the runFimo() command with each DOF motifs that were found over-represented and conserved in the bundle sheath across species (adj. <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS190275-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d28aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>J.S. is an awardee of the Life Sciences Research Foundation (funded by Open Philanthropy) and a recipient of the American-Australian Association Fellowship (funded by Pratt Industries).
