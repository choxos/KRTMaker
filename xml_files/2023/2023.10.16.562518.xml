Dysregulation of NMDARs is linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, emphasizing the need to understand the functional roles of individual NMDAR subtypes in the brain. GluN2B-containing NMDARs (GluN2B-NMDARs) are particularly important due to both pro-cognitive and pro-excitotoxic roles, although these functions remain under debate. Traditional pharmacological and genetic approaches have important shortcomings in terms of specificity and spatio-temporal resolution, limiting their use in native tissues. We therefore turned to optopharmacology, a technique based on the use of photosensitive ligands, whose activity can be reversibly tuned via illumination with different wavelengths. We developed OptoNAM-3, an azobenzene-based, photoswitchable negative allosteric modulator selective for GluN2B-NMDARs. OptoNAM-3 is a potent inhibitor of GluN2B-NMDARs in its <italic>trans</italic> configuration and inactive in its <italic>cis</italic> configuration. When bound to GluN2B-NMDARs, OptoNAM-3 displays remarkable red-shifting of its photoswitching properties that we attributed to geometric constraints imposed by the binding site onto the ligand azobenzene moiety. OptoNAM-3 allowed fast and reversible photomodulation of GluN2B-NMDAR activity <italic>in vitro</italic> using either UV/green or blue/green light illumination cycles. OptoNAM-3 furthermore acted as a reversible, red-shifted <italic>in vivo</italic> photomodulator of Xenopus tadpole locomotion. By enabling fast and reversible photocontrol of endogenous GluN2B-NMDARs with <italic>in vivo</italic> compatible photochemical properties, OptoNAM-3 should advance our understanding of the role of this class of NMDARs in brain function and dysfunction.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Significance statement</title><p id="P2">This article presents the development and characterization of a photoswitchable negative allosteric modulator (NAM) targeting GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors (GluN2B-NMDARs).

At these specialized neuronal sites, neurotransmitters released from a presynaptic neuron cross the synaptic cleft and activate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, hence mediating transmission of information from one neuron to another. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are a class of ionotropic receptors activated by glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter of the Vertebrate central nervous system. They play a central role in synaptic transmission and plasticity but their dysfunction is also involved in many pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). NMDARs are tetramers composed of two GluN1 and two GluN2 (or GluN3) subunits. Each tetramer can either incorporate two identical GluN2 (or GluN3) subunits (di-heteromers) or different GluN2 (or GluN3) subunits (tri-heteromers), each GluN2 subunit conferring to the receptor distinct biophysical and pharmacological properties, as well as different expression and signaling profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Understanding the functional role of NMDAR individual subtypes in the brain is fundamental to develop new strategies to counteract the deleterious effects of NMDAR deregulation.</p><p id="P4">Over-activation of NMDARs, as occurring during traumatic brain injury or stroke, induces an excessive increase in intracellular calcium, a process leading to neuronal death (excitotoxicity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). This excitotoxicity phenomenon is also observed in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). NMDAR overactivation furthermore occurs in other pathologies such as epilepsy, neuropathic pain and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Multiple studies point to a specific role of GluN2B-NMDARs in triggering excitotoxicity, although this role is debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). To counteract the deleterious effects of GluN2B-NMDAR overactivation, a large number of negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) specific for GluN2B-NMDARs were developed in the late 90s – early 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). These antagonists, of which ifenprodil is the lead compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), displayed neuroprotective properties <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> with reduced adverse effects compared to broad spectrum antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). So far, however, all of these compounds failed in clinical trials because of a lack of effect or a narrow therapeutic window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Ifenprodil derivatives bind at the level of the NMDAR N-terminal domains (NTDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), bilobar domains preceding the agonist-binding domain (ABD) and that constitute a hub for allosteric modulation in NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> for NMDAR subunit architecture). At this level, these compounds induce their inhibition by interacting with the upper lobe of GluN1 NTD and with the upper and lower lobes of the GluN2B NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), which favors entry of NMDARs into an inhibited state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Some of these GluN2B-specific NAMs, such as ifenprodil, Ro25-6981 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) or CP-101,606 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) are currently used as standard pharmacological tools to specifically target GluN2B-NMDARs in native tissues and have proven useful to investigate the contributions of this receptor subtype to several physiological and pathological processes. However, use of these compounds in native tissues faces serious limitations due to their slow association and dissociation kinetics. In recombinant systems, time constants of association of GluN2B-specific NAMs are indeed in the seconds to tens of seconds time-range at saturating compound concentration, while time constants of dissociation are in the tens of seconds to minute time-range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). These slow kinetics are even more marked in native tissues. In brain slices, for instance, GluN2B-specific NAMs take tens of minutes to elicit their inhibitory effect, which is then irreversible (see, for instance, refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>)). It is thus important to develop GluN2B-selective inhibitors with improved temporal resolution and reversibility of action for a dynamic control of GluN2B-NMDARs in native tissues.</p><p id="P6">Photopharmacology, an approach based on the use of photosensitive ligands, allows such high temporal resolution of action. The most widely adopted method for optical modulation of ion channel activity involves caged compounds, whose activity is inhibited by a photolabile moiety (cage) but this strategy is limited by its irreversibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). An alternative approach employs photoconvertible ligands that can alternate between an active and an inactive configuration after exposure to different light wavelengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). This photoswitchable property is conferred to the molecule by the presence in its structure of a photo-isomerisable unit such as an azobenzene, which can reversibly alternate between an extended <italic>trans</italic> form and a twisted <italic>cis</italic> configuration using two different wavelengths, usually UV and blue-green light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). In a previous paper, we had developed a caged and a photoswitchable ifenprodil derivative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). However, while caged ifenprodil allowed fast GluN2B-NMDAR inhibition, the kinetics of NMDAR recovery from inhibition were still limited by the slow dissociation rate of ifenprodil. Additionally, the strategy we utilized to obtain a photoswitchable ifenprodil– attachment of an azobenzene to the ifenprodil molecule – strongly decreased its inhibitory activity, probably because ifenprodil binding-site is too small to accommodate the supplementary azobenzene moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In this paper, we took advantage of the chemical diversity of GluN2B-selective antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) and designed photoswitchable NAMs by incorporating the azobenzene moiety within the chemical scaffold of the molecule (azologization approach, see refs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) and below). Among the four photoswitchable NAM candidates, OptoNAM-3 appeared as a potent and selective inhibitor of GluN2B-NMDARs in its <italic>trans</italic> configuration, while its <italic>cis</italic> isomer was inactive. OptoNAM-3 allowed us to reversibly control GluN2B-NMDAR activity in real time with fast (in the second range) temporal resolution. Surprisingly, binding of OptoNAM-3 to GluN2B-NMDARs induced a red-shift of its action spectrum, allowing us to use visible (blue and green) light to turn off and on OptoNAM-3 activity. Using molecular dynamics and density-function theory (DFT), we show that this red-shift is due to geometric constraints imposed by OptoNAM-3 binding-site on a specific rotamer of the compound. We finally show that OptoNAM-3 also acts as a red-shifted photomodulator <italic>in vivo</italic>, allowing us to reversibly modulate the locomotion behavior of Xenopus tadpoles. This highlights the strong potential of OptoNAM-3 for fast and reversible control of GluN2B-NMDAR activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S4"><title>Design of a photoswitchable GluN1/GluN2B-selective NMDAR antagonist</title><p id="P8">There are two main strategies for converting conventional ligands into photoswitchable ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>): (i) attach a ‘photoswitchable’ moiety (in our case, an azobenzene moiety) to a well-known ligand (azo-extension approach). As this approach can potentially be applied to any ligand, it is currently the most widely used strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). (ii) Integrate the azobenzene moiety into the molecular scaffold of the ligand when the latter allows it, a process called “azologisation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). This strategy cannot be applied to all ligands and is therefore less employed, although a strong increase in its development has been observed in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Where appropriate, this technique allows light sensitivity to be conferred on a ligand with minimal chemical modification. We have previously shown that the strategy of azo-extension was not the most appropriate to confer photosensitivity to ifenprodil derivatives because the binding-site was likely too buried to accommodate both the ligand and the azobenzene moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>) (see above). We therefore decided to use the azologization strategy. We selected a series of four NAMs selective for GluN2B-NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>) possessing chemical motifs that can be changed into an azobenzene with minimal perturbation of the molecule structure (isosteres of azobenzenes or “azosteres”, refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>)) to design photoswitchable compounds OptoNAM-1, -2, -3 and -4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The photochemical and biological characterizations of OptoNAM-1, -2 and -4 are described in Supplementary Text 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1, S2 and Table S1</xref>. In brief, OptoNAM-1 and -2 displayed photodependent activity on GluN1/GluN2B NMDARs but with a &gt;1000-fold shift in IC<sub>50</sub> compared to their parent compounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 and Table S1</xref>). This is likely due to the loss of protonation of the aminopyridine moiety at physiological pH induced by introduction of the azo moiety (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Protonation was indeed shown to be critical for the activity of this class of compounds onto GluN1/GluN2B NMDARs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D</xref> and ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>)). OptoNAM-4, on the other hand, retained strong potency for GluN1/GluN2B NMDARs but its activity was not photodependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 and Table S1</xref>). In this paper we focus on OptoNAM-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), which emerged as the best candidate for efficient photocontrol of GluN1/GluN2B NMDARs (see below).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Photochemical characterization of OptoNAM-3</title><p id="P9">We first characterized the photochemical properties of OptoNAM-3. We focused on the three key properties allowing use of azobenzenes in biological systems: (i) ideal wavelengths for <italic>trans</italic> to <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>cis</italic> to <italic>trans</italic> conversions; (ii) compound photostability, <italic>i.e</italic>. half-life of the <italic>cis</italic> isomer in the dark; and (iii) fatigability, <italic>i.e</italic>. the number of illumination cycles that the molecule can undergo without degradation. To this aim, we acquired UV-visible absorption spectra of OptoNAM-3 diluted in oocyte recording solution (pH 7.3; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>) either in the dark (absence of illumination), or after illumination by light wavelengths ranging from 350 to 580 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1M</xref>). The absorption spectra of OptoNAM-3 in solution were characteristic of azobenzenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). In the dark (black curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), the spectrum was characteristic of a <italic>trans</italic> isomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Application of UV light at a wavelength close to the main absorption peak of the <italic>trans</italic> form (365 or 350 nm) gave a completely different spectrum (violet curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), characteristic of azobenzenes in their <italic>cis</italic> configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). HPLC analysis of an OptoNAM-3 solution identified photostationary states (PSS) containing 94% <italic>trans</italic> and 6% <italic>cis</italic> in the dark, 75% <italic>cis</italic> and 25% residual <italic>trans</italic> after illumination at 365 nm (365 nm PSS, violet curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), and 94% <italic>cis</italic> and 6% residual <italic>trans</italic> after illumination at 350 nm (350 nm PSS, lavender curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). This shows that illumination with UV light can convert most of OptoNAM-3 into its <italic>cis</italic> configuration, 350 nm being the most efficient wavelength to induce <italic>trans</italic>-to-<italic>cis</italic> transition. Irradiation of OptoNAM-3 365 nm PSS with wavelengths from 435 to 550 nm gave equivalent <italic>cis</italic>-to-<italic>trans</italic> conversions with 435 and 550 nm yielding slightly stronger conversions (~70% <italic>trans</italic> after illumination at 435 and 550 nm measured at λ<sub><italic>trans</italic></sub> = 329 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1N</xref>). 550 nm was chosen as the optimal wavelength since green light is less harmful for cells compared to lights of shorter wavelengths. We then tested the photostability of the <italic>cis</italic> form in the dark (in the absence of illumination). The absorbance spectrum of the 365 nm PSS kept in the dark did not evolve after 24h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) indicating a very strong photostability of the <italic>cis</italic> isomer in aqueous solution in the dark. This very high stability is interesting because it avoids the prolonged use of UV to keep OptoNAMs in <italic>cis</italic>. OptoNAM-3 could finally endure many illumination cycles without degradation. Indeed, UV-visible spectra acquired after alternating illumination of OptoNAM-3 with UV light and green light during ten cycles were perfectly superimposable for each wavelength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>OptoNAM-3 is a potent NAM of GluN1/GluN2B NMDARs with a photodependent activity</title><p id="P10">The activity of OptoNAM-3 was then monitored by electrophysiology on Xenopus oocytes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). To assess the light-dependent effect, we tested the activities of the dark PSS (mostly <italic>trans</italic>) and the UV PSS (mostly <italic>cis</italic>, see above) separately. For each concentration, we made one solution that was divided into two samples: one in which the compound was kept in the dark for the duration of the experiment (dark PSS state), and one that was pre-illuminated with UV light (350 or 365 nm: UV PSS) and then kept out of the light for the duration of the experiment to avoid photoisomerization of the compounds by ambient light (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Due to their high photostability, the <italic>cis</italic>-OptoNAM-3 did not show any relaxation to the <italic>trans</italic> state during the several hours of experimentation. We generated dose-response curves of OptoNAM-3 dark and UV PSS on wild-type (wt) GluN1/GluN2B NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) in the presence of saturating concentrations of agonists (glutamate and glycine). OptoNAM-3 had an IC<sub>50</sub> of 380 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>) in the dark, which is in the same range of activity as its parent compound <bold>3</bold> (Ki = 93 nM, ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>); <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). In addition, OptoNAM-3 displayed a significant photo-dependent activity, since its IC<sub>50</sub> for GluN1/GluN2B NMDARs increased by 4.5 and 11.5-fold compared to the dark condition when the solution was pre-illuminated with 365 and 350 nm light, respectively (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.7 μM and 4.38 μM at 365 and 350 nm, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). To gain further insights into the photo-dependence of OptoNAM-3 activity, we calculated the theoretical dose-response curve of a pure <italic>cis</italic>-OptoNAM-3 population, knowing that solutions pre-illuminated with 365 nm and 350 nm contain respectively 25% and 6% of residual <italic>trans</italic>-OptoNAM-3, and assuming that the dose-response curve in the dark represents the activity of a pure <italic>trans</italic> population (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Our calculations show that the <italic>cis</italic> isomer is inactive on GluN1/GluN2B NMDARs and that the residual activity observed after UV illumination entirely results from the activity of the remaining <italic>trans</italic> isomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A, B</xref>). The activity of OptoNAM-3 is therefore strongly photo-dependent with an active <italic>trans</italic> isomer and an inactive <italic>cis</italic> isomer. The separation of effect between dark and UV conditions is only limited by the photochemical properties (i.e. the proportion of <italic>trans</italic> remaining after UV illumination) of the compound.</p><p id="P11">NMDARs exist as multiple subtypes in the brain that are formed by the combination of two GluN1 and either two identical (di-heteromers) or different (tri-heteromers) GluN2 (GluN2A-D) subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). We assessed the selectivity of <italic>trans-</italic>OptoNAM-3 (dark PSS) for the other most abundant NMDAR subtypes in the adult forebrain aside from GluN1/GluN2B di-heteromers: GluN1/GluN2A di-heteromers and GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B tri-heteromers. 1 μM of OptoNAM-3, which induces 69% inhibition of GluN1/GluN2B diheteromeric NMDARs, induced minimal inhibition (2.7%) of GluN1/GluN2A diheteromers and had slightly stronger effect on GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromeric NMDARs (11.4% inhibition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Like other ifenprodil derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>), OptoNAM-3 is therefore selective for GluN2B-containing NMDARs with a marked preference for GluN1/GluN2B di-heteromers over GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B tri-heteromers.</p><p id="P12">We finally investigated the location of OptoNAM-3 binding-site on the receptor.

By mutating residues selectively disrupting binding of the compounds in one or the other pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), we show that OptoNAM-3 binds the ifenprodil binding pocket and not the EVT-101 pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>).

To answer this question, we turned to mammalian cells, whose transparency allows homogeneous illumination of all membrane-expressed NMDARs. OptoNAM-3 was perfused during application of agonists on HEK cells expressing GluN1/GluN2B receptors. When applied in the dark, 2 μM OptoNAM-3 induced 77% inhibition of GluN1/GluN2B currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). This inhibition was partially abolished by UV (365 nm) illumination (23% remaining inhibition) and partially restored by 550 nm illumination (59% inhibition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). OptoNAM-3 thus allows real-time reversible inhibition of GluN1/GluN2B activity with light. We furthermore plotted the effect of different concentrations of OptoNAM-3 in the dark and during UV illumination and observed a 20-fold UV-induced shift of OptoNAM-3 IC<sub>50</sub> compared to the dark condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).

After docking, we first performed three simulations of 1 μs with no constraints. They all started from the same structure, but were assigned different initial random velocities during the equilibration procedure (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). We followed the evolution of two dihedral angles during these simulations: one that describes the orientation of the NH from aniline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), and one that describes the orientation of one of the azo group relative to the central azobenzene phenyl (C-C-N=N dihedral angle; orientation of azo; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). During these simulations, the C-N=N-C angles from the azo group stayed at 180° i.e. OptoNAM-3 did not convert from <italic>trans</italic> to <italic>cis</italic>.</p><p id="P22">We observed however that both the aniline and C-C-N=N angles could interconvert between 0° and 180° (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>). Thus, the ligand is flexible in the active site with different possible conformations, and in particular different conformations of the terminal phenyl-azo moiety. We furthermore observed that the protein was also quite flexible. Indeed, the distance between GluN1 and GluN2B NTD lower lobes significantly increased during the simulation (35 Å between the Cα of GluN1-K179 and GluN2B-K185 at the end of the simulations vs 25 Å in the 5EWJ crystal structure). This can easily be explained by the fact that we are simulating a dimer of isolated GluN1 and GluN2B NTDs, whose relative orientation is usually constrained by the rest of the protein in the full-length receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). We thus decided to perform new simulations where the protein heavy atoms were restrained close to the crystallographic position by a soft harmonic potential of 100 kJ/mol/nm<sup>2</sup>. One simulation started from the same initial conformation of OptoNAM-3 as before (C-C-N=N angle of 141°, called Rot1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), whereas in the other we manually rotated the C-C-N=N dihedral angle by 180° (going from 141° to -39°, Rot2 rotamer; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>) to reflect the OptoNAM-3 conformational mobility observed in the first round of simulations. As expected, the restraints rigidified the protein, and the distance between GluN1 and GluN2B lower lobes remained around 25 Å. In both simulations, the angle that describes the aniline orientation stayed around 0°, whereas the C-C-N=N angle was respectively of 172° and -17° in average for Rot1 and Rot2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B</xref>).

We first modeled the absorption properties in water with an implicit scheme where the solvent is represented by a continuum and not by explicit solvent molecules. The computed vertical energies and oscillator strength (f) of OptoNAM-3 are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref> using the B2PLYP functional.

We then investigated the absorption properties of the two rotamers of bound OptoNAM-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). The computed vertical excitation and oscillator strength (f) of the 11 snapshots are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref> for each rotamer. On average the n → π* excitation energy of Rot1 is similar to the one of free-OptoNAM-3 but the n → π* excitation energy of Rot2 is 0.11 eV (20 nm) red-shifted compared to Rot1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S2 and S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). The second major observation is the difference of the computed oscillator strength (f) of the n → π* between the two rotamers, which is in average 10-fold higher for Rot2 than for Rot1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). This dimensionless number can be defined as the probability of absorption in a defined transition. This suggests that the probability of <italic>trans</italic>-<italic>cis</italic> photoconversion can be 10-fold higher for Rot2 than for Rot1.</p><p id="P25">To investigate the molecular origin of the red-shift in Rot2 absorption, we plotted the relationships between the computed wavelengths of the different snapshots and three different torsion angles of OptoNAM-3: the previously defined C-C-N=N angle; torsion of the azo bond (C-N=N-C); and torsion of the distal azobenzene phenyl relative to the azo bond (N=N-C-C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B-D</xref>). We observed a strong correlation between the N=N-C-C torsion angle and the n → π* absorption energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). The distal part of the azobenzene moiety was more planar (i.e. closer to 180°) in Rot2, which corresponded to lower excitation energies (higher absorption wavelengths) (salmon dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). On the other hand, Rot1 adopted more twisted conformations on this side of the molecule (grey dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7C</xref>), which were closer to the conformations of free OptoNAM-3 in water (blue dots in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7C</xref>). Rot2 isomers furthermore displayed slightly more twisted azo bonds (C-N=N-C angle), which also correlated with a higher absorption wavelength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7B</xref>). There was no correlation between the C-C-N=N angle and bound OptoNAM-3 absorption properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7D</xref>). It therefore seems that the red-shift of Rot2 n → π* transition in its binding-site is due to geometrical constraints imposed by the protein on the ligand, especially on the extremity of the azobenzene moiety. To confirm this hypothesis, we dissected the electrostatic and geometric contributions of the protein environment to Rot1 and Rot2 transition energies. For both Rot1 and Rot2, re-computing the vertical transition energies in absence of the protein (but keeping the conformations intact) did not significantly affect the compound transition energies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>, lines 1 and 2). On the other hand, removal of the protein and re-optimization of the compound geometries in vacuum induced a 11 nm red-shift of Rot1 transition and a slight, 5 nm blue shift of Rot2 transition, so that the two isomers have similar n → π* transition energies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>, line 3). Rot 1 and Rot2 N=N-C-C angles are much closer to 180° in vacuum (175.41° and 178.89° respectively), which is consistent with our previous analysis correlating a higher torsion angle to a higher n → π* transition wavelength.</p><p id="P26">In conclusion, the red-shift in bound OptoNAM-3 properties observed experimentally is likely due to geometrical constraints imposed on a specific rotamer of OptoNAM-3, Rot2. While Rot1 adopts similar, twisted conformations whether free or bound to NMDARs, the shape of the binding site imposes a “flatter” conformation to Rot2 of bound OptoNAM-3, hence inducing a red-shift in its n → π* transition. Given the much stronger oscillator strength of Rot2 n → π* transition compared to Rot1, we expect Rot2 to dominate the spectral properties of bound OptoNAM-3.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>OptoNAM-3 controls GluN2B-dependent pathological processes and animal behavior in a red-shifted, photo-dependent manner</title><p id="P27">We first investigated whether OptoNAM-3 could be used in the context of a patho-physiological process related to GluN1/GluN2B receptors.

Their baseline locomotion was recorded for three minutes in the dark, after which they were incubated for 45 minutes in a solution containing either 0.1% DMSO (control) or 5 μM OptoNAM-3 (refer to <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9A</xref> for details). For each condition (control and OptoNAM-3), tadpole locomotion was recorded for three minutes in the dark, followed by cycles of one-minute illumination at 365 nm and 550 nm, interspersed with three-minute rest periods to avoid bias due to a post-stimulation refractory period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9A</xref>). We also conducted the same protocol using 460/550 nm light cycles, as OptoNAM-3 can switch from <italic>trans</italic> to <italic>cis</italic> state when bound to the receptor upon exposure to blue light at 460 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, E</xref>). Tadpole travelled distance was calculated from precise position coordinates of tadpole body parts across frames, assessed by automatic position multi-animal tracking using the open-source program DEEPLABCUT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>). Xenopus <italic>laevis</italic> tadpoles present non visual photoreceptors that generate a photomotor response characterized by an increase of activity upon UV light illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). We indeed observed a small increase of tadpole locomotion with UV compared to 550 nm light in the control condition (up to 1.5-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, B and S9B, C, grey points). The photodependent effect of OptoNAM-3 on locomotion was therefore quantified by calculating the travelled distance normalized twice: by the tadpole baseline locomotion (to decrease inter-individual variability linked to locomotion speed) and, for each condition, by the locomotion of the control group (to remove the unspecific effect of UV light). After incubation with OptoNAM-3, tadpoles from the UV/visible and blue/green cycles protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A, C and B, D</xref>, respectively) exhibited in the dark a 35% and 50% reduction in locomotor activity, respectively, in comparison to the baseline condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C, D</xref>). Their locomotion could be restored to baseline activity with UV light at 365 nm or blue light at 460 nm and inhibited again with 550 nm for two cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C, D</xref>). Consequently, OptoNAM-3 enables fast and reversible control of tadpole locomotion using light. In addition, the compound red-shifted properties observed <italic>in vitro</italic> were conserved <italic>in vivo</italic>. OptoNAM-3 therefore holds great promise to photocontrol native GluN2B-NMDARs with the high biocompatibility of red-shifted photoswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">Antagonists selective for GluN2B-NMDARs are routinely used to investigate GluN2B-NMDAR function but their slow rate of action is a strong limiting factor for their use in native tissues. To improve their temporal resolution of action, we have designed a photoswitchable, GluN2B-selective NAM, OptoNAM-3, whose activity could be reversibly turned on and off with light. OptoNAM-3 combined good photochemical properties in solution with efficient <italic>trans</italic>-to-<italic>cis</italic> and <italic>cis</italic>-to-<italic>trans</italic> conversions by UV and blue-green light, respectively; a very strong photostability of its <italic>cis</italic> isomer (&gt;24h); and no signs of bleaching or degradation after 10 cycles of illumination. In the dark (<italic>trans</italic> isomer), OptoNAM-3 combined all the pharmacological properties of GluN2B-selective NAMs: a submicromolar potency (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.38 μM) in the same range as ifenprodil and OptoNAM-3 parent compound potencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>); a strong selectivity for GluN2B- over GluN2A-NMDARs, and the same binding site as ifenprodil derivatives. Inhibition by OptoNAM-3 could be relieved by UV light with a large separation of activity (up to 20-fold) between its dark and UV PSS, which lie in the same range as previously published optopharmacological agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>). By taking into account the proportion of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> isomers composing OptoNAM-3 365 and 350 nm PSS, we demonstrated that the remaining inhibition observed after illumination of OptoNAM-3 with UV light was only mediated by the residual <italic>trans</italic> isomer present in the UV PSS. OptoNAM-3 activity is therefore strongly photodependent with one active <italic>trans</italic> isomer and one inactive <italic>cis</italic> isomer. The amplitude of OptoNAM-3 photodependence of effect is thus solely limited by the photochemical properties (i.e. the proportion of <italic>trans</italic> remaining after UV illumination) of the compound.</p><p id="P31">OptoNAM-3 allowed fast and reversible photomodulation of GluN2B-NMDAR activity in mammalian cells (HEK cells and cultured cortical neurons). In this experimental setting, in which <italic>trans</italic>-OptoNAM-3 was first equilibrated in the cell membrane and inside the GluN1/GluN2B receptor before being irradiated with 365 nm light, we observed a stronger separation of activities between the dark and UV conditions (~20-fold shift in IC<sub>50</sub>) than when the compound was first UV irradiated and then applied onto the cell (4.5-fold shift in IC<sub>50</sub>, see above). Given our previous results, this suggested that the photochemical properties of OptoNAM-3 in solution and in a cellular context were different. Indeed, by performing a comprehensive comparison of OptoNAM-3 spectral properties (i.e. proportion of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> isomers under illumination wavelengths from 365 to 580 nm) in solution (free OptoNAM-3) and in a cellular context (bound OptoNAM-3), we observed a strong red shift in the spectral properties of the <italic>trans</italic>-to-<italic>cis</italic> and <italic>cis</italic>-to-<italic>trans</italic> transitions of bound OptoNAM-3 compared to free OptoNAM-3. As a consequence, 460 nm light was almost as efficient as 365 nm light to relieve inhibition by <italic>trans</italic>-OptoNAM-3, while in solution a majority of <italic>trans</italic> isomer was present in the 460 nm PSS. This has important consequences for <italic>in vivo</italic> applications, since use of blue light would be less toxic and have better tissue penetration than UV light (see below). This red-shifting of OptoNAM-3 properties suggests that, when OptoNAM-3 is first equilibrated onto the cell before illumination, photoswitching occurs within the binding site and that the observed red-shifting of OptoNAM-3 photochemical properties stems from the interaction of the molecule with its binding-site.</p><p id="P32">These changes of OptoNAM-3 spectral properties could not be simply mimicked by changing the polarity of the medium, although we observed a more efficient <italic>trans</italic>-to-<italic>cis</italic> isomerization by 365 nm light in DMSO. Instead, molecular dynamics simulations showed that OptoNAM-3 could bind as two distinct rotamers differing by the orientation of the distal phenylazo moiety (Rot1 and Rot2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>) in the GluN1/GluN2B NTD dimer interface. DFT calculations of the electronic transitions of these two OptoNAM-3 rotamers within their binding-site, revealed that the n→π* transition of the Rot2 isomer was shifted by 20 nm towards higher wavelengths and its absorption coefficient increased by 10-fold. We showed that this red-shift was due to geometrical constraints imposed by the binding site, which stabilized Rot2 azobenzene moiety in a less twisted conformation than in water. Our findings are consistent with previous experiments and simulations showing an increase in n→π* transition energies (and hence a blue-shift in the n→π* absorption bands) as the phenylazo moieties rotate away from planarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>). This is particularly true for ortho-substituted azobenzenes, in which addition of substituents at the azobenzene ortho positions induces a red-shift in their n→π* transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>), due to electronic repulsions between the nitrogen lone pairs and the ortho-substituents. This red-shift is less important in twisted, ortho-substituted azobenzenes compared to the ones retaining a more planar structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>). One can thus assume a similar explanation for the origin of the red-shift of bound Rot2 spectral properties. Differences in photochemical properties between free and bound ligands are not well documented in the literature. Such drastic red-shifting of spectral properties has however been previously observed for a photoswitchable AMPA receptor competitive antagonist, ShuBQX-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>). The authors attributed this shift to the interaction of ShuBQX-3 azobenzene moiety with an arginine in the inhibitor binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>). In their case, free arginine induced a 75 nm red-shift of ShuBX-3 π→π* transition in solution, but the actual impact on the compound spectrum of ShuBQX-3/arginine interaction within the protein was not confirmed by quantum calculations. Given the strong dependence of azobenzene photochemical properties on the molecule geometry and chemical environment, it is highly probable that alterations of the photoswitching properties of photosensitive compounds when bound to their target are more common than currently thought.</p><p id="P33">While OptoNAM-3 dissociation rate in the dark was slow (τ <italic>~</italic> 30 s), similarly to other GluN2B-selective NAMs, the reduction of inhibition by UV light was rapid (τ <italic>~</italic> 1 s). As previously said, the slow dissociation rate of GluN2B-selective NAMs represents a problem when using them in native tissues, in which the effects of the compounds become irreversible. In contrast, the fast light-induced onset and offset of OptoNAM-3 inhibition, in the second time range, should allow dynamic tuning of GluN2B-NMDAR activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. This fast decrease of inhibition is most likely due the <italic>trans</italic>-to-<italic>cis</italic> photo-conversion of OptoNAM-3 inside its binding site. It remains unclear, however, whether the formed <italic>cis</italic>-OptoNAM-3 dissociates from its binding site or remains there as a silent modulator. Photoswitching within the binding site was previously described in mGlu receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>), AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>), as well as at the orthosteric glutamate site of NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>). In the latter study, the authors used this property to induce deactivation of NMDARs with much faster kinetics than after glutamate uncaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>). Hence, our study confirms that receptor photocontrol using photoswichable ligands is very powerful in that it allows to break the temporal limitations not only of ligand diffusion, but also of ligand association/dissociation.</p><p id="P34">The 20-fold shift of OptoNAM-3 between dark and UV conditions, its red-shifted properties, as well as the fast kinetics of light-induced GluN2B-NMDAR inhibition and disinhibition observed <italic>in vitro</italic> suggest that our compound should be a powerful tool to dynamically modulate GluN2B-NMDAR activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, in the dark OptoNAM-3 inhibited the locomotion of Xenopus tadpoles, a process involving NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). Locomotion could be restored to control levels by either application of UV (at 365 nm) or blue light (at 460 nm), and inhibited again by application of visible light (550 nm) for 2 cycles. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments therefore confirm the in-situ, red-shifted properties of OptoNAM-3. Since blue light is less toxic and has better tissue penetration than UV light, OptoNAM-3 is a promising compound to reversibly control GluN2B-NMDAR activity in the mammalian brain.</p><p id="P35">A large number of soluble, photoswitchable ligands have been currently developed for many different targets including receptors, ion channels and enzymes (see, for instance, refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>). In iGluRs, the large majority of previously developed photoswitchable compounds are competitive agonists and antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>), with a few compounds targeting the ion channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>). However, none of these compounds display subtype selectivity. In this work we have developed the first photoswitchable allosteric modulator of NMDARs, OptoNAM-3, which selectively targets GluN2B-NMDARs. In addition to being more specific than competitive ligands and pore blockers, allosteric modulators preserve the endogenous patterns of receptor activity, since they do not prevent binding of the endogenous agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>). This limits the toxicity and desensitization linked to untimed receptor activation/inhibition. OptoNAM-3 combines the high potency and selectivity of classical GluN2B-selective NMDAR antagonists with faster kinetics of action, improved reversibility and red-shifted properties that make it highly biocompatible. This compound should thus allow selective, local and time-controlled inhibition of GluN2B-NMDARs in native systems. It should thus lead to a better understanding of the physio-pathological roles of this class of receptors in the brain, as well as to better tolerated drugs to counteract neurological diseases linked to NMDAR overactivation.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="P36">Salts, D-serine, DTPA (diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid), glucose, L-glutamate, glycine, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide), α-cyclodextrin, γ-cyclodextrin, uridine and 5-Fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA); D-APV (D-(-)-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid) and N-methyl-D-aspartate from HelloBio (County Meath, ROI) and gentamycin from GIBCO (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD, USA).

The plate was positioned on optical cast plastic infrared filters, which allowed only wavelengths above 650 nm to pass, and red light (770 nm at 15% intensity) was continuously applied during recording to enable video recording in the dark. To habituate the tadpoles, the red light was gradually increased to 15% (0.03 mW) over a 15-minute period, and their baseline locomotion was recorded for 3 minutes. Subsequently, the tadpoles were incubated in the dark for 30 minutes in a 60 x 15 mm petri dish containing 5 mL of either the vehicle (0.1% DMSO in MBS 0.1X) or OptoNAM-3 solution (5 μM in MBS 0.1X) to facilitate drug penetration.

Once the model achieved satisfactory training (network evaluation with a 1.3-pixel error for both training and testing), the video was analyzed, and individual tadpole traveled distances were calculated based on the x and y pixel coordinates of the labels provided by the data sheet obtained from video analysis. The stomach traveled distance yielded the best results; therefore, the tadpole traveled distance reported here represents the distance traveled by the “stomach” label. Since the identity of the 3 tadpoles could not be determined across the videos, the mean of the traveled distance per 3 tadpoles in one well was calculated in order to do a paired statistical test between light conditions.

Data points from 435 and 580 nm represented in this figure were scaled between 365 nm and dark conditions (see Method for calculation protocol). <bold>(I)</bold> UV-visible spectra of a solution of OptoNAM-3 in the dark (black curve), after 365 nm illumination (violet curve) and subsequent illumination with 460 (blue curve) or 550 nm (green curve). Inset, absorbance at the peak absorbance wavelength of the dark state (329 nm) of OptoNAM-3 following illumination at various wavelengths of the 365 nm PSS. <bold>(J)</bold> Proportion of <italic>trans</italic> isomer in OptoNAM-3 PSS obtained upon irradiation with various wavelengths of the OptoNAM-3 365 nm PSS either in solution or in a cellular context (same calculation methods as in Panel E). This graph reveals a red-shifted and less efficient <italic>cis</italic>-to-<italic>trans</italic> photoconversion in a cellular context (OptoNAM-3 likely in its binding site) than in solution.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS189766-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Molecular simulations of OptoNAM-3 in solution and in its binding site.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> 3D representation of <italic>trans</italic>-OptoNAM-3 Rot1 (grey) and Rot2 (salmon) and definition of the two dihedral angles (displayed as balls and sticks) that were monitored during molecular dynamics simulations. <bold>(B)</bold> Docking poses of <italic>trans</italic>-OptoNAM-3 Rot1 (grey) and Rot 2 (salmon) in their binding site: like ifenprodil, at the interface between GluN1 (green) and GluN2B (blue) NTD upper lobes.

This linear correlation shows that a higher torsion angle (lower twist) of the azobenzene leads to a red-shift of the absorption peak.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS189766-f005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>OptoNAM-3 photomodulates Xenopus tadpole locomotion <italic>in vivo</italic>.</title><p><bold>(A, B)</bold> Positions (represented by dots) of a tadpole’s stomach in a well taken every 40 ms during 3 minutes of recording for baseline and dark conditions, and 1 minute of recording for either 365 nm and 550 nm illumination cycles (A), or 460 nm and 550 nm illumination cycles (B).
