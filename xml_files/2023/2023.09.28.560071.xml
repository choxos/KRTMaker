To include all amino acids of the peptide and the CDR3 as given in the PDB database, the amino acids sequence of each was represented by a ‘sliding window’ of five amino acids, containing two amino acids adjacent to it on its N terminal side and two amino acids adjacent to it on its C terminal side.

Indeed, the highest learning performance has been shown for epitopes that share some similarity with epitopes present in the training data(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Moris <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). To address this issue we clustered the peptides in our dataset into folds by peptide similarity, where each fold contained all peptides that were similar to each other. Peptide inter-sequence similarity was measured by Levenshtein distance (LD)(Levenshtein VI, 1966), that sums the number of amino acid insertions/ deletions/substitutions. 232 unique peptide sequences were clustered into sixteen groups, each contained peptides that are similar by a total LD of four or less, which are equivalent to ∼40% similarity, with each peptide present in a single cluster. We set this strict similarity threshold based on evidence that a TCR can bind to peptides that are distinct at five or six positions from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Hausmann <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>).

To reduce mislabeling of pairing TCRs with epitope-peptides to which they may cross-react, we clustered the epitope-peptides by sequence similarity before pairing them with the TCRs. As in the positive training set, we clustered the 232 unique epitope-peptides in the dataset into sixty-eight clusters, each cluster contained all peptides that were similar by at least 40% (LD = &lt; 4). We then generated the random TCR-peptide pairs for the negative training and testing sets: each TCR’s alpha-beta CDR3 in the negative set was paired with epitope peptides from a different epitope cluster than that of the original pair in the train set, minimizing the chance for false negative results.

To predict whether the peptide and the CDR3, as wholes, actually bind each other we trained and tested another machine learning model, based on the prediction generated by the first classifier (scheme is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). To train this machine, we relied on a positive set of 4370 TCR-peptide pairs that are known to bind each other and an assumed negative set of 60,000 pairs that are not known to bind each other (see Methods). We did not use, and did not have, any structural information for these pairs.</p><p id="P33"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> shows the precision-recall (PR) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves from the three models tested.

ROC curve shows that the performance of the alpha- based model was similar to random (Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.474).

In the severe/critical group, only 9 of the TCR were predicted to bind five peptides with this score. In these patients, one of the TCRs got this score for 301 peptides.

We suggest that pairing TCRs with peptides that belong to an entirely different cluster helped reduce the falsely labeled negative samples. We acknowledge, however, that with this design it is impossible to assess how well the method predicts the effect of small changes in a peptide. We refrained from using unpaired TCRs from healthy subjects in our negative data as such data probably includes pathology-related sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Madi <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P42">Analyzing the experimentally solved TCR-peptide complexes, we found that the alpha and beta chains differ in their peptide binding preferences. Beta chains favor hydrophobic and anion-pi interactions, which contribute to binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) and are relatively stable as they require less structural precision to obtain the same binding affinity of a peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Singh <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). The models that we trained on beta chain dataset alone outperformed the ones trained on the alpha chain or on mixed data sets composed of both alpha and beta chains sequences. This was true for both our models. The fact that we got good generic learning (i.e., of the unseen-epitope problem) with beta chain CDR3 data alone may be helpful for future deep learning models, as data on this chain is abundant in TCR-epitope databases.</p><p id="P43">A potential application of the model is to find the antigenic specificities of T cells of unknown specificity. We propose that using a computational model as the first step in such analyses may be a simpler and faster alternative that expands the available fitness landscape. We used our model to match TCRs from COVID-19 infected patients with potential cognate epitopes. Our prediction suggests that patients with severe disease may have fewer SARS-Cov2 TCRs than patients with mild disease.</p><p id="P44">This may be consistent with studies that found in antibodies that the potency of the immune response to SARS-Cov2 is predictive of survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Garcia-Beltran <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec

A model based on the alpha CDR3 alone, a model based on the beta CDR3 alone, and a model that is trained on both chains. The input to the prediction models is the sequence of a peptide and a sequence of a CDR3 beta. The output is a score for whether they bind each other or not. The test set is based on peptides new to the machine that were different by more than 40% from the peptides the machine had been trained on. For recall level of ∼43% the model correctly predicts 85% of the interacting pairs (point marked by a star). For recall 18%, precision is approximately 99% (point marked by a star).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS188952-f003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p id="P49">Performance of POP-UP TCR on an independent dataset, VDJdb (Bagaev DV, Vroomans RMA, Samir J, Stervbo U, Rius C, Dolton G, Greenshields-Watson A, Attaf M, Egorov ES, Zvyagin IV, Babel N, Cole DK, Godkin AJ, Sewell AK, Kesmir C, Chudakov DM, Luciani F, 2019).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS188952-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p id="P50">Model applications on the 40 most common SARS-Cov2 TCR beta CDR3 sequences that do not have a known cognate epitope(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Liao <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Twenty CDR3 sequences were from patients with moderate disease and twenty sequences were from patients who were in severe or critical condition. Each TCR’s beta CDR3 was submitted to the model with all possible 545 peptides, creating 21,800 prediction scores. TCRs from moderate COVID-19 patients have significantly stronger predictions for binding SARS-Cov2 peptide epitopes compared to TCRs from patients in severe/critical condition (Student’s t-test, p-value &lt;0.001)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS188952-f005"/></fig></floats-group></article>
