Wnt signalling pathway, typically via missense mutations within a degron hotspot motif in exon 3. Here, we combine saturation genome editing with a fluorescent reporter assay to quantify signalling phenotypes for all 342 missense mutations in the mutation hotspot, including 74 recurrent mutations reported in over 6000 tumours. Our data define the genetic requirements for β-catenin degron function and reveal diverse levels of signal activation among known driver mutations. Tumorigenesis in different human tissues involves selection for <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutations spanning distinct ranges of effect size. In hepatocellular carcinoma, mutations that activate β-catenin relatively weakly are associated with worse prognosis compared to stronger activating mutations, despite greater immune cell infiltration in the tumour microenvironment. Our work therefore provides a resource to understand mutational diversity within a pan-cancer mutation hotspot, with potential implications for targeted therapy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The canonical Wnt signalling pathway is essential for normal development and is erroneously activated in many types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Clevers and Nusse 2012</xref>). The main intracellular signal transducer is β-catenin, encoded by the <italic>CTNNB1</italic> gene. Under normal conditions the level of β-catenin available for signalling is kept low by a destruction complex consisting of APC, AXIN2, CK1 and GSK3β. In the presence of Wnt ligands or mutations that reduce destruction complex function, β-catenin accumulates, enters the nucleus and activates target genes via association with TCF transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P3"><italic>APC</italic> loss-of-function mutations occur in most colorectal cancers. Gain-of-function changes within a degron motif in <italic>CTNNB1</italic> exon 3 are among the most common mutations in cancers of the liver and endometrium and occur frequently in tumours originating in several other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Çelen et al. 2015</xref>). A large body of work has demonstrated that mutations within this pan-cancer hotspot region act in a dominant manner by blocking destruction complex activity (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gao et al. 2018</xref>)). Positions 32 – 37 of CTNNB1 comprise the DpSGXXpS docking motif for the E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate receptor β-TRCP, where pS denotes phosphoserine and X any residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wu et al. 2003</xref>). The phospho-regulatory cascade involves an initial CK1-mediated phosphorylation at S45 (‘CK1 priming’), followed by GSK3β - mediated phosphorylation at positions T41, S37 and S33 to enable β-TRCP docking.</p><p id="P4">Analysis of <italic>APC</italic> mutations in patient tumour material and mouse models has shown that tumours often select for mutations that result in a specific ‘just-right’ level of β-catenin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Albuquerque et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Pollard et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Feng et al. 2015</xref>). However, although analysis of a limited number of mutations within <italic>CTNNB1</italic> has suggested that different mutations can activate to different degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Rebouissou et al. 2016</xref>), how the full spectrum of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutational diversity impacts on signalling and tumorigenesis is unknown.</p><sec id="S1"><title><italic>CTNNB1</italic> hotspot mutational patterns are tissue specific</title><p id="P5">In order to catalogue the complexity of β-catenin mutations in human cancer, we analysed 9248 tumours with <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutations in the COSMIC database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Çelen et al. 2015</xref>), the majority of mutations (86%) were missense substitutions. Of these, 88% occurred in the L31-S48 hotspot region encoded by exon 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C &amp; 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Residues T41 and S45 were mutated most frequently in this pan-cancer analysis, comprising 27% and 25% of all hotspot missense mutations, followed by S37, S33, D32 and G34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We next analysed the distribution of missense mutations in the hotspot region within cancers originating from different primary tissue sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S1</xref>). Tumours associated with some primary sites tended to favour mutations at particular codon positions within the hotspot. For example, S45 mutations are greatly enriched in tumours originating in the adrenal gland and kidney, whereas mutations within the β-TCRP recognition motif were favoured in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Other tissues such as the liver and skin showed a comparatively broad profile, with mutations distributed across each of the 6 most frequently mutated positions. At individual positions, we also observed biases in the specific amino acid substitutions that were observed across tumour sites. For example, 99% of soft tissue tumours with T41 mutations (1201/1217) carried T41A whereas in pituitary gland, 89% of T41 mutations (77/87) were T41I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S1</xref>). Overall, it is clear that there is substantial diversity in the mutational patterns seen in tumours within the <italic>CTNNB1</italic> hotspot.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Mutational scanning reveals diverse consequences of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> hotspot mutations</title><p id="P7">To systematically measure the consequences of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> hotspot mutations on β-catenin signalling, we devised a multiplexed CRISPR homology-directed repair assay to quantify the phenotypes resulting from all 342 possible single amino acid substitutions across positions 31 - 48. This assay allows phenotypic analysis of variants expressed from the endogenous mouse <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S2A &amp; S2B</xref>, Methods), which is 100% conserved with human at the amino acid level throughout exon 3. The function of each variant was measured in parallel, under normal regulatory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Findlay et al. 2014</xref>; 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Buckley et al. 2023</xref>), to provide a sensitive and comprehensive assessment of hotspot mutant phenotypes. A library of homology-directed repair (HDR) templates was synthesised, each encoding a single amino acid substitution within the hotspot and flanking synonymous nucleotide changes to enable selective PCR amplification of edited alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S2</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Findlay et al. 2014</xref>; 2018)).</p><p id="P8">To establish a system in which the phenotype of individual hotspot mutations could be measured in single cells, we derived primary embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from the Tcf/Lef::H2B-GFP transgenic mouse line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Ferrer-Vaquer et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Czechanski et al. 2014</xref>) then replaced exons 3 – 6 of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> with a negative counter selection cassette on one allele. By selectively targeting and replacing the selection cassette with a multiplexed HDR template library in combination with Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), this allowed us to efficiently generate and measure the functional consequences of different <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> hotspot mutations in a single experimental workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, full procedure described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S2</xref> and Methods).</p><p id="P9">After editing and selection, a subset of cells in the population expressed the Tcf/Lef::H2B-GFP reporter at elevated levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), consistent with Wnt pathway activation. Cells were sorted into six equally log-spaced bins (referred to as “bin P1-P6”) based on increasing reporter GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), and genomic DNA was purified and subjected to amplicon deep sequencing across the <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> hotspot region using primers that selectively amplified HDR-edited alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S2</xref>). In addition, amplicon sequencing was conducted on control samples including the untransfected HDR donor template library (“plasmid”), and on genomic DNA from cells that had been edited but not separated based on GFP expression (“pool”, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S3</xref>). This allowed us to enumerate the frequency of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> alleles associated with each range of reporter gene activity relative to their frequency in the total cell population. The resulting codon replacement frequencies showed high correlations between biological replicates (Pearson’s R, range 0.65 – 0.98), and were therefore merged for downstream analysis. Codon replacement frequencies also correlated well between plasmid and pool samples (Pearson’s R=0.63), indicating that HDR efficiency was consistent and unbiased throughout the targeted region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Whereas the replacement frequency was relatively constant across positions in the unsorted cell population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S3</xref>), it varied substantially across cells expressing different levels of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), confirming that different hotspot mutation patterns can lead to different levels of β-catenin activity. The codons with high mutation frequencies in tumours (D32, S33, G34, S37, T41 and S45) were found at low frequency in low activity bins, but made up a large proportion of sequences in bins of higher activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Mutations at these sites are known to disrupt β-catenin phospho-regulation and increase Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Morin et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Korinek et al. 1997</xref>), confirming the utility of this system to functionally classify <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutations.</p><p id="P11">We next reconstructed an average activity profile for each amino acid substitution by combining the codon replacement frequency in each of the 6 bins with the average fluorescence value of cells in the corresponding bin (Supplemental methods, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kosuri et al. 2013</xref>)). The resulting mutational effect scores (MES) provided a metric to compare the phenotypic consequences of different amino acid substitutions within the hotspot region to gain insight into β-catenin regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To evaluate the quality of this dataset, we compared the MES values with scores produced by 50 different computational variant effect predictors (VEPs) for the same substitutions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Livesey and Marsh 2023</xref>)). The strongest correlation with MES values was observed for EVE, a recently developed method that uses deep generative models to calculate variant effect scores from evolutionary sequence information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Frazer et al. 2021</xref>), and was recently shown to be a top-performing VEP when benchmarked against deep mutational scanning data and clinical variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Livesey and Marsh 2023</xref>). Notably, the correlation between the MES values for the <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutation hotspot and the corresponding EVE predictions (Spearman’s ρ=0.662, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S4A, S4B</xref>) was higher than observed for any other protein in this benchmarking study, and higher than observed for all but 3 out of 1430 VEP/DMS comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Livesey and Marsh 2023</xref>). Thus, the strong correlation we observe here is supportive of the high quality of the current dataset.</p><p id="P13">Notably, EVE predicted mutations at two codon positions (G38 and P44) to elicit substantially stronger phenotypes relative to the MES values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S4B, S4C</xref>). However, neither codon is frequently mutated in human cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), as would be expected if mutation at these sites activated the canonical WNT pathway. Thus our experimental mutational scanning strategy generates data that are broadly consistent with the best computational predictors, but also appear to be a more reliable guide to the roles of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutations in cancer.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Genotype/phenotype correlations within the <italic>CTNNB1</italic> hotspot</title><p id="P14">Although mutational scanning scored all 19 possible amino acid substitutions at each position, only a subset can be reached via a single nucleotide change in the human genome (105/342, median = 6 amino acid changes per site, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). As expected, this single nucleotide group included almost all (&gt;98%) of the single amino acid substitutions observed in the COSMIC database. Also as expected given the dual specificity of CK1 and GSK3β for phosphorylation at serine and threonine residues, S45T and T41S substitutions yielded low mutational effect scores relative to other substitutions at the same position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Prior studies have suggested that S45 mutations activate β-Catenin signalling only weakly, whereas T41 mutations activate moderately and mutations within the core β-TRCP docking motif (32/33/34/37) have strong effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Rebouissou et al. 2016</xref>). In agreement with this we found that mutations at position 45 tended to activate reporter gene expression to a lower level, on average, compared to 32/33/34/37, and this was true both for the single nucleotide mutation group and when all possible mutations were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In particular, substitution of S45 for small amino acids (alanine, glycine, cysteine) was well tolerated, despite removing the CK1 target site thought to be required for N-terminal phosphorylation events and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Amit et al. 2002</xref>). It has previously been reported that in-frame deletions at S45 still enable phosphorylation to occur at T41, S37 and S33 in colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Wang et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Parker et al. 2020</xref>). Collectively, the data therefore suggest that the absence of a large side chain at position S45 enables GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation without CK1 priming.</p><p id="P16">In our dataset, mutations at T41 had effects that were intermediate, on average, compared with mutations at S45 or within the β-TRCP docking motif, in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Rebouissou et al. 2016</xref>). However, essentially all cancer mutations at T41 are substitutions for alanine (A) or isoleucine (I). These strong T41 substitutions activate β-Catenin more than most substitutions at positions 32/33/34/37, including several found commonly in cancer (e.g. D32V, D32Y, D32H, S33P, G34R). It is therefore evident that different substitutions at the same position can elicit markedly different effects on β-Catenin signalling. This extends our understanding of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutational diversity, with potential implications for patient stratification.</p><p id="P17">The I35 residue occupies a central position in the docking motif that directly contacts β-TRCP, which has been suggested to require a hydrophobic amino acid side chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wu et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Çelen et al. 2015</xref>). Consistent with this, the I35 side chain can be seen to extend into a cavity on the β-TRCP surface in the co-crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wu et al. 2003</xref>)). MES values for different substitutions at I35 were broadly distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), and showed the expected negative correlation with a hydrophobicity index at this position (Spearman’s ρ=-0.42, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kyte and Doolittle 1982</xref>)). However, substitution of isoleucine for several polar amino acids (e.g. threonine, asparagine, tyrosine) yielded low MES values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>), showing that hydrophobic side chains are not necessary at this position for normal degron function. To investigate this further, we used the AAindex database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kawashima et al. 2008</xref>) to search for other physicochemical and biochemical amino acid properties that better explained the MES index at I35. Of 566 indices, we observed that those with the strongest correlations were nearly all related to secondary structure propensities. For example, a Spearman correlation of -0.79 was observed with the “normalised frequency of beta sheet” index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chou and Fasman 1978</xref>)). While residue I35 does not form a β-sheet specifically in any of the available crystal structures, its dihedral angles place it clearly in the β region of a Ramachandran plot.</p><p id="P18">To ask whether this secondary structure requirement extended to other β-TRCP docking sites in the proteome, we compiled a list of 28 high confidence β-TRCP-dependent degron sequences containing an exact match to the “DSGX” motif spanning β-Catenin positions 32 – 35 ((<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S4</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Low et al. 2014</xref>)). As expected, amino acid identity at position 4 of this motif (corresponding to I35 in β-Catenin) was variable across substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Numerous substrates (8/28) had position 4 amino acids that ranked in the 25% most disruptive on the hydrophobicity scale, whereas only 1/28 featured in the same bracket of the β -sheet scale (Fisher’s exact p = 0.0248). Thus, it appears that requirement for a specific extended backbone conformation can better explain the effects of substitutions at I35 of β-Catenin, and potentially equivalent positions of other β-TRCP docking sites, than the hydrophobicity of the side chain.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Tissue-specific <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutation patterns are driven by selection for optimal levels of Wnt signalling</title><p id="P19">There are notably different frequencies of individual <italic>CTNNB1</italic> hotspot mutations in different tumour types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S1</xref>), and this may reflect a variety of factors. Stem cells in different tissues are subject to different genotoxic insults, which affect overall mutational spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Alexandrov et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Blokzijl et al. 2016</xref>), and could thus affect the probability that particular nucleotide substitutions encoding missense mutations within the <italic>CTNNB1</italic> hotspot become available to selection. Alternatively, or in addition, different tissue environments might favour selection for missense mutations causing levels of activation that are optimal, or ‘just-right’, for their spatio-temporal context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Albuquerque et al. 2002</xref>). The current data provide an unusual opportunity to assess the roles of mutational bias and selection in the hotspot variants that accumulate during tumourigenesis.</p><p id="P20">It has previously been shown that mutational probability, calculated from background rates of nucleotide substitution, is a poor predictor of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutation patterns in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Muiños et al. 2021</xref>), suggesting a strong influence of selection. To extend these observations, we computed ‘Mutational Likelihood Scores’ (MLS) for each of 342 hotspot missense mutations, using the background rates of nucleotide substitution in Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Endometrial Carcinoma whole exome sequencing (WES) data from TCGA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S5A, S5B, S5C</xref>). These MLS scores represent the probability of an amino acid substitution, given the dominant mutational biases seen genome-wide in coding sequences of <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-mutant tumours. MLS values correlated positively across tissues (Pearson R = 0.920 for all mutations &amp; 0.655 for the single nucleotide group, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), but were not predictive of the observed mutation frequency in the corresponding tumour type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, negative binomial GLM, no improvement over null model, p<sc>lrt</sc>=0.77 and 0.60, respectively). The data therefore do not support the hypothesis that tissue-specific differences in observed <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutation patterns are primarily driven by the rates at which the specific mutations arise.</p><p id="P21">We next asked whether tumours arising in different tissues tend to favour hotspot mutations that activate ß-Catenin signalling to different degrees. This proved to be the case. Mutations in the Endometrial Carcinoma cohort from TCGA (UCEC) were enriched for higher MES values (Mann Whitney p = 2.2 x 10<sup>-5</sup>), whereas in the Hepatocellular Carcinoma cohort (LIHC), mutations spanned a broader range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Given that mutation bias does not explain the tissue-specific difference in observed mutation frequencies, we postulate they most likely arise via natural selection for different optimal levels of Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Albuquerque et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Even greater variation in MES values was observed in the larger COSMIC dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) across a range of <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-mutant tumours from different primary tissue sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, One-way ANOVA p &lt; 2 x 10<sup>-19</sup>). Tissues could be divided into categories based on the MES distribution: those which favoured mutations of relatively high effect (e.g. CNS, Pituitary), relatively low effect (e.g. Kidney, Adrenal Gland), or a broad or bimodal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Bimodal distributions were observed in tissues such as the Large Intestine and Liver, and comprised a lower effect group with mutations at S45 and weaker mutations within the β-TRCP docking motif (e.g. H36P, D32Y, S33P), and a higher effect group containing mutations at S33, G34, S37 And T41. These distributions highlight the potential for wide phenotypic variation, even in tumours with the same site of origin, as a result of mutations within the same <italic>CTNNB1</italic> hotspot region.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Clinical and molecular correlates of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutation strength in Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title><p id="P23">To gain insight into the effect of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutation strength on inter-tumour heterogeneity, we identified Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) samples from TCGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2017</xref>) with missense mutations in the exon 3 hotspot and available RNA-Seq data, and stratified them into STRONG (n = 47) and WEAK (n = 33) categories based on the bimodal distribution of MES scores observed in this cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Strikingly, survival was significantly poorer for tumours with WEAK mutations compared to those with either STRONG mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), or no <italic>CTNNB1</italic> pathway mutation (No mutation, n = 217, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).

These include other missense mutations in <italic>CTNNB1</italic> that occurred outside the hotspot region (OTHER, n = 19), primarily at positions 335, 383 and 387 within armadillo repeats 5 and 6, which have been shown to perturb interactions with the destruction complex subunit APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Liu et al. 2020</xref>). Moreover, a further 10% of the LIHC cohort had coding mutations in AXIN1 (n = 36): another destruction complex subunit and known HCC driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Feng et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2017</xref>)). We therefore explored the impact of these variants, which were ‘unseen’ by our mutational scanning assay, relative to WEAK and STRONG hotspot mutations on the CTNNB1 pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma. Based on published literature, we identified a set of 10 known ß-Catenin targets from among the top 50 upregulated genes in the transcriptomes of HCC tumours with any hotspot missense mutation, versus the NO MUTATION group. As expected, tumours with either WEAK or STRONG activating mutations in <italic>CTNNB1</italic> exon 3 expressed <italic>CTNNB1</italic> target genes at substantially higher levels compared to the NO MUTATION group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S7A</xref>).

Thus, although mutations in <italic>AXIN1</italic> and <italic>CTNNB1</italic> armadillo repeats clearly contribute to HCC development, their effects on β-Catenin target gene expression are distinct from both WEAK and STRONG activating mutations within <italic>CTNNB1</italic> exon 3 ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Feng et al. 2012</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abitbol et al. 2018</xref>)).</p><p id="P25">The differential expression of ß-Catenin targets in WEAK versus STRONG tumours was relatively subtle in comparison to the three other groups.

They also correlate with important molecular and clinical features of hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), which can be rationalised based on known pathways of ß-Catenin function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Ruiz de Galarreta et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hoffmeyer et al. 2012</xref>).

Second, the function of each variant was evaluated in parallel in the same population of cells, providing sensitivity to distinguish subtle differences in phenotype. Although our mutational scanning assay spanned just 2% of ß-Catenin amino acids, this covers over 75% of <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-mutant cancers in the COSMIC database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Tate et al. 2019</xref>)), including 74 different recurrent missense substitutions observed collectively in over 6000 tumours.</p><p id="P30">Using only experimentally determined mutational effect scores, we identified a subgroup of HCC patients characterised by relatively weak CTNNB1 pathway activation, immune infiltration and poor survival.

Weakly activating exon 3 mutations, which our work has systematically defined for the first time, could provide both a novel mechanism and biomarker for this patient group and, in the future, help to guide strategies for personalised combination-based therapies. ß-Catenin activation is a known mechanism of immune escape in other tumour types, notably melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Spranger et al. 2015</xref>), where exon 3 mutations also span a broad range of effect sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>).

The results shown here are based upon data generated by the TCGA Research Network: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancer.gov/tcga">https://www.cancer.gov/tcga</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Model to convert trinucleotide scores to mutational likelihood scores</title><p id="P50">All possible mutational paths from one codon to another, one nucleotide change at a time, were generated for all codon pairs. The mutational likelihood score (MLS) of each path was calculated as Π<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>freq<sub>i</sub></italic>) where <italic>freq<sub>i</sub></italic> is the tri-nucleotide context mutational frequency of the <italic>i<sup>th</sup></italic> step of the path. The MLS of each codon change in every possible tri-nucleotide context is the sum of all paths between the two codons, similarly the MLS for each amino acid change in its tri-nucleotide context is the sum of its codon change scores. Worked examples are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Table S10</xref>, and MLS scores calculated separately from TCGA-LIHC and UCEC are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Table S11</xref>. For statistical testing, we modelled observed mutation frequencies as the result of mutational likelihood score in the same tumour type, and using a negative binomial GLM, implemented in the R package MASS. We compared these fits to null models fitting only the mean using likelihood ratio tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Table S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS190956-supplement-Table_S1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d96aAdJbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Table S2</label><media xlink:href="EMS190956-supplement-Table_S2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d96aAdJcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Table S3</label><media xlink:href="EMS190956-supplement-Table_S3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d96aAdJdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Table S4</label><media xlink:href="EMS190956-supplement-Table_S4.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d96aAdJeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Table S5</label><media xlink:href="EMS190956-supplement-Table_S5.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d96aAdJfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Table S6</label><media xlink:href="EMS190956-supplement-Table_S6.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d96aAdJgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Table S7</label><media xlink:href="EMS190956-supplement-Table_S7.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d96aAdJhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Table S8</label><media xlink:href="EMS190956-supplement-Table_S8.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d96aAdJiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD9"><label>Table S9</label><media xlink:href="EMS190956-supplement-Table_S9.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d96aAdJjB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD10"><label>Table S10</label><media xlink:href="EMS190956-supplement-Table_S10.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d96aAdJkB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD11"><label>Table S11</label><media xlink:href="EMS190956-supplement-Table_S11.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d96aAdJlB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD12"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS190956-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d96aAdJmB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>PH acknowledges grant support from the MRC (MR/M010341/1) and BBSRC (BB/J004316/1).

of Wnt pathway regulation in normal development and in the presence of exon 3 degron mutations. (Left) In the absence of Wnt ligand, the destruction complex phosphorylates sites within the exon 3 degron to allow docking of the E3 ligase receptor β-TRCP, followed by ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome. (Centre) In the presence of Wnt ligand, the destruction complex is sequestered at the cell membrane. ß-Catenin accumulates and translocates to the nucleus where it associates with Tcf transcription factors to activate target genes. (Right) Exon 3 mutations prevent destruction complex activity to uncouple ß-Catenin accumulation from Wnt ligand binding, locking the pathway in the active state. <bold>B.</bold> Histogram showing the frequency of mutations at each amino acid position of human <italic>CTNNB1</italic> across all tumours present in the COSMIC database.

As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S4</xref>, primary murine ESCs were engineered such that exons 2 – 6 of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> were heterozygously replaced with a puroTK cassette. Two sgRNAs then cleave at either flank of this integrated cassette while leaving the wildtype allele unmodified. High throughput gene synthesis was used to generate double stranded DNA molecules encoding each individual amino acid substitution across positions 31 – 48 (n = 342 substitutions), which were then cloned into a vector containing 1kb homology arms on either side. <bold>C.</bold> Timeline for the multiplex editing assay to classify <italic>CTNNB1</italic> hotspot mutations.
