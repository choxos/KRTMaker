TOPOVIL is composed of two subunits (SPO11 and TOPOVIBL) and is evolutionarily related to the archaeal TopoVI topoisomerase complex. SPO11 is the TopoVIA subunit orthologue and carries the DSB formation catalytic activity. TOPOVIBL shares homology with the TopoVIB ATPase subunit. TOPOVIBL is essential for meiotic DSB formation, but its molecular function remains elusive, partly due to the lack of biochemical studies. Here, we purified TOPOVIBLΔC25 and characterized its structure and mode of action <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our structural analysis revealed that TOPOVIBLΔC25 adopts a dynamic conformation in solution and our biochemical study showed that the protein remains monomeric upon incubation with ATP, which correlates with the absence of ATP binding. Moreover, TOPOVIBLΔC25 interacted with DNA, with a preference for some geometries, suggesting that TOPOVIBL senses specific DNA architectures. Altogether, our study identified specific TOPOVIBL features that might help to explain how TOPOVIL function evolved toward a DSB formation activity in meiosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd><kwd>topoisomerase</kwd><kwd>TopoVI</kwd><kwd>TOPOVIBL</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In most organisms, the accurate segregation of the homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division depends on homologous recombination. This is initiated by the programmed formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) that is catalyzed by the conserved TOPOVIL complex and by its accessory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Eukaryotic TOPOVIL is composed of two subunits that are both essential for meiotic DSB formation: SPO11 and TOPOVIBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). The meiotic TOPOVIL complex is evolutionarily linked to the archaeal TopoVI type IIB topoisomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) that regulates DNA topology through the formation of transient DNA DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The archaeal TopoVI is composed of two subunits: TopoVIA and B (the orthologues of SPO11 and TOPOVIBL, respectively) that assemble as an A<sub>2</sub>/B<sub>2</sub> hetero-tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The A subunit is the catalytic part of the enzyme and the B subunit corresponds to the ATP binding region. Structural studies suggest that TopoVI relaxation activity is mainly driven by the B subunit motion, triggered by ATP binding/hydrolysis and interaction with DNA. It was proposed that the reaction cycle initiates by the binding of one DNA duplex (G DNA segment) to the A subunit dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). This is followed by the capture of a second duplex (T DNA segment) upon ATP binding by the B subunit that triggers its dimerization and the G segment cleavage to form a DSB with a covalent protein-DNA link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Then, ATP hydrolysis induces the B subunit motion that triggers the separation of the A dimer, the opening of the G segment and the passage of the T segment through the break. This promotes G segment religation followed by the enzyme reset through ADP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Three regions of the B subunit interact with DNA: the KGRR loop, the Stalk/WKxY motif, also named WKxY-containing octapeptide (WOC) motif, and the H2TH domain. The interaction with the first two motifs is essential for TopoVI function. Indeed, it was proposed that the KGRR loop helps DNA crossing recognition and ATP turnover, while the WOC motif is important for G segment binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P3">In meiosis, TOPOVIL achieves a partial TopoVI cycle and its activity is frozen at the DSB formation step. <italic>In vivo</italic> data showed that DSBs are generated through the formation of concerted double nicks catalyzed by SPO11, which remains covalently bound to the DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). This mechanism leads to a non-catalytic reaction, with the absence of the religation step and a suicide reaction for TOPOVIL. This meiotic activity implies similarities and differences between TOPOVIL and the TopoVI topoisomerase. Particularly, like the TopoVIA subunit, SPO11 is believed to act as a dimer, suggesting the formation of an active hetero-tetramer composed of two SPO11 and two TOPOVIBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). TOPOVIBL displays only partial homology with TopoVIB. Indeed, TopoVIB contains a GHKL/Bergerat fold, a H2TH motif, the transducer domain and a disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Conversely, TOPOVIBL harbors a degenerate GHKL/Bergerat fold-ATPase domain, a linker domain replaces the H2TH DNA interacting domain, the central transducer domain is present but, the disordered CTD is divergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). TOPOVIBL molecular function remains puzzling, particularly its potential ATP-dependent dimerization and interaction with DNA, which are pivotal for the TopoVI cycle.</p><p id="P4">In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the identified TOPOVIBL orthologue Rec102 shares similarity only with the transducer domain. It was proposed that the Rec104 protein replaces the GHKL domain and that the Rec102/Rec104 complex fulfills TOPOVIBL function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). The yeast meiotic DSB core complex was defined <italic>in vitro</italic> as a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry complex, composed of Spo11, Rec102, Rec104 and Ski8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). This core complex interacts with DNA, and Rec102 is one of the contact points. However, the core complex does not dimerize <italic>in vitro</italic> and consequently is not active for DSB formation. Therefore, the molecular function of Rec102/Rec104 (TOPOVIBL counterpart) in these processes remains to be understood. Recently, it was proposed that the yeast Rec114, Mei4 and Mer2 DSB accessory factors assemble in a complex. This complex forms condensate-like structures in the presence of DNA that directly interacts with Rec102/Rec104 and thus might favor the core complex dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The different domains composing TopoVIB have been identified in the mouse TOPOVIBL sequence. However, based on AlphaFold2 modeling of TOPOVIBL (AF-J3QMY9-F1-model), we recently showed that the ATP binding site of the GHKL domain is degenerated and lacks the ATP-lid structure and the N-terminal strap region involved in the ATP-dependent dimerization, suggesting a meiotic-specific regulation of the TOPOVIBL subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). We also found that TOPOVIBL directly interacts with the mouse REC114 DSB accessory protein and that this interaction is essential for DSB formation in some genomic contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). These results indicate that TOPOVIBL regulates, in part, the TOPOVIL DSB catalytic activity through protein-protein interactions. However, how TOPOVIBL is intrinsically regulated at the molecular level to promote the DSB formation activity of the TOPOVIL complex rather than the cutting/resealing activity of its archaeal counterpart remains unknown.</p><p id="P6">A biochemical characterization of the meiotic B subunit to understand the regulation of this essential activity for sexual reproduction is missing, probably due to difficulties in purifying the soluble protein. Here, we present a biochemical and structural characterization of the mouse TOPOVIBL subunit, which represents a first important step in the characterization of TOPOVIBL role in TOPOVIBL-SPO11 mode of action. We purified a soluble and structured TOPOVIBL form that lacks the last 25 C-terminal residues: TOPOVIBLΔC25. We showed that this protein adopts a dynamic conformation in solution, in equilibrium between an extended and a compact form. Unlike its archaeal counterpart, it did not dimerize upon incubation with ATP and DNA, and did not interact with ATP. However, we found that TOPOVIBLΔC25 interacts with DNA, with a topological preference for linear single-stranded (ss) DNA and negative supercoiled DNA. This highlights the importance of TOPOVIBL interaction with some DNA geometries for TOPOVIL regulation. In addition, the TOPOVIBLΔC25-DNA interaction only partly relied on the known conserved WOC motif, suggesting the presence of additional contact points with DNA. From this study, we identified common and divergent features with the archaeal TopoVIB that might help to explain how TOPOVIL function evolved toward a DSB formation activity in meiosis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Purification of mouse TOPOVIBLΔC25</title><p id="P7">To characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying TOPOVIBL activity, we purified <italic>in vitro</italic> the mouse TOPOVIBL protein. As full length TOPOVIBL fused to the maltose binding protein (MBP) tag was mostly insoluble after expression in Sf9 insect cells, we tested different truncated versions. TOPOVIBLΔC25, which lacks the last 25 C-terminal residues that fold into a single helix essential for the interaction with the REC114 meiotic protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), showed the highest solubility. AlphaFold2 structure prediction (AF-J3QMY9-F1-model) suggested that TOPOVIBLΔC25 includes a globular domain at its N-terminus that contains the GHKL-Like and Linker motifs (respectively residues 1 to 172 and 172 to 196), followed by the transducer domain (a long alpha-helix, residues 196 to 450) that is connected to a disordered region of 119 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Among the different tested constructs, TOPOVIBLΔC25 was the closest in structure to the full-length protein. Moreover, we previously showed by yeast two-hybrid assay that it interacts with SPO11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), suggesting that it is correctly folded <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, we decided to characterize in vitro TOPOVIBLΔC25 that we consider the most informative to assess the TOPOVIBL subunit role.</p><p id="P8">We affinity-purified TOPOVIBLΔC25 fused to the MBP tag, and then released the protein from the resin by tag cleavage with the PreScission protease followed by purification by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A-B</xref>). We confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) that the purified protein corresponded to TOPOVIBLΔC25: 40 unique peptides identified all along the protein and the highest iBAQ value (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Far-UV circular dichroism analysis of purified TOPOVIBLΔC25 confirmed the presence of secondary structures in a proportion that matched the AlphaFold2 model derived from AF-J3QMY9-F1 pdb file (Fig. <italic>1B</italic>), indicating proper folding of purified TOPOVIBLΔC25.</p><p id="P9">During SEC purification of TOPOVIBLΔC25, we observed a second peak at a lower elution volume that could correspond to the protein eluted as homodimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). To better characterize the different purified species, we used SEC coupled to multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS). The experimental molecular weight (MW) values were compatible with two oligomeric states: 55.1 ± 0.15 kDa for the monomer and 111.1 ± 0.007 kDa for the homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), compared with the theoretical MW of 61.32 kDa and 122.64 kDa for the monomeric and dimeric form.</p><p id="P10">We further characterized the protein in its putative homodimer state by native MS that gave a MW of 123.044 ± 0.024 KDa, in accordance with the expected MW of a homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). In native MS spectra, we observed systematically two charge state distributions that corresponded to the homodimer mass, one with an average charge of 21+ and another with a higher average charge of 32+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). This suggests that TOPOVIBLΔC25 exists in a closed and a more open conformation. The second could be related to the disordered region in the protein and/or to unfolded TOPOVIBLΔC25 species. Increasing the activation during MS acquisition did not lead to the disruption of the dimeric stoichiometry. This implied the presence of a covalent interaction between monomers. As TOPOVIBLΔC25 contains eleven cysteines, we hypothesized that these residues can form disulfide bonds during protein production or purification. To test this hypothesis, we incubated TOPOVIBLΔC25 homodimers with 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT, a reducing agent), followed by SEC analysis. We observed a displacement of the homodimer toward the monomeric form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Similarly, incubation of the homodimer with different concentrations of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), from 1 mM to 10 mM, followed by protein separation on non-reducing acrylamide gels showed that homodimers can be fully converted into monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Moreover, native MS analysis of SEC-purified TOPOVIBLΔC25 homodimers that were subsequently incubated with 50 mM DTT and 10 mM 2-Iodoacetamide (IAA), which alkylates the accessible cysteine residues and prevents the formation of disulfide bonds, confirmed the formation of stable blocked monomers with a measured MW of 61,844 ± 55 Da (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). These results show that TOPOVIBLΔC25 homodimers result from disulfide bond formation.</p><p id="P11">Lastly, to evaluate whether these bonds are induced by the oxidative environment of the cell lysis conditions or are formed during protein folding in Sf9 cells, we purified TOPOVIBLΔC25 in lysis buffer that included 10 mM IAA. IAA alkylated and blocked the free cysteines, but not the cysteines that were engaged in disulfide bonds in the cells <italic>in vivo</italic> during protein expression and folding. SEC showed that in this condition, TOPOVIBLΔC25 was mainly purified as monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>). Therefore, we propose that i) TOPOVIBLΔC25 homodimer formation is due to stochastic intermolecular interactions between cysteines, favored by the oxidative environment of the purification conditions; and ii) TOPOVIBLΔC25 homodimers have no physiological relevance. In line with these assumptions, AlphaFold2 did not generate homodimers. Therefore, we focused on the monomeric form.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>TOPOVIBLΔC25 monomers adopt a dynamic conformation in solution</title><p id="P12">To evaluate the conformation of TOPOVIBLΔC25 monomers in solution, we performed SEC coupled to Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SEC-SAXS) that provides low resolution structural information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). SEC-SAXS data indicated that TOPOVIBLΔC25 had a radius of gyration (Rg) of 3.65 ± 0.06 nm and a maximum intramolecular distance (Dmax) of 15.6 ± 0.6 nm in solution. MW estimation confirmed that TOPOVIBLΔC25 remained as monomers (experimental MW of 62.35 kDa vs theoretical MW of 61.32 kDa) in the SEC-SAXS experimental conditions. The dimensionless Kratky plot does not display a perfect bell-shaped peak but rather a combination of a bell-shape and a plateau at higher gRg values and displays a shift from the values expected for globular proteins on both <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), indicative of flexibility in the protein. The asymmetrical pairwise distance distribution function, P(r), confirmed TOPOVIBLΔC25 flexibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, inset). To precisely characterize the protein structure, we generated an ensemble of conformations based on the AlphaFold2 model of TOPOVIBLΔC25, especially for the protein core that comprises the GHKL-like domain, the linker and the transducer motif. The C-terminal domain (from C451 to S579) was built as a random-coil region. Fitting the SAXS profile using the Ensemble Optimization Method (EOM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) indicated that TOPOVIBLΔC25 C-terminal domain did not behave as a fully random coil part. Indeed, the SAXS profile of TOPOVIBLΔC25 was best described with an excellent fit to the experimental profile (chi-square of 0.76) by EOM selected sub-ensembles showing that the C-terminal region adopts two distinct conformations leading to an elongated form of TOPOVIBLΔC25 (with Rg&gt;40Å), where the C-terminal region is highly extended and to a more compact form of TOPOVIBLΔC25 (with Rg&lt;35Å), where the C-terminal region is in close proximity to the core of the protein. The latter represents 66% of the selected conformations over 20% frequency of extended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Importantly, the peaks corresponding to these two forms were robust relative to the parameters used for the genetic algorithm optimization in EOM and supported the hypothesis that TOPOVIBLΔC25 exists in a dynamic conformational equilibrium between two main states, with a preference for the compact form in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). This suggests an allosteric regulation of the TOPOVIBL subunit.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>TOPOVIBLΔC25 is not sensitive to ATP</title><p id="P13">In Archaea, ATP-induced TopoVIB dimerization is essential for TopoVI cutting and resealing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). We previously reported that the ATPase domain of mouse TOPOVIBL is degenerated compared to its archaeal ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Yet, despite the absence of the conserved N-strap dimerization domain in the TOPOVIBL sequence, we did not rule out the possibility of an ATP-dependent TOPOVIBLΔC25 dimerization. To address this question, first, we purified TOPOVIBLΔC25 in the presence of IAA to favor the formation of blocked monomers, followed by incubation, or not, with an excess of ATP. Both conditions led to the same SEC elution profile, compatible with the presence of stable monomers. This suggested that TOPOVIBL does not dimerize upon incubation with ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). To rule out the possibility of a rapid ATP turnover that might mask the ATP binding-dependent TOPOVIBL dimerization, we used an excess of AMP-PNP, the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue. Again, we did not detect TOPOVIBL dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Second, we incubated blocked TOPOVIBLΔC25 monomers with two different ATP concentrations (20 μM and 50 μM, 1:1 and 1:2.5 molar ratio, respectively) before native MS analysis that did not highlight any strong interaction of TOPOVIBLΔC25 with ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The small ATP adducts observed did not increase significantly upon ATP addition, and were mainly visible at the lowest charge states of TOPOVIBLΔC25 (15+). This implies that the observed adducts are most probably related to non-specific binding occurring during the electrospray process. On the other hand, ATP addition did not induce any increase in the proportion of homodimeric species detected in the native MS spectra.</p><p id="P15">Our results suggest that TOPOVIBLΔC25 does not interact with ATP and experimentally validated our previous <italic>in silico</italic> predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).

To determine whether the meiotic TOPOVIBL subunit also interacted with DNA, independently of the presence of SPO11 (the TopoVIA orthologue), we first measured TOPOVIBLΔC25 affinity for DNA duplexes of different lengths and sequences. The duplex sequences chosen for these experiments (2B20, 2B39, 2B60 and 2B70, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>) were centered on a C57BL/6 mouse meiotic DSB hotspot (2B, chr9, centered at position 4447025), mapped using the SPO11-oligo approach and shown to be targeted and cut by the TOPOVIL complex <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). We measured TOPOVIBLΔC25 affinity for the linear DNA duplexes (from 20 to 70 bp) labeled with the ATTO647 fluorescent label using a fluorescence anisotropy-based approach. TOPOVIBLΔC25 monomers bound to 2B20 duplex DNA with a Kd of 1610 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The affinity increased (Kd = 650 nM) for the 39 bp duplex, and then progressively decreased for the 60 and 70 bp duplexes (Kd = 900 nM and 1500 nM, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Competition experiments performed with unlabeled 2B39 duplex confirmed that the DNA-TOPOVIBLΔC25 monomer interaction was DNA-specific and not related to the labeling with ATTO647 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>).</p><p id="P17">These experiments showed that among the different dsDNA duplexes tested, the TOPOVIBLΔC25 subunit preferentially interacted with DNA of 39 bp in length. We then used native MS to confirm the results obtained by fluorescence anisotropy and assess the stoichiometry of the TOPOVIBLΔC25 monomer-DNA interaction. The native MS spectra obtained after incubating blocked TOPOVIBLΔC25 monomers with the 2B39 duplex showed a TOPOVIBLΔC25-DNA interaction with a 1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).

The TOPOVIBLΔC25 affinity for this duplex was similar to that for the 2B39 duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).

Affinity measurements using the fluorescence anisotropy-based approach showed that TOPOVIBLΔC25 interacted with ATTO647-labeled linear ssDNA (39 bases, ss2B39) with a Kd of 310 nM (versus 650 nM for dsDNA), indicating a better affinity for ss2B39 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Next, we assessed the relative affinity of TOPOVIBLΔC25 for a negative supercoiled plasmid using a competitive binding assay. We incubated TOPOVIBLΔC25 with the ATTO647-labeled 2B39 duplex and varying amounts of unlabeled ssDNA (ss2B39) or of unlabeled negatively supercoiled pBR322 plasmid. We determined the relative affinity of TOPOVIBLΔC25 for the supercoiled or ssDNA competitors by monitoring how well they interfered with the binding of linear DNA. These measurements showed that TOPOVIBLΔC25 bound to supercoiled pBR322 with a similar affinity as to 2B39 ssDNA, and thus more efficiently than to 2B39 dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Altogether, we showed that the TOPOVIBLΔC25 subunit, independently of the rest of the TOPOVIL complex, directly interacts with DNA.

The far-UV circular dichroism and SEC results suggested that the two mutations introduced in TOPOVIBLΔC25 did not alter the protein structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>). To determine whether the mutations in TOPOVIBLΔC25<sup>K281EK282E</sup> affected the interaction with DNA, we performed affinity measurement by fluorescence anisotropy.

TOPOVIBLΔC25 purified as a single monomer, even if disulfide bonds can arise during the purification. The secondary structure analysis of TOPOVIBLΔC25 by circular dichroism and the structural characterization by SAXS confirmed the correct folding of the protein and experimentally validated the AlphaFold2 structure predictions. In addition, we showed that TOPOVIBLΔC25 exists in a conformational equilibrium between two states where the C-terminal disordered tail can adopt either a compact structure in close contact with the TOPOVIBLΔC25 core, or a more extended structure that is compatible with potential regulatory intramolecular interactions. This highlighted the intrinsic flexibility of the protein. The compact TOPOVIBLΔC25 arrangement could represent a closed conformation and the interaction of the missing C-terminal helix with partners (e.g. REC114) could trigger the opening of the protein by moving away the disordered part. Such conformational changes might have consequences on the TOPOVIL complex structure and activity, making it inactive (compact conformation) or active (extended conformation) for DSB formation. Adding SPO11 and REC114 for the biochemical analysis of TOPOVIBL will be essential in future studies to validate this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>TOPOVIBLΔC25 is not sensitive to ATP</title><p id="P24">Although the N-strap region is missing and the GHKL ATPase domain degenerated in TOPOVIBL, it is crucial to determine whether TOPOVIL activity relies on TOPOVIBL dimerization in order to understand its molecular function. Here, we experimentally confirmed that TOPOVIBLΔC25 does not interact with ATP and we did not detect its dimerization upon incubation with ATP or AMP-PNP. These results suggest that the TOPOVIBL subunit is not sensitive to ATP and that the activity of the mammalian TOPOVIL complex does not depend on TOPOVIBL subunit dimerization, although we cannot formally exclude an alternative dimerization mode. One consequence of this observation is that SPO11 dimerization and its DSB formation activity could be independent of TOPOVIBL dimerization. One possible model is that the TOPOVIBL subunit interaction with partners, such as REC114/MEI4, induces its motion and favors SPO11 dimerization and DSB formation (see below, model). Interestingly, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has two meiotic SPO11 variants (SPO11-1 and SPO11-2). Their dimerization is essential for DSB formation and depends on MTOPVIB, the TOPOVIBL orthologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). This observation is in accordance with the hypothesis that TOPOVIBL triggers SPO11 dimerization and activity.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>TOPOVIBLΔC25 interacts with DNA, with topological preferences</title><p id="P25">We propose that the interaction of the TOPOVIBL subunit with DNA that we reported is required for the TOPOVIL DSB meiotic activity. In Archaea, TopoVI preferentially interacts with DNA crossings and bends of supercoiled DNA. This stimulates TopoVIB dimerization and DNA cleavage. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). TOPOVIBLΔC25 interacted with linear dsDNA, particularly of 40 bp in length. In our experimental conditions, TOPOVIBLΔC25 interacted better with smaller linear DNA than its archaeal counterpart (60 bp in Archaea) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). The fact that DNA might interact concomitantly with the B and A subunits could explain this discrepancy. The smaller DNA size preference might reflect SPO11 missing contribution.</p><p id="P26">Moreover, TOPOVIBLΔC25 displayed better affinity for linear ssDNA and supercoiled DNA, compared to linear dsDNA. This suggests that the B subunit senses different topological statuses. As we did not detect sequence-specificity for the TOPOVIBLΔC25-DNA interaction, we might hypothesize that the DNA geometry also contributes to the substrate choice. DSB formation at meiosis onset occurs in particular accessible chromatin regions where DNA conformation may have specific features. Recent studies in yeast showed that DSB formation overlaps with specific topological regions of the genome, and in particular with regions bound by topoisomerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). This suggests a recognition of specific chromosomal features, such as negative supercoils and DNA crossings. Thus, in line with this observation, our work suggests that the TOPOVIBL subunit plays a role in sensing this specific topological status. The DNA topological status might also influence TOPOVIL activity by triggering TOPOVIBL motion that could favor the formation of an active TOPOVIBL-SPO11 hetero-tetramer <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P27">In Archaea, three TopoVIB domains interact with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), but only the WOC motif (or Stalk/WKxY) is conserved in the mouse protein. We found a partial contribution of the TOPOVIBL WOC motif to the TOPOVIBLΔC25-DNA interaction. Different non-exclusive hypotheses might account for this difference. First, the double mutation introduced in the WOC domain of TOPOVIBLΔC25 (two lysine residues replaced by glutamic acid residues) had no detectable impact on the protein structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F-G</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>). In Archaea, the generated mutants targeted a tryptophan, a lysine and a tyrosine residue within the WOC motif that presumably affect more strongly the protein structure and the DNA binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). This might partly explain why the archaeal mutant has a clearer effect. Second, the mild contribution of the WOC motif in the interaction with DNA indicates that additional parts of the protein, not conserved in Archaea, are implicated in the interaction with DNA, suggesting an evolution of the regulatory role of the TOPOVIBL-DNA interaction in the regulation of the meiotic enzyme activity. Interestingly, in yeast, an interaction between the Rec102 subunit of the DSB core complex (equivalent to the transducer region of TOPOVIBL) and DNA was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). However, the Rec102 interacting region is not conserved and its biological significance remains to be studied.</p><p id="P28">Altogether, our results, in line with previous studies, highlight the importance of the TOPOVIBL-DNA interaction. They also show that this interaction depends on a specific DNA architecture and is partly mediated by a conserved motif and possibly also by additional (not identified yet) regions of the protein or of the complex.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>A proposed mode of action for the TOPOVIL complex</title><p id="P29">Based on our results and previous studies, we propose the following model for TOPOVIL molecular activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). First, the SPO11-TOPOVIBL dimeric complex interacts with specific DNA structures (e.g. negative supercoiled or DNA crossing) (Step 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Then, the SPO11 subunit dimerizes. Different non-exclusive parameters might promote and stabilize this dimerization. The DNA topological environment sensed by TOPOVIBL could be one of these parameters. The MEI4/REC114 (1:2) complex also might act as a clamp to hold together the two SPO11 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). This clamping activity could be mediated by the C-terminal helix of TOPOVIBL that interacts with REC114 and possibly by TOPOVIBL dynamic conformation revealed by our SAXS data (Step 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5</xref>). In this model, the open and compact conformations of TOPOVIBL allowing interaction or not with REC114, might represent an active and inactive state for TOPOVIL, respectively. Accumulation of proteins that create a matrix and a condensate-like environment to favor protein-protein interactions also might favor SPO11 dimerization, as proposed in alternative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). As observed in archaea, the SPO11 dimerization could then induce conformational changes of this catalytic subunit, making it efficient for DSB formation activity (Step 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Finally, following cleavage, SPO11 binding interfaces are destabilized. These structural changes could be associated to a compact conformation of TOPOVIBL and to the destabilization of MEI4/REC114 interaction. Altogether, this leads to the release of the two ends of the DSB (Step 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p id="P30">This study offers a first step in the <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization of TOPOVIBL molecular function and helps to understand how it regulates meiotic DSB formation activity in mammals.

Data were the mean of at least three independent experiments, and were fitted using a sigmoidal dose-response model (GraphPad Prism, GraphPad software).</p><p id="P45">Competition assays were carried out as described for the direct binding assay, with protein samples diluted in binding buffer to a final concentration of 1.3 μM and incubated with the ATTO647-labeled 2B39 dsDNA at a final concentration of 20 nM. Unlabeled 2B39 ssDNA or the negatively supercoiled pBR322 plasmid (ThermoScientific) were titrated by serially diluting them in two-fold steps in the final binding assay buffer, starting from 100 μM bp. Incubation conditions were the same as for the direct titration. Anisotropy data were fitted with an on-site competition equation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS190584-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d86aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The Centre for Structural Biology (CBS) is a member of France-BioImaging (FBI) and the French Infrastructure for Integrated Structural Biology, two national infrastructures supported by the French National Research Agency (grant nos.
