This is a highly conserved process that operates in C<sub>3</sub> plants but also those that use the derived C<sub>4</sub> pathway. To date the majority of downstream signalling targets responding to light are associated with changes to transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Indeed, during the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, genes important for the C<sub>4</sub> cycle appear to have acquired mutations that allowed integration into the light responsive transcriptional networks that operate in C<sub>3</sub> species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. However, in C<sub>3</sub> Arabidopsis during de-etiolation protein synthesis (translation) is also reconfigured in response to light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Although, in C<sub>4</sub> maize translational regulation has been associated with the cell preferential accumulation of enzymes required for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> to our knowledge there have been no detailed studies on translational efficiency during photomorphogenesis in C<sub>4</sub> species. In particular, we sought to establish whether control of genes used specifically in the C<sub>4</sub> pathway is modified such that their translation becomes fully co-ordinated with canonical photosynthesis genes. To better understand how translation is reprogrammed during de-etiolation and whether this is altered during the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis we undertook paired RNA-Seq and Ribosome Profiling (Ribo-Seq) on C<sub>3</sub> rice and C<sub>4</sub> sorghum to define and decouple light-dependent translational responses and RNA turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>De-etiolation activates transcriptional and translational machinery in C<sub>3</sub> rice</title><p id="P5">Prior to light exposure highly structured prolamellar bodies were evident in etioplasts of C<sub>3</sub> rice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). After 0.5 h of light exposure these had started to dissipate and by subsequent timepoints, development of thylakoid membranes with granal stacks was evident. Starch granules indicative of net photosynthesis were visible by 12 h. Concomitant with this elaboration of chloroplast structure, chlorophyll content accumulated in a logistic manner immediately after light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Biogenesis of chloroplasts was underpinned by accumulation of transcripts encoding proteins required for C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). These included transcripts encoding light harvesting complexes and the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, but as would be expected not those derived from orthologs of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). Our results therefore suggest 12 hours of light was sufficient to capture events associated with chloroplast biogenesis and the dynamics of photosynthesis gene expression underlying this response.</p><p id="P6">Although the induction of light-mediated transcriptional networks is fundamental for establishment of the photosynthetic machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, the extent to which this is co-ordinated with protein synthesis is not fully defined. Ribo-Seq is a high-throughput technology that captures positions of ribosomes on mRNAs and so provides a highly-sensitive ‘snap-shot’ of global translational activity at any time point<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). When undertaken in parallel with RNA-Seq it provides insight into the extent to which increases in transcript abundance are coupled with protein synthesis. Quantification of the total number of ribosome protected fragments (RPF) provides a direct measurement of total protein synthesis, and the number of RPF per RNA molecule an estimate of translation efficiency (TE). In contrast with the read-size distribution from the RNA-Seq data that was indistinct, devoid of phasing and included reads from both 5’ and 3’ UTRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3B</xref>) Ribo-Seq generated profiles enriched in size classes of between 27 and 29 nucleotides, distinct phasing, and RPF were not detected in untranslated regions (UTRs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3A&amp;B</xref>). As has previously been reported in mouse, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> we also observed a larger footprint at the stop codon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3C</xref>). The latter characteristic has previously been associated with release factor rather than tRNA incorporation during translation termination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. It was also notable that as with data from <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> an enrichment of reads corresponding to start and stop codons was observed in the meta-transcriptomes due to preferential ligation of adaptors to 5’ Adenosine and 5’ Uridine start and stop codons respectively during library preparation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3B</xref>). We also detected the non-AUG) initiated upstream open reading frame for the <italic>GDP-L-GALACTOSE PHOSPHORYLASE</italic> (<italic>GGP</italic>) gene involved in L-ascorbate biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). Non-canonical regulation of <italic>GGP</italic> is found in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhartii</italic> as well as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In summary, characteristics of the data from Ribo-Seq conformed to expectations and so with the RNA-Seq collected in parallel should allow robust analysis of any uncoupling between RNA levels and translation during de-etiolation.</p><p id="P7">We next analysed global translation profiles to determine the extent to which translational regulation during de-etiolation modified the transcriptional response. Principal Component Analysis performed on normalized counts from RNA-Seq (RNA) and Ribo-Seq showed that 39% of variance was explained by time exposed to light. The second principal component related to mRNA abundance and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>). Correlation analysis between mRNA abundance and protein synthesis showed that they were strongly correlated indicating a tight coupling between mRNA abundance and translation (p &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>). However, residuals analysis revealed that the relationship between mRNA levels and protein synthesis (total RPF) was not linear for all translated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D&amp;E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). For example, in the dark, one gene encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA, <italic>LOC_Os10G08022</italic>) which is important for gluconeogenesis during early seedling growth showed higher rates of protein synthesis than expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Gene enrichment analysis for genes showing a weaker coupling between protein synthesis and mRNA abundance in the dark (0 hrs) showed that these genes tended to be classified into categories related to organelle organization including “nucleus” and “membrane bounded organelles” (FDR &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, by 4 and 12 h after light exposure genes annotated as “cytoplasmic” tended to be translated more than would be predicted from their transcript abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 7, Supplemental table 5</xref>). It was noticeable that over the time course genes related to light signalling including the blue light photoreceptor Zeitlupe (ZTL) and also several circadian rhythm related genes in the PRR family (PRR3-7, PRR5-9 and TOC1) displayed lower rates of protein synthesis than was expected from mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Rice photosynthesis transcripts with low abundance in the dark are efficiently translated</title><p id="P8">The above analysis suggested that in rice the translational programme operating in etiolated plants is disrupted by 30 minutes of light. To further explore these changes we compared Translational Efficiency (TE) with mRNA abundance. TE is defined as the ratio of counts derived from Ribo-Seq (RPF, i.e. protein synthesis) compared with those coming from total mRNA, and is therefore a measure of the proclivity of an mRNA molecule to interact with one or more ribosomes simultaneously. TE thus provides insight into the economics of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Exposure to light for 30 mins had relatively little impact on coupling between TE and mRNA abundance with ninety-one percent of genes showing less than two-fold change compared to the dark period for both TE and mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Of the remaining 9% of genes that did not correlate strongly, four percent showed two-fold higher TE in the dark but this was no longer detected 30 minutes after light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental table 4</xref>). A similar trend was found for genes with higher TE after 0.5 hrs of light compared with the dark (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 8A</xref>). Analysis of efficiently translated genes in the dark showed an enrichment in categories related to DNA packaging such as core histones and chloroplast proteins. This is consistent with the regression analysis for mRNA and total RPF as the residual levels of transcripts classified by the “chloroplastic” gene ontology term were higher in the dark compared with 0.5 h of light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 8B</xref>). Among genes associated with the chloroplast we found transcripts encoding a signal recognition particle <italic>OscpSRP43</italic> (LOC_Os03g03990) which is essential for chloroplast development and photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Other genes included those encoding a Photosystem II core complex protein <italic>psbY</italic> (LOC_Os08g02630), the plastid specific ribosomal protein 6 (LOC_Os11g34940) and the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle protein <italic>CP12</italic> (LOC_Os01g19740) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 5</xref>). For genes that were less translated in the dark but rapidly acquired more ribosomes in response to light the only enriched category was defined by intracellular anatomical structures. For instance, the transcription factor <italic>DOF12</italic> (<italic>LOC_Os03g07360</italic>) known to be involved in defining leaf architecture (Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2015) and perhaps associated with the morphological changes taking place during deetiolation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 8C, Supplemental table 7</xref>). Overall, our results indicate the translational program of skotomorphogenic rice leaves is characterised by high translational efficiency for genes involved in chloroplast biogenesis. This is then temporally disrupted by light, before a tight coupling between TE and mRNA abundance is established.</p><p id="P9">To better understand the translational response associated with photomorphogenesis we examined the following features for differentially translated transcripts: (1) RNA structure, which can interfere with all stages of translation; (2) initiation context, as initiation is a rate-limiting stage of translation; and (3) codon usage, which can impact efficiency of translational elongation. Plotting the local minimal free energy of RNA secondary structure along a 30-nucleotide sliding window revealed that the most efficiently translated mRNAs in the dark typically possessed unstructured 5’ UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figures 9</xref>). However, after 0.5 h of light efficient translation was associated with a different class of mRNAs that possessed less structured coding sequence. These findings are consistent with two modes of translational regulation allowing control over ribosomal scanning/initiation and elongation in dark and light respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 9</xref>). As initiation is widely considered a rate-determining step for efficient translation and we also observed preference for unstructured 5’UTRs in efficiently translated mRNAs in the dark, we also investigated sequence identity surrounding the start codon (i.e. Kozak consensus) to determine whether efficiently translated mRNA are subject to efficient 5’UTR scanning as well as initiation. However, while we revealed a ricespecific Kozak consensus, where instead of A/GNN_AUG_G, efficiently translated rice mRNAs were generally enriched in guanidine at +6 and cytosine at the -2 and +5 positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 10</xref>), we did not observe significant differences in initiation context associated with transcripts showing altered TE in response to light.</p><p id="P10">Preferential translation of mRNAs with less structured coding sequence after thirty minutes of light could be associated with translational elongation through a reduced need to unwind RNA. We investigated whether this effect is also compounded with efficient codon usage. Codon adaptation index (CAI) is a measure of codon bias and when this was plotted for all translated transcripts a bimodal distribution with peaks around 0.76 and 0.92 was apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Further investigation of the relationship between TE and CAI during light transition revealed that efficiently translated transcripts in the dark were generally associated with high CAI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). However, this correlation was lost upon light induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 11</xref>). From these data, we propose that within first 30 minutes of light induction TE is mainly controlled during elongation.</p><p id="P11">We next focused on transcripts associated with photosynthesis as we observed high TE and low transcript abundance of genes associated with light-dependent reactions in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>). For this gene set, TE decreased after thirty minutes of light because transcript abundance increased, before rising again at 2 and 4 hours of light. This behaviour was also observed for genes encoding proteins of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). In contrast, TE of genes encoding proteins associated with C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis were not affected by light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Further investigation revealed genes involved in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis with a high CAI (&gt;0.85) typically had low transcript abundance but high TE in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H-I</xref>). After 30 minutes and two hours of light, transcript derived from these genes with high CAI had increased whilst TE had dropped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). There was little change after 4 hrs and by 12 hrs of light in transcript abundance and TE of these genes had dropped at 12hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). These co-ordinated changes to transcript abundance and TE for genes with high CAI were not as evident for components of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham or C<sub>4</sub> cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). In fact, when the relationship between CAI and these gene categories was plotted there was a clear enrichment of high CAI for genes associated with the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis, a more balanced distribution for genes of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, and a higher proportion of C<sub>4</sub> related genes with low CAI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>). These data indicate that in rice most of the genes associated with light dependent reactions of photosynthesis and a reduced proportion of Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle appear to have evolved an optimised codon usage, and despite low transcript abundance are efficiently translated in the dark. These characteristics are not apparent for rice genes whose orthologs are co-opted into the C<sub>4</sub> cycle in C<sub>4</sub> plants.</p><p id="P12">We conclude that TE dynamics during photomorphogenesis of rice is determined by at least three processes. First, efficiently transcripts in the dark tend to possess 5’UTRs with relaxed secondary structure, indicative of efficient 43S ribosomal scanning prior to initiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Second, upon transfer to light, coding region for transcripts with high TE typically have a relaxed structure which facilitates efficient translation elongation by circumventing need for additional helicase activities during elongation. Lastly, genes encoding components of the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis have evolved to possess optimised codon usage for efficient translational decoding in the dark.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>C<sub>4</sub> cycle genes in <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> are efficiently translated in the dark</title><p id="P13">We next investigated whether genes encoding proteins of the C<sub>4</sub> pathway in sorghum have co-opted this translational control of photosynthesis genes that operates during photomorphogenesis of C<sub>3</sub> rice. Over the same de-etiolation time-course as used above, chlorophyll accumulated and chloroplast biogenesis was induced in sorghum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 12</xref>). Dimorphic chloroplasts in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> were observed by 4 hrs of light with granal stacks preferentially observed in the mesophyll and starch granules most evident in the bundle sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). This assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus was accompanied by accumulation of transcripts encoding components of the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis,Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle but also genes required for the C<sub>4</sub> pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 13</xref>). There was a strong linear relationship between mRNA abundance and protein synthesis activity (RPF) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 14, 15 &amp; 16A</xref>). As with rice, time after exposure to light was the main component for driving variance (42%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 15</xref>), and light-signalling and circadian clock genes such as <italic>ZTL</italic>, <italic>PRR3-7, TOC1, CCA/LHY</italic> had lower rates of protein synthesis than would be expected from the linear model predicted from all RNA abundance and RPF data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 16B</xref>). Moreover, 7.5% of translated genes showed a two-fold change in TE without a significant change in transcript abundance and this was most noticeable during the transition from dark to light (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 16</xref>). Gene Ontology analysis for genes with higher TE in the dark than 30 minutes of light showed an enrichment in chloroplastic genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 17B &amp; 18</xref>). However, the identity of chloroplastic genes enriched in sorghum were different to those found in rice with for example genes encoding proteins related with NAD-binding and localized in the stroma as well as ribosomes being enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 10</xref>). For genes with higher TE at 0.5 hrs of light compared with the dark we observed a similar trend to rice where this difference was lost by later timepoints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 17, Supplemental Table 11</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Analysis of the dynamics of TE for photosynthetic genes revealed that in addition to genes encoding components of the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis showing a rapid reduction in TE after exposure to light, this was also the case for those associated with the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Like rice, there was no clear differences in Kozak initiation consensus sequence between differentially translated transcripts in either dark or light (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 20</xref>). In contrast with rice, there was no compelling evidence for transcripts with high TE in the dark having lower structure of either UTRs or coding regions suggesting that in sorghum additional mechanisms such as recruitment of <italic>trans-</italic>factors facilitate translational regulation in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 19</xref>). However, efficiently translated sorghum transcripts in the dark tended to possess high codon usage (CAI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 21</xref>). As with rice, this was a global observation and was particularly evident for genes associated with the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F-H</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Genes associated with the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis in sorghum with high CAI showed a gradual reduction in TE upon light exposure that was then reversed at 12 hrs of light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). In contrast, abundance of transcript derived from these genes with high CAI was low in the dark but rose steadily from 2 hrs onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). Similar to rice, it was clear that the majority of sorghum genes associated with the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis had high CAI, while the proportion of genes with high CAI was lower for Calvin-Benson-Basham genes and even lower for C<sub>4</sub> cycle genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>).

Although photomorphogenesis in both C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> leaves is highly dependent on remodelling of transcriptional activities, it is clear that post-transcriptional regulation is also crucial role to allow efficient assembly of the photosynthetic machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. To explore the dynamics of translation during the establishment of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis we applied Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq during de-etiolation of <italic>O. sativa</italic> and <italic>S. bicolor</italic>. Consistent with previous observations of the C<sub>3</sub> plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> mRNA turnover seems to be the main determinant in the regulation of most photosynthesis related genes upon light induction. We conclude that this feature appears conserved between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species.</p><p id="P18">However, our analysis also shows that for many light responsive genes the relationship between translational responses and mRNA turnover was not linear. The relatively low rates of protein synthesis for a group of clock regulators (ZTL, PPRs and TOC1) could allow different elements of the clock to be fully integrated with activation of the photosynthetic machinery. In both species after 12 hours of light a steady state relationship between RNA abundance and translation had been re-established. Skotomorphogenesis operates with limited resources and so once light is available, photosynthetic competence must be achieved quickly. Consistent with this, nonphotosynthetic etioplasts contain protein complexes required for electron transport and protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> implying some basal activity of photosynthesis related genes that is independent of light signalling networks takes place in the dark. Our data show that in the dark photosynthesis-related genes are efficiently translated despite low transcript abundance, and so indicate a compensatory mechanism maximising production of protein from these low levels of transcripts. As the light environment becomes favourable for activation of light-signalling cascades, photosynthesis genes become more dependent on transcriptional activity. Interestingly, the identity of genes most influenced by these changes as well as the duration of this translational compensation differed between rice (C<sub>3</sub>) and sorghum (C<sub>4</sub>) possibly as a consequence of different protein stoichiometries needed for the functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus. Ribosome profiling has been undertaken at multiple developmental stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of C<sub>4</sub> maize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The main focus of these analysis was on chloroplast genes, and it was concluded that changes in mRNA abundance were the major control of protein production, with changes in translational efficiency allowing fine-tuning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Moreover, It was also shown that translation efficiency for genes encoding PSII core subunits such as psbA, psbB, psbC and psbD had a significant impact on preferential gene expression in the mesophyll<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Subsequent analysis of maize chloroplasts from green seedlings experiencing light-to-dark and dark-to-light shifts showed enhanced ribosome occupancy for <italic>psbA</italic> in response to light. While other chloroplast mRNAs showed similar ribosome occupancy during these transitions, translation efficiency was higher due to an increase in elongation rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Together with our findings, these results suggest that in C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> cereals genes involved in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis (either chloroplastic or nuclear encoded) are tightly controlled at the translational level. This is apparent despite the fact chloroplast translation is compartmentalised and performed by prokaryotic-type ribosomes, and nuclear genes are translated by cytosolic eukaryotic type ribosomes.</p><p id="P19">During photomorphogenesis while photosynthesis genes from both rice and sorghum are regulated at the level of translation, it is striking that the underpinning molecular mechanisms varied between the species. It is possible that these differences are caused by divergence between the lineages since their last common ancestor. Notably, we observed efficiently translated rice transcripts in the dark tended to possess unstructured 5’ UTRs, and although not the case in sorghum, transcripts in rice with less structured coding regions were preferentially translated after exposure to light. It is possible that in rice in the dark transcripts that enable efficient 43S ribosomal scanning process are preferred whilst transcripts with unstructured coding regions are preferentially translated by the 80S ribosome upon light induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We propose that processes independent of RNA structure operate in sorghum during the dark to light transition, potentially through recruitment of additional <italic>trans</italic>-factors, either to the mRNA or the 43S/80S ribosome to facilitate efficient 5’ UTR scanning and/or translational elongation.</p><p id="P20">In both rice and sorghum it appears that codon optimality plays a major role in efficient translation of photosynthesis genes, especially those involved in the light-dependent reactions when plants are skotomorphogenic. Upon light perception, transcriptional induction is initiated and transiently exceeds the rate of translation before coupling is restored. As this was observed in rice and sorghum we propose that this is a conserved mechanism to optimise assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus once light is perceived. Post transcriptional control of C<sub>4</sub> gene expression has been established in the past mainly in the context of cell-preferential gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and chloroplast differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In maize at least 31 genes associated with the C<sub>4</sub> cycle showed differences in translation between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Of these, <italic>Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase</italic> (R5PI) was found to be subject to translational control in maize but also the independent C<sub>4</sub> lineage <italic>Setaria viridis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Our work shows R5PI orthologs for both sorghum and rice had high translation efficiency in the dark that was associated with high codon use efficiency. Together, these findings imply that genes important for photosynthesis are regulated at the level of translation during de-etiolation and seedling development but also in the mature C<sub>4</sub> leaf. While differential use of AUG versus non-AUG initiation codons in upstream open reading frames (uORFs) has been linked to cell-type dependent translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> we did not find compelling evidence that uORFs or non-AUG initiation influence translation of photosynthesis related genes in rice or sorghum. This included orthologs of GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR (GEF), ADP-GLUCOSE PYROPHOSPHORYLASE LARGE SUBUNIT 1 (AGPLL1), CBL-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE 3 (CIPK3), and CHLOROPLAST UNUSUAL POSITIONING 1 (CHUP1) for which this has been reported for maize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Whilst, in rice and sorghum it is possible that greater sequencing depth would reveal such phenomena for these genes, and the coverage was too low to determine the precise start codon utilised, we did find evidence for non-AUG initiation of Calvin-Benson-Bassam cycle regulatory protein CP12 in sorghum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 23</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In summary, this analysis shows that during photomorphogenesis and assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus tight control of translation of photosynthesis genes is apparent in both rice and sorghum. This regulation of translation has become more widespread in sorghum to include genes encoding proteins of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle such that translation and transcription of canonical photosynthesis and also C<sub>4</sub> pathway genes are co-ordinated. We conclude that during the evolution of the C<sub>4</sub> pathway, genes encoding components of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle have acquired mechanisms controlling translation of photosynthesis genes during photomorphogenesis in the ancestral C<sub>3</sub> state.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Growth of plant material, chlorophyll analysis and microscopy</title><p id="P22">Sterile rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) and sorghum (<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>) seeds were germinated on moist filter paper in the dark at 30°C for 24h.
