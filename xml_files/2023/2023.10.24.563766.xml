The smallest clinical deletions fall within the large (~650Kb) SNHG14 gene, removing 29 consecutive introns that each generate SNORD116. SNHG14 also includes 48 tandem introns encoding SNORD115 and generates multiple, extended snoRNA-related species. SNORD115 and SNORD116 resemble box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) but lack known targets. Both snoRNAs strongly accumulated during neuronal differentiation. SNORD116 accumulation apparently reflected stabilization, potentially linked to the appearance of FBLL1, a homologue of the ubiquitous snoRNA-associated protein Fibrillarin (FBL). In contrast, SNORD115 was selectively transcribed, apparently due to regulated termination. For functional characterization we created cell lines lacking only the expressed, paternal, SNORD115 or SNORD116 cluster. Analyses during neuronal development indicated changes in RNA stability and protein synthesis. Altered mRNAs included <italic>MAGEL2</italic>, mutation of which causes the PWS-like disorder Schaaf-Yang syndrome. Comparison of SNORD115 and SNORD116 mutants indicated overlapping or interacting functions. Most changes in mRNA and protein abundance appeared relatively late in development, with roles including cytoskeleton formation, extracellular matrix, neuronal arborization. Comparison with human embryonic midbrain development suggested enhanced progression in neuronal development in the snoRNA mutants. Subtle impairment of relative neuronal maturation during development, might generate the clinical phenotypes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a paradigm of neurodevelopmental disorders with a frequency of ~1:20,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bieth <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bochukova <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bortolin-Cavaille &amp; Cavaille, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cavaille <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) caused by deletions in chromosome 15 (15q11.2-q13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The region is “imprinted” with different expression patterns for the paternal and maternal chromosomes. PWS specifically results from the lack of expression of genes from the paternal chromosome, due to deletion, uniparental disomy or imprinting center defects. Deletions in the maternal chromosome cause a different neurological disease, Angelmann syndrome. This has been linked to loss of <italic>UBE3A</italic> which encodes a ubiquitin ligase ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Wolter <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>) and references therein). Deletions causing PWS typically remove large genomic regions, however, disease-linked microdeletions have also been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bieth <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Duker <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Tan <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). The smallest remove a ~70 Kb region of <italic>SNHG14</italic> (snoRNA host gene 14), in which 29 tandem introns each encode the small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) SNORD116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cavaille <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cavaille <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Duker <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P3"><italic>SNHG14</italic> generates a very long non-protein coding RNA (lncRNA) with a predicted primary transcript around 600 Kb in length including 145 annotated introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Runte <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). It is processed into multiple ncRNAs; including mature snoRNAs, extended snoRNA-related ncRNA species (SPA-lncRNAs and sno-lncRNAs), and alternatively spliced versions of the <italic>SNHG14</italic> exons ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Sledziowska <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Yin <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>) reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ariyanfar &amp; Good, 2022</xref>)). Multiple, non-identical versions of SNORD116, are encoded by 29 tandem introns of <italic>SNHG14</italic> and excised following splicing. Adjacent to the SNORD116 region a further 48 tandem introns encode another snoRNA-like species, SNORD115. However, differences in the spatiotemporal expression profiles of SNORD115 and SNORD116 have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Landers <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Vitali <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>), potentially reflecting a boundary conferring tissue-specific expression of the <italic>SNORD115</italic> and <italic>UBE3A-ATS</italic> regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hsiao <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Martins-Taylor <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Splicing of the snoRNA-containing introns in mouse transgenes was inhibited by depletion of the neuronal splicing factor RBFOX3 (NeuN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Coulson <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). In humans, most snoRNA species are encoded within introns of mRNAs or long non-protein coding RNAs. In analyzed cases the mature snoRNAs are generated by 5’ and 3’ exonuclease degradation of the excised intron following splicing and debranching of the intron lariat. Progression of the exonucleases is likely blocked by snoRNA assembly with proteins into stable, small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) particles, since loss of these proteins in yeast prevents snoRNA accumulation.</p><p id="P4">PWS individuals show a range of developmental and neurological deficits. Perhaps most notable is hyperphagia, which leads to potentially life-threating over-eating. This has been linked to altered gene expression in the hypothalamus, where hunger is regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bochukova <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Polex-Wolf <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Tauber <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Human tissue distribution data confirmed high SNORD116 levels in multiple brain regions including, but not limited to, the hypothalamus These findings suggest direct roles for the snoRNA in gene expression leading to regulated feeding.</p><p id="P5">SNORD116 and SNORD115 species resemble box C/D class snoRNAs, which have characteristic structural features and bind a set of four, highly conserved proteins; Fibrillarin (FBL), NOP56, NOP58 and SNU13, (NPHX, 15.5K) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). All characterized snoRNAs function through base-pairing with target RNAs, most commonly directing site-specific modification in rRNAs or other small stable ncRNAs, while some are required for pre-rRNA processing. Box C/D snoRNAs generally form extended base-paired interactions that precisely target the 2’-hyrodroxyl residue on the nucleotide located 5 base-pairs from the box D motif in the snoRNA. This directs nucleotide-specific 2’-<italic>O</italic>-methylation of the ribose group by the snoRNA-associated methyltransferase FBL. This specificity allows target sites for many snoRNAs in rRNA and stable ncRNAs to be precited with considerable confidence. However, no relevant targets are known for SNORD116 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cavaillé <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Potential targets in mRNAs have been predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Baldini <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>), and reporter constructs indicate that SNORD116 expression can stabilize the NHLH2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Burnett <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kocher <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>)</p><p id="P6">Most snoRNAs are ubiquitously expressed, but ~200 including SNORD116 and SNORD115 were reported to show brain-enriched expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cavaillé <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Most of these are described as “orphans” since, like SNORD116 and SNORD115, they lack evident base-complementarity to rRNA or other targets. Loss of SNORD115 was previously reported to impair specific pre-mRNA splicing and editing events on mRNAs. These include that encoding neuronal serotonin receptor 2C (5HT2C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Falaleeva <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kishore &amp; Stamm, 2006</xref>), although this finding was questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hebras <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Changes in mRNA levels have been reported in human PWS-derived cells, brain samples and SH-SY5Y cells, but with limited consistency ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Baldini <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bochukova <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Burnett <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Powell <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>); reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bochukova, 2021</xref>)). Overexpression of SNORD116 and SNORD115 in non-neuronal cells also altered the abundance of many RNAs, with apparent interactions when co-expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Falaleeva <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). In addition, extended forms of the snoRNAs have been proposed to sequester specific RNA-binding proteins, including the pre-mRNA spicing factor Rbfox2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Yin <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). The <italic>SNHG14</italic> host gene is widely expressed, with brain-enrichment, and other ncRNA products could also be disease-related (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ariyanfar &amp; Good, 2022</xref>)). Despite these findings, the mechanistic basis for links between non-coding RNAs originating from the <italic>SNHG14</italic> locus and PWS remain unclear.</p><p id="P7">In a neuronal model, we tested mechanisms by which RNAs encoded by SNORD115 and SNORD116 clusters might alter gene expression, including: (1) impaired ribosome synthesis (analysis of pre-rRNA processing); (2) changes in RNA abundance (RNA-sequencing); (3) changed alternative splicing (RNA-sequencing); (4) translation efficiency (comparing transcriptome [RNA-sequencing] to proteome [mass spectrometry]); (5) TF sequestration (bioinformatics of key changes in gene expression). Substantial changes were observed in gene expression, at the levels of RNA abundance and predicted translation. These could not be linked to direct snoRNA base-pairing, but the transcriptome profile of cells depleted of SNORD116 indicated that the effect is to advance developmental progression.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Regulated expression of ncRNAs from the <italic>SNHG14</italic> locus</title><p id="P8">Consistent with their reported brain-enriched expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cavaillé <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>) we saw no SNORD115 or SNORD116 in HEK293 cells. However, we detected expression in human Lund human mesencephalic (LUHMES) cells following differentiation to neurons. LUHMES are an embryonic, mid-brain derived human cell line that can be induced to synchronously differentiate into polarized dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lauter <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Smirnova <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Neuronal markers are expressed by day 6 of differentiation; including β3-tubulin (TUBB3), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95, postsynaptic marker), kinesin 17 (KIF17, neuronal transport marker) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lauter <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Smirnova <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). This high synchrony was of particular importance for biochemical analyses during differentiation time courses. We tested snoRNA expression over differentiation time course up to day 15, after which LUHMES cells become sensitive to detaching from the dish. In cycling, pre-neuronal cells (day 0; D00) SNORD115 was not detectable by northern hybridization and SNORD116 was at low abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>). Both rose rapidly during differentiation, with a plateau for SNORD116 between day 6 (D06) and day 10 (D10), whereas SNORD115 steadily increased up to day 15 (D15). This relatively late expression of SNORD115 and SNORD116 suggested their importance during later stages of neuronal maturation. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was therefore performed on undifferentiated cells and during differentiation at D06, D10 and D15. Note that the RNAseq approach used does not detect mature snoRNAs due to their short lengths. LUHMES cells are reported to be diploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Shah <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Normal karyotyping cannot exclude specific duplication in the PWS region. However, RNAseq confirms deletions within the expressed, paternal <italic>SNHG14</italic> gene, whereas maternal expression of the non-overlapping, convergent UBE3A gene is unaffected.</p><p id="P9">RNAseq data was initially characterized for expression of ncRNAs originating from the <italic>SNHG14</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). SNHG14 RNA abundance over the region surrounding the <italic>SNORD116</italic> cluster was almost unaltered during differentiation. Accumulation of the exons was substantially greater than for introns, which are normally rapidly degraded following debranching, consistent with correct splicing of introns encoding SNORD116 throughout differentiation. In contrast, the region surrounding the SNORD115 cluster showed low expression at D00. This increased during differentiation, but remained substantially lower than around <italic>SNORD116</italic> even at D15. To better characterize the changes in expression, reads mapping to exon sequences were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). This confirmed that transcripts around <italic>SNORD115</italic> markedly increased during differentiation, while those around <italic>SNORD116</italic> and at sites further 5’ were essentially unchanged. Extended snoRNA-related RNAs SPA1 and sno-lncRNAs 1-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Sledziowska <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Yin <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>) were readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), but showed only modest changes during differentiation. Other reported ncRNAs, SPA2 and sno-lncRNA 5, were not clearly identified.</p><p id="P10">The sequence data showed a clear drop between the SNORD116 and 115 clusters, whereas <italic>SNHG14</italic> was previously described as a single ~596 Kb transcription unit. To investigate this, we inspected mapping data for histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), characteristic of RNAPII transcription initiation sites, and H3K27Ac, characteristic of regulatory regions (see; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/104472715">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/104472715</ext-link> and UCSC genome browser ENCODE regulation tracks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kent <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). H3K4me3 peaks, and accompanying H3K27Ac peaks, were found at the predicted transcription start sites for <italic>SNHG14</italic> and the flanking <italic>UBE3A</italic> protein coding gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). There was no indication of initiation between the <italic>SNORD116</italic> and <italic>SNORD115</italic> clusters. We therefore predict that the apparent extension of the <italic>SNHG14</italic> transcripts into the region surrounding the <italic>SNORD115</italic> cluster reflects regulated read-through of a termination site located 3’ to <italic>SNORD116</italic>, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Vitali <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this, GENECODE V43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) indicates processing of <italic>SNHG14</italic> transcripts into multiple alternatively-spliced versions (in non-neuronal cells), covering <italic>SNORD116</italic> or <italic>SNORD115</italic> but not overlapping both clusters.</p><p id="P11">We conclude that the region encoding <italic>SNORD116</italic> is well transcribed in undifferentiated cells. The accumulation of exon regions relative to introns indicates that splicing is functional, suggesting that the failure in mature <italic>SNORD116</italic> accumulation reflects instability. We speculate that impaired assembly with snoRNP proteins allows degradation of the snoRNA sequence along with the excised intron within which it is embedded. At the same time there is abundant expression of SNORD116 containing sno-lncRNAs, indicating that those two kinds of ncRNAs undergo distinct, possibly competing processing pathways. In contrast, <italic>SNORD115</italic> is poorly expressed in undifferentiated cells, with increased transcription readthrough into this region during differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Transcriptional changes during differentiation of LUHMES cells</title><p id="P12">LUHMES cells are frequently used as a model of dopaminergic neurons. Changes in the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lauter <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) and proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Tüshaus <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) were reported up to day 6 of neuronal differentiation, at which point they were considered mature. In agreement with that, in our data most changes to the transcriptome occur between D00 and D06 of LUHMES differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). However, we observe that about 1% of genes that change expression during differentiation, showed changes between D10 and D15, when snoRNA-related effects appeared more likely.</p><p id="P13">To identify gene expression patterns related to neuronal differentiation we performed k-means clustering, with k=6 giving the best resolution without repeating patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3B and 3C</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) for all quantified genes, confirmed good separation between clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>; genes are colored by cluster). The results are consistent with previous data on LUHMES cells and other analyses of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lauter <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). The biggest cluster, CL0 (25.2 % of all genes) contains genes that are stably expressed throughout differentiation. GO term analysis using gProfiler, indicates enrichment for intercellular transport, transcription, proteolysis and macroautophagy; essential functions regardless of differentiation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>; detailed results in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). CL1-3 comprise genes that substantially change expression between D00 and D06, as the LUHMES cells exit mitosis. CL1 and CL2 genes showed decreased expression (CL2 more acutely than CL1) and are involved in growth, cell cycle regulation and progression, transcription, ribosome biogenesis and translation. CL3 genes had increased expression at D06, but lack clear GO term enrichment. The smaller CL4 (11%) and CL5 (6%) comprise genes that continued to change later during the differentiation time course. Genes from CL4 generally showed elevated expression at D06 that continued over later time points. They are enriched for characteristic neuronal functions; including neurite development, axon guidance, intercellular communication, formation of synapses, cell junctions, transmembrane transport, or cell motility. CL5 genes rose sharply at D06 and then declined. They show enrichment for tissue development and establishment of higher level organization, particularly muscles - both striated and cardiac. Decreased expression after an initial peak, potentially indicates similarities in early developmental pathways for neurons and muscles, with divergence at this point.</p><p id="P14">Notably, genes from clusters CL4 and CL5 are enriched for neuronal/developmental functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>) and show regulated expression at times when SNORD115 and SNORD116 snoRNAs accumulate.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Differentiating LUHMES cells express a homologue of core snoRNP protein Fibrillarin</title><p id="P15">Canonical box C/D snoRNAs are packaged with four proteins; the snoRNA-directed RNA 2’-<italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase Fibrillarin (FBL) together with NOP56, NOP58 and SNU13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). During LUMHES differentiation the mRNA and protein levels of FBL fell rapidly, probably reflecting a shut-down in ribosome synthesis as cell division stops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Expression of the other snoRNP components was also reduced, but to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Unexpectedly, transcriptome analysis of mRNAs that are strongly upregulated identified an almost uncharacterized homologue of FBL designated Fibrillarin Like 1 (FBLL1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). FBLL1 mRNA and protein had very low abundances in undifferentiated, cycling cells, but increased rapidly during differentiation. As expected, changes in protein levels lagged behind mRNA during FBL depletion and FBLL1 induction. Inspection of published transcriptome data (GTEx portal) strongly supported brain-specific expression of FBLL1 mRNA, which was generally anti-correlated with FBL expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>; the pituitary is located within the brain). The <italic>FBLL1</italic> gene is unusual in lacking introns, suggesting that it may have originated via retro-transposition. It also has a notably high G+C content: 89% within the 5’ 200 nt and 71% overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). This is a feature that generally correlates with high translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kudla <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and may offset negative effects on mRNA transport and translation due to the absence of introns from the <italic>FBLL1</italic> transcript.</p><p id="P16">FBL and FBLL1 share 83% similarity and 76% identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). The globular, enzymatic cores of FBL and FBLL1 are highly homologous and predicted to adopt very similar structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4F and 4G</xref>). Notably, residues directly implicated in RNA methyltransferase activity of FBL (KDK) are conserved in FBLL1, as are amino acids surrounding the catalytic site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4E and 4G</xref>). Both FBL and FBLL1 share the presence of an unstructured domain, rich in glycine and arginine (termed the GAR or RGG domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aris &amp; Blobel, 1991</xref>), and the composition of this region shows differences between FBL and FBLL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E, 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>). In particular, FBLL1 has more Lys and Trp than FBL, and fewer Phe residues. These changes potentially mediate alterations in RNA binding and condensate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kim &amp; Kwon, 2021</xref>) and could be related to the predicted stabilization of SNORD116 during differentiation (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>RNA abundance changes in a disease model system</title><p id="P17">To understand the role of SNORD116 and SNORD115 clusters in neuronal differentiation and PWS, we precisely deleted regions of <italic>SNHG14</italic> gene containing the snoRNA clusters from only the paternal (expressed) chromosome, using CRISPR in LUHMES cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>).

Surprisingly, only 9 genes showed clearly altered expression of a subset of exons in H116 and H115 cells, all with quite small effects.

Histone modification data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) indicates that the entire <italic>SNHG14</italic> region forms a single transcription unit. However, we clearly distinguished regions showing differential transcript accumulation: SNURF/SNRPN region, SPA1 region, SNORD116 cluster and SNORD115 cluster, the latter two being our major focus. During differentiation, transcriptome data revealed substantial accumulation of spliced <italic>SNHG14</italic> exons relative to introns, and little change in exon abundance within the SNORD116 region. This indicated that transcription and splicing of the <italic>SNHG14</italic> primary transcript is essentially unaltered during differentiation. We detected previously reported sno-lncRNAs, long ncRNAs containing two SNORD116 snoRNAs joined by a linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Sledziowska <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Yin <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).

This expression pattern would be consistent with competing maturation pathways for SNORD116 snoRNAs and sno-lncRNAs.</p><p id="P40">A quite different pattern was seen for the SNORD115 region, located further 3’. Very low levels of all transcripts were seen in undifferentiated cells, with accumulation of both lncRNA exons and mature snoRNAs only during differentiation. We cannot exclude the possibility that the primary transcript encompassing this region is rapidly and completely degraded in undifferentiated cells. However, it seems more likely that transcription terminates immediately prior to the SNORD115 region. During differentiation, termination readthrough increases with immediate splicing and SNORD115 accumulation.</p><p id="P41">We speculate that accumulation of mature SNORD115 and SNORD116 snoRNAs is related to the differentiation driven appearance of FBLL1 protein. FBLL1 is a close homolog of FBL, a core component of canonical snoRNPs, but is uncharacterized and apparently neuron-specific. The main differences lie within the GAR/RGG domain, a low complexity, glycine plus arginine rich, RNA interacting region, also present in several other nucleolar proteins. The GAR domain of FBLL1 has fewer charged arginine residues than FBL, but more lysine, and fewer aromatic, phenylalanine residues, but more tryptophan. The uncharged, planar amino acids can intercalate into or stack onto RNA stems. RNA interactions by the GAR domains are precited to be largely sequence independent but are likely to facilitate condensate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kim &amp; Kwon, 2021</xref>). The changes between FBL and FBLL1 may impart different phase separation properties to snoRNP complexes. We note that key steps in snoRNP maturation take place in phase-separated Cajal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Verheggen <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), offering a potential link. Functional analyses of FBLL1 will be reported elsewhere.</p><p id="P42">To better understand PWS-related changes, we created two heterozygous deletion cell lines lacking expression from either the SNORD116 or SNORD115 cluster. Notably, the LUHMES cells used have “never” expressed these snoRNAs (or at least have not done so for many generations), but then express the ncRNAs from the endogenous locus, in an appropriate cell type, during differentiation. We therefore expected to better identify primary effects, before compensatory mechanisms become dominant.</p><p id="P43">Upon deletion of the SNORD116 or SNORD115 clusters, accumulation of neighboring exons was unaffected, with no indication of unusual transcripts generated from <italic>SNGH14</italic>. Within the PWS region, genes in proximity to <italic>SNHG14</italic> gene were also unaffected. We concluded that deletion of SNORD115 and SNORD116 clusters did not influence transcriptional regulation within in PWS locus. There were, however, changes the wider PWS locus. Notable amongst these was the under-accumulation of mRNA from <italic>MAGEL2</italic>, located ~1.5 Mb “upstream” from <italic>SNORD116</italic>. Mutations in <italic>MAGEL2</italic> are causal in Schaaf-Yang syndrome, which shows striking similarities to the PWS-phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Runte <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>).

However, we did not detect MAGEL2 protein in our proteomic data, suggesting that its depletion does not cause cellular defects reported here.</p><p id="P44">Throughout the transcriptome numerous genes and ncRNAs showed altered abundance in the mutant cell lines. In the wild type, changes in mRNA abundance during differentiation predominately occur during the initial period (to D06) as the cells exit mitosis.

We noted a striking degree of overlap between RNAs with altered abundance in the SNORD116 and SNORD115 deletion strains. Although SNORD115 and SNORD116 are both classed as box C/D snoRNAs, they lack clear homology outside the conserved structural features of the C/D and C’/D’ elements. They would not therefore be expected to base pair to the same sequences. We speculate that the SNORD115 and SNORD116 families may share overlapping, but non-redundant target RNAs, or functionally interact in some way – perhaps acting cooperatively on some targets. A previous report found potential interactions between SNORD115 and SNORD116 when ectopically expressed in non-neuronal, human HEK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Falaleeva <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P45">Mature SNORD115 and SNORD116, as well as extended snoRNA transcripts, were previously reported or predicted to affect alternative pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Baldini <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kishore &amp; Stamm, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Yin <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).

Almost all keratins and keratin-associated mRNAs were strongly depleted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A and B</xref>), whereas neurofilament mRNAs were generally upregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>). This may be linked to the changes in developmental timing described below.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Altered developmental progression in cells lacking SNORD116</title><p id="P51">Principal component analysis of the RNA and protein expression data suggested that the mutant and wild-type cell lines might be on the same trajectory, but with the mutants advancing more rapidly. Comparison of mRNA levels in wild type and H116 line to a range of mid-brain cell types provided strong support for this interpretation; cells lacking SNORD116 showed greater similarity to more mature neurons, while the wild type resembles more immature cell types. Moreover, mRNAs that are specifically affected show enrichment for neuronal function, including phenotypes related to features of PWS. It might be envisaged that many different defects in cellular metabolism could slow development, perhaps by limiting gene expression. In contrast, advances in developmental progression seem likely to reflect more specific changes.</p><p id="P52">Many genes contributed to the “more mature” phenotype of snoRD116-depleted neurons, and multiple TFs were predicted to participate in their regulation. Among these, we note that the MYC-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) is activated by RNA via EWS RNA-binding protein 1 (EWSR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hoell <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), suggesting the possibility of regulation by the snoRNAs. Overall, the data indicate that the ncRNAs may act to reduce TF activity.</p><p id="P53">The effects on gene expression reported here are much more marked than in several previous analyses. This might reflect the fact that LUMES cells natively express SNORD115 and SNORD116 during differentiation. They may therefore be “primed” for the appearance of these snoRNAs, expressing the corresponding cofactors and targets. In addition, like cells in early development, LUHMES cells have never previously expressed, or required, the snoRNAs, thus avoiding selection for compensatory pathways. Detection of the changes in gene expression timing reported here were greatly facilitated by the rapid and highly synchronous development of LUHMES cells, but would potentially be obscured by heterogeneity in other model systems.</p><p id="P54">We speculate that, in the absence of timely, neuronal SNORD116 expression, early developmental timing is altered. This may generate neuronal sub-populations that are out of synchrony in individuals lacking SNORD116. Resulting impairments in optimal network generation, may trigger functional consequences later in development. However, by this time the original primary problem will not be readily identified. Previous mouse models for PWS have not fully recapitulated the human disease phenotype. We note that the timing of mouse brain development is substantially different from humans, possibly explaining these difficulties.</p><p id="P55">Developmental timing is crucial for brain development; key processes including cell division, migration and the establishment of cell-cell contacts are separated in time and depend on the extracellular environment. In humans brain development is slow relative to growth, compared to many other animals, allowing large brains, with maturation continuing even after birth. It is well documented that individuals with PWS have significant structural brain alterations. We postulate that these may fundamentally reflect subtle changes in the progression of neuronal maturation in early development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S16"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P56">LUHMES cells (ATCC cat# CRL-2927) (kindly supplied by A.

Cells were differentiated in two steps: For pre-differentiation cycling (D00) cells were seeded at 2.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells per T75 dish, grown for one day in proliferation medium. This was exchanged for differentiation medium for two days. On day 2 of differentiation cells were trypsinized, counted and seeded at 6 x 10<sup>6</sup> per 10 cm dish, starting second step of differentiation. This is important because the differentiating neurons are very sensitive to cell density. During the subsequent differentiation process, half of the medium was changed every second day.

This value is quite stable as visible from a narrow distribution of values around 1 (full range of values: 0.003 to 81), suggesting that P/R ratio is a characteristic feature of a gene at a given differentiation stage and that can be utilized to test the hypothesis that ncRNAs from PWS locus influence post-transcriptional gene expression. We consider that direct influences of the ncRNAs on the stability of multiple proteins is unlikely.</p><p id="P76">We focused on genes that show changes in P/R ratio of at least two-fold upon deletion of the SNORD115 or SNORD116 cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6I</xref>) for at least two differentiation stages and are identified as DEPs. This allowed us to limit the analysis to the most reliable subset of genes, with the protein expression stable enough to pass the statistical criteria of differential expression analysis. For all those genes we created a heatmap using ComplexHeatmap package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gu <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supp Figures 1 - 6</label><media xlink:href="EMS190122-supplement-Supp_Figures_1___6.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d100aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supp Tables 1 - 7</label><media xlink:href="EMS190122-supplement-Supp_Tables_1___7.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d100aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Shaun Webb for advice on bioinformatics, Tatsiana Auchynnikava for assistance with proteomics, Justyna Cholewa-Waclaw, Ruth Shah and Adrian Bird for the LUHMES cell line.
