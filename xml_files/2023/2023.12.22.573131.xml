This model suggests that STR mutation rates should scale linearly with a father’s age, as progenitor cells continually divide after puberty. In contrast, it suggests that STR mutation rates should not scale with a mother’s age at her child’s conception, since oocytes spend a mother’s reproductive years arrested in meiosis II and undergo a fixed number of cell divisions that are independent of the age at ovulation. Yet, mirroring recent findings, we find that STR mutation rates covary with paternal and maternal age, implying that some STR mutations are caused by DNA damage in quiescent cells rather than the classical mechanism of polymerase slippage in replicating progenitor cells. These results also echo the recent finding that DNA damage in quiescent oocytes is a significant source of <italic>de novo</italic> SNVs and corroborate evidence of STR expansion in postmitotic cells. However, we find that the maternal age effect is not confined to previously discovered hotspots of oocyte mutagenesis, nor are post-zygotic mutations likely to contribute significantly. STR nucleotide composition demonstrates divergent effects on DNM rates between sexes. Unlike the paternal lineage, maternally derived DNMs at A/T STRs display a significantly greater association with maternal age than DNMs at GC-containing STRs. These observations may suggest the mechanism and developmental timing of certain STR mutations and are especially surprising considering the prior belief in replication slippage as the dominant mechanism of STR mutagenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>mutation rate</kwd><kwd>tandem repeats</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>human evolution</kwd><kwd>molecular evolution</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Short tandem repeats (STRs) are genomic elements composed of repeating nucleotide motifs typically of length 1-6bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Weber and Wong 1993</xref>). Sometimes also known as micro- and minisatellites, they mutate at rates orders of magnitude greater than non-repetitive loci, a feature which results in high levels of diversity that enabled studies of genetic diversity in the pre-genomic era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Weber and Wong 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Spencer <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>). Despite this classical importance, STRs have fallen behind relative to single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in terms of our understanding of how germline mutation rates vary in humans, what environmental or genetic conditions may contribute to this variance, and how their variation broadly shapes complex traits and genomic evolution.</p><p id="P3">STRs are numerous – they encompass nearly 3% of the human genome, a similar proportion to that of coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>). Until recently, our understanding of how specific STR loci affect traits remained limited to a small number of large effect size loci, though the molecular underpinnings of their associations still remain largely unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">McGinty and Sunyaev 2023</xref>). Germline and somatic expansion at these loci have long been implicated in Mendelian developmental and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sherman <italic>et al</italic>. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gatchel and Zoghbi 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mitra <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nurk <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>). More broadly, variation genome-wide has recently demonstrated association with complex traits and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gymrek <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fotsing <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Margoliash <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>). Accordingly, some STRs are inferred to be under purifying selection, regardless of their instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gymrek <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mitra <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). Children diagnosed with simplex (likely non-inherited) Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have been found to harbor <italic>de novo</italic> mutations (DNMs) at STRs inferred to be more deleterious than those identified in their unaffected siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mitra <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). These recent findings suggest that STRs’ complex genotype-phenotype interactions and evolutionary history may have similar complexity to those attributed to SNVs and structural variation.</p><p id="P4">Both SNV and STR mutation rates depend strongly on paternal age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kong <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Forster <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). This dependency was classically explained by the fact that male germ cells replicate throughout the reproductive lifespan, assuming that most mutations originate as errors in replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Goodman 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Drost and Lee 1995</xref>). In the case of SNVs, recent work has cast doubt on this model and has begun to support DNA damage as a substantial source of SNVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Goodman 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Drost and Lee 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gao <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Wu <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>). The proportion of SNVs inherited from the paternal lineage, known as <italic>ɑ</italic>, remains strikingly stable with parental age, which should not be the case if most mutations are replicative in origin and the ratio of paternal to maternal cell divisions increases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gao <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>). Although the female germline does not continue to replicate after birth, the ratio of male to female germline mutations appear to remain largely constant regardless of developmental stage. Nevertheless, analyzing how the rates of different types of mutations covary with parental age and sex can provide clues to mutational mechanisms that may be more associated with replication errors or with DNA damage.</p><p id="P5">Although we have less information on how life history impacts STR mutagenesis, the high mutation rate at these loci has long been attributed primarily to polymerase slippage during S phase replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Klintschar <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Forster <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). Replication slippage typically causes STR expansions or deletions by one or more repeat units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brinkmann <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sun <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Amos <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mitra <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). Historically, studies have found no genome-wide association of STR mutation rates with maternal age (maternal age effect) but have found a strong association with paternal age (paternal age effect) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sun <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Forster <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). At face value, these age effects seemed to bolster the theory that STRs mutate only during DNA replication in S phase. Given the lack of maternal germline replication after the future mother’s birth, we would expect replication-driven mutations to exhibit a paternal age effect but no maternal age effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Drost and Lee 1995</xref>). However, previous studies of STR parental age associations draw upon much less data than comparable studies of single nucleotide mutation rates. Certain STR loci have been shown to accumulate mutations in post-mitotic cells, indicating that damage could play some role in STR mutagenesis independent of cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gonitel <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). For example, somatic expansion in postmitotic striatal medium spiny neurons of the CAG/CAA repeat that encodes a polyglutamine tract in the <italic>huntingtin</italic> gene causes Huntington’s Disease, a highly heritable and penetrant neurodegenerative disease with adolescent/early adulthood onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Wright <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lee <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown evidence that the rate of expansions and deletions at STRs may not be fully explainable by strand slippage alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Ananda <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Although directly proving a link between a mutational pattern and its causal mutational pathway can be challenging, it is possible to infer potential molecular mechanism by examining the covariance of mutation rate with polymer complexity and nucleotide content. Local mutation rate, chromatin state, and many other genomic features covary with nucleotide content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hwang and Green 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alexandrov <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Goldberg and Harris 2022</xref>). This broad phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that nucleotide content is highly predictive of local DNA conformation, or 3-dimensional molecular shape, which in turn associates with the types of molecules likely to interact with a locus and the frequency of those interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Rohs <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lazarovici <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abe <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Liu and Samee 2023</xref>). Similarly, certain types of STRs are known to form unique structures different from the canonical double helix of B DNA; for example, some guanine rich repeats form fragile cruciforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">McGinty and Sunyaev 2023</xref>). Different tumor types display variance in mutational spectra and signatures in mutations at repetitive DNA elements, indicating tissue- or tumor-specific mutation rate modifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Alexandrov <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>). When applied to polymorphic and <italic>de novo</italic> germline SNVs, these types of analyses have revealed significant diversity in the spectra of mutations accumulating in different populations, families, or species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hwang and Green 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Harris 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Harris and Pritchard 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Carlson <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bergeron <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>). Similar approaches have helped identify variance in mutational pathways active at STRs: recently, a small set of families were discovered to harbor a mutator allele that affects indels at TNT repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Reijns <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Maksimov <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In this study, we sought to further describe how STR mutation rates vary as a function of parental age and sex to better understand the developmental timeline and possible mutational mechanisms. To do so, we analyzed a dataset of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations (DNMs) at STR loci found in 1593 families comprising two parents and two children (quads), one of whom has been diagnosed with a simplex case of ASD without prior family history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fischbach and Lord 2010</xref>). These families were recruited, in part, to study how rare and <italic>de novo</italic> mutations contribute to ASD as a subset of the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fischbach and Lord 2010</xref>). Our work aims to clarify how parental age and sex impact both autism risk and deleterious DNM load, as we further characterize how these variables effect the distribution of fitness effects of STR DNMs. Very recently, a study examining nearly 77k STR DNMs in over 6000 trios identified a significant association of DNM rate with maternal age, dispelling a simplistic model of STR mutagenesis in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kristmundsdottir <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>). We confirm the presence of this maternal age effect in an independent dataset and demonstrate its robustness to noise typical of STRs genotyped with short read sequencing. Furthermore, we examine how parental age effects are modified by certain genomic features, identifying specific DNA motifs enriched for the maternal age signal.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P8">We examined STR <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in a cohort of 1593 quad families recruited as a part of the Simons Simplex collection based on the diagnosis of a simplex case of ASD in a single child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fischbach and Lord 2010</xref>). These probands have been shown to harbor an enrichment of both SNV and STR DNMs that may affect neurodevelopment and lead to ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Turner <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mitra <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). We used mutation calls from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mitra et al., 2021</xref>. As described previously, the families were sequenced to 35X coverage, and diploid genotypes at STR loci were inferred using GangSTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fischbach and Lord 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mitra <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). This database of STR DNMs is the largest compiled to date. DNMs were called using MonSTR, a likelihood-based caller with an accuracy of 90%; this accuracy was estimated based on validation with capillary electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mitra <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). Stringent filters were placed on the genotype calls as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mitra et al., 2021</xref>. We developed further stringent filters on the DNM calls to account for allelic dropout in parents at high diversity sites that result in false positive DNM calls in the children; these filters were further validated with Pacific Biosciences high fidelity (HiFi) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies long read sequencing generated for two quads (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S1, S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Briefly, these filters involve removing any DNM at a locus at which one or more reads observed in the parents matches the putative <italic>de novo</italic> allele observed in the child and resulted in filtering out 43% of non-homopolymer DNMs (30623 of out 71581). Similarly to Mitra et al., we excluded homopolymers from all analyses unless otherwise specified, as homopolymers are challenging to genotype with short read next generation sequencing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Stoler and Nekrutenko 2021</xref>). As fully described in Mitra et al., mutations were phased to their parental lineages based solely on the observed alleles in parents and child without explicitly recreating the surrounding haplotype. If the inherited allele in a child could be assigned unambiguously to one parent’s lineage, the <italic>de novo</italic> allele was phased to the other parent’s lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mitra <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). We were able to phase 56% of the non-homopolymer DNMs that passed our filters. Following these filtering steps, the mean number of STR DNMs per child was 12.91; the mean number of paternally and maternally phased DNMs was 5.80 and 1.43, respectively (95% confidence intervals [CI] 12.76 – 13.06, 5.70 – 5.89, and 1.39 - 1.49, respectively). Affected probands and their unaffected siblings respectively harbored 13.11 and 12.72 STR DNMs (95% CI 12.96 - 13.25, 12.57 - 12.87, respectively).</p><p id="P9">We separately regressed the number of maternally and paternally phased mutations per child against their mother’s and father’s ages at their birth, respectively, using Poisson regressions with identity link functions (this regression model was used throughout the study unless otherwise specified). Our analysis confirms the strong paternal age effect on the rate of paternally phased STR mutations that has been reported in this and other STR DNM datasets (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>) (0.14 paternal mutations/year, std. err. = 8.01 * 10<sup>-3</sup>, <italic>P</italic> = 1.11*10<sup>-66</sup>). In line with other recent findings, we also observe a significant effect of maternal age on maternally inherited STR DNMs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>) (0.025 maternal mutations/year, std. err. = 4.42 * 10<sup>-3</sup>, <italic>P</italic> = 8.11*10<sup>-9</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kristmundsdottir <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>). The maternal age model does not demonstrate significant overdispersion, which can lead to artificially deflated <italic>P</italic> values (<italic>P</italic> = 0.27, dispersion = 1.02, overdispersion test). Maternal age remains a significant predictor of the maternal STR mutation rate even when we include paternal age as a covariate, indicating that phasing errors are not likely to explain the signal (<italic>P</italic> = 4.20*10<sup>-6</sup>). An exponential model of the maternal age effect fits slightly better than the linear model (delta AIC = -0.2), whereas the linear model is the superior fit for the paternal age effect (delta AIC = -5). This finding mirrors the observation of an exponential maternal age effect on SNV rate presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gao et al., 2019</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gao <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>). Interestingly, neither paternal nor maternal age was significantly associated with the DNM rate at homopolymers (<italic>P</italic> = 0.062, 0.816 for paternal and maternal age effects, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S3</xref>). Although this observation could support an association between parental age effects and variance in a mutational pathway that does not affect homopolymers, it may also reflect the difficulty of accurately genotyping homopolymers and that any parental age effects are overwhelmed by the noise of sequencing errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Stoler and Nekrutenko 2021</xref>). We replicated these analysis accounting for possible additional bias in genotyping and still observed a significant association between maternal age and DNM rate (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Prior to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kristmundsdottir et al. 2023</xref>, studies found no significant maternal age effect on the STR DNM rate, but most have used several orders of magnitude fewer loci and DNMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sun <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Forster <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). To determine if these prior studies were simply underpowered to discover the maternal age effect, we repeated our regression-based inference of the DNM rate after restricting to the subset of loci analyzed in a prior study by Sun, et al. that found no maternal age effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sun <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Although this study included more trios than ours, they used a far smaller number of loci – a subset of 2477 STR sites from a larger set of ∼5000 (AC)<sub>n</sub>/(TG)<sub>n</sub> dinucleotide repeats used as markers to infer recombination maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kong <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>). Using the superset of Kong et al. sites that mapped to loci in our panel (n = 2040), we found significant association of the rate of paternally derived DNMs but no such association of maternally derived DNMs with maternal age (<italic>P</italic> = 2.81*10<sup>-7</sup>, 0.165 for paternal, maternal age effects; linear regression) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>). These results indicated that the low number of loci in prior studies have resulted in insignificant statistical power to discover a maternal age effect.</p><p id="P11">Recent studies of de novo SNVs have found that the fraction of phased mutations arising from the paternal lineage, known as <italic>ɑ</italic>, does not depend on parental age; instead, the father contributes about 3/4 of mutations regardless of the total mutation load or the ages of the parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gao <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>). In contrast to this, we find a significant positive association between ɑ and paternal age, indicating that the paternal STR mutation rate increases disproportionately to the maternal mutation rate (0.0023 increase in paternal fraction per year, <italic>P</italic> = 4.99*10<sup>-3</sup>, quasibinomial GLM with identity link function) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>). This observation likely supports replication as the dominant mechanism of STR DNMs, though the weak slope and nonzero maternal age effect indicate that damage independent of replication still contributes.</p><p id="P12">Part of the maternal age effect on single nucleotide substitutions has been attributed to a higher rate of post-zygotic mutagenesis in older mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gao <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>). To examine whether the same might be true for STRs, we tested for covariance between maternal age and the mutation rate of STRs occurring on paternally inherited chromosomes, controlling for variance in paternal age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gao <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>). After controlling for paternal age, any correlation of mutation rate on paternally inherited chromosomes with maternal age could indicate that older mothers harbor a higher postzygotic mutation rate. To do this, we randomly sampled nonoverlapping pairs of children born to fathers of the same age (+/- 6 months). For each pair of children, we calculated the differences in maternal ages and the additional number of STR DNMs phased to the father identified in the child born to the older mother. We detected no significant correlation between maternal age and paternally phased STR DNMs, conditional on equal paternal age (one-sided Spearman’s correlation test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.47; GLM <italic>P</italic> = 0.831) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S6</xref>). This analysis provided no evidence that advanced maternal age causes additional post-zygotic mutations to accumulate on paternally inherited chromosomes. Simulations, however, suggest that our power to detect weak postzygotic maternal age effects is limited (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>).</p><sec id="S3"><title>Nucleotide content modifies parental age and sex effects on STR DNM rate</title><p id="P13">Thorough characterization of the maternal age effect on SNV DNM rate found that the effect was enriched for specific genomic hotspots and C&gt;G mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Jónsson <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gao <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>).

We then modeled the effect of parental age on STR DNM rates, testing for covariance and interaction with STR nucleotide content. To account for differences in the number of loci between nucleotide content bins, we included an offset variable of the number of genotyped nonhomopolymer sites, which forces a beta coefficient of 1 (though using an offset is more straightforward to apply with a log link function, which we used in this figure’s analyses) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Paternal mutation rate at GC-containing STRs was significantly higher than that of AT-only STRs, though the paternal age effect was not significantly different; in fact, a model without an interaction variable was a better fit while accounting for differences in degrees of freedom (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 2 * 10<sup>-16</sup> for GC content effect on intercept; delta AIC = -2).

This evidence supports claims that ASD may be somewhat related to DNM burden at STRs. Following our finding that maternal age more strongly affected certain types of STRs, we sought to test whether parental age and sex affected the deleteriousness of DNMs. Selection coefficients were inferred for ∼90,000 di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide STRs using SISTR as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mitra <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>).

The fraction of phased mutations deriving from the paternal lineage increases with paternal age, supporting a hypothesis that the ratio of paternal to maternal mutation rates is lower pre-puberty than post-puberty. This is ostensibly a result of the continued replication of the paternal germline after puberty. Nevertheless, the significant maternal age effect cannot be a result of polymerase slippage during S-phase replication, as the maternal germline does not replicate after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Drost and Lee 1995</xref>). This observation is reminiscent of findings of STR expansions in postmitotic cells and may provide broader evidence that damage-associated STR mutagenesis is observed across many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gonitel <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P22">The stronger maternal age association with deletion DNMs at AT-only repeats may provide a clue as to the source of these mutations, though our current understanding of STR mutational signatures is not advanced enough to decode it.

(2021)</xref>. However, we implemented several additional filtering strategies to account for possible cryptic sources of bias in the dataset. In particular, we noticed that DNMs at loci where one parent is homozygous and the other is heterozygous are more likely to originate on the chromosome inherited from the homozygous parent rather than the heterozygous parent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1</xref>). We hypothesized that this observation might be the result of allelic dropout events: if a parent is heterozygous at a locus but incorrectly genotyped such that they appear homozygous, their child could inherit an allele that is falsely identified as a de novo event. Similar strategies to account for possible allelic dropout in this dataset have been previously described; we developed a new, strict, read-based approach to accounting for this possible artifact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mitra <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Using a read-based approach, we filtered a starting set of 175,290 <italic>de novo</italic> STR calls identified by MonSTR. We used pysam to assess the number of Illumina reads with the <italic>de novo</italic> allele in a child and its parents. Importantly, we did not perform a local realignment step like Mitra et al., but instead opted to use the original alignments to GRCh38. First, we selected any primary reads aligned to the starting coordinate of the STR with mapping quality &gt; 60. We retained only reads that spanned not only the length of the longest observed STR allele in the family, but also included 10 base pairs of flanking sequence on either end of the STR, excluding soft-clipped bases. For every read that completely spanned the length of the longest STR sequence and its flanking bases, we queried the sequence at those coordinates. To determine the length of the STR allele in a given read, we simply traversed the sequence until we found the first instance of the STR motif, and then counted the number of continuous STR motifs that followed. Once we reached the end of the STR, we checked the 10 bases preceding the start and following the end to ensure that they matched the reference sequence that flanks the STR. Reads with interruptions in the STR sequence or more than one mismatch between the observed and reference flanking were discarded. If there were no reads with the <italic>de novo</italic> allele in the child, we called the variants a false positive. If there was one or more reads with the <italic>de novo</italic> allele in either parent, we called the variant inherited. All <italic>de novo</italic> variants with no read support in either parent and at least one supporting allele in the child were labeled true events, for a final <italic>de novo</italic> STR callset of 56,925 variants.</p><p id="P25">We generated long read sequencing data using Pacific Biosciences high-fidelity (HiFi) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) for two families from our dataset in order to further validate <italic>de novo</italic> variants and assess our validation strategy (a total of 157 STR variants across 4 children) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). For the parents and child, we aligned HiFi and ONT data to GRCh38, and then manually examined the length of the STR allele in each aligned read with mapping quality &gt; 60. Using the same criteria (at least one read with the <italic>de novo</italic> allele in the child, and no reads with the <italic>de novo</italic> allele in the parents), we determined whether each variant was a true de novo event. Upon visual inspection, we found that only 52.5% (31/59) of non-homopolymer DNMs have no evidence of being inherited (24.8% of all DNMs [39/157]). Furthermore, we found that only 8% of putative STR DNMs at homopolymer loci showed no evidence of being inherited from parents or falsely genotyped in the child. This observation further motivated our decision to exclude all homopolymer DNMs from analysis. Based on the long read data, we predict our filter has an accuracy of 92.3%, sensitivity of 94.8%, and specificity of 91.5%. Furthermore, the bias towards DNM phasing to homozygous parents we observed with the full dataset was attenuated when applying these filters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P26">The sensitivity of this filtration strategy, however, may be lower at some loci and alleles. Each read mapping to an STR locus supports a certain allele length, here measured in number of repeat units; GangSTR uses the amount of read support for allele lengths to call a genotype. However, at some loci, reads support a variety of possible allele lengths. For example, at a site where parents have genotypes [10, 10] and [10, 10] but frequently we observe reads supporting an allele of length [11], we would erroneously filter possible <italic>de novo</italic> [11] alleles in a child. We were therefore motivated to further assess the variance in sensitivity of our filter, i.e., how frequently would we erroneously filter out a putative STR DNM. Given a family with parental genotypes [10, 10] and [10, 10] and a proband genotype of [10, 11] (putative <italic>de novo</italic> allele [11]), we searched for any other set of parents with the exact same genotypes (sex non-specific) and no children with the same putative <italic>de novo</italic> allele; these are “positive” couples, from whom a putative [11] allele was unlikely to have dropped out from genotyping. In these positive couples, we counted the number of reads that supported the target family’s putative <italic>de novo</italic> allele to assess the frequency with which we would erroneously flag a couple for possible allelic dropout. We found that sensitivity differed greatly between loci and sometimes between alleles at the same locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>). We could not reliably predict which loci and genotypes had high false negative rates; calculating the empirical false negative rate was only possible for loci and genotypes common among the SSC parents. Implementing an updated filtration strategy allowing &gt;0 reads supporting the putative <italic>de novo</italic> allele at certain loci could bias us against rare genotypes, especially those uncommon in families of predominantly European ancestry, which comprise the bulk of the SSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Wilfert <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). Thus, we chose to maintain our strict filtering technique and accounted for possible variance in sensitivity by calculating and regressing with an accurate denominator, as described in the following section.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Denominator calculation</title><p id="P27">At sites with high sequencing noise or parental diversity in alleles, only a subset of possible DNMs can be confidently called. In the following descriptions, alleles are annotated by their number of repeat units. For example, at a site where the parents have genotypes [10, 10] and [11, 11], a 10 -&gt; 11 mutation or an 11 -&gt; 10 DNM resulting in either a [10, 10] or a [11, 11] genotype in the child would be indistinguishable from (and perhaps more parsimoniously explained by) allelic dropout in the child. Furthermore, if ≥ 1 reads from the [11,11] parent indicated a 12 allele, observing the 12 allele in the child could again indicate dropout over mutation. However, any DNM could be discoverable at a site where both parents are [10, 10] with no reads mapping any other alleles. These concerns affect the denominator for each trio, i.e. how many sites are we able to discover DNMs. To account for variance in denominator as a possible artifactual source of the association of STR DNM rate with maternal age, we applied an extra set of filters requiring 100% discoverability for all DNMs observed in a trio. For a given mutation size of <italic>i</italic> repeat units, a site is fully discoverable if and only if for every parental allele <italic>a</italic> in all parental alleles <italic><bold>A</bold></italic>, no reads in the parents map to any allele of size <italic>a +/- i</italic>.

For each pair of parents in the dataset, we examined every STR site that was genotyped in all four parental haplotypes in Illumina data aligned to GRCh38. Borrowing code from our STR filtering script, we selected passing reads and estimated the length of the STR in each read. We classified every observed allele as an “uncallable mutation” – if an allele was observed in even 1 parental read, it would never pass our <italic>de novo</italic> filtering script. Unfortunately, this filter left us with only 833 maternally derived mutations, which gave us insufficient power to observe a significant maternal age effect on their rate per child (<italic>P</italic> = 0.12, GLM). These validated mutations are more challenging to phase with our methods, given the high proportion from sites with no diversity in parental alleles (31% vs. 15% of DNMs that passed filters in prior section). However, a regression of the mutation rate of all mutations regardless of phase and against both maternal and paternal age found that both parental ages were significantly positively associated with rate (<italic>P</italic> = 1 * 10<sup>-11</sup>, 0.012 for paternal, maternal age). This model was significantly better than one that did not include maternal age as a covariate (delta AIC = -4). Furthermore, Poisson GLMs regressing the number of fully discoverable mutations (numerator in above equation) against parental age including an offset of the sum of the number of loci discoverable for mutations of sizes 1, 2, and 3 (denominator in above equation) found significant paternal and maternal age effects, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2 * 10<sup>-16</sup>, <italic>P</italic> = 4.41 * 10<sup>-9</sup> for paternal and maternal age effects, respectively, log link). This indicated to us that, although the maternal age effect appeared robust to differences in denominator, this approach could result in a lack of statistical power for any further analyses.

However, due to the low number of nonhomopolymer STR DNMs that pass our filters and can be phased to a parental lineage, we may be limited in our power to detect small amounts of this postzygotic mutagenesis.

While their study sequenced 24832 trios at 2477 loci for a total of 6.15 * 10<sup>7</sup> transmissions at AC dinucleotides, our study examined 3172 at 55830 AC dinucleotide loci alone for 1.77 * 10<sup>8</sup> transmissions (and 6.83*10<sup>5</sup> non-homopolymer STR loci for 2.17 * 10<sup>9</sup> total transmissions).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Table S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS193116-supplement-Table_S1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d160aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS193116-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d160aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S12"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Science (T32GM081062 to M.E.G., 1R35GM133428-01 to K.H.), the National Human Genome Research Institute (T32HG008962 to M.E.G.), and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (R01HD106112 to A.R.Q.); the National Institute of Mental Health (R01MH101221 to E.E.E.), all at the National Institutes of Health; the Simons Foundation (SFARI 810018EE to E.E.E.); the Burroughs Wellcome Fund (a Career Award at the Scientific Interface to K.H.); the Pew Charitable Trusts (Biomedical Scholarship to K.H.), the Searle Scholars Program (Career Award to K.H.), and the Alfred P.

replication. Contradicting this long-held theory, we show that tandem repeats accumulate mutations in maternal germ cells during periods when these cells do not replicate. This bolsters a new consensus that DNA replication is not the only driver of mutagenesis, even at loci where replicative slippage is possible. Patterns shared by certain loci enriched for mutations from older mothers may hint at mechanisms.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Significant maternal and paternal age effects on STR DNM rate.</title><p>A, B: Number of paternal and maternal nonhomopolymer STR DNMs per offspring in the SSC are plotted and regressed against paternal and maternal age at birth, respectively.

The number of STR DNMs phased to the respective parental lineage is plotted as a function of the respective parental age for AT-only and GC-containing STRs. For readability and to account for differences in panel size, the number of GC-containing STR DNMs is rescaled by the ratio of AT-only to GC-containing loci in the panel. We account for panel size differences in the models described in the main text with an offset covariate, though lines plotted here are Poisson GLMs with identity link functions fit to rescaled mutation counts with ggplot2.
