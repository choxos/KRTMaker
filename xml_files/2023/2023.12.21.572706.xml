CH has been associated with higher risk of haematological cancer, cardiovascular disease and lower life expectancy and is strongly age-dependent, becoming almost ubiquitous in older adults. However, the dynamics of CH are not yet fully understood, and an accurate quantitative model of clonal expansion in healthy people could inform strategies for risk stratification and early detection of haematological malignancy. Here, we analyse the age-dependence of the variant allele frequency (VAF) distributions of CH driver variants from blood-derived whole exomes in 420,000 cancer-free UK Biobank participants. Across a number of CH driver genes (including <italic>DNMT3A, TP53</italic> and <italic>TET2</italic>) we find evidence of a substantial deceleration of clonal expansion with age, while other drivers (including <italic>SRSF2, SF3B1</italic>, and <italic>IDH2</italic>) display more consistent growth throughout life. We find that this deceleration occurs consistently across the population and happens mostly before the age of 40. Using evolutionary models of clonal dynamics we assess the validity of alternative mechanisms of clonal deceleration. We find that variation in fitness among individuals (e.g. due to genetic susceptibility) is not sufficient to explain the deceleration. We also consider a clonal competition model in which clonal expansion later in life is inhibited by interference with a background of other expanding clones, and find this model inconsistent with the data given established estimates of the prevalence of hidden selection in blood. Our results imply that the intrinsic selection landscape in blood is substantially different in early life compared with middle age.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The acquisition and clonal expansion of somatic mutations is a ubiquitous feature of human ageing, observed across a range of tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. In blood, this phenomenon, termed clonal haematopoiesis (CH), causes dramatic changes to the clonal diversity of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in later life and is associated with higher risk of haematological cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, cardiovascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and lower life expectancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. CH is rare in young adults but the prevalence increases with age and it is observed in almost all adults by age 65<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. A rapid collapse in clonal diversity is often observed around the age of 70<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. However, we do not yet have a full quantitative understanding of the factors that shape this age dependence.</p><p id="P3">A simple model of CH in which driver mutations occur at a constant average rate and expand exponentially has been shown to capture key features of the variant allele frequency (VAF) distributions of clones, enabling one to estimate the fitness effects conferred by key CH-associated genes and mutation ‘hotspots’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, longitudinal studies of CH have yielded conflicting estimates of fitness, suggesting that clonal fitness may vary over a lifetime. The growth of driver variants in some genes (e.g. <italic>DNMT3A, TP53</italic>) has been suggested to decelerate with age, while other drivers (e.g. <italic>SRSF2, SF3B1</italic>) appear to expand more quickly in later life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Since most existing estimates of clonal expansion rates are derived from elderly people, little is known about the timing of age-related changes. The extent to which age-related changes in fitness could be linked to variation between individuals, competition between clones in the HSC pool or age-related changes in HSC biology remains unknown.</p><p id="P4">UK Biobank (UKB) is a cohort of more than 420,000 individuals aged 37-73 at recruitment. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of blood samples from the cohort provides an opportunity to characterise CH at genomic hotspots across a large, healthy population spanning more than three decades. Here we use UKB to characterise VAF distributions of common CH driver mutations in people of different ages and investigate quantitatively how the dynamics of CH change with age. We observe that for many CH drivers there is a fundamental inconsistency between the growth rates required to explain the clones size distribution observed in the youngest age-group in UKB and the growth rates required to explain how the clone size distribution evolves between the youngest and oldest age-groups. By exploring mathematical models of clonal dynamics we find evidence for population-wide age-related deceleration of CH that suggests that the selection landscape in blood in the first four decades of life is sub-stantially different than in middle age.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Widespread age-related deceleration of CH</title><p id="P5">Somatic clone sizes are determined by when variants arise and how quickly clones subsequently grow. Existing work has shown that somatic mutations in many tissues, including blood, are acquired at a constant rate throughout life,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and that the variation in clone sizes in CH is consistent with the principle that CH driver variants confer a consistent fitness advantage to cells per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> without the need to explicitly account for the spatial structure of the HSC niche or external selective pressures. However, emerging evidence suggests that the selection landscape in CH may change over individuals’ lifetimes. Clonal growth rates from longitudinal samples are frequently observed to be lower on average than those determined cross-sectionally, and some clones have growth rates too slow for them to have achieved their observed size within the lifespan of the individual<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, suggesting that deceleration of clonal expansion may be widespread in later life.</p><p id="P6">To try and reconcile these observations, we examined the VAF distributions across 424,089 individuals aged 37-73 from the UK Biobank exome sequencing dataset. We focussed our initial analysis on 18 common ‘hotspot’ variants for which sufficient data existed to analyse VAF spectra across a range of ages, excluding individuals with a history of cancer or those with multiple CH drivers (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). We applied an evolutionary framework we had previously developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> to estimate the fitness effect (<italic>s</italic>) associated with each variant by fitting the model to the VAF distribution observed across all ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), under the assumption of a constant expansion rate. The VAF distribution predicted by the model is in close agreement with the data, and the fitness effects and mutation rates inferred are broadly consistent with previous estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S14, S15</xref>).</p><p id="P7">However, stratifying the data by age uncovers a diversity of age-dependent growth rates. For several variants (e.g. <italic>DNMT3A</italic> R882H, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), the youngest UKB participants carry a substantially larger number of CH clones than would be predicted if clonal growth was consistent throughout life. These clones are also at much higher VAF than would be expected: some of the youngest individuals carry variants that have nearly fully swept the blood, which would require growth rates in excess of existing estimates. Conversely, the evolution of the VAF distributions between ages 40 and 70 years appears much slower than expected. This strongly suggests that the rate of clonal expansion driven by these variants varies over a lifetime.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Quantifying age-dependent clonal dynamics</title><p id="P8">To quantify this age-dependent effect across multiple hotspots, we adopted a two-phase model of clonal dynamics in which clones grow at a constant rate <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> until age 40 years, and at a different rate <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub> thereafter, with these rates consistent across the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Very few UK Biobank participants were younger than 40 years at recruitment, so it is not possible to model the dynamics at younger ages: <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> simply represents an average growth rate in early life determined by the prevalence of variants at age 40. While the age-dependence of growth rates is likely to be more complex than this, this heuristic model can nonetheless be informative – for example, <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> establishes a lower bound on the early-life clonal growth rate, since if clones decelerate sooner than age 40 they must have expanded faster up to that point.</p><p id="P9">To fit the model, we developed a new maximum-likelihood approach which explicitly accounts for both the age and clone size for each individual (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 2D</xref>). Our method adjusts for the uncertainty in VAF introduced by sequencing at finite depth, an important source of additional dispersion in relatively low-depth sequencing data such as the UKB exomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We applied the two-phase model to each of the 18 CH hotspots, independently inferring the mutation rates (<italic>µ</italic>) and ‘deceleration factor’ (fold-change in fitness) <italic>α</italic> = <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>/s</italic><sub>2</sub> for each variant. The model was able to capture the observed VAF distributions accurately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e-g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S16</xref>). The age-specific prevalence was generally consistent with exponential growth over the 40-70 years age range, implying strongly that any deceleration occurs mostly before 40 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S16</xref>). In particular, for all 12 hotspots in <italic>DNMT3A</italic>, the two-stage model was a significant improvement (LR test: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 5 × 10<sup><italic>−</italic>4</sup> for all DNMT3A variants), with each hotspot showing a substantial deceleration.

We called CH across the whole exome in the same UK Biobank participants using a set of bespoke filters (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref> and Supplementary Note 1B) and identified fourteen genes where at least 50 cancer-free individuals carried putative somatic clones, CH prevalence was associated with age at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and sequencing coverage was sufficient (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We aggregated data for all variants in each gene as a single variant ‘burden’, fitted the two-stage evolutionary model described above and estimated the total mutation rate to CH drivers and the early- and late-life fitness parameters for each gene. For genes where one or two hotspots (n &gt; 50) dominated the CH spectrum (<italic>MYD88, SRSF2</italic>), only the hotspots were included and each was analysed separately. For <italic>SRSF2</italic>, these hotspots had already been included in the above analysis so they were not analysed again.</p><p id="P13">Of the fifteen genes included in total, twelve displayed significant evidence of deceleration (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.1 × 10<sup><italic>−</italic>4</sup>), with only <italic>SRSF2, SF3B1</italic> (K700E and K666N) and <italic>IDH2</italic> (R140Q) consistent with consistent growth over a lifetime (<italic>p &gt;</italic> 0.05).

An exception to this was <italic>ASXL1</italic>, where the deceleration was much less pronounced (<italic>α</italic> = 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5) and the late-life growth rate remained relatively high (13% per year). For the genes exhibiting <italic>DNMT3A</italic>-like deceleration, expansion rates after age 40 were estimated to be 5-10% per year, with inferred early-life growth rates of approximately 20% per year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The deceleration of <italic>DNMT3A</italic> on aggregate was consistent with the behaviour of the twelve previously analysed <italic>DNMT3A</italic> hotspots, although the fit to the gene-wide VAF distribution was visibly poorer, likely as a result of aggregating a large number of drivers with varying fitness effects.

While we observed a higher late-life growth rate for <italic>TET2</italic>-than <italic>DNMT3A</italic>-variant clones, <italic>TET2</italic>-variant clones presented clear evidence of early-life deceleration and a relatively slow expansion rate in later life, suggesting that its general behaviour is more similar to the majority of CH driver genes than to the late, fast-growing splicing genes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Fitness variation alone cannot explain age deceleration</title><p id="P15">To investigate how the underlying dynamics of the haematopoietic system might give rise to decelerating clones across the exome, we adapted our evolutionary model to explore two potential explanations: variation of fitness between individuals and clonal competition.</p><p id="P16">Longitudinal evidence suggests that clones with the same driver variant can expand at substantially different rates in different individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. While the mechanisms underlying this diversity are not fully understood, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci associated with prevalence of CH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> suggesting fitness variation is partly driven by genetic susceptibility. To test whether variation in fitness among individuals could explain the apparent age-related deceleration of CH, we modified the existing model to draw fitness effects for each individual from a distribution of fitness effects (DFE). Fitness effects were drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> and standard deviation <italic>σ</italic> for each CH driver, which tended to a constant-fitness model as <italic>σ</italic>→ 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We verified that introducing a DFE can cause changes in the VAF distribution that resemble deceleration, even if each individual’s fitness remains constant throughout life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-c</xref>), Supplementary Note. 3B.1).</p><p id="P17">We applied this model to the decelerating CH drivers in UK Biobank to assess whether the deceleration observed could be accounted for by a distribution of fitness effects.

We estimated <italic>µ</italic>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> and <italic>δ</italic> for each of the twelve decelerating hotspots (all in <italic>DNMT3A</italic>) using a maximum-likelihood approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S18</xref>).

However, despite the best-fit DFEs showing considerable variation in fitness (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M3"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> close to zero, <italic>σ∼</italic> 5% per year) the predicted deceleration remained notably weaker than observed in UKB. This suggests that fitness variation alone is not sufficient to explain the observed deceleration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). The best fits to the data were achieved with monotonically decreasing DFEs, contrary to what might be expected if genetic susceptibility was the source of variation. However, our power to estimate the DFE at lower fitnesses is limited by the lower VAF threshold in the UKB exome data (~ 3%), as variants with low fitness are very unlikely reach detectable levels in UK Biobank (Supplementary Note 3B.2).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Competition-mediated deceleration requires very high levels of hidden selection</title><p id="P18">The genetic makeup of the blood changes with age, from a ‘polyclonal’ landscape comprising a large number of small, unique clones in early life to an ‘oligoclonal’ landscape dominated by a small number of highly expanded clones in later life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Competition between clones is a natural consequence of such a transition, and has been observed directly in individuals in the years prior to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. If multiple clones of varying fitness reach a high VAF in the same individual, this could could slow, or even reverse, the clonal expansions of less fit clones later in life. A number of studies have shown that 60-80% of clonal expansions in blood do not involve alterations in currently known cancer driver genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> suggesting that deceleration could be due to competition from fitter clones with unobserved ‘hidden’ drivers.</p><p id="P19">We derived a model in which clones driven by such ‘hidden’ drivers can arise and expand alongside clones containing known CH drivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 3C</xref>) and estimated the parameters for the hidden drivers required to produce the deceleration. Both the observed and background clones were assumed to arise at a constant mutation rate and have constant fitness effects, with any age-dependent behaviour emergent from the competition between the two. We analysed all genes that had displayed significant evidence of deceleration, with the DNMT3A hotspots treated separately.</p><p id="P20">For each of these genes and hotspots, we estimated the mutation rates and fitness effects for the CH hotspots and the unobserved background that would be required to obtain a good fit to the UKB data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The estimated fitness of the (unobserved) background clones was 20-23%, as expected slightly greater than the observed driver variants being analysed. The mutation rate (<italic>µ</italic>) of the background clones was ∼ 10<sup><italic>−</italic>5</sup> per cell per year, markedly higher than all the observed CH drivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p><p id="P21">It is also possible to estimate the characteristics of the background required for clonal competition in middle age from a theoretical perspective. To do this, we derived estimates for the the mutation rate and fitness of ‘hidden’ drivers required so that the average individual has at least one expanded clone by middle-age (detailed derivation in Supplementary Note 3C). We found that to reach the observed prevalence, the mutation rate to high-fitness drivers must be of the order 1<italic>/N</italic> <sub><italic>τ</italic></sub> (<italic>N</italic> = HSC population size), that is ∼10<sup><italic>−</italic>5</sup> per cell per year. Moreover, only large-VAF clones will produce competition. For a typical clone to have reached a substantial VAF by middle age its fitness must be at least 20% per year.</p><p id="P22">A background mutation rate of approximately 10<sup><italic>−</italic>5</sup> per cell per year to highly fit drivers is significantly larger than existing estimates of the total mutation rate to CH drivers (including ‘missing’ drivers), for example by Poon et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Exact comparisons are sensitive to assumptions about distribution of fitness, but the levels of missing selection required to produce extensive clonal competition in middle age are clearly inconsistent with the prevalence of hitch-hiking synonymous variants in blood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S12</xref>). Such a large mutation rate to hidden drivers also implies that a significant fraction of HSCs in an average healthy person at age 40-50 are members of expanded clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S13</xref>). This is not observed in phylogenetic analysis of HSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> where this ‘collapse’ in somatic diversity is seen only around the age of 70. We conclude, therefore, that clonal competition is unlikely to be the primary factor underlying the deceleration of clones observed in UK Biobank.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">By analysing the cross-sectional VAF spectra of established CH driver variants across ~420, 000 UK Biobank participants, we demonstrated that clonal expansion does not occur evenly across a person’s lifetime. The overabundance of variants seen in young people, relative to the expected frequency under a constant selective advantage, indicates that clonal expansion slows with age, and that much of this deceleration occurs before age 40 years. This deceleration was seen across the majority of, though not all, CH driver genes, suggesting that clonal deceleration is a more general phenomenon in CH. Our findings are consistent in a number of important ways with existing analysis of CH derived from longitudinal samples in later life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Where previous cross-sectional analysis have estimated the average fitness of clones over a lifetime (e.g. <italic>DNMT3A</italic> R882H: <italic>s</italic> = 15%/yr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>), we were able to estimate the fitness in middle age directly, which we found to be in close agreement with longitudinal estimates (e.g. <italic>DNMT3A</italic> R882H: cross-sectional late-life <italic>s</italic> = 5.3%/yr, longitudinal <italic>s</italic> = 5.5%/yr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>). Similarly, longitudinal analyses have identified clones that expand too slowly in later life to explain the observed VAF under an assumption of constant growth, again implying early-life deceleration. Since the UK Biobank includes participants as young as 40 and growth rates appear consistent over the age range studied, we are able to conclude that any deceleration occurs primarily before the age of 40. An important implication is that clonal expansion in the young may be faster than previously thought (e.g. &gt;20%/yr for <italic>DNMT3A</italic>). This prediction could be tested directly by studying children and young people, as discussed further below.</p><p id="P24">Another finding in agreement with existing work is that clones driven by <italic>SRSF2</italic> and <italic>SF3B1</italic> variants expand faster than other drivers in later life. We found that for these genes (and the <italic>IDH2</italic> R140Q hotspot), the data were consistent with a relatively low mutation rate but constant fitness throughout life. This indicates that their fitness advantage during later life might result from maintaining steady growth while most other clones slow down, rather than late-life acceleration as others have suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Clones carrying <italic>ASXL1</italic> variants were also found to retain a relative fitness advantage later in life. Conversely, clones carrying <italic>U2AF1</italic> variants showed modest late-life growth rates, although other studies have reported fast expansion in elderly individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">The model of deceleration presented is simplistic but illustrates that a period of fast growth followed by a period of slower (but consistent) growth captures the observed features of both the VAF distributions and prevalence curves in the UK Biobank. The nature of the early period is open to interpretation: for example, rapid clonal expansion in childhood followed by a decline during adolescence would produce the same VAF distributions as the model presented here, with suitably adjusted parameters (Supplementary note 3A). The findings raise the prospect of a yet-unknown biological change in HSC dynamics occurring in young people.</p><p id="P26">We sought to investigate how the fundamental dynamics of HSCs might give rise to clonal deceleration using mathematical models. Some of the key features of clonal dynamics, such as the collapse in clonal diversity around age 70, can be shown to be emergent properties of a constant-growth model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. However, we found that competition between clones growing at a constant rate is unlikely to be sufficient to explain the deceleration. We estimated the genome-wide mutation rate and fitness effect of CH drivers that would be required to produce pervasive clonal competition in middle age, finding that both are implausibly large compared to existing estimates (for instance, derived from hitch-hiking synonymous variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>). This is largely a consequence of the fact that the deceleration appears to occur relatively early in life: an alternative perspective is that pervasive clonal competition is a feature of the collapse in diversity, and before this collapse occurs clonal competition is unlikely to play a major role at the population level.</p><p id="P27">The variation in clonal expansion rates between healthy individuals carrying the same CH driver remains relatively poorly characterised. A weakness of our single-timepoint approach is that the the effects of deceleration and fitness variation are mutually confounding and therefore difficult to quantify independently. We found that incorporating variation in fitness effects improved predictions of VAF distribution, consistent with evidence from longitudinal studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, we found that even an exaggerated degree of variation was unable to reproduce the extent of clonal deceleration observed in UK Biobank, suggesting that while variation is probably present, it is not the primary mechanism responsible for the apparent slowing of clonal growth. Longitudinal studies are likely better suited to addressing this issue, but age again may be an important factor: in older people with a clonal spectrum characterised by a few highly-expanded clones, clonal competition and multiple mutation are likely to increase observed variation in fitness. Since most existing longitudinal studies are in older people, the degree of inter-individual diversity in the 40-70 year age group is even less clear. Higher-VAF clones are associated with increased cancer risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> so clonal expansion rate at the individual level could be an important risk modifier: this is a key area for future study.</p><p id="P28">The mechanism underlying the observed deceleration remains unknown. Changes in stem cell numbers over time could produce decelerating dynamics, and existing work has identified decreasing stem cell division rates with age in colon, oesophagus and other non-blood tissues in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The HSC population in blood, however, has been estimated to be quite stable at <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>τ</italic></sub> <italic>≈</italic> 100, 000 from early childhood onwards, albeit with a relatively large uncertainty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. One feature of our evolutionary model is that HSC population size is better estimated using low-VAF clones, so the limited sequencing depth of the UKB exomes constrains our ability to assess this issue. Other mechanisms have been proposed that could give rise to apparent age-related deceleration: for instance, that for some driver genes, decaying telomere length in expanding clones impedes cell division later in life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">A more complete model of healthy CH dynamics would be greatly facilitated if CH could be evaluated directly in individuals from early childhood to middle age. A sufficiently large and deeply-sequenced study (ideally with data at multiple time points) would enable many of the poorly-understood aspects of healthy CH to be explored in detail: clonal fitness in early life and the mechanisms of the deceleration, the effects of germline genetics and extrinsic environmental factors on fitness and mutation rate, and the role of early development and HSC population size.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Identifying CH in the UK Biobank</title><p id="P30">Exome sequencing of 450,000 people was performed on DNA from blood samples from participants in the UK Biobank,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, a prospective cohort study of 500,000 middle-aged people in the UK.
