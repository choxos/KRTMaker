However, PN/A of undiluted source-separated urine has not yet been established. In this study, the feasibility of PN/A for source-separated urine (total nitrogen ≈ 2 to 3 g-N L<sup>-1</sup>). To evaluate the influence of different factors, one- and two-stage configurations were operated using different influents, i.e. source-separated urine, synthetic urine, and urine with additional divalent cations. While partial nitritation was successfully achieved in both configurations with digester supernatant and urine, anammox activity was lost shortly after switching from digester supernatant to the urine influents. Toxic organic compounds or pharmaceuticals and the high monovalent to divalent cation ratio were suspected as causes of anammox failure, but were ruled out due to the different reactor configurations and influent compositions tested. Other suspected factors such as COD/N ratio, phosphate and sulfate inhibition, nitrogen compound inhibition, metal inhibition, pH and dissolved oxygen were also systematically excluded. Instead, the high salt concentration in urine compared to the digester supernatant most likely caused the reactor to fail due to the disintegration of large flocs, and the resulting challenge of biomass retention. The shortcomings of the floccular sludge system were overcome by using biofilm carriers, resulting in successful PN/A. This hybrid system ran for 140 days with nitrogen removal rates of up to 1000 mg-N L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> with an average of 410 ± 220 mg-N L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, and a nitrogen removal efficiency of 93 ± 3% at 30°C.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Source separation</kwd><kwd>Nitrogen removal</kwd><kwd>Decentralized treatment</kwd><kwd>Regenerative life support systems</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Urine contributes about 80% of the nitrogen in domestic wastewater, but only to around 14% of the organics expressed as chemical oxygen demand (COD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Larsen and Gujer, 1996</xref>). The total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN = NH<sub>3</sub>-N + NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N) concentration in stored urine, i.e. after urea hydrolysis, can be as high as 8 g-N L<sup>-1</sup>, typically at a COD/N ratio of around 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Udert et al., 2006</xref>). However, due to mixing with some flushing water, the TAN concentration of source-separated urine is typically between 2 and 4 g-N L<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Fumasoli, 2016</xref>). Decentralized nitrogen treatment of source-separated urine is potentially cheaper and less energy-intensive than for wastewater, where the nitrogen is already highly diluted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Maurer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wilsenach and Loosdrecht, 2006</xref>). If about 60-75% of the urine is treated on-site, the nitrogen treatment step in wastewater treatment plants would no longer be necessary, as all the remaining nitrogen would be used for assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Wilsenach and van Loosdrecht, 2003</xref>), which could also yield a lower greenhouse gas emission footprint. Typically, urine treatment is associated with fertiliser production by recovering the nitrogen as, for example, struvite or ammonium nitrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Larsen et al., 2021</xref>). However, nitrogen removal as nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>) rather than recovery may be more economically and energetically attractive due to the well-established fertiliser production pathway via the Haber-Bosch process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Spiller et al., 2022</xref>). In the special case of space missions, converting nitrogen to N<sub>2</sub> could be used to counteract gas losses and provide atmospheric pressure in regenerative biological life support systems, or provide a nitrogen source for food production based on biological nitrogen fixation, uncoupled from potentially undesired residuals in the urine matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Timmer et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The conventional process for biological nitrogen removal from wastewater combines autotrophic nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification, consuming at least around 4 g-COD per g-N removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Tchobanoglous et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, without dosing additional organics (COD), traditional nitrification/denitrification is not feasible with urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Schielke-Jenni et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, nitrogen removal via partial nitritation and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), abbreviated as PN/A, is fully autotrophic and does not require any biodegradable organic substrate, although some contribution of heterotrophic denitrification cannot be ruled out in real systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Schielke-Jenni et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, PN/A is economically advantageous as it reduces the oxygen requirement by up to 60% compared to conventional nitrification/denitrification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Siegrist et al., 2008</xref>). PN/A can either be operated in one-stage or two-stage configurations. One-stage reactors are more common, partly because of their smaller footprint and lower capital investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lackner et al., 2014</xref>). Systems are operated either with floccular sludge, with biofilm, growing on carrier material, or as a hybrid system. Hybrid systems, e.g. integrated fixed-film activated sludge systems, have the potential to offer better performance than pure biofilm-based systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). However, the addition of biofilm carriers will increase the costs and may increase the energy required for aeration and mixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Nelson et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The PN/A application on sewage sludge reject water, termed sidestream nitrogen removal, is a mature technology with over 100 full-scale installations worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lackner et al., 2014</xref>). However, the composition of urine is very different from the usual influent of high-strength nitrogen PN/A processes, i.e., digester supernatant, due to the high concentration of organics and the high salinity. Stored urine has a COD to nitrogen ratio of about 1 g-COD g-N<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Faust et al., 2023b</xref>), which is higher than for digester supernatant, at about 0.4 g-COD g-N<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Udert et al., 2008</xref>). Organic substances can potentially be directly toxic to the bacteria involved in the PN/A process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gomez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, two-thirds of pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics are excreted in the urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lienert et al., 2007</xref>), where they are present in higher concentrations than in diluted sewage. These pharmaceuticals can be toxic to bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fernández et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, organic substances promote the growth of heterotrophic bacteria, which compete with aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AerAOB) for oxygen and with anammox bacteria (AnAOB) for nitrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chamchoi et al., 2008</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jenni et al. (2014)</xref> showed that AnAOB can coexist with HET at least up to influent COD to N ratios of 1.4 g-COD g-N<sup>-1</sup> provided a high sludge retention time (SRT) is maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jenni et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Stored source-separated urine has high salinities of 10 to 30 mS cm<sup>-1</sup>, which can directly inhibit bacteria. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Moussa et al., 2006</xref>). AnAOB have been shown to be sensitive to salinity, but can also adapt to high salt concentrations if the salinity is gradually increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kartal et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Faust et al. (2023b)</xref> showed that an increase in salinity during urine nitrification strongly reduces the activity of AerAOB and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). As the decrease in activity was greater for AerAOB than for NOB, the increase in salinity may be problematic for partial nitritation. In addition to the high salinity, urine has a high ratio of monovalent to divalent cations, due to high concentrations of sodium, ammonium and potassium compared to magnesium and calcium, resulting in a ratio of 400 mol mol<sup>-1</sup> compared to 20 mol mol<sup>-1</sup> in the digester supernatant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Jenni, 2015</xref>). The high ratio of monovalent to divalent cations, can affect floc formation and lead to destabilization of flocs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dapena-Mora et al., 2010</xref>), posing a challenge to sludge retention. The divalent cation bridging theory states that divalent cations can bridge negatively charged functional groups of extracellular polymeric substances. This bridging helps aggregate and stabilise the biopolymer and bacterial matrix, promoting bioflocculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Higgins et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Sobeck and Higgins (2002)</xref> showed that the addition of sodium resulted in a deterioration of floc properties (sludge volume index, floc strength, capillary suction time), whereas the addition of either calcium or magnesium resulted in an improvement of floc properties.</p><p id="P7">The operation of a one-stage PN/A process with highly diluted urine (TAN ≈ 0.6 g-N L<sup>-1</sup>) in a floccular sludge system was successfully tested in two previous studies but was prone to process failures due to a loss of AnAOB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bürgmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Udert et al., 2008</xref>). Only with a biofilm system, i.e., a membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR), were <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Timmer et al.

In addition, the MABR was successfully tested for a short period of 50 days on source-separated urine with nitrogen concentrations of 2 to 5.5 g-N L<sup>-1</sup>. Instead of hydrolyzed urine (pH ≈ 9), stabilized urine (pH ≈ 11) was fed to the reactor, i.e. base was added to the fresh urine to prevent urea hydrolysis during storage, which also adds alkalinity to the urine. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Pourbavarsad et al.

Partial nitritation of urine has been successfully achieved at various pH values ranging from 4.5 to 8.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Faust et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Faust et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Pourbavarsad et al., 2022</xref>), but the combination with anammox in a two-step configuration has yet to be tested.</p><p id="P8">Until now, PN/A with source-separated urine could only be achieved in a floccular sludge system with highly diluted urine or in an MABR using undiluted pre-alkalinized urine. So far, the systems with floccular sludge systems were prone to failure. A robust, simple, and inexpensive process is essential for decentralised treatment. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of PN/A for source-separated urine (TAN ≈ 2 to 3 g-N L<sup>-1</sup>) using a floccular system. The main focus was on one-stage PN/A configurations. However, for the first time, a two-stage system was also investigated with urine, as this allowed the nitritation and anammox processes to be studied separately. Additional attention was given to the effects of potentially toxic compounds, e.g. pharmaceuticals, and the ratio of monovalent to divalent cations. Finally, biofilm carriers were added to the floccular sludge system to see if a hybrid system would improve PN/A treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Reactor operation and influent composition</title><p id="P9">Five experiments were carried out with different reactor configurations and influent compositions (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><sec id="S4"><label>2.1.1</label><title>Two-stage partial nitritation/anammox with floccular sludge</title><p id="P10">A two-stage PN/A configuration using floccular sludge was investigated to assess the effects on nitritation and nitrogen removal with anammox separately (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The partial nitritation reactor consisted of an aerated 7-L continuous-flow stirred reactor (CSTR) without additional sludge retention, i.e. the SRT was equal to the hydraulic retention time (HRT). The partial nitritation reactor was inoculated with suspended sludge from the nitrification stage of the wastewater treatment plant at Eawag (Dübendorf, Switzerland). Stored source-separated urine, from waterless urinals and source-separating toilets was used as influent (experiment Nr. 1 in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

The anoxic reactor consisted of a 7-L sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The SBR consisted of a stirred, anoxic phase, a settling phase of 10 min and a short withdrawal phase. Initially, the length of the anoxic phase was time-controlled, i.e. 12 h, and the exchange volume per cycle was 0.75 L per cycle. From day 10 onwards, the length of the anoxic phase was extended due to the slow AnAOB activity. To avoid ammonia toxicity and ensure high NRE, the ammonium concentration at the end of each cycle was kept below 50 mg-N L<sup>-1</sup> by adding additional nitrite. The pH was controlled at 7.6 to 7.8 by adding hydrochloric acid, and the temperature was maintained at 30°C.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.1.2</label><title>One-stage partial nitritation/anammox with floccular sludge</title><p id="P12">One-stage PN/A configurations were tested using floccular sludge. To investigate the effect of bulk organics, pharmaceuticals, salt concentrations, and the type of cations, three experiments were conducted with different influent compositions (experiment Nr. 2, 3 and 4 in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The three 13-L reactors were operated in fed-batch mode. Fed-batch mode was chosen over a sequential batch reactor (SBR) to avoid large pH fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Faust et al., 2023a</xref>). A cycle always consisted of four different steps: (i) feeding phase, (ii) stirring phase, (iii) settling phase, and (iv) decanting phase (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). (i) The first step consisted of a pH-dependent feeding with alternating aerated and anoxic phases until the maximum fill level of 13 L was reached. Due to the proton released during ammonia oxidation, the pH decreased. When the lower pH setpoint was reached, the influent was switched on, which increased the pH due to the higher pH and alkalinity in the influent (stored urine pH ≈ 9). In experiment Nr. 2 and 3, the pH was kept constant between 7.25 and 7.30, and in experiment Nr. 4 the pH was adjusted to optimize the process (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In principle, lower pH set-points were tested to reduce the inhibition of AnAOB by free ammonia, while providing sufficient substrate for AerAOB. The aeration intensity in all reactors was manually adjusted as a function of the DO in the reactor to ensure values around 0.1-0.2 mg-O<sub>2</sub> L<sup>-1</sup> during the aerobic phase. The duration of the aerated phase was manually adjusted according to the nitrite production by AerAOB. The anoxic phase was manually adjusted as a function of the nitrite degradation until no nitrite was present in the reactor, i.e. if nitrite was still present, the proportion of the feeding phase without aeration was increased. Adjustments were made at least once a week, except during holidays. (ii) Additional anoxic stirring was included prior to sedimentation to remove any remaining nitrite. (iii) Stirring was then stopped to allow the sludge to settle, and finally (iv) 1 L was withdrawn from the reactor. The temperature in the reactors was controlled at 30°C.

According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Faust et al.

Without the addition of base, the ratio of nitrite to ammonia was 0.9 g-N g-N<sup>-1</sup>, which was below the targeted value of 1.15 to 1.32 g-N g-N<sup>-1</sup> for anammox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lotti et al., 2014</xref>). Even if NOB were completely inhibited and no nitrite was further oxidized to nitrate, the ratio would only increase to 0.95 mg-N mg-N<sup>-1</sup>. Assuming a theoretical nitrite requirement of 1.32 mole per mole ammonia a maximum of 88% nitrogen could be removed due to the limited alkalinity in urine. The addition of alkalinity allowed more of the ammonia to be converted to nitrate but requires the dosing of a base, i.e., NaOH. Alternatively, an electrochemical unit could be used to produce hydroxide ions on-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">De Paepe et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P26">In the anoxic reactor of the two-stage configuration, the nitrate concentration further increased. NOB activity in the anoxic can be excluded due to the anoxic conditions.

Notably, the nitrate increase accounted for only about 5% compared to the converted ammonium and nitrite, meaning that possibly some nitrate was even removed through denitrification. Even though, the organics are mainly degraded in the partial nitritation reactor, some organics could originate from cell debris. Due to the uncertainty of available kinetic data and of the measurements, it is usually not possible to quantify the relative contribution of heterotrophic denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Schielke-Jenni et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P27">In the one-stage reactor fed with source-separated urine, the nitrate in the effluent accounted for less than 11% of the converted nitrogen on average, indicating no or low NOB activity.

To counteract the decline in AnAOB activity while maintaining high nitrogen removal efficiencies, the anoxic phase was extended, but this did not restore the AnAOB activity. The following section discusses potential factors that may explain the decrease in anammox activity. As AnAOB activity was only lost after the influent switch, the focus of the following discuss will be on the differences between digester supernatant and urine.</p><sec id="S19"><title>Toxic organics compounds or pharmaceuticals</title><p id="P29">Urine contains high concentrations of unidentified organic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bouatra et al., 2013</xref>) and pharmaceuticals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lienert et al., 2007</xref>).

A strong decrease in AnAOB activity was also observed when the reactor was fed with the synthetic urine containing only readily biodegradable organic substrate and no pharmaceuticals.

Therefore, the high COD/N ratio can be excluded as the main cause for the failure of AnAOB. However, even if the high COD/N ratio in the urine is not the main cause of failure in the floccular sludge systems, an increase in COD concentration can still have a negative effect on PN/A (see <xref rid="S32" ref-type="sec">section 4.3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Monovalent to divalent cation ratio</title><p id="P31">The monovalent to divalent cations ratio in urine is with about 350 mol mol<sup>-1</sup> much higher than in the digester supernatant.

A favourable affect of salinity on granulation in PN/A systems has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Li et al., 2018</xref>). This can be explained with the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, which states that an increasing salinity reduces electrostatic repulsion by compressing the double layer and therefore improves flocculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Derjaguin and Landau, 1993</xref>). However, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Zita and Hermansson (1994)</xref> this is only true for ionic strengths below 0.1 mol L<sup>-1</sup>.

The oxygen gradient in the biofilm ensured that AnAOB were not inhibited by oxygen, allowing them to be active even during the aerated feeding phase. An increase in the air flow rate resulted in an increase in the nitrogen removal rate, indicating that nitritation was most likely the rate-limiting step in this configuration. The brief increase in free ammonia up to 40 mg-N L<sup>-1</sup> on day 18 did not cause any lasting damage to the NRR, even though the concentration is close to the IC<sub>50</sub> of 38 mg-N L<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fernández et al., 2012</xref>). This again suggests that the AnAOB may be additionally protected by the biofilm. Finally, an increase in the COD to N ratio in the influent, and therefore the COD load, is likely to have caused a decrease in NRR during the last 15 days. Increased COD is likely to result in the growth of more heterotrophic bacteria competing with AnAOB for space and nitrite, which could lead to a decrease in AnAOB activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S33" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><list list-type="bullet" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P47">Long-term anammox activity could not be established for source-separated urine in either one-stage or two-stage configurations using floccular sludge.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P48">Inhibition of AnAOB by toxic organic compounds, whether natural metabolites or pharmaceuticals, has not been confirmed.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P49">The high salt content, and not the high ratio of monovalent to divalent cations, is probably the main reason for the failure of floccular PN/A with urine.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P50">It is likely that the high salinity causes large flocs to disintegrate and the AnAOB bacteria to be washed out.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P51">The use of biofilm carriers (hybrid system) resulted in successful PN/A at high rates and high removal efficiencies.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supporting Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS193118-supplement-Supporting_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d150aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S34"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Philipp Markus, Marijn J.
