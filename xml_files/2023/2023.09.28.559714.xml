An overlooked characteristic of gel-encapsulated cultures is the emergence of cell aggregates, which are the result of the mechanical confinement of the cells. Such aggregates have a dramatic effect on the light management of gel-encapsulated photobioreactors and hence strongly affect the photosynthetic outcome. In order to evaluate such an effect, we experimentally studied the optical response of hydrogels containing algal aggregates and developed optical simulations to study the resultant light intensity profiles. The simulations are validated experimentally via transmittance measurements using an integrating sphere and aggregate volume analysis with confocal microscopy. Specifically, the heterogeneous distribution of cell aggregates in a gel matrix can increase light penetration while alleviating photoinhibition compared to a flat biofilm. Finally, we demonstrate that light harvesting efficiency can be further enhanced with the introduction of scattering particles within the hydrogel matrix, leading to a four-fold increase in biomass growth. Our study, therefore, highlights a new strategy for the design of spatially efficient photosynthetic living materials that have important implications for the engineering of future algal cultivation systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Classification</title><kwd>Biological Sciences: Plant Biology</kwd><kwd>Physical Sciences: Physics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><kwd>hydrogels</kwd><kwd>living materials</kwd><kwd>photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>optical modelling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The escalating demand for novel materials with biomimetic functionalities has stimulated the development of so-called biohybrid systems, which are typically comprised of a soft hydrogel matrix hosting living cells that can perform various functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Biohybrids incorporating photosynthetic organisms such as photosynthetic bacteria or microalgae have been proposed for diverse applications, ranging from chemical sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), bioremediation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), biotransformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), cell regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), bioelectronics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), hydrogen generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), and energy production by artificial leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Algal-based biohybrid systems offer a highly effective platform for algal cultivation, mitigating several fundamental challenges associated with traditional photobioreactors where the algae are planktonic i.e. free in liquid suspension cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). From notable improvements in space and water requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), to protection against contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) and environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), studies have reported that biohybrids for algal cultivation show enhancement in photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) and growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), as well as increased production of secondary metabolites such as pigments and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), compared to traditional methods. In addition, gel-encapsulated cultures provide distinct advantages for specific applications such as carbon capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), water treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), and non-invasive metabolite harvesting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), while preventing contamination of surrounding natural water systems and potential threats to native species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In order for photosynthetic systems to function efficiently, it is crucial to achieve a homogeneous distribution of light throughout the entire material, while minimising both overexposure and self-shading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Nonetheless, there is a lack of studies investigating light delivery in such hybrid living systems, or the underlying reasons for the observed improvements in performance. Most studies on light management in algae cultures have focused on liquid suspension cultures, where algal cells are homogeneously dispersed either freely in an aqueous phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) or within a gel matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), rather than growing naturally into aggregates, which is instead what occurs when algae are encapsulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Thus, how aggregate formation impacts light propagation and photosynthetic efficiency in gel-immobilised algal cultures and photobioreactors remains a compelling and intriguing question that requires thorough investigation through optical modelling and experimental analysis.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we performed optical characterisation of the microalgal biomass confined within a gel matrix and studied how cell aggregation affects light management. More specifically, we measured the transmittance of light through agarose gel pads embedded with algal aggregates and compared the experimental values with predictions from Monte Carlo-based modelling of radiative transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). The simulated local scalar irradiance was coupled into a net photosynthetic rate (<bold><italic>P<sub>net</sub></italic></bold>) model based on the Harrison model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), providing insight into the expected <bold><italic>P<sub>net</sub></italic></bold> in homogeneous algal biofilms and encapsulated algal aggregates in photobioreactor systems. We explored different incident irradiance levels and variable areal biomass densities, considering the impact of aggregate growth within the hydrogel. We also varied the cell seeding density and the scattering matrix on optical propagation efficiency, both computationally and experimentally. The results highlighted a fundamental difference in terms of light distribution between a biofilm and a gel-embedded distribution of algal aggregates, while also demonstrating a potential for further light-harvesting enhancement via modulating the scattering properties of the hosting matrix. Our findings have significant implications for the optimisation of light transport within immobilised algal cultures and the design of novel photobioreactors for microalgae cultivation and harvesting, which are now becoming increasingly important due to the growing commercial demand for sustainable food sources and additives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Optical characterisation of immobilised biomass</title><p id="P6">The encapsulation of microalgae within a gel matrix inevitably leads to the formation of dense aggregates, primarily caused by cell division and the inability of the daughter cells to disperse within the physical confinement imposed by the encapsulating matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). This phenomenon is general, as the algae are physically constrained and it can be observed in a wide variety of biohybrids composed of different types of algae and hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In this study, to evaluate the capability of light management within such biohybrids, we considered model systems composed of microalgae <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> encapsulated in agarose gel. However, many of the considerations we presented can be extended to other types of biohybrids. The first step for modelling realistic experimental conditions was to evaluate the precise shape of the aggregates and their scattering capability. To achieve this, we exploited both confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques, revealing that the aggregates developed a lenticular, almost spherical shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, 1E, and 1F</xref>). To conduct optical simulations, we used a simplified model where the gel-encapsulated culture was represented as a random arrangement of spherical algal aggregates embedded within the gel matrix. This approximation was made based on the observation that the oblateness of the aggregates had minimal effects on the optical attenuation results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To evaluate the scattering parameters, we performed OCT with 930 nm light on isolated microalgal aggregates to estimate the scattering coefficient <italic>μ<sub>s</sub></italic> and anisotropy factor <italic>g</italic> within the confined biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 2</xref>). The empirical fitting of the backscattered intensity suggested that the values of <italic>μ<sub>s</sub></italic> and <italic>g</italic> for 930 nm within individual algal aggregates were 1000 ± 100 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 0.99, respectively. More details on how these values were extrapolated from the raw data is reported in the SI.</p><p id="P9">To assess the extent of light attenuation, the variation of spectral scalar irradiance was measured within individual aggregates, as a function of depth beneath the algae-gel interface. Considering the integrated spectral range from 400 to 700nm, which corresponds to the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), the value of the scalar extinction coefficient <italic>μ<sub>ext,PAR</sub></italic> was calculated from the slope of light attenuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>) and found to be 180 ± 20 cm<sup>-1</sup> based on the following equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). <disp-formula id="FD1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="M1"><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P10">It is known that the scalar irradiance attenuation is equal to the absorption coefficient divided by average cosine of all the incident photons at medium interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Considering that the algal biomass was highly forward scattering, assuming minimal wavelength dispersion of scattering anisotropy, the attenuation coefficient measured from scalar irradiance was close to the absorption coefficient, within the percentage uncertainty of measurement. Hence, we determined the absorption coefficient <italic>μ<sub>a</sub></italic> to be 180 ± 20 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Notably, this estimation aligns closely with the reported values from microalgal biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), suggesting that the extent of optical attenuation within isolated individual aggregates is comparable to that observed in dense biofilms.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Simulation of light propagation through gel-immobilised aggregates</title><p id="P11">In order to simulate the effect of light propagation through gel-immobilised aggregates, it is important to consider that the system was not static, but was evolving continuously, with gel-encapsulated colonies developing into aggregates from individual algal cells that underwent cell growth and division. Therefore, different growth stages were simulated with different aggregate sizes under constant aggregate positions and numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>). As expected, we observed a reduction in normalised scalar irradiance with the simulation depth, indicating greater light attenuation through absorption and scattering. The growth of the aggregate gave rise to greater attenuation of light with depth, due to the increased number of algae absorbing light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). It is also important to notice that the intensity plateaued on a non-zero value, indicating that light was also scattered more efficiently and not fully absorbed.</p><p id="P12">To validate the simulation results of light transmission experimentally, we studied the effect of aggregate size and density of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> using integrating sphere measurement and quantitative analysis of aggregates through confocal imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). To prepare samples with algal aggregates of varying size and density distribution, we inoculated the culture with varying cell densities. Specifically, we observed that a lower inoculum density led to the formation of sparser but larger algal aggregates, while a larger inoculum density led to smaller aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C and 2D</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> also shows that independently from the inoculation density, the size of the aggregates increased from day 4 to day 8, indicating that the cells were growing and dividing actively during the culture period.</p><p id="P13">Transmittance spectra of gel-encapsulated cultures for all the different inoculation conditions were measured after 4 and 8 days of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Here we observed that light attenuation was more pronounced when aggregates were smaller and denser, while larger but more aggregates gave a lower light attenuation. To evaluate the effective light absorbance for these different conditions, we performed Monte Carlo simulations. To develop the simulation model, we considered numerous algal aggregates encapsulated within gel culture, according to the spatial distribution and size variance of the algal aggregates obtained with confocal microscopy. As a result, we observed that the formation of sparser but larger algal aggregates contributes to higher optical transmittance, as supported by the numerical simulation and Mie theory prediction. The numerical simulation and experimental results deviated slightly from the theoretical prediction, which computed the effective attenuation coefficient using Mie’s theory and calculated the overall light transmission with Beer-Lambert’s law, as the assumption of homogeneous media implied in Beer-Lambert’s law did not hold and could not account for localised shading of light within individual aggregates. It provided less effective light absorbance per unit biomass volume, as expressed in our simulations by the lower percentage of the incident photon energy deposited per unit voxel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Comparison of light transmission and utilisation within the algal biofilm and gel-immobilised algae</title><p id="P14">In contrast to planktonic cultures, the biofilm and gel-immobilised cultures share similarities in terms of higher biomass production and harvesting simplicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). We, therefore, compared the capacity of the total areal biomass production per volume in these two configurations.</p><p id="P15">We modelled the gel-immobilised cultures and biofilm with an equal areal biomass density so that the total amount of algae and surface area of illumination were kept constant in all scenarios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The simulation model considered lateral light loss with photons escaping in all directions, i.e., top, bottom, and four sides of the simulation volume. The lateral dimension was chosen to be at least twice that of the simulation depth, to minimise simulation artifacts in the form of edge effects. For a better comparison across varied areal biomass densities, the illuminated area of the simulation volume was kept constant at z = 1 mm and x = y = 2 mm.</p><p id="P16">However, different biofilm thicknesses were also explored from z = 0.5 mm to 5 mm, keeping the constant area of illumination (x = y = 2 mm) and same areal density of algal biomass in gels compared to biofilms. A higher areal biomass density corresponded to a thicker biofilm and a denser aggregate distribution in gel immobilisation, and <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p><p id="P17">Owing to the dense distribution of absorbers (algae) in a biofilm, the normalised scalar irradiance approached zero at a depth of 200 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), consistent with previous reports, where biofilm growth was typically limited to a thickness of 200 μm to 300 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). In contrast, the gel-encapsulated system exhibited much less light attenuation, resulting in similar transmittance output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Given high enough areal biomass density, the gel-immobilised algal aggregates eventually exhibited light attenuation similar to that in biofilm with self-shading among aggregates. At very high biomass densities, the aggregates tended to overlap and coalesce, forming a network of interconnected biomass, that could be observed both in simulations and practical experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The understanding of light propagation and absorbance alone was, however, insufficient to characterise biomass production as the photosynthetic rate is not linear with the amount of light absorbed. To correlate the effective scalar irradiance to microalgae photosynthetic activity across the simulation volume depth, we coupled the optical simulation outcome to an experimentally determined light response curve fitted to an empirical model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 4</xref>), taking the effect of photoinhibition into account.

The biofilm generated higher <bold><italic>P<sub>net</sub></italic></bold> compared to the gel-immobilised system up to the thickness threshold where the light was attenuated completely in the biofilm. Beyond this threshold, around 35 mm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> in areal biomass density, the gel-immobilised configuration exhibited slightly higher <bold><italic>P<sub>net</sub></italic></bold>, as the bottom of the biofilm was heavily shaded, while the gel-immobilised system still had some light reaching the aggregates at the bottom, allowing for moderate photosynthetic activity.</p><p id="P21">Under high incident irradiance (1000 μmol photon m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), photoinhibition became significant, as predicted by the Harrison model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 6</xref>). Given high absorbance efficiency and less shielding effect at low areal biomass density, more cells were photo-inhibited, giving rise to lower <bold><italic>P<sub>net</sub></italic></bold>. On the other hand, with the increase of areal biomass density, the extent of self-shading increased, lowering the degree of photoinhibition, until the point of light saturation for maximal photosynthetic capacity. With further self-shading, part of the shielded culture became light-limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). While the top layer of the biomass may be photo-inhibited, the shaded biomass would be exposed to the optimal light level. Overall, the gel-immobilised system exhibited higher <bold><italic>P<sub>net</sub></italic></bold>, indicating a lower degree of photoinhibition, as compared to the biofilm system.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Performance optimisation with scattering matrix</title><p id="P22">To increase the absorbance efficiency, and therefore increase the probability of interaction between photons and algal aggregates, we explored the effect of incorporating scattering elements within the matrix. While a heterogeneous biomass distribution would enable the transmission of some photons among cell aggregates without interaction with the biomass, a scattering matrix with a wide angular range of scattering directions could redirect these unabsorbed photons to interact with the algal aggregates, effectively improving the probability of light absorbance. Experimentally, such enhancement of scattering efficiency of a matrix can be achieved by incorporating scattering particles into the gel matrix. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> shows that increasing the scattering efficiency in the surrounding matrix increased the effective absorbance per aggregate beyond that of the biofilm at high areal biomass density. A key parameter to consider when adding scattering element in the matrix is their filling fraction and distribution. The simplest approach is to use a uniform dispersion of scatterers throughout the gel matrix, with overall concentration per unit volume of scatterers, which scaled with the scattering coefficient in the unit of reciprocal length. Alternatively, further optimisation could be achieved by concentrating scatterers at different depths of the gel matrix, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>.</p><p id="P23">Our simulations showed how adding scattering particles to the gel matrix with different anisotropy factors and the percentage of coverage affected the light distribution within the matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast to a smooth exponential decay of normalised scalar irradiance in a material without a scattering matrix (represented by the black line), the interface between a normal gel matrix and a scattering matrix created a ripple of intensity profile, as a result of enhanced backscattering. The degree of this enhancement was influenced by the anisotropy factor of the scattering particles, with a lower anisotropy factor resulting in more pronounced backscattering effects. We note that following the peak of enhanced scalar irradiance at the medium-gel interface, light availability in deeper parts of the gel was diminished, as the scattered photons were either absorbed by the algae or escaped from the upper interface. The associated shifts in the profile of normalised scalar irradiance affected the overall absorbance efficiency and hence the integrated <bold><italic>P<sub>net</sub></italic></bold> of the entire biomass volume, depending on the incident irradiance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 7</xref>).</p><p id="P24">In the gel-immobilised system, mutual shading among the cells in the aggregates resulted in the concentration of photons in the upper region, as light is attenuated with depth. Hence, under low incidence irradiance, increasing the availability and absorbance of photons in the upper region significantly enhanced the overall photosynthetic efficiency, particularly with a higher percentage of scatterer coverage and lower anisotropy factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P25">In addition, the distribution of the scatterers is important. Excessive backscattering especially in the upper region of the gel caused photoinhibition and reduced photon transfer to the lower regions when the scatterer coverage exceeded 70%. This was demonstrated in the case of 90% scatterer coverage, where the maximum scalar irradiance reached up to twice the incident irradiance. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, since under high incident irradiance, the algae in the upper region of the gel were subjected to photoinhibition without any scattering presence, scattering enhancement in the upper area of the gel would lower the overall net photosynthetic efficiency. In contrast, the scattering enhancement was optimal in the light-limiting regime, namely the middle zone (40% to 50% in depth) after some degree of light attenuation from mutual shading (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 7a</xref>). With an even higher irradiance (1000 μmol photon m-2 s<sup>-1</sup>), the optimal zone for scattering matrix coverage reduced to the lower region of 20% to 40% in depth, as the light-limiting regime was shifted further downwards (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 7b</xref>). Under high irradiance, if the scattering interface was in the upper region with 80% coverage in depth, the <bold><italic>P<sub>net</sub></italic></bold> decreased with a lower anisotropy factor as photoinhibition was aggravated with higher photon interaction in the light-saturated region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 7c and 7d</xref>).</p><p id="P26">As a proof-of-concept experiment, agarose hydrogels were embedded uniformly with cellulose microparticles (CMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>) to increase light scattering within the matrix. CMPs were chosen as scattering particles for their optimized scattering abilities and their biocompatible characteristic. As evident in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 8</xref> the addition of CMP resulted in increased opacity of the hydrogel, owing to higher haze ratio of the haze transmittance to the total transmittance with higher proportions of CMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 9</xref>). CMP doping introduced significant light scattering within the hydrogel matrix. Within the 1 mm-thick hydrogels, 0.7%w/v CMP doping caused 75%-85% of the transmitted light to be scattered, compared to approximately 15% in standard hydrogels without CMP (0%w/v). When comparing the spectra of the 2 mm hydrogels, 0.7%w/v CMP doping scattered approximately 90% of the transmitted light. This demonstrates that the addition of CMP altered the light profile throughout the hydrogels, thereby influencing the growth of immobilised microalgae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Within the 1 mm-thick agarose pad, in comparison to those without CMP, those containing 0.7%w/v CMP showed a higher biomass throughout the entire growth curve, showing an approximate 50% increase in cell numbers after 10 days. Additionally, there was cumulatively improved growth in the agarose with 0.7%w/v CMP, rather than an initial increase, which was then maintained. In 2 mm-thick agarose pads, both 0.5%w/v and 0.7%w/v CMP doping resulted in a higher degree of growth enhancement, with approximately 100% increase in cell numbers after 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Comparing the cell density alone, the 1 mm-thick hydrogels were much more productive than the 2 mm-thick hydrogels, with or without scattering, as a result of limited gaseous and mass exchange with increasing hydrogel thickness.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">By comparing the light management capabilities of biofilms and gel-immobilised cultures, we have been able to conclude that gel-immobilised algal cultures have the potential to reach a higher areal biomass density compared to flat, homogeneous algal biofilms. Our results suggest that the formation of cell aggregates upon gel immobilisation is crucial as it reduces the probability of photon-cell interaction, effectively lowering the scattering and absorbance coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). As a result, more photons were able to penetrate and reach greater depths in the gel-immobilised algal culture. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Such an increase in light penetration depth alleviated self-shading of the algal biomass that is inevitable in dense biofilms, whose thickness is limited to 300 um or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), corresponding to an areal biomass density of 30 mm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> approximately.</p><p id="P29">Additionally, gel-immobilised systems were able to achieve significantly higher <bold><italic>P<sub>net</sub></italic></bold> compared to biofilm at higher biomass densities, particularly when higher incident irradiance was required to counteract self-shading within the growing biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D and 3E</xref>). While photoinhibition could be minimised with a lower incident irradiance, the predominance of a light-limiting regime could lower the overall photosynthetic efficiency, especially in dense biomass with significant self-shading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Hence, as the biomass density increased, moderate to high levels of illumination could reach the shaded cells in the lower region of algal culture. This argument is supported by the decrease in overall <bold><italic>P<sub>net</sub></italic></bold> with biomass density and the enhancement of <bold><italic>P<sub>net</sub></italic></bold> with incident scalar irradiance beyond areal biomass density of 20 mm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). In comparison to a homogeneous biofilm, a gel-immobilised culture achieved higher <bold><italic>P<sub>net</sub></italic></bold>, with an areal biomass density exceeding 30 mm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. A heterogeneous biomass distribution from cell aggregation reduced the proportion of photo-inhibited cells among the top layers as not all cells located in the upper layers were exposed to the same intensity as incident illumination. Furthermore, self-shading within individual aggregates protected some of the cells against excessive irradiance. In contrast, the algal biomass in biofilms was uniformly exposed and hence equally photo-inhibited in the top layer. With further self-shading, part of the shielded culture became light-limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Meanwhile, the shaded biomass beneath the top layer received an optimal light level. In the case of gel-immobilisation, the percentage of photo-inhibited biomass was significantly lower compared to the biofilm, owing to its heterogeneous distribution of cells. Such optimisation required finding an optimal trade-off between alleviating the light shading in the lower region with intense illumination irradiance, while incurring a smaller degree of photoinhibition in the upper region of biomass.</p><p id="P30">Finally, a gel-immobilised system was able to deliver light more efficiently than a biofilm even when a low incident irradiance is desired, given an optimal scattering matrix. We found that modifying the scattering properties of the gel matrix could enhance the overall photosynthetic performance, both in simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) and experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). These hydrogels showed that algal growth was promoted through increasing the amount of light available to them for photosynthesis. This is especially prominent given the light level that these cultures were grown under was low (~40 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). If a higher light level had been used, light may not have been a limiting factor for growth, especially in a growth chamber with direct light falling on the samples. In industrial settings, direct and intense light sources cannot always be guaranteed, and factors like shading or variable sunlight can dilute the light reaching the samples. With the proof of concept shown here, it is now possible to develop a light-sensitive material with dynamic scattering properties upon light exposure of varying intensity, optimising the light distribution with a better trade-off between the proportion of photo-limited and photo-inhibited cells within the population.</p><p id="P31">However, it is important to take into account that light management is not the sole factor to consider in a photobioreactor. The availability of gases and nutrients in a hydrogel system depends on the diffusion of molecules within and between cell aggregates. Diffusion-limited growth became evident in the lower cell density within a thicker bulk hydrogel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Potential strategies have been studied to address diffusion limitation in hydrogels, such as 3D bioprinting to increase the surface area-to-volume ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>) or co-cultivation of algae with symbiotic bacteria to enhance gas and nutrient exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). It should also be noted that this study has assumed a simplified schematic to capture the main optical properties of a homogeneous biofilm. In reality, biofilms growing on a substrate can exhibit more complex morphology both in terms of uneven surface morphology and bulk porosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>).</p><p id="P32">In conclusion, our study demonstrates the advantages of cell aggregation in gel-encapsulated colonies of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> compared to biofilm growth. This aggregation led to improved light transmission and utilisation, particularly under optimal incident irradiance. As biomass density increased and self-shading became more prominent, the aggregated system achieved a better balance between photo-limited and photo-inhibited regimes when exposed to higher incident irradiance. Furthermore, the addition of scattering particles enhanced light harvesting efficiency, resulting in increased growth rates of <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> under low incident irradiance. By highlighting the collective improvement in light allocation throughout the gel culture, our findings offer new insights for optimising the design and light use efficiency of photobioreactors and microalgae-based photosynthetic living materials.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Cell culture of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic></title><p id="P33">The green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (wild type strain 137c) was grown mixotrophically in carbon-supplemented Tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>) (Tris base: 48.4 mg L<sup>-1</sup>; Beijernick salts (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl: 375 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, MgSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O: 100 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, and CaCl<sub>2</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O: 50 mg L<sup>-1</sup>); phosphate solution (K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>); Kropat’s trace elements; CoCl<sub>2</sub>: 1 mg L<sup>-1</sup>; glacial acetic acid: 0.1 <italic>vol</italic>%).

However, efficient growth of microalgae requires optimised light conditions, which are usually challenging to obtain using biofilm cultivations mode: as the outer layer of cells are necessarily more exposed to incoming light than the inner layer, posing the problem of photoinhibition on the outer cells receiving too much light, and shading the ones below. Here we study both experimentally and numerically, how microalgae aggregates growing in the confinement of a hydrogel can provide an improved light distribution and therefore biomass growth is maximised. This study proposes new strategies on how to engineer future photobioreactors.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Cell aggregation resulting from the gel-immobilised culture of microalgae:</title><p>(A) Isolated colonies of Platymonas sp. in silk-based hydrogel (scale bar = 10 μm) adapted with permission from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>) under Copyright 2023 American Chemical Society; (B) Aggregates of Marinichlorella kaistiae KAS603 in a 3D-printed bionic coral (scale bar = 100 μm) reprinted from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) under Creative Commons CC-BY; (C) Tight clusters of Chlorella vulgaris encapsulated within sodium alginate (reprinted from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) under Creative Commons CC-BY); (D) Confocal imaging (mean Z-stack projection) of chlorophyll autofluorescence emitted from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii aggregates after 7 days of growth within an agarose hydrogel (scale bar = 1 mm); (E) Close-up maximum intensity projection of Z-stack through a single aggregate (scale bar = 25 μm); (F) Cross-sectional view of an immobilised algal aggregate imaged with an optical coherence tomography system (scale bar = 500 μm); (G) Microsensor profile of photon scalar irradiance (400-700 nm) measured across individual algal aggregates, where the origin was set to be the upper interface between the aggregate and gel matrix.
