In the presence of membrane potential driving mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation, transient changes of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> in response to cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] variations are ensured by a molecular machinery for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and efflux embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). While it is well established that influx relies on the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU), efflux was expected to be molecularly diversified, given the occurrence of functionally different exchange pathways with either Na<sup>+</sup> or H<sup>+</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Accordingly, dedicated transporters ensure proper Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and tightly regulated mitochondrial bioenergetics, but the process is not yet fully elucidated. We here demonstrate that TMEM65, a protein with an unknown biological function, is a fundamental component of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux machinery of mitochondria. As the MCU, TMEM65 has a broad tissue expression and localizes to the IMM. Its overexpression dramatically enhances Na<sup>+</sup>- and Li<sup>+</sup>-dependent mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion, which is abrogated by the pharmacological inhibitor CGP-37157. Conversely, its downregulation chronically elevates resting mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and inhibits efficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux upon cellular activation, culminating in mitochondrial calcium overload and causing organelle dysfunction. Since TMEM65 has been associated with a severe human mitochondrial disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, we deleted the TMEM65 homologues in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<italic>CeTMEM65</italic>). While the two CeTMEM65 orthologs are dispensable for the survival at permissive growing conditions, their loss undermines embryonic developments when eggs are exposed to mild temperature-stress. In this regard, we find that <italic>CeTMEM65 (null)</italic> alleles cause necrotic lesions that are suppressed by inhibiting the mitochondrial calcium uniporter MCU-1. Overall, these results unambiguously assign a primary role in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis to the orphan protein TMEM65. More importantly, our findings describe a novel molecular component that may be relevant in pathological settings in which excessive mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation critically contribute to degenerative pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>TMEM65</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial calcium</kwd><kwd>ion transporters</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) acts as a universal and ubiquitous intracellular messenger, exerting control over every facet of cellular pathophysiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Such a remarkable versatility relies on the one hand on a large array of dedicated Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and/or transporting proteins, and on the other hand on the strictly controlled compartmentalization of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] changes. In such a sophisticated framework, mitochondria significantly shape intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathways. In healthy cells at rest, intramitochondrial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub>) matches cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) at approximately 100 nM. Upon cellular stimulation, mitochondria undergo a rapid transient rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> that largely exceed bulk [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>, up to 1 mM in a few cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. This marked accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is in part due to the highly negative organelle membrane potential (180 mV), but also to the strategic positioning of mitochondria near Ca<sup>2+</sup>-releasing channels of the endoplasmic reticulum or the plasma membrane, where local micro/nano-domains of high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] are generated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Inside mitochondria, Ca<sup>2+</sup> acts as a positive modulator of three dehydrogenases (PDH, IDH3 and OGDH), which stimulating oxidative metabolism and eventually ATP synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In pathological conditions, excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation within the organelle matrix (commonly referred to as Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload) can potentially trigger permeability transition, ultimately leading to membrane permeabilization that may promote the release of pro-death factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Functioning as auxiliary cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> reservoirs, mitochondria contribute to buffering intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients, thereby influencing the spatio-temporal patterns of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] oscillations, either within micro/nano-domains or on a bulk scale (e.g., throughout the entire cell)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Consequently, impairment of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases, ranging from neuromuscular diseases to brain injuries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">From a biophysical perspective, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> is dynamically determined by the rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx versus efflux across the IMM. Pioneering investigations conducted in the 1960s and 1970s elucidated the mechanisms underlying this regulation: Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into mitochondria is facilitated by an electrogenic uniporter, while Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion occurs through two distinct mechanisms - one dependent on sodium ions (i.e. mediated by a Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger) and the other Na<sup>+</sup>-independent (i.e. mediated by a H<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. At the molecular level, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is orchestrated by the MCU complex, whose precise composition varies across tissues and may encompass components such as MCU, MCUb, EMRE, MICU1, MICU2, and MICU3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. As to the efflux, the protein NCLX, encoded by the SLC8B1 gene, has been identified as the mediator of Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, whereas two distinct proteins, LETM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and TMBIM5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, have been proposed to function as mitochondrial H<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers. Given the breakthrough discoveries of the last decade, it is not possible to rule out that other molecular components may contribute to mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport. Here, we identify TMEM65 as a novel, unexpected, broadly conserved protein that enables Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux. Genetic manipulation of TMEM65 expression has yielded striking effects on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in cultured cells. Specifically, overexpression of TMEM65 virtually eliminates [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> transients, while its silencing prevents the decay of the organellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises, resulting in markedly elevated resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> levels. Further highlighting the prominent contribution of TMEM65 to organelle Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance, we show that genetic deletion of <italic>TMEM65</italic> homologues in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> causes an overt necrotic phenotype that could be prevented by inhibiting mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, thereby pointing out that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload is a crucial determinant of cell demise. Since a human subject harboring a homozygous <italic>TMEM65</italic> loss-of-function mutation exhibits a neuromuscular phenotype reminiscent of mitochondrial disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, it may be that MCU inhibition is a potential therapeutic strategy for conditions characterized by excessive mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation.</p><sec id="S1"><title>TMEM65 is a conserved protein of the IMM</title><p id="P4">We previously performed a bioinformatic analysis and identified candidate mitochondrial proteins of the inner membrane with a putative function in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Besides MCU, the list contains the recently described mitochondrial H<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger TMBIM5 (also known as GHITM/MICS1). Thus, we sought to further inspect the list of presumed Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporters using an evolutionary analysis to look for proteins with a conservation profile similar to MCU, and focused on a protein of unknown function named TMEM65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). Among these candidates, TMEM65 is a 25 kDa protein with 3 transmembrane domains and a glycine zipper motif that are well conserved in kinetoplastids, green algae (but not in other plants) and metazoan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig 1a-b</xref>). Mammalian TMEM65 also shows an apparent poly-acidic tail near the C terminus. Although two works proposed TMEM65 as a protein positioned to cardiac sarcolemma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, multiple lines of evidence indicate that TMEM65 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> mitochondrial protein. In this regard, i) TMEM65 expression is not limited to the heart but rather is ubiquitous (highest in the cerebellum, lowest in the liver, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig 1c</xref>), ii) sequence analysis of TMEM65 reveals a conserved, prototypical mitochondrial targeting signal at the N-terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>, predicted MPP-cleaved peptide indicated in cyan), and iii) TMEM65 is present in all high quality mitochondrial datasets based on robust proteomic evidence, including MitoCarta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, MitoCOP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and MitoPhos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. To confirm these predictions and assess TMEM65 localization, we cloned, tagged (3xFlag) and expressed human TMEM65 in HeLa cells. Immunoblot analyses show a major band running with high specificity at 20 kDa, in line with the predicted molecular weight of the mature protein after processing by the Mitochondrial Processing Peptidase (MPP). The unprocessed 25 kDa precursor is also detectable upon overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>). Immunofluorescence analyses confirm co-localization with the mitochondrial marker HSP60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref>). To test protein topology across the IMM, we performed Proteinase K (PK) protection assay in isolated mitoplasts. Digestion of intact (but not permeabilized) mitoplasts causes the loss of full-length TMEM65 and the appearance of a smaller fragment, indicating that a significant portion of TMEM65 resides within the matrix. Of note, the Flag peptide fused at the C-terminus of TMEM65 is lost after PK treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1e</xref>), thereby demonstrating that TMEM65 is inserted in the IMM as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>. This membrane orientation is also supported by other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, including an independent spatially-resolved proteomic screening that mapped Tyrosine 77 within the matrix (Y77, highlighted in grey in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>TMEM65 expression modulates mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis</title><p id="P5">We next tested the role of TMEM65 on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling by monitoring [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> in living intact HeLa cells using mitochondrial-targeted genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECI) based on the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive bioluminescent protein Aequorin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Control and TMEM65-overexpressing cells were continuously perfused with modified Krebs-Ringer buffer and challenged with 100 Î¼M histamine, an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-generating agonist that elicits Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a transient increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in both cytoplasm and mitochondria. Interestingly, TMEM65 overexpression robustly inhibits (approximately 80%) the peak of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> upon cellular stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>). Importantly, this effect on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling is specific, since no major changes were detected in terms of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig 2a-b</xref>) and mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig 2c</xref>), hence ruling out possible confounding factors. To further confirm the specificity of the effect and obtain additional insights into the structure-to-function relationship of TMEM65, we generated a set of mutants by introducing individual substitutions in the most conserved amino acids or by disrupting relevant motifs (i.e. glycine zipper and poly-acidic tail, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig 2d</xref>). All TMEM65 variants are expressed at a similar level, with the notable exception of the mutant lacking the transmembrane glycine zipper motif (GZ dead), that completely fail to express, probably due to an impairment in membrane packing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig 2e</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. We evaluated histamine-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> peaks in cells expressing wild-type (wt) or mutant TMEM65. Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig 2f-g</xref>) indicate that D132, D167, G170 and E178 are required for TMEM65 activity, while G140L and Q195E mutants are very similar to wt. The TMEM65 mutant lacking the poly-acidic tail still retain some effect, although to a lower extent when compared to wt. Surprisingly, the E144Q mutant shows even stronger effect than the wt. Overall, these data suggest a clear, specific involvement of TMEM65 in the regulation of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes.</p><p id="P6">We next evaluated the effect of TMEM65 downregulation on organelle Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics by testing different synthetic unmodified siRNAs. When agonist-induced peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> values were compared, we obtained inconsistent results among siRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 3a-b</xref>) despite comparable efficiency in reducing TMEM65 protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 3e</xref>), an outcome likely due to off-target effects. To minimize non-specificity, we used endoribonuclease- prepared siRNAs (esiRNA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. This approach reveals increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> peak upon specific downregulation of TMEM65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a-b</xref>). Most importantly, we also observed that, in addition to the effect on maximal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> values, TMEM65 silencing alters the kinetic profile of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> transients. In particular, a delayed Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance after the peak is noticeable, an indication of impaired mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion. To better appreciate this effect, we re-analyzed all Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces by normalizing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> on peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 3c</xref>). The slope of the resulting trace is thus proportional to mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 3d</xref>). This analysis clearly reveals that TMEM65 overexpression enhances mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion (notwithstanding lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> peak), while its silencing elicits the opposite effect. Remarkably, all tested siRNAs consistently decreases mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux, irrespective of their wavering effect on peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 3a-d</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest an involvement of TMEM65 in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux rather than in influx. To further substantiate our data, we evaluated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics using a GFP-based GECI, the mitoGCaMP6 probe, that also allows the more precise quantification of baseline [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> and extrusion kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Compared to controls, both overexpression and downregulation of TMEM65 alter mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, further supporting that TMEM65 is a key regulator of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux. Specifically, TMEM65 overexpression causes a negligible decrease of resting Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a histamine induced upstroke similar to control, at least in the initial phase, but most evidently, a steep return to baseline after the peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>). Conversely, TMEM65-silenced cells show chronically elevated resting matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, and histamine-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] elevations that last over several minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c-d</xref>). Altogether, our detailed analyses of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics uncover a prominent role of TMEM65 in controlling mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>TMEM65 mediates Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux</title><p id="P7">We next explore the mechanism underlying TMEM65 effect on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>. It is known that experiments carried out in intact cells have the benefit of examining mitochondria in their native environment. However, these experimental settings suffer of two main drawbacks. Firstly, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and efflux constantly coexist, thus preventing the genuine segregation of the two phenomena. Secondly, efflux relies on two concurrent but separate mechanisms, one Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent and the other Na<sup>+</sup>-independent. To overcome these limitations, we performed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> measurements in digitonin-permeabilized cells, where mitochondria can be exposed to buffers with defined ionic composition. In this experimental setup, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is initiated by perfusing mitochondria of plasma-membrane permeabilized cells with an intracellular-like buffer containing fixed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], until a plateau [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> is reached (i.e. when influx rate equals efflux rate). Then, Ruthenium Red (RuR), the best-known MCU inhibitor, is added to block the influx, thus causing a progressive decrease of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub>. The rate of this decrease represents a reliable measurement of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux. Perfusion with Na<sup>+</sup>-free buffer allows the evaluation of organelle Na<sup>+</sup>-independent efflux, while incorporation of 10 mM NaCl in the RuR-containing buffer enhances mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion, thereby enabling the quantification of Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent efflux. Li<sup>+</sup> can also be used as Na<sup>+</sup> surrogate, although less effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Using this approach, we found that both TMEM65 overexpression and downregulation show no effects on neither mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx nor Na<sup>+</sup>-independent efflux. Rather, TMEM65 overexpression greatly enhances Na<sup>+</sup>- and Li<sup>+</sup>-dependent mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux. Accordingly, its silencing blunts the Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent component of organellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig 4a-b</xref>). To further support this finding, we took advantage of the specific pharmacological inhibitor of mitochondria Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange, the benzothiazepine CGP-37157<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. This compound causes an increase in agonist-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> peaks in control cells due to the inhibition of organelle Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Strikingly, CGP-37157 is able to abrogate the effect elicited by TMEM65 overexpression, restoring normal mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3 e-g</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that i) mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux strongly counteracts both in resting conditions and in all phases of agonist-evoked responses the action of MCU and ii) TMEM65 is an essential component and/or the strongest contributor to the process of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>TMEM65 deficiency causes necrotic lesions <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p id="P8">To better understand the physiological relevance of TMEM65, we set out a series of experiments using the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as an <italic>in vivo</italic> model organism.

First, we tested the expression and functionality of CeTMEM65 in mammalian cells. Western blot shows that CeTMEM65-1 is efficiently expressed also in HeLa cells, while CeTMEM65-2 fails to be detected, probably due to instability of the protein at 37Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig 5d</xref>). In terms of activity, the effect of CeTMEM65-1 on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling is comparable to its human counterpart, indicating that their biochemical function is maintained through evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig 5e</xref>).

Both <italic>C03B8.3 (null)</italic> and <italic>tag-321 (null)</italic> single mutants had a median lifespan that was comparable to wt nematodes, whereas <italic>C03B8.3;tag-321</italic> double mutant nematodes lived slightly less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig 6e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). When we had a closer look at plates of animals grown at 25 Â°C, we noticed that most of the <italic>CeTMEM65 (null)</italic> eggs did not hatch and, more importantly, they displayed large vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref>), resembling necrotic structures, very similar to those necrotic lesions observed in neurons expressing degenerin channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. We sought to further substantiate our initial observation by quantifying the number of animals that could hatch from eggs laid by nematodes grown for a single generation at 25 Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4e</xref>). Intriguingly, we found that only a handful of <italic>C03B8.3;tag-321</italic> double mutants could properly develop and reach adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4f</xref>). Of note, <italic>C03B8.3 (null)</italic> mutants had a hatching rate similar to wt, whereas <italic>tag-321 (null)</italic> animals showed a modest, although significant increased number of larvae that could survive at 25 Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4f</xref>). Together, this severe degenerative phenotype is consistent with the proposed molecular function of TMEM65. Indeed, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion in <italic>CeTMEM65 (null)</italic> cells should be dramatically reduced, thereby leading to organellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload accompanied by extensive cell death. Because of that, we reasoned that inhibition of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (e.g. by deletion of nematode <italic>mcu-1</italic> gene) in <italic>CeTMEM65 (null)</italic> background should prevent mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and restore normal hatching at 25 Â°C. We first attempted to generate <italic>C03B8.3;mcu-1;tag-321</italic> triple mutants using the already existing alleles. However, since <italic>mcu-1</italic> and <italic>tag-321</italic> genes are both on chromosome IV at a very close distance (~2Mb), we could not introduce the <italic>mcu-1(ju1154)</italic> allele<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> into the existing <italic>C03B8.3(null);tag-321(null)</italic> mutants. To overcome this problem, we performed another gene editing in <italic>mcu-1(ju1154)</italic> animals and generated an equivalent lesion within <italic>tag-321</italic> gene. DNA sequencing of the obtained mutation confirmed that the new <italic>bon105</italic> allele disrupted the promoter and coding region of <italic>tag-321</italic> gene as the previous <italic>bon103</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig 6f</xref>). We backcrossed the new strain, generated <italic>C03B8.3(bon104);mcu-1(ju1154);tag-321(bon105)</italic> triple mutants and carried out another hatching assay. Remarkably, we found that <italic>mcu-1</italic> loss-of-function <italic>(lof)</italic> almost suppressed the degeneration of <italic>C03B8.3;tag-321</italic> double mutant eggs at 25 Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4g-h</xref>), indicating an epistatic relationship between MCU and TMEM65 and supporting the prominent role of TMEM65 as a key regulator of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux. Together, our <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental evidence demonstrates that TMEM65 deficiency may facilitate mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, when cells are exposed to environmental challenges (e.g., restrictive temperatures) that may deplete resources (e.g., lipids) and induce degenerative processes (necrosis).</p><p id="P9">In conclusion, we herein unveil the previously undescribed function of TMEM65, by demonstrating its involvement in controlling mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes. Our data suggest that TMEM65 is on the one hand sufficient to greatly enhance Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion, as demonstrated by overexpression experiments. On the other hand, TMEM65 is also necessary to prevent mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, as demonstrated by both <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with siRNAs and <italic>in vivo</italic> using <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Our results also shed light on the pathogenic mechanism of a case report showing that TMEM65 deficiency causes mitochondrial dysfunction and leads to a severe neuromuscular syndrome in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Based on our <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental paradigm, it seems that MCU inhibition may be a strategy to ameliorate pathogenic processes associated with TMEM65 deficiency. Considering that excessive mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been implicated in several diseases, the present work sets the stage for the development of therapeutic approaches that focus on correcting mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only" id="S5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S6"><title>Chemicals, cell culture and transfection</title><p id="P10">All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise specified.

Tryptic peptides were then cleaned, desalted on C18 stage tips and re-suspended in 20 Î¼l 1% FA for LC-MS analysis. MS runs were performed with at least 3 biological replicates.Tryptic peptides were analyzed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nanosystem coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 MS. Peptides were injected at starting conditions of 95% eluent A (0.1% FA in water) and 5% eluent B (0.1% FA in 80% ACN), with a flow rate of 300 nL/min. They were loaded onto a trap column cartridge (Acclaim PepMap C18, 100Ã…, 5 mm x 300 Î¼m i.d., #160454, Thermo Scientific) and separated by reversed-phase chromatography on an Acclaim PepMap C18, 100Ã…, 75 Î¼m X 25 cm (both columns from Thermo Scientific) using a 75 min linear increasing gradient from 5% to 31% of eluent B followed by a 20 min linear increase to 50% eluent B. The mass spectrometer was operated in data dependent and positive ion mode with MS1 spectra recorded at a resolution of 120K, mass scan range of 375â€”1550, automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 300% (3Ã—10<sup>6</sup>) ions, maxIT of 25 ms, charge state of 2-7, dynamic exclusion of 60 sec with exclusion after 1 time and a mass tolerance of 10 ppm. Precursor ions for MS/MS were selected using a top speed method with a cycle time of 2 sec. A decision tree was used to acquire MS2 spectra with a minimum precursor signal intensity threshold of 3Ã—10<sup>5</sup> for scan priority one and an intensity range of 1Ã—10<sup>4</sup> â€“3Ã—10<sup>5</sup> for scan priority two. Data dependent MS2 scan settings were as follows: isolation window of 2 m/z, normalized collision energy (NCE) of 30% (High-energy Collision Dissociation (HCD)), 7.5K and 15K resolution, AGC target value of 100% (1Ã—10<sup>5</sup>), maxIT set to 20 and 50 ms, for scan priority one and two, respectively. Full MS data were acquired in the profile mode with fragment spectra recorded in the centroid mode. Raw data files were processed with Proteome Discovererâ„¢ software (v2.5.0.400, Thermo Scientific) using SEQUESTÂ® HT search engine against the Swiss-ProtÂ® Caenorhabditis elegans database (v2022-06-14). Peptides were identified by specifying trypsin as the protease, with up to 2 missed cleavage sites allowed and restricting peptide length between 7 and 30 amino acids. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, and fragment mass tolerance to 0.02 Da MS2. Static modifications were set as carbamidomethylated cysteine, while dynamic modifications included methionine and N-terminal loss of methionine, for all searches. Peptide and protein FDR were set to 1% by the peptide and protein validator nodes in the Consensus workflow. Default settings of individual nodes were used if not otherwise specified. In the Spectrum Selector node, the Lowest Charge State = 2 and Highest Charge State = 6 were used. The INFERYS rescoring node was set to automatic mode and the resulting peptide hits were filtered for maximum 1% FDR using the Percolator algorithm in the Processing workflow. A second stage search was activated to identify semi-tryptic peptides. Both unique and razor peptides were selected for protein quantification. Proteins identified by site, reverse or potential contaminants were filtered out prior to analysis. Label-free quantitative MS analysis of the <italic>C03B8.3(bon104);tag-321(bon103)</italic> double mutants in comparison to the wt(N2) reference was performed.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Statistical analysis of data</title><p id="P29">Bar graphs and error bars indicate mean Â± s.d., and dots show individual data points.
