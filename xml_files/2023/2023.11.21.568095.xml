The circadian clock synchronizes an organism with these environmental changes and alters their physiology in anticipation. Prediction of the probable timing of pathogen infection enables plants to prime their immune system without wasting resources or sacrificing growth. Here, we explore the relationship between the immune hormone salicylic acid (SA), and the circadian clock in Arabidopsis. We found that SA altered circadian rhythmicity through the SA receptor and master transcriptional coactivator, NPR1. Reciprocally, the circadian clock gates SA-induced expression of NPR1-dependent immune genes. Furthermore, the clock gene CCA1 is essential for SA-induced immunity to the major bacterial plant pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>. These results reveal new interactions between the circadian clock and SA signaling which produce an effective immune response. Understanding how and why the immune response in plants is linked to the circadian clock is crucial in working towards improved crop productivity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The rotation of our planet creates 24-hour cycles in our environments, such as in light levels and temperature. To anticipate these rhythms, the circadian clock has evolved as an internal timekeeping mechanism in almost all eukaryotes. It synchronizes an organism’s behavioral and physiological processes with the rhythmic changes in its surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dunlap 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Reppert and Weaver 2002</xref>). Detection of environmental cues feeds into the circadian clock, which then regulates outputs such as rhythmic gene expression. The temporal separation or coordination of process that results from this timekeeping enables the optimization of resource use in an organism’s everyday function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hodge et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kim et al. 2017</xref>). For example, in humans, the circadian clock plays roles in the cardiovascular and nervous systems, gut microbiome, cancer and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bechtold et al. 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P3">As sessile organisms, plants cannot escape unfavorable conditions, evade herbivores, or move to find more distant resources. Therefore, the main challenge for plants is the effective use of available resources to improve fitness. Plants utilize the circadian clock to track and anticipate periodic environmental changes and stressors. This results in the prioritizing of distinct biological responses at different times of day or year according to the anticipated environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dodd et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Covington and Harmer 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kim et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Creux and Harmer 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In Arabidopsis, circadian rhythms involve an interconnected network of transcriptional/translational feedback loops, in which circadian components activate or repress each other’s activity in a cyclical manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Creux and Harmer 2019</xref>). Expression of the MYB-related transcription factors Circadian Clock Associated 1 (CCA1) and Late elongated Hypocotyl (LHY) peak at dawn. This is followed by the sequential expression of Pseudo-Response Regulator 9 (PRR9), PRR7 and PRR5 throughout the day. The transcription factor, Timing Of Cab expression 1 (TOC1), peaks in the evening, followed by expression of the evening complex (EC), consisting of Early Flowering 3 (ELF3), ELF4 and LUX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Li et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kamioka et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Huang and Nusinow 2016</xref>). The rhythmic expression of these core clock components in turn regulates many downstream pathways through periodic gene expression. At least 30% of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis) transcriptome is under circadian control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Covington et al. 2008</xref>). This includes genes involved in regulating flowering, biomass, photosynthesis, water use, temperature stress responses and pathogen defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Mizoguchi et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kim et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Paajanen et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P5">One of the downstream pathways that the clock modulates is the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lu et al. 2017</xref>). Plant pathogens and pests cause devastating losses to food crops worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Savary et al. 2019</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms that underpin plant immunity is critical to improving crop productivity and to meet the exponentially increasing food demand. Pathogen recognition is conferred through two immune pathways: PAMP triggered immunity (PTI) and effector triggered immunity (ETI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jones and Dangl 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Spoel and Dong 2012</xref>). Pathogen recognition by these interconnected pathways leads to accumulation of the immune hormone salicylic acid (SA) that activates the expression of thousands of immune genes, many via the activation of the master transcriptional coactivator, NPR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Cao et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cao et al. 1997</xref>). NPR1 is responsible for the regulation of pathogenesis related (PR) genes including PR1. In addition to activating local immune responses, SA and NPR1 are also required for the onset of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which provides long-lasting protection throughout the entire plant against a broad spectrum of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Malamy et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gaffney et al. 1993</xref>; Park et al. 2007; Chanda et al. 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fu and Dong 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Basal levels of SA are under circadian control with SA abundance peaking in the middle of the night, which is thought to prime the immune response for dawn, when plants are most vulnerable to pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Melotto et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Goodspeed et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Zheng et al. 2015</xref>). In accordance, Arabidopsis displays enhanced resistance in the subjective morning and increased susceptibility at subjective midnight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bhardwaj et al. 2011</xref>). This disparate resistance is lost in plants overexpressing <italic>CCA1</italic> (<italic>CCA1ox</italic>) and in <italic>elf3-1</italic> mutants, both of which are arrhythmic at the gene expression levels. Furthermore, key immune genes are under circadian regulation, including the pathogen recognition receptors <italic>FLS2</italic> and <italic>EFR</italic>, as well as components of the SA biosynthesis, <italic>ICS1</italic> and <italic>EDS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bhardwaj et al. 2011</xref>).

The period shortening was most significant between LL29 and LL34. These results indicate a time-dependency of SA-induced period shortening.</p><p id="P14">Our experiments and those reported previously investigated the effect of continuous exposure to SA on the circadian clock. As basal SA levels are rhythmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Goodspeed et al. 2012</xref>) and pathogen-induced SA accumulation is transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Ederli et al. 2011</xref>), we investigated the effect of transient SA treatment on <italic>CCA1</italic> rhythms. <italic>CCA1pro:LUC</italic> leaf disks were treated with SA at five different time points over 24 hours and the media was replaced with SA-free imaging media 8 hours after treatment. Here, only time points LL34 and LL44 exhibited significant period shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This confirms that transient SA treatment also shortens the period of the circadian clock similarly to continuous treatment, though the effect size is somewhat smaller.</p><p id="P15">Collectively, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> suggest that conflicting reports in literature may be due to difference in SA dose dependency and treatment time within experimental setups.

NPR1 is an SA receptor and master regulator of SA-responsive immune gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cao et al. 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zhou et al.

However, in previous studies that observed circadian gene expression of NPR1 mutants, no effect on period was found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zhou et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Li et al. 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To investigate this, we observed <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>TOC1</italic> rhythms in <italic>npr1-1</italic> mutants.

Although the period lengthening effect is small the detailed time resolution provided by luciferase reporters allowed us to evidence a clear effect of NPR1 on circadian gene expression in uninduced conditions</p><p id="P18">To test if NPR1 also mediates the effects of SA on circadian period shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), we subjected our clock marker lines in the WT and <italic>npr1-1</italic> backgrounds to SA treatment.

Combined, these data demonstrate that NPR1 affects timekeeping and that the effect of SA on the circadian clock is dependent on NPR1. Thus, basal and SA induced NPR1 are part of the input system of the plant circadian clock.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>SA-induced PR1 gene expression is gated by the circadian clock</title><p id="P19">Thus far, NPR1 appears to be one of the key elements in crosstalk between SA levels and the circadian clock. NPR1 is a master regulator of SA-responsive gene expression, including the antimicrobial gene <italic>Pathogenesis-Related 1</italic> (PR1). As endogenous basal levels of SA as well as the abundance of monomeric NPR1 protein exhibit circadian oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Zheng et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zhou et al. 2015</xref>), we investigated if <italic>PR1</italic> gene expression is also rhythmic. We measured PR1 expression in wild-type plants by sampling every 3 hours for two days. In the absence of an immune inducer, basal <italic>PR1</italic> gene expression remained very low and did not exhibit rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). However, when we subjected plants to SA at 3-hour intervals, we found that SA-induced <italic>PR1</italic> expression was consistently higher during the subjective night than the subjective day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, the circadian clock might gate SA-induced <italic>PR1</italic> expression.</p><p id="P20">To investigate this further, we compared SA-induced <italic>PR1</italic> expression levels at subjective dawn versus dusk in wild-type as well as in arrhythmic <italic>CCA1ox</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Wang and Tobin 1998</xref>) and <italic>cca1lhy</italic> mutants that exhibit a shortened period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Zhang et al. 2013</xref>).

None of these studies observed any effect of long-term SA exposure on period.</p><p id="P25">To understand the discrepancies of the effect of SA signaling on the clock, we investigated the effect of both continuous and transient SA treatment on clock gene expression using a range of treatment times and consistent methodology.

Notably, the length of SA treatment determined the extent to which clock alterations occurred with longer treatment having more pronounced effects.

As we have shown that vice versa the circadian clock is also involved in regulating SA induced PR gene expression and resistance to Pseudomonas, it would be interesting to investigate whether NPR1 plays a role in this interaction, potentially facilitating crosstalk between the circadian clock and the immune system in both directions. Additionally, as redox regulation of NPR1 conformation and localization is a key step in its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Mou et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Tada et al. 2008</xref>), daily redox rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Edgar et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lai et al. 2012</xref>) may control the interplay between the circadian clock and NPR1.</p><p id="P31">Our study provides evidence of the reciprocal regulation between the circadian clock and SA signaling.

The findings presented here further our understanding of the interactions between the circadian clock and the immune system and how they work together to produce an effective immune response. Continued study of the systems controlling plant immunity is essential to prioritize plant health and thus food security.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p id="P32"><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> were grown on soil for 3-4 weeks, unless otherwise stated, in growth cabinets (Percival Scientific Inc.) set at constant 21°C with a light intensity of 70-100 μmoles m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (Fusion 18W T8 2ft Triphosphor Fluorescent Tube 4000K) under 12 h light/12 h dark.
