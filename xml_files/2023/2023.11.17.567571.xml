Preclinical studies using laboratory rodents are essential to advance our understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological functions of these cells in the central nervous system. Rodents are nocturnal animals, and they are mostly maintained in a defined light–dark cycle within animal facilities, with many laboratories investigating microglial molecular and functional profiles during the animals’ light (sleep) phase. However, only a few studies have considered possible differences in microglial functions between the active and sleep phases. Based on initial evidence suggesting that microglial intrinsic clock genes can affect their phenotype, we sought to investigate differences in transcriptional, proteotype and functional profiles of microglia between light (sleep) and dark (active) phases, and how these changes are affected in pathological models. We found marked transcriptional and proteotype differences between microglia harvested during the light or dark phase. Amongst others, these differences related to genes and proteins associated with immune responses, motility, and phagocytosis, which were reflected by functional alterations in microglial synaptic pruning and response to bacterial stimuli. Possibly accounting for such circadian changes, we found RNA and protein regulation in SWI/SNF and NuRD chromatin remodeling complexes between light and dark phases. Importantly, we show that microglial circadian transcriptional changes are impaired in a model of immune-mediated neurodevelopmental disorders. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering circadian factors in studying microglial cells and indicate that implementing a circadian perspective is pivotal for advancing our understanding of their physiological and pathophysiological roles in brain health and disease. This may also open novel avenues towards therapeutic strategies for modulating microglial functions during specific windows of the active or sleep phase.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Microglia cells constitute the immune competent cells of the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Borst et al., 2021</xref>).

The latter aspect has received increasing attention in recent years, as microglia cells have been shown to participate in a vast array of physiological brain functions in favor of proper circuit stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Borst et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Umpierre and Wu, 2021</xref>).

Rodents are nocturnal animals, and they are mostly maintained under in a defined light–dark cycle within animal facilities, with many laboratories performing analyses of microglial functions during the animals’ light (sleep) phase. There is, however, initial evidence suggesting that microglial functions differ between active and sleep phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Deurveilher et al., 2021</xref>). For example, while initial studies found that pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in rat hippocampi followed a circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fonken et al., 2015</xref>), more recent studies have shown that the expression of the clock genes <italic>Bmal1 (Arntl)</italic> and <italic>Rev-erbα (Nr1d1)</italic> influence the microglial immune response and phagocytic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Griffin et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). However, these studies only looked at selected microglial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fonken et al., 2015</xref>), or they analyzed the response to the bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), via mRNA-sequencing. of whole hippocampal tissue(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Griffin et al., 2019</xref>), but not in a cell-specific manner. Other studies revealed that microglial morphology and process motility also changes between the light and dark phases in response to circadian fluctuations of noradrenaline levels, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Stowell et al., 2019</xref>). For example, Stowell <italic>et al.</italic> observed that noradrenaline-mediated modulation of microglial process motility during the dark (active) phase is associated with a decrease in synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex of of laboratory rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Stowell et al., 2019</xref>). In line with these findings, Choudhuri <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that microglia-mediated phagocytosis of synaptic material is higher during the light (sleep) phase in the prefrontal cortex of adult rats, while Griffin <italic>et al.</italic> found increased microglial synaptic pruning during dark (active) phase in the mouse hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Choudhury et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Griffin et al., 2020</xref>). More recently, Corsi <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that hippocampal microglia alter their fractalkine receptor <italic>(Cx3cr1)</italic> expression between active and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Corsi et al., 2022</xref>), which suggests that circadian factors may play a role in modulating microglial activity through neuron-derived signals.</p><p id="P4">Taken together, the existing evidence suggests that the functional properties of microglia differ between the active and sleep phases as a result of the influence of clock genes and circadian rhythms. However, a systematic investigation of the transcriptional, proteotype and functional profiles of microglia harvested during the active or sleep phase is still lacking. A multi-modal comparison of microglial profiles during active and sleep phases would help explaining within- and between-study variability in microglial readouts, which may arise due to differences in sampling hours in correlation with facilities’ light-on/off schedules. Moreover, considering circadian factors in microglial functions may also open novel avenues towards their therapeutic modulation, as it may allow more specific chrono-pharmacological targeting of the central immune system. For these reasons, the present study was designed to evaluate the transcriptional, translational, and functional adaptations of microglia to the active (dark) and sleep (light) phases in laboratory mice.</p><p id="P5">To this end, we focused on hippocampal microglial cells, mainly because the hippocampus is a highly plastic brain region associated with learning and memory processes that are supported by microglial functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cornell et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Microglia undergo transcriptional adaptations to active and sleep phases</title><sec id="S4"><label>3.1.1</label><title>Changes in microglial specific genes between the active and aleep phases are accompanied by altered levels of fractalkine and Interleukins</title><p id="P6">First, we compared the expression of selected microglial genes in freshly isolated hippocampal microglia along with hippocampal cytokine and fractalkine protein levels in samples collected at 1 p.m. (i.e., 4 h after lights were off; = active phase) and 1 a.m. (4 h after lights were on; = sleep phase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We found that <italic>P2ry6</italic> and <italic>P2ry12,</italic> both of which are important for purine-mediated microglial phagocytosis and process motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bernier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Koizumi et al., 2007</xref>), were significantly increased during the active as compared to the sleep phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).

Likewise, we found that hippocampal fractalkine (CX3CL1) and IL-4 were significantly higher during the active as compared to the sleep phase, whereas hippocampal IL-6 levels were lower during the active as compared to the sleep phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Hippocampal levels of IL-1β, IL-10 and TNF-α did not change as a function of the dark-light cycle. Taken together, these results provided a first line of evidence suggesting that basal immune microenvironments and microglia-related transcripts in the hippocampus of laboratory mice differ between light and dark phases.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>3.1.2</label><title>Microglia cells undergo transcriptional adaptations between the active and sleep phases</title><p id="P7">To further substantiate this notion, we performed unbiased, genome-wide RNA sequencing using hippocampal microglia that were collected at 1 p.m. (i.e., 4h after lights were off; = active phase) and 1 a.m. (4 h after lights were on; = sleep phase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). These analyses revealed marked differences between the transcriptomic profiles of microglia collected during the active or sleep phase. Indeed, compared to microglia collected during the active phase, 1328 and 231 genes were up- and downregulated, respectively, in microglia collected during the sleep (light) phase as compared to the active (dark) phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Besides others, genes that are crucial for phagocytotic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Sierra et al., 2013</xref>), including <italic>Dock</italic>-family genes, <italic>Mertk, Rhob, Elmo1, Syk, Hck, Csk</italic> and <italic>Rac3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4F</xref>), were found to be upregulated during the active phase, suggesting that the transcriptional correlates of phagocytotic activity follow a circadian regulation. Consistent with the findings of increased hippocampal fractalkine (CX3CL1) levels during the active phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1C</xref>), we also found the active phase to be associated with increased expression of <italic>Adam10</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1C</xref>), which encodes the enzyme responsible for fractalkine cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gunner et al., 2019</xref>). Other DEGs that were upregulated during the active phase were genes related to chaperone-mediated protein folding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4C-D</xref>), innate immune response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), antigen presentation, Toll-like receptor signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig.S4E</xref>), and phagocytic receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The latter included <italic>Fcgr1, Fcgr3 C5ar1</italic> and <italic>C5ar2</italic> found enriched during the active phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig S4E-F</xref>), along with genes characterizing disease associated microglia (DAM) signatures observed in β-amyloid plaque-associated microglia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Grubman et al., 2021</xref>). On the other hand, specific DEGs that were upregulated during the sleep (light) phase were annotated with cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4A-B</xref>), motility, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The latter involved e.g., <italic>Adamts4, Mmp14,</italic> and <italic>Ctsc</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1</xref>), relevant for microglial ECM-remodeling and engulfment in favor of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Confirming our initial qRT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), we also found lower transcript levels of <italic>P2ry12</italic> and <italic>P2ry6</italic> in hippocampal microglia collected during the sleep phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1A</xref>). These changes were accompanied by decreased expression of <italic>Entpd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2A</xref>), which encodes for CD39, a membrane bound enzyme responsible for converting extracellular ATP to ADP. The latter stimulates P2Y12 receptors and promotes microglial process motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Illes et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the transcripts of various neurotransmitter receptors, including serotonergic, cholinergic, and adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3</xref>), as well as transcripts of several heat-shock proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4C-D</xref>), were significantly altered between active and sleep phases. Notably, several clock genes were also found to be expressed differently in hippocampal microglia that were collected during the sleep as compared to the night phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), confirming previous reports of circadian effects on clock gene expression in microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Griffin et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that hippocampal microglia undergo widespread transcriptional adaptations between light and dark phases in laboratory mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6"><label>3.2</label><title>Microglia display increased excitatory synaptic pruning during the dark phase</title><p id="P10">Fractalkine is a “find me” signal that can lead to microglial phagocytosis of synaptic material, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Paolicelli et al., 2014</xref>). We found increased levels of fractalkine during the active phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) accompanied with an enrichment in phagocytosis-associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Sierra et al., 2013</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest a higher level of synaptic pruning during the active phase. We therefore assayed whether the present microglial transcriptional profile and increased fractalkine levels were followed by an increased synaptic engulfment during the active phase. For the purpose, we employed a recently published protocol to detect synaptic material within microglia cells via fluorescent associated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Brioschi et al., 2020</xref>). We collected microglia from adult mouse hippocampi 4h post light-on and 4h post lights-off as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>. We observed a significant increase in percentage of microglia positive for the excitatory presynaptic marker vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (vGlut1) during the active phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), accompanied by a significantly higher vGlut1 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D-E</xref>, the complete gating strategy is displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5</xref>). This is in accordance with Griffin et al. that found a higher number of synaptophysin-positive microglial inclusions during the active phase in the adult mouse hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Griffin et al., 2020</xref>). For this experiment, we distinguished microglia cells from peripheral monocytes by the high expression of CD11b and low expression of CD45. We have previously shown that a limited number of peripheral monocytes are allowed into the brain parenchyma in support of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Möhle et al., 2016</xref>). The RNA-seq also revealed an increased expression of chemokines <italic>Cxcl12</italic> and <italic>Cxcl10</italic> during the sleep phase, accompanied by a decreased expression in <italic>Ccl8</italic> and <italic>Ccl24,</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>), which may reflect on changes in chemoattraction of peripheral monocytes. We therefore investigated whether monocytes identified as CD45<sup>hi</sup> and CD11b<sup>low</sup> were more abundant during either phase, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Of note, animals were perfused to remove peripheral immune cells from the brain vasculature. Interestingly, we found an increased proportion of CD45<sup>hi</sup> and CD11b<sup>low</sup> during the sleep phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><label>3.3</label><title>The microglial response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide changes in intensity between the active and sleep phases</title><sec id="S8"><label>3.3.1</label><title>The microglial transcriptional response to lipopolysaccharide changes in intensity between the active and sleep phases.</title><p id="P11">Previous studies indicate a higher peripheral innate immune response to LPS during the sleep phase in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Keller et al., 2009</xref>).

LPS was administered intraperitoneally (1mg/Kg) to adult male mice either two hours post light-on (11.00 a.m.) or post light-off time (11.00 p.m.). Hippocampal microglia cells were collected four hours post injection (03.00 p.m. and 03.00 a.m. respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Of note, to avoid technical and batch effects and to be able to best compare the LPS responses, the injections were performed within the same 24h, with the same lot of mice and LPS batch. Furthermore, RNA isolation and library preparation were performed simultaneously for all groups.</p><p id="P12">Total RNA-sequencing revealed that peripheral LPS during the active phase induced a deregulation of 3286 protein coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-C</xref>, 1675 up- and 1611 downregulated genes). LPS administration during the sleep phase caused a deregulation of 2799 protein coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D-E</xref>, 1674 up- and 1125 downregulated genes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref> contains the complete differential expression and GO-analysis). GO-analysis revealed similar pathways to be deregulated in both time-points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, E</xref>), however, the LPS response during the sleep phase showed a stronger enrichment for immune-related pathways such as defense response, response to cytokine, and response to bacterium, as compared to the LPS response during the active phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, E</xref>), despite the similar number of upregulated genes in both phases. This enrichment was observable also at different Log2FC cut-offs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). This suggests a higher innate immune reactivity during the sleep phase, as observed in peripheral macrophages in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Keller et al., 2009</xref>) and similar to what was found in whole hippocampal tissue in response to systemic LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fonken et al., 2015</xref>). To better understand the effect of time on the LPS response we computed directly the contrast in effects by subtracting the observed change in the LPS group during the day (3 p.m.) from the control group during the day (3 p.m.), and similarly, by subtracting the observed change in the LPS group during the night (3 a.m.) from the control group during the night (3 a.m.), (Delta = (LPS_3p.m. vs. Control_3p.m.)-(LPS_3a.m. vs. Control_3a.m.)).

GO-analysis analysis revealed that 4h post LPS injection during the sleep phase there was a greater enrichment in proteins associated with an immune response as compared to the active phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C, E</xref>), corroborating our findings at the RNA level. Enhanced enrichment in immune-related proteins in response to LPS during the sleep phase was observed irrespective of Log2FC cut-off (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>).

Since proteins are the final effectors of a given transcriptional response, this data suggests that microglia cells react faster to LPS during the sleep phase. Besides regulation in classical immune and metabolic pathways, the response to LPS induced a downregulation in olfactory receptors genes such as <italic>Olfr110</italic> and <italic>Olfr111</italic> resulting in enrichment of BPs such as sensory perception of smell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-E</xref>), that was corresponded at the proteotype level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C, E</xref>).

Of note, as for the transcriptional evaluation, injections for this experiment were performed within the same 24h-period, with the same LPS batch and lot of animals, to minimize batch and technical biases.

We found 182 protein-coding DEGs between these two timepoints (56 upregulated and 126 downregulated, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig S7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref> contains the complete differential expression and GO-analysis). Similar to the changes found between 1 a.m. and 1 p.m., microglia showed transcriptional regulation in BPs associated with cell migration, motility, adhesion, and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S7B</xref>). Additionally, genes associated with neuronal processes and myelination were enriched at 3 p.m. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S7B</xref>). Microglia have been shown to express neuronal and oligodendrocyte genes, albeit to a lower extent, and the function of such transcripts in microglia remains elusive, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Grassivaro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Solga et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, genes associated with cell differentiation were enriched during the sleep phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S7B</xref>). Proteotype analysis of microglia freshly isolated from control mice at 3 p.m. and 3 a.m. revealed 481 proteins differentially expressed (251 up- and 230 downregulated proteins, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig S7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref> contains the complete proteotype analysis). We found proteins associated with cell-adhesion and cell differentiation to be enriched at 3 a.m., in correspondence with the transcriptional analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S7B, D</xref>), while cell motility- and angiogenesis-related proteins were enriched at 3 p.m. Also, corresponding the RNA-analysis, neuronal-related processes such as cell projection organization, were enriched at 3p.m. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S7D</xref>). Looking deeper into hippocampal microglial changes in protein expression we found increased levels of C1QA and C1QC in the active phase, confirming what we found transcriptionally at 1 p.m., as reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>. The latter table summarizes the transcriptional and proteotype changes in selected genes and proteins relevant to microglial states and functions. Higher complement component proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>) along with increased fractalkine during active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) may participate to the higher rate of synaptic pruning observed during the active phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). In line with this, we found that phagocytic marker CD68 and the proteins paxillin and cofilin-2 were also enriched during the active phase, along with CDC42 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). The latter are important drivers of cytoskeletal changes necessary for phagocytosis to occur, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gitik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">López-Colomé et al., 2017</xref>). Concomitantly, we found an active phase-associated enrichment in myosin proteins MYH10 and MYH14, required for proper cell motility and phagocytosis, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Porro et al., 2021</xref>), along with chaperonin-containing TCP1 subunits 2, 3 and 5 (CCT2, CCT3 and CCT5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). CCT chaperonins are critical for proper myosin and actin folding and fibril formation, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Srikakulam and Winkelmann, 1999</xref>). Importantly, CCT5 interacts with F-actin enabling proper MERTK-dependent phagocytic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Feng et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, CD81 was enriched during the active phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>), a protein relevant for microglia motility and myelin phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Martins et al., 2019</xref>). The proteotype analysis also revealed a decrease in P2Y12 and CD39 levels during the sleep phase, as were the corresponding transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>), confirming a circadian regulation of the microglial purinergic system. Finally, we report circadian regulation of genes and proteins associated with glucose and lipid metabolism along with mitochondrial functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>), indicative of metabolic reorganization between phases. Next, we sought to understand the potential machinery behind the microglial circadian molecular and functional changes. We observed a sleep phase-associated enrichment in BPs such as chromatin remodeling and nucleosome organization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S7D</xref>). Accordingly, we found marked protein enrichment for several components of the chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) and Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5 and S6</xref>) at 3 a.m. The latter complexes can swiftly change the chromatin architecture thereby mediating changes in cellular state and are emerging as key players of innate immune cells’ ability to flexibly alter their states, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gatchalian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2006</xref>). CRC activity is guided by epigenetic readers, i.e., proteins that binds to specific histone and DNA epigenetic marks and recruit CRCs to appropriate chromatin sites. We found a sleep phase-associated protein enrichment in epigenetic readers, amongst which CHDs, (part of the NuRD complex) and bromodomain-containing factors (BRDs, recruiters of the SWI/SNF complex), at baseline and in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>). These are particularly important transcriptional regulators of the response to LPS in macrophages and microglia, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). We further found that following LPS injection, protein regulation of CRCs and epigenetic readers, was more pronounced during the active phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>), as also reflected by the associated BPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3I</xref>). This is likely because these proteins are already enriched during the sleep phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>), indicating a higher microglial state of flexibility.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><label>3.5</label><title>Microglia cells display a deregulated phase-associated transcriptional adaptation in the maternal immune activation model of neurodevelopmental disorders</title><p id="P15">Microglia cells have garnered extensive attention in the field of neurodevelopmental disorders, including conditions like schizophrenia, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mattei and Notter, 2020</xref>).

In prior studies, we demonstrated that injection of Poly(I:C) during gestational day 17 (GD17) yields adult offspring presenting several hippocampal abnormalities, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Giovanoli et al., 2015</xref>). We have also shown that offspring from dams injected with Poly(I:C) display aberrant transcriptional profiles in hippocampal microglia, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mattei et al., 2017</xref>). Of note, for the latter study, animals were hosted in a light:dark cycle, and microglia were collected during the light phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mattei et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we generated GD17 Poly(I:C) adult offspring (Poly animals) to extend the transcriptional analysis to look at 1) the microglial transcriptional differences between the light (sleep) and dark (active) phases in adult Poly animals (within-group comparison: Poly-3p.m. versus Poly-3a.m., 2) to compare the adult Poly microglial transcriptional profile to control animals with respect to the light and dark phase (between-group comparisons: Poly-3p.m. versus Control-3p.m. and Poly-3a.m. versus Control-3a.m.) and 3) to compare the response to LPS between the active and sleep phases in microglia from Poly animals, as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>. When comparing the microglial transcriptional changes between the sleep and active phase in Poly animals (Poly-3a.m. vs. Poly-3p.m.), we found 2527 DEGs, (1399 upregulated and 1128 downregulated, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>).

The direct contrast of PolyI:C effects on adult microglial transcriptional changes between the active and sleep phases (Delta = (PolyI:C_3p.m. vs. Ctr_3p.m.)-(PolyI:C_3a.m. vs. Ctr_3a.m.)) reveals 1420 significant protein coding genes (574 upregulated and 845 downregulated genes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>, analogous to figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D-E</xref>).

This suggests that the physiological adaptation between the light and dark phase is profoundly affected in this model of neurodevelopmental disorders. Genes associated with innate immune functions, including cytokine production and phagocytosis were enriched during the active phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>), deviating from what we found in control animals for the same comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). Genes associated with cell adhesion, which in control conditions were enriched at 3 a.m. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S7C</xref>) were instead strongly enriched at 3 p.m. in adult Poly microglia. Genes linked to neurogenesis were enriched at 3 p.m., alike in control conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig S7C</xref>) albeit to higher extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>). Notably, genes associated with sensory perception of smell where highly enriched at 3 a.m. in Poly microglia. As mentioned in the result section 3.3, olfactory receptors regulate innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Orecchioni et al., 2022</xref>), and they were subject to expression changes at both the RNA and protein level in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C, E</xref>). When comparing the transcriptional profile of microglia collected during the active phase from Poly animals and controls (Poly-3p.m. versus Control-3p.m., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>), we found 901 DEGs (298 upregulated and 603 downregulated, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>).

When comparing the transcriptional profile of microglia collected during the sleep phase from Poly animals and controls (Poly-3a.m. versus control-3a.m., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), we found 250 DEGs (157 upregulated and 93 downregulated). The upregulated genes were associated with BPs such as cell development, glia cell differentiation, cell adhesion and cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). The downregulated genes were associated with angiogenesis, cell motility, chemotaxis, and immune system processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Importantly, the latter pathways were found deregulated also in our previous transcriptional analysis, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mattei et al., 2017</xref>), where microglia were collected from Ploy and control animals during the sleep phase. We thus show that the same comparison performed with microglia cells collected during the active phase can reveal transcriptional deregulations different from the sleep phase.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><label>3.6</label><title>The circadian transcriptional differences in LPS response are blunted in adult MIA offspring</title><p id="P16">Next, we sought to compare the response to LPS in Poly animals between the active and sleep phase as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>.

Although the upregulated biological processes were comparable, we observed an increased regulation in olfactory receptor-related biological processes amongst the downregulated genes in response to LPS during the sleep phase.

We found that there was little interaction between the two factors, suggesting that the microglial LPS response in adult PolyI:C offspring is not affected by circadian factors as we found for control animals.

However, there is at present no study directly comparing the naïve microglial transcriptional and proteotype profiles between the active and the sleep phase.

These alterations were mirrored by changes in functional readouts such as hippocampal synaptic pruning and intensity of response to LPS. This suggests that exclusively studying microglial functions during laboratory rodent's sleep phase provides only a partial understanding of these cells' physiological roles within the CNS. Our data indicate that microglia finetune their motility in a phase-dependent manner, accompanied by expression changes in neurotransmitter receptors associated with wake states, like the beta-2-adrenergic receptor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3A</xref>). This has been functionally validated by two recent studies that confirmed differences in microglial process surveillance between the active and sleep phases, also in association with changes in noradrenergic tone, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Stowell et al., 2019</xref>). The present work provides a transcriptional and proteotype resource to understand such changes at the molecular level. Moreover, genes coding for serotonin and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, known to modulate microglial motility and phagocytosis also showed phase-dependent regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Krabbe et al., 2012</xref>),, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Piovesana et al., 2021</xref>). This is indicative of a microglial functional adaptation to altered neurotransmitter levels between wake and sleep. Notably, we observed an active phase-associated enrichment in transcripts and proteins for the purinergic receptor P2Y12 and the enzyme CD39 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>), which converts extracellular ATP to ADP, the endogenous ligand for P2Y12. This system mediates the microglial process extension towards extracellular ATP sourced by e.g., high synaptic activity or brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Haynes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Pankratov et al., 2006</xref>). Our data indicate that hippocampal microglia may be more responsive to ATP and ADP-mediated stimulation during the wake-phase, which is potentially linked to increased synaptic activity during wake and the surge in excitatory neuronal ATP occurring in the transition between sleep and wake states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Natsubori et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Of particular interest are the changes in expression of genes associated with ECM remodeling.

These have been implicated in the microglial response to IL-33 for ECM-remodeling in favor of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). ECM-remodeling is also of relevance in pathological conditions, e.g., in the context of brain tumors, as microglia-mediated ECM remodeling promotes brain tumor expansion, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Crapser et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, aberrant ECM remodeling is an important feature in neurodegenerative disorders and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and schizophrenia, where abnormal ECM composition and remodeling seem to participate to glial activation and circuit instability, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Crapser et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, we found that genes and proteins associated with phagocytic functions were enriched during the active phase, including receptors and components of the complement system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). These changes were accompanied by increased hippocampal synaptic pruning during the active phase. Microglial phagocytosis is being investigated for its relevance to physiological processes like neurodevelopment, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">VanRyzin, 2021</xref>) as well as in disease, such as neurodevelopmental disorders, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lukens and Eyo, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mattei et al., 2017</xref>) and neurodegeneration, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Podleśny-Drabiniok et al., 2020</xref>).

Present immune-pharmacological strategies for AD are being developed around microglial DAM-states studied mostly during the animal’s sleep (light) phase. The present study suggests that studying microglial phagocytic functions, ECM-remodeling properties as well as disease-associated states from a circadian perspective has the potential to advance our understanding of their involvement in brain disorders. This could potentially reveal circadian time-windows for optimal targeting of specific pathways. An example of such an approach is presented here for the study of microglia cells in the Poly(I:C) mediated MIA model of neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). We have previously shown that hippocampal microglia from adult Poly(I:C) offspring present with a transcriptional deregulation in genes associated with e.g., immune system processes, chemotaxis, and VEGF-signaling pathways, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mattei et al., 2017</xref>). The animals used in the latter study were hosted in a light:dark cycle, and microglia were isolated during the light phase. Thus, we captured transcriptional differences between Poly(I:C) offspring and control microglia during the rodent’s sleep phase. In fact, in the present study, the comparison Poly 3 a.m. vs. Control 3 a.m. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>, sleep phase) corroborate our previous findings of downregulated pathways such as immune system processes, chemotaxis and VEGF-signaling pathways. The same comparison performed with microglia isolated during the active phase (Poly 3 p.m. vs. Control 3 p.m.) revealed an upregulation in biological processes associated with IL1 and TNF production, regulation of stress-activated MAPK cascade and metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Finally, we hypothesize that the observed microglial transcriptional, proteotype and functional changes between phases are possibly mediated by the circadian regulation in NuRD and SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5 and S6</xref>). The latter are recruited to open and close chromatin access at specific sites, and they are emerging as important players in immune cell state flexibility, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gatchalian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2006</xref>).

We observed a protein enrichment in several CRCs subunits during the sleep phase, when microglia were associated with a stronger immune response to LPS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>).

Considering the present results, it would be advisable to report the lights-on/off schedules of individual animal facilities, and the specific hour post light-on (or off) when animals are euthanized for microglial characterizations. This may support a better reproducibility of scientific findings. For the purpose of implementing a circadian component in microglial characterizations, cohorts of mice can be hosted in rooms set in a dark:light and in a light:dark cycle in parallel. This way, cohorts would be available during both phases, facilitating experimental designs such as the one proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>. A limitation of the present study is that we did not perform a complete circadian transcriptional time-course, but rather had fixed time-points in the light and dark phase. Collins et al. recently demonstrated how the transcriptome and proteome of peripheral macrophages undergoes circadian oscillations, which influences their immune responsiveness and phagocytic functions, similar to what we found in microglia cells in the present study, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Collins et al., 2021b</xref>) Moreover, we only performed this analysis in male mice. Future studies should aim at addressing how the microglial transcriptional and translational profiles changes throughout a complete circadian cycle and in a sex-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>4</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S16"><label>4.1</label><title>Animals</title><p id="P23">Nine to ten weeks old male C57BL6/N mice (Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany) were used throughout the study. They were caged 3-5 animals per cage in individually ventilated cages (IVCs). The animal vivarium was a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) holding room, which was temperature- and humidity-controlled (21 ±3 °C, 50 ± 10%) and kept under a reversed light–dark cycle (lights off: 09:00 AM–09.00 PM). Hence, all animals were in their active and sleep phases during the experimenters’ light (day) and dark (night) phases, respectively. All animals had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food (Kliba 3436, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) and water throughout the entire study. All procedures described in the present study had been previously approved by the Cantonal Veterinarian’s Office of Zurich, and all efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><label>4.2</label><title>Breeding and maternal immune activation</title><p id="P24">The maternal immune activation (MIA) model was implemented as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Scarborough et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, successful mating was verified by the presence of a vaginal plug, considered as gestational day 0 (GD 0). Dams were housed individually throughout gestation. On GD 17, pregnant dams were randomly assigned to a single intravenous tail-vein injection of either poly(I:C) (Sigma–Aldrich P9582, Buchs, St. Gallen, Switzerland) to induce MIA, or pyrogen-free 0.9% NaCl (prenatal control).

The gestational time point of poly(I:C) or vehicle administration (i.e., GD 17) was selected based on previous studies showing more extensive abnormalities in hippocampal structures and functions when MIA occurs in late gestation as compared to earlier time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Giovanoli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Meyer et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">2006</xref>). All injections had a total volume of 5 ml/kg. Following the injection, the dams were placed back in their home cages and left undisturbed until the first cage change on postnatal day 7.

Briefly, the animals were deeply anesthetized with an overdose of Nembutal (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL, USA) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold, calcium- and magnesium-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS). Hippocampi and frontal cortices were dissected on a cooled petri dish and placed in ice-cold Hibernate-A medium. MD at 4°C was carried out on ice with a Dounce homogenizer, using a loose pestle. Myelin debris were removed via percoll gradient centrifugation. After washing of the percoll, total brain cell pellets were used for CD11b magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) using anti-mouse CD11b magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The MACS buffer consisted of 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) diluted in DPBS from a 7.5% cell-culture grade BSA stock (Thermo Fisher Scientfic). Total hippocampal cell pellets were re-suspended in 90 μl MACS buffer and 10 μl anti-mouse-CD11b magnetic beads. The cells were then incubated for 15 min at 4°C. Cells were washed with 1 ml MACS buffer. The cells were then passed through an MS MACS column (Miltenyi) attached to a magnet.

For spectral library generation, a fraction of the samples originating from the same condition were pooled to generate a mixed sample for each condition. Peptides were separated by reverse-phase chromatography on an 25-cm Easy Spray column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) connected to an EASY-nLC 1200 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Maternal immune activation at gestational day 17 (GD17) was induced via injection of the synthetic viral RNA mimic Poly(I:C). The offspring was left undisturbed until they reached adulthood (postnatal day 70) and were included in the experiment. Adult offspring of PolyI:C injected dams (termed Poly animals) and controls were intraperitoneally injected with either LPS or sterile saline solution at either 11 p.m. or 11 a.m. Hippocampal microglia were isolated 4h post injection at either 3 p.m. (active phase) or 3 a.m. (sleep phase). Microglia from control animal groups that did not receive LPS (wildtype [wt] control-saline and Poly-saline), were used to investigate active and sleep phase-associated changes in transcriptional profile within Poly microglia and between Poly and control microglia at baseline.
