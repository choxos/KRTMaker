To identify the cell type-specific immune alterations in the BD brain, we performed a proteomic and single nuclear transcriptomic analysis of <italic>postmortem</italic> cingulate cortex samples from BD and control subjects. Our results showed that genes associated to the genetic risk for BD are enriched in microglia and astrocytes. Transcriptomic alterations in microglia point to a reduced proinflammatory phenotype, associated to reduced resistance to oxidative stress and apoptosis, which was confirmed with immunohistochemical quantification of IBA1 density. Astrocytes show transcriptomic evidence of an imbalance of multiple metabolic pathways, extracellular matrix composition and downregulated immune signalling. These alterations are associated to <italic>ADCY2</italic> and <italic>NCAN</italic>, two GWAS genes upregulated in astrocytes. Finally, cell-cell communication analysis prioritized upregulated SPP1-CD44 signalling to astrocytes as a potential regulator of the transcriptomic alterations in BD. Our results indicate that microglia and astrocytes are characterized by downregulated immune responses associated to a dysfunction of core mechanisms via which these cells contribute to brain homeostasis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe and highly heritable psychiatric disorder, with significant morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, affecting 1% to 4.5% of the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and is characterized by episodes of mood alteration, that can be depressive or (hypo)manic. A significant proportion of BD patients suffers from functional and cognitive impairment at various degrees across the phases of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The aetiology of the disease is still largely unknown, but it is considered multifactorial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, encompassing genetic and environmental factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The absence of reliable animal models of the disease (based on genetic or environmental mechanisms) further hampers the understanding of the pathology. Indeed, the clinical heterogeneity of BD patients combined with the high comorbidity rate leads to difficulties in the identification of specific biological targets. Nevertheless, evidence from Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> have highlighted several genomic loci with a significant association with BD.</p><p id="P5">One of the potential biological mechanisms that has been widely described in BD is inflammation. Indeed, an increased concentration of peripheral inflammatory markers has been consistently reported in cross-sectional studies in BD, suggesting immune alterations across the various mood states of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. However, whether this increased peripheral inflammatory state is due to central inflammation has not been determined. If peripheral inflammation is mechanistically associated with BD pathophysiology central immune mechanisms should also be activated. This central immune activation should involve microglia and astrocytes, which are among the most important cellular mediators of immunity in the central nervous system (CNS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Contrary to the upregulation of peripheral inflammatory markers in BD, a recent large-scale bulk RNA sequencing study of over 500 brain samples from two brain regions involved in BD pathophysiology (cingulate cortex and amygdala) has shown that gene co-expression modules enriched in immune pathways were significantly downregulated in BD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. However, bulk RNA sequencing does not allow for cell type-specific inferences to be made, so it is impossible to assert if this downregulation of immune pathways involves microglia and astrocytes. Furthermore, a recent systematic review of human neuropathology studies assessing immune markers in <italic>postmortem</italic> human brain samples highlighted that at the protein level, results are inconsistent across studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, likely due to the heterogeneity of the employed techniques and the targeted molecules.</p><p id="P6">To clarify the central molecular alterations involved in BD, we first performed a bulk tissue proteomic analysis in human <italic>postmortem</italic> samples from BD patients and age- and sex-matched controls, which showed that proteomic alterations in BD involved astrocyte- and microglia-specific molecules. Consequently, using single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq), we focused on microglia and astrocytes and first assessed the astrocyte- and microglia-specific expression of BD GWAS genes and their alterations with the disease. We then characterized the wider dysfunctional biological pathways in BD using snRNAseq and spatial transcriptomics and validated the most important findings using immunohistology and an independent bulk tissue transcriptomic dataset. Our multi-omic analyses results point to specific molecular alterations in glial cells in BD, predominantly characterized by extracellular matrix (ECM) gene overexpression, metabolic and immune signalling dysfunction in astrocytes and reduced proinflammatory, phagocytosis-related signalling and apoptosis-associated decrease in microglial density in BD.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>BD is characterized by proteomic alteration of immune, mitochondrial and lipid metabolic pathways</title><p id="P7">To identify protein pathway alterations in BD, we first performed a proteomic analysis on bulk cingulate gyrus (Cg) tissue–a brain region that has been consistently implicated in BD − from 18 <italic>postmortem</italic> human brain samples from BD patients and age- and sex-matched non-neurological and non-psychiatric control subjects (CT). To increase the statistical power in the assessment of protein functional pathways that are altered in BD, we employed a protein co-expression analysis using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, which yielded 13 modules. WGCNA uses principal component analysis (PCA) to extract an eigenprotein value, i.e. a numeric value representing the overall abundance of all the proteins in the module (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). We thus compared the eigenprotein values of the modules between the BD and CT samples and based on this comparison we prioritized the two significantly differentially abundant modules: Module 17 (M17, 104 proteins, <italic>p<sub>adj</sub></italic> = 0.0194, downregulated in BD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and, “Module” 0 (M0, 185 proteins, <italic>p<sub>adj</sub></italic> = 0.0184, upregulated in BD), which actually is the set of proteins that were not assigned to any module in the WGCNA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) of the M17 module using enrichR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> showed enrichment in growth factor pathways (involving proteins that mediate VEGF, NTRK2-NTRK3, FGF and PDGFB signalling), innate immune/phagocytosis pathways and citrate cycle proteins and mitochondrial matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The presence of C1S in M17 indicates a downregulation of the classical pathway of complement activation, whereas the presence of the complement regulator CD55 indicates a potential mechanism for neurotoxicity in BD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and corroborates previous findings of a downregulation of CD55 in the plasma of BD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. We then performed individual protein level differential abundance analysis focusing on proteins included in this module to prioritize potential drivers of its downregulation. ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase (PFKL), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH3G), mitochondrial acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase 2-like (ACSS1) and mitochondrial ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) were significantly downregulated (log<sub>2</sub>FC<sub>PKFL</sub> = -0.313, <italic>p<sub>adjPKFL</sub></italic> &lt; 0.0001, log<sub>2</sub>FC<sub>ACSS1</sub> = -0.303, <italic>p<sub>adjACSS1</sub></italic> = 0.00481, log<sub>2</sub>FC<sub>OAT</sub> = -0.251, <italic>p<sub>adjOAT</sub></italic> = 0.0164), underlining the dysregulation of mitochondrial and metabolic function in BD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). In the M0 protein set, lipoprotein metabolism, ECM, apoptosis and neurotransmitter signalling pathways were enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Individual protein differential abundance analysis highlighted lipid processing alterations (APOE, APOA1 and FABP3) as significantly upregulated in BD (log<sub>2</sub>FC<sub>APOE</sub> = 0.373, <italic>p<sub>adjAPOE</sub></italic> &lt; 0.0001, log<sub>2</sub>FC<sub>APOA1</sub> = 0.431, <italic>p<sub>adjAPOA1</sub></italic> = 0.0491, log<sub>2</sub>FC<sub>FABP3</sub> = 0.333, <italic>p<sub>adjFABP3</sub></italic> = 0.0293) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Some of the donors of our BD group were taken psychotropic medications (lithium, olanzapine or valproate) at the time of death. We thus asked if the proteomic alterations in our samples could be driven by these medications. We identified gene sets that were in the brain of rodents in response to treatment with these medications from previous studies. We thus tested the overlap between the differentially abundant proteins in our samples with genes altered in response to lithium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, olanzapine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> or valproate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and did not find any significant overlap. This results suggests that the results of our proteomic analysis is not driven by medications.</p><p id="P8">Given that this proteomic analysis was performed on bulk tissue, we then sought to identify cell type associations of the significantly altered protein sets. We employed the Expression Weighted Cell type Enrichment (EWCE) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> that assesses if a given set of proteins/genes is significantly enriched in markers of a particular cell type based on brain single cell RNA sequencing datasets. This analysis identified a significant enrichment of astrocyte-specific proteins in both downregulated (M17) and upregulated (M0) sets of proteins (<italic>p</italic><sub>downregulated</sub> = 0.005, <italic>p</italic><sub>upregulated</sub> = 0.0137, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G, H</xref>).

No other cell types were enriched in any of the modules. Taken together, these results suggest immune, lipid and mitochondrial metabolic alterations in BD that are specifically associated with astrocytes and microglia.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>BD risk factor genes are differentially expressed in astrocytes and microglia</title><p id="P9">Our proteomic analysis suggested that the major alterations in protein expression in BD occurred in astrocytes and microglia. We thus specifically examined these two cell types using snRNAseq on a subset of our samples. We used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) on the isolated nuclei to remove SOX10-positive oligodendrocytes and NEUN-positive neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> prior to barcoding. With this method, 15’000 ‘double negative’ nuclei were retained per sample (=0.079 ±0.047% of total events − <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure S1A</xref>). The nuclei were then processed on the 10X Chromium controller and sequenced. Then, we used the nf-core/scflow pipeline to perform integration using Liger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, clustering with UMAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, and cell identification, resulting in 18’176 nuclei in total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). BD and CT as well as male and female donor nuclei were well-mixed after integration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure S1B, C</xref>). The number of nuclei did not significantly differ between BD and CT (<italic>p</italic> = 0.1033, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure S1D</xref>), or between male and female donors (<italic>p</italic> = 0.3415, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure S1E</xref>). Nuclei sorting and automated cell type annotation was verified with canonical microglial and astrocytic cell markers and with enrichment of the nuclei for gene sets characteristic of human microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> using AUCell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, which confirmed the cell type identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure S1F, G</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We first assessed if genes related to BD genetic risk-associated genomic loci from GWAS (a combined list of genes identified by Stahl et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and Mullins et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref></italic>), were enriched in astrocytes and microglia nuclei. We first quantified the expression of the 73 GWAS genes. Of those genes, 43 are expressed by at least 5% of astrocytes or microglia in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We then used MAST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> to perform a differential gene expression (DGE) analysis using a mixed effects model, between BD and CT samples and found that several of the GWAS genes were differentially expressed in glial cells (padj &lt; 0.1, |logFC| &gt; 0.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B, C</xref>): in astrocytes <italic>ADCY2</italic> (p<sub>adj</sub>= 0.092, logFC =0.698) coding for an isoform of adenylyl cyclase that catalyses the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from ATP and is involved in cAMP-PKA signalling, regulating multiple cellular functions such as glycogen metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>;</sup> <italic>CACNB2</italic> (p<sub>adj</sub>= 0.0669, logFC = -2.607), a subunit of a voltage-gated calcium channels which has been associated with hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> and brain cognitive dysfunctions in BD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>; <italic>NCAN (p<sub>adj</sub>= 0.015, logFC = 0.785)</italic>, a component of brain ECM and specifically of brain perineuronal nets that regulate synaptic structure and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, which also contributes to the formation of glial scar in response to injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>;</sup> <italic>SLC25A17</italic> (p<sub>adj</sub>= 0.0369, logFC = 0.268), a peroxisomal transporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>; and <italic>FSTL5</italic> (p<sub>adj</sub>= 0.007, logFC = -0.352), coding for a Wnt signalling-associated protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> shown to be implicated in caspase-dependent apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Insulin signalling, along with the upregulated <italic>CSF1R</italic>, both potential activators of the PI3K-Akt pathway, may drive autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, which also shows evidence of upregulation. Autophagy might be in response to oxidative stress, which characterises BD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, especially given the dysfunctional antioxidant responses and glutathione metabolism indicated by the downregulation of relevant genes (<italic>GSR, MGST2, LAP3, JUN, PNPT1, SELENOS, CYBA, VRK2, ETV5;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Microglial dysfunction is accompanied by a reduction in the expression of proinflammatory genes of the cytokine, antigen processing, interferon, and JAK-STAT pathways. This could have an impact on synaptic pruning by microglia impacting neuroplasticity and neuronal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> in BD. Finally, we found evidence for an increased apoptosis of microglial cells in BD. Indeed, several genes involved in antiapoptotic signalling were found downregulated (e.g. <italic>TUBA1B, NAIP, YWHAG, YWHAQ, BCL2, BCL2L1, GLUD1</italic> and <italic>ACTG1</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>.

These results confirm a reduction of genes related to microglial proinflammatory and phagocytosis pathways. To test the reproducibility of this result on a larger scale, we performed the same analysis on the dataset published by Zandi et al. and found that, in addition to the validation of an overall hypoactivation of microglia in Cg in BD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure S2F</xref>), this result extends to the amygdala (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure S2G</xref>).</p><p id="P13">With evidence of increased apoptosis in microglia in BD and a global downregulation of microglia specific genes in these two bulk transcriptomic datasets, we hypothesized that microglial density may be reduced with the disease.

We first assessed the presence of amyloid β deposits as well as hyperphosphorylated tau protein in both BD and CT subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure S3</xref>) that showed no significant difference. We next asked if the differential expression of microglial genes could have been induced by psychotropic medications that some of the BD subjects of our cohort were taking.

This result confirms that microglial transcriptomic alterations in our dataset have not been the result of medication, but most likely of the disease itself.

Bulk tissue proteomics provided evidence for downregulation of growth factor and proinflammatory signalling, citrate cycle and mitochondrial matrix proteins, accompanied by an upregulation of lipoprotein metabolism and apoptosis-related proteins. These significantly altered proteins were predominantly of astrocytic and microglial origin and this prompted us to perform a snRNAseq characterization of these two cell types in BD to obtain a cell-type specific mapping of the molecular alterations in the disease. We first showed that GWAS genes for BD were expressed in microglia and astrocytes and showed for the first time to our knowledge that several of them were altered with the disease (e.g. <italic>ADCY2, NCAN, CD47, SSBP2</italic>). At the transcriptomic level, both microglia and astrocytes showed evidence for a downregulated proinflammatory and growth factor signalling and for dysfunctional metabolism. Using immunostaining we showed that microglial density is reduced in BD, associated with increased apoptosis and deficient response to oxidative stress. Among the potential mechanisms of astrocyte contribution to neuronal dysfunction, we found evidence for dysregulated immune and metabolic functions, dysfunctional glutamate homeostasis and an overexpression of ECM components that form perineuronal nets, alterations that are potentially associated to increased signalling through SPP1 to astrocytic CD44. Using spatial transcriptomics, we show that these astrocytic alterations differentially affect the cortical WM and GM. Finally, we indicate that despite the diverging proinflammatory molecular alterations in the CNS (downregulation) and the periphery (upregulation) in BD, two potentially anti-inflammatory molecules (IL-10 and VEGF-D) may serve as biomarkers of the disease as their serum dynamics parallel those of the brain.</p><p id="P25">We provided several lines of evidence that proinflammatory signalling is downregulated in both microglia and astrocytes in BD, a finding that has been suggested by previous brain transcriptomic studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup>. This comes in contrast with the largely reproduced increased concentration of proinflammatory cytokines in the plasma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> of BD patients. This could suggest that the peripheral proinflammatory markers are increased due to brain-independent processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup>. Alternatively, this finding could be due to a particular vulnerability of BD patient glial cells to the effect of ageing. Indeed, our sample included aged individuals, whereas studies measuring peripheral inflammation have been performed on cohorts of a younger age. We can thus hypothesize that glial cells, particularly microglia present a « dystrophic » phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref></sup> with an altered morphology (explaining the smaller IBA1<sup>+</sup> area per cell in our study), an increased apoptosis and a lower proinflammatory gene expression. This could be due to chronic activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref></sup>. It is still unclear if during an acute episode of the disease there is proinflammatory activation in the brain, which could contribute to this chronic activation with multiple disease episodes. Such dysfunctional microglia may lead to defective synaptic pruning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref></sup> and, together with impaired astrocytic glutamate homeostasis may contribute to synaptic dysfunction in BD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref></sup>. This result prompts further research into carefully phenotyped cohorts to identify clinical trajectories associated with glial cell dysfunction in BD. We have recently shown that Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging measuring the 18 kDa-Transclocator Protein (TSPO) in the CNS is a marker of microglial density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref></sup>. PET TSPO imaging is the appropriate tool to further explore the clinical correlates of microglial density alterations in BD. The only PET TSPO study to date in BD included patients from various mood states, thus the upregulation that was highlighted could have been driven by individuals experiencing a disease episode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, there may still be peripheral inflammatory markers that show variations consistent with those in the brain, such as IL-10 and VEGF-D so further research should validate these markers.</p><p id="P26">Metabolic dysregulation was prominent in our proteomic and transcriptomic datasets.

At the same time, <italic>ADCY2</italic> is a BD GWAS gene: it could thus be an upstream of these metabolic alterations in astrocytes. This is particularly relevant, given the evidence in favour of an imbalanced cAMP and calcium signalling and glycogen synthesis, with a potential impact on lactate metabolism and the overall cortical activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref></sup>.

It is important to note that 5 of the patients in our cohort where diabetic, although they were equally distributed between the samples (n = 2 in BD, n= 3 in CT) so the downregulation of insulin pathway genes is therefore probably not the result of this comorbidity.</p><p id="P27">Our spatial transcriptomic experiment allowed us to obtain information on the phenotypic characteristics of cortical GM and WM astrocytes. This finding provides potentially mechanistic insight into the WM connectivity impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">106</xref></sup> and GM volume alterations in BD.</p><p id="P28">We recognize that our study has limitations. The principal one is the small group size and, though we have provided multiples lines of evidence using independent experimental approaches to validate our most important results (including the use of a particularly large bulk RNAseq dataset). In addition, several individuals of our BD cohort (3 out of 9) were on BD medication (lithium, clozapine and quetiapine) at the time of death. This could have an impact on some of our results, but the relative contribution of any of those individuals on the whole cohort should be small. We specifically tested for overlap between the genes that we were altered in our snRNAseq analysis and genes altered in response to these medications from previous studies. We did not find any significant overlap and this supports the argument that the results of our DGE analysis in microglia and astrocytes is likely not due to the effects of psychotropic medication. Furthermore, if the results of our DGE analysis were biased by medication, we would most likely expect an opposite effects on mechanisms such as brain proinflammatory activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">107</xref></sup> than what our results suggest. Another limitation stems from the fact that We studied samples from one brain region and our results warrant further validation in other brain regions implicated in BD. Finally, knowing that BD and other severe psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and major depressive disorder may share common pathophysiological mechanisms, our study is limited by the fact that it does not provide any information on the specificity of our findings in BD.</p><p id="P29">In summary, we have performed a multi-omic analysis of human brain samples in BD and identified potential mechanisms affecting microglial and astrocytic function. We show that brain inflammatory signalling is reduced in BD and highlight potential serum cytokines that could reflect their brain levels, while glucose and lipid metabolism alterations also characterise the disease. Our work prompts the assessment of the clinical impact of these alterations with metabolomic profiling of serum as well as through carefully designed clinical studies.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Human samples</title><p id="P30">Flash Frozen (FF) and Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) human <italic>postmortem</italic> cingulate cortex samples were obtained from the same 9 BD and 9 age- and sex-matched non-neurological and non-psychotic CT subjects.
