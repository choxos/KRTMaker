Many PAMP-induced signaling pathways and cellular responses are known, yet how pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) limits pathogen growth in plants is poorly understood. Through a combined metabolomics and genetics approach, we discovered that plant-exuded proline is a virulence-inducing signal and nutrient for the bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>, and that PAMP-induced depletion of proline from the extracellular spaces of Arabidopsis leaves directly contributes to PTI against <italic>P. syringae</italic>. We further show that PAMP-induced depletion of extracellular proline requires the amino acid transporter <underline>L</underline>ysine <underline>H</underline>istidine <underline>T</underline>ransporter <underline>1</underline> (LHT1). This study demonstrates that depletion of a single extracellular metabolite is an effective component of plant innate immunity.

In animals, recognition of PAMPs by PRRs activates specialized immune cells that coordinate their functions with local tissues to kill and clear pathogens from infection sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In contrast, plants do not possess mobile immune cells that seek out and destroy invading pathogens. Rather, individual cells that constitute plant tissues are capable of directly detecting and mitigating threats locally at sites of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Because many plant pathogens remain outside of host cells during infection, PRR-mediated resistance must be capable of hindering microbial growth within the apoplast, or extracellular space, of plant tissues. In this regard, activation of PRRs triggers defense responses that are associated with suppressing microbial growth in the apoplast, including the production of reactive oxygen species, secretion of antimicrobial compounds, and cell wall reinforcement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Collectively, PAMP-induced defenses provide effective resistance termed PAMP- or pattern-triggered immunity (PTI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. However, the exact mechanism(s) of how PTI limits pathogen infection of the apoplast remain(s) largely unknown.</p><p id="P3"><italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> are Gram-negative bacteria that cause disease on economically important crops as well as the model plant Arabidopsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. <italic>P. syringae</italic> are primarily foliar pathogens and enter leaves through openings such as stomata or wounds. Once inside, <italic>P. syringae</italic> can multiply to high levels within the leaf apoplast. A key virulence factor for <italic>P. syringae</italic> is its type III secretion system (T3SS), a syringe-like apparatus that delivers PTI-suppressing effector proteins into plant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Although the T3SS is critical for virulence, T3SS-encoding genes are not constitutively expressed and must be induced during infection. To this end, <italic>P. syringae</italic> relies on plant-exuded metabolites, namely sugars and specific amino acids, as signals to induce its T3SS-encoding genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. <italic>P. syringae</italic> receptors and signaling pathways required for detecting specific host signals are known, and mutants lacking these signaling components are less virulent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. On the host side, the extracellular release of T3SS-inducing metabolites by plant cells is genetically-regulated, as evidenced by the discovery of an Arabidopsis mutant lacking <italic>MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1)</italic> that exudes lower amounts of several T3SS-inducing metabolites and as a consequence is more resistant to <italic>P. syringae</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Collectively, these observations reveal that the abundance of virulence-inducing metabolites encountered by <italic>P. syringae</italic> in plant tissues is an important determinant of infection outcomes.</p><p id="P4">Pathogenic bacteria must express specific virulence genes to infect a host. As such, the signaling events that initiate the expression of these genes represent a vulnerability that can be targeted by host defenses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. A long-standing observation is that activation of plant immunity can prevent <italic>P. syringae</italic> from injecting type III effectors into plant cells. In this regard, <italic>P. syringae</italic> is restricted in its ability to inject effectors into Arabidopsis and tobacco leaf cells pre-treated with PAMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. A similar restriction occurs when <italic>P. syringae</italic> infects PAMP-treated Arabidopsis seedlings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. More recent transcriptome analyses revealed that expression of T3SS-encoding genes is inhibited during <italic>P. syringae</italic> infection of PAMP-treated Arabidopsis leaves, suggesting that PTI limits <italic>P. syringae</italic> growth by interfering with T3SS gene induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In this work we investigated PAMP-induced changes in the metabolic composition of the Arabidopsis leaf apoplast.

AvrPto levels were greatly diminished in flg22-treated leaves infected with DC3000 for five hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The reduced amount of AvrPto was not due to differences in leaf bacteria populations at this early time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We observed identical results with leaves treated with the PAMP elf26, indicating that decreased AvrPto accumulation occurs in response to multiple PAMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Flg22 and elf26 are recognized by the PRRs FLS2 and EFR, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. AvrPto levels were not altered in <italic>fls2</italic> or <italic>efr</italic> mutants pretreated with either flg22 or elf26, respectively, confirming the observed phenotype is receptor-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P6">PTI is severely compromised in an Arabidopsis <italic>dde2 ein2 pad4 sid2</italic> quadruple knockout (QKO) mutant deficient in the production of defense hormones salicylic acid, ethylene and jasmonic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In contrast to reduced AvrPto accumulation in flg22-treated Col-0 leaves, no decrease in AvrPto abundance was detected in flg22-treated QKO leaves infected with DC3000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). We also infiltrated Col-0 and QKO leaves with a DC3000 <italic>hrpL</italic><sub>promoter</sub>:<italic>gfp</italic> reporter strain and, based on GFP fluorescence from the infected tissue, observed that expression of T3SS regulator <italic>hrpL</italic> was significantly decreased in flg22-treated Col-0 leaves, whereas a significant flg22-dependent decrease in <italic>hrpL</italic> expression did not occur in QKO leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Indeed, <italic>hrpL</italic> expression was significantly higher in mock-treated QKO compared to mock-treated Col-0, possibly due to the attenuated response of QKO to endogenous DC3000 PAMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Together, these results confirm that PAMP-induced defenses restrict the expression of T3SS genes in <italic>P. syringae</italic>, and reveal that this restriction does not occur in PTI-deficient QKO leaves.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Apoplastic wash fluid from PAMP-treated leaves inhibits <italic>P. syringae</italic> growth and T3SS deployment</title><p id="P7">To investigate how PTI restricts T3SS deployment, we isolated apoplastic wash fluid (AWF) from mock- and PAMP-treated Arabidopsis leaves. For this procedure, we syringe-infiltrated leaves with water containing flg22 or the solvent DMSO as a mock control. After eight hours, we then syringe-infiltrated the same leaves with water and used low-speed centrifugation to isolate AWF from the infiltrated leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Using a malate dehydrogenase (MDH) enzyme assay to detect cytoplasmic proteins, we confirmed that our AWF isolation procedure did not result in substantial cytoplasmic leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Furthermore, no significant difference in MDH activity between AWF from mock-treated (mock-AWF) or flg22-treated (flg22-AWF) leaves was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The leaf apoplast is rapidly alkalinized following PAMP perception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Consistent with these previous observations, the average pH of our mock-AWF samples was 6.17, whereas the average pH of flg22-AWF samples was 6.63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We measured a similar increase in pH between mock- and flg22-AWF from PTI-deficient QKO leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Based on these data, alkalization of the apoplast is likely not causal for flg22-induced restriction of T3SS genes.</p><p id="P9">We next tested whether T3SS deployment is altered when <italic>P. syringae</italic> are cultured in AWF from flg22-treated Col-0 leaves. To alleviate possible pH effects, we mixed the extracted AWF with a phosphate-buffered minimal medium (MM). The added MM was sufficient to adjust the pH of both mock-AWF and flg22-AWF to 6.0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>). We then cultured DC3000 <italic>hrpL</italic><sub>promoter</sub>:<italic>gfp</italic> in the buffered AWF and, based on GFP fluorescence, observed significantly decreased <italic>hrpL</italic> expression in bacteria cultured in flg22-AWF compared to mock-AWF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). To further investigate this difference in AWF bioactivity, we chloroform-extracted mock-AWF and flg22-AWF, lyophilized the resulting aqueous and organic phases to dryness, then resuspended the dried samples directly into MM. We cultured DC3000 <italic>hrpL</italic><sub>promoter</sub>:<italic>gfp</italic> in these extracted samples and observed that nearly all of the <italic>hrpL</italic>-inducing activity was present in the aqueous fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b</xref>). Furthermore, decreased <italic>hrpL</italic>-inducing activity of flg22-AWF relative to mock-AWF was evident in the aqueous but not in the organic fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b</xref>). Immunoblot detection of AvrPto in the treated bacteria confirmed the difference in bioactivity of aqueous mock- and flg22-AWF fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). We also incubated DC3000 <italic>hrpL</italic><sub>promoter</sub>:<italic>gfp</italic> in mock-AWF and flg22-AWF isolated from QKO leaves. In contrast to AWF from Col-0 leaves, no significant decrease in <italic>hrpL</italic>-inducing activity was detected between mock-AWF and flg22-AWF isolated from QKO leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p><p id="P10">In addition to T3SS induction, we also tested for DC3000 growth in AWF. Similar to the pattern for <italic>hrpL</italic> expression, DC3000 grew in mock-AWF from Col-0 leaves, and this growth was significantly reduced in flg22-AWF from Col-0 leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). After chloroform extraction of AWF samples, the growth-stimulating activity in AWF was present in only the aqueous fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c,d</xref>). No difference in bacterial growth was observed for DC3000 cultured in mock- and flg22-AWF from QKO plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Based on these results, we conclude that AWF isolated from flg22-treated Col-0 leaves has decreased T3SS- and bacterial growth-inducing activity.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Metabolomics analysis of apoplastic wash fluid from flg22-treated Arabidopsis leaves</title><p id="P11">To determine the molecular basis for the decreased T3SS-inducing activity of flg22-AWF, we used gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to profile flg22-induced changes in the Arabidopsis leaf apoplast metabolome. From samples collected in eight independent experiments, we identified a total of 96 features from both mock- and flg22-AWF, 62 of which could be identified based on comparisons of peak retention times and mass spectra to entries in the FiehnLib library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Based on <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and &gt;2 fold-change cutoffs, four features increased and six decreased in flg22-AWF compared to mock-AWF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Notably, the defense hormone salicylic acid increased 13-fold in flg22-AWF, thus confirming that defense responses were elicited in flg22-treated leaves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. We grouped the identified metabolites into categories of amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), organic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) and sugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Despite surprisingly few changes overall, significant differences in metabolite abundance between mock- and flg22-AWF occurred in each of these three categories. Notably, threonic acid was the only sugar that differentially accumulated between treatments, increasing four-fold in flg22-AWF. We also profiled metabolites present in mock-AWF and flg22-AWF collected from QKO leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Of those metabolites that significantly changed in abundance in flg22-AWF from Col-0 leaves, only threonic acid and succinic acid also significantly accumulated in flg22-AWF from QKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>), indicating that flg22-induced accumulation of these two metabolites is not causal for decreased T3SS-inducing bioactivity of flg22-AWF.</p><p id="P12">We next measured the absolute concentrations of metabolites that differentially accumulated in AWF in response to flg22 treatment. In mock-AWF, all of these metabolites were detected at concentrations &lt; 20 μM except for proline and serine that were present at 120 μM and 194 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2a,b</xref>). We then tested each of these metabolites for <italic>hrpL-inducing</italic> activity at their measured concentrations. Only proline and serine significantly induced <italic>hrpL</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2c</xref>). Based on the abundance and T3SS-inducing activity of proline and serine, we hypothesized that decreased abundance of these specific amino acids is causal for the decreased T3SS-inducing bioactivity of flg22-AWF. We focused on proline because, compared to serine, proline was a more potent inducer of <italic>hrpL</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2c</xref>) and showed the greatest flg22-dependent fold-change of all metabolites except for salicylic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We added 100 μM of proline, a similar concentration to the ~90 μM difference in proline between mock- and flg22-AWF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>), to both mock- and flg22-AWF. The added proline restored <italic>hrpL</italic> expression in flg22-AWF back to levels observed with mock-AWF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>). Moreover, adding proline to the flg22-AWF partially yet significantly restored DC3000 growth to levels measured in mock-AWF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3j</xref>).

Although this constitutive defense phenotype was observed in our experiments as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>), the focus of our hypothesis was the magnitude of flg22-induced reduction in bacterial growth, rather than the absolute levels of resistance. Because DC3000Δ<italic>putA</italic> is specifically compromised in its ability to respond to proline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), the growth of this mutant relative to DC3000 provides a measure of apoplastic proline levels in infected leaf tissue and its impact on <italic>P. syringae</italic> virulence. Our hypothesis predicts several outcomes of these infection assays. First, because apoplastic proline is depleted in Col-0 in response to flg22, DC3000 and DC3000Δ<italic>putA</italic> should grow to similar levels in flg22-treated Col-0 leaves. Indeed, in flg22-treated Col-0 leaves, growth of DC3000 and DC3000Δ<italic>putA</italic> was indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>, gray color). Second, because flg22 treatment does not alter levels of apoplastic proline in <italic>lht1-7</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>), sufficient levels of proline should remain in flg22-treated <italic>lht1-7</italic> leaves to function as a T3SS-inducing signal and promote DC3000 growth.

Our data reveal that proline levels within the Arabidopsis leaf apoplast are highly dynamic and controlled by complex processes.
