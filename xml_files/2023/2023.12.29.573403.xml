Despite progress, the genomic aberrations underpinning osteosarcoma evolution remain poorly understood. Using multi-region whole-genome sequencing, we find that chromothripsis is an ongoing mutational process, occurring subclonally in 74% of tumours. Chromothripsis drives the acquisition of oncogenic mutations and generates highly unstable derivative chromosomes, the evolution of which drives clonal diversification and intra-tumour heterogeneity. In addition, we report a novel mechanism, loss-translocation-amplification (LTA) chromothripsis, which mediates rapid malignant transformation and punctuated evolution in about half of paediatric and adult high-grade osteosarcomas. Specifically, a single double-strand break triggers concomitant <italic>TP53</italic> inactivation and segmental amplifications, often amplifying oncogenes to high copy numbers in extrachromosomal circular DNA elements through breakage-fusion-bridge cycles involving multiple chromosomes. LTA chromothripsis is detected at low frequency in soft-tissue sarcomas, but not in epithelial cancers, including those driven by <italic>TP53</italic> mutation. Finally, we identify genome-wide loss of heterozygosity as a strong prognostic indicator for high-grade osteosarcoma.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies of tumours has revealed that most human cancers are riddled by complex forms of structural variation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). A major mutational process driving cancer genome complexity is chromothripsis, which refers to the acquisition of hundreds to thousands of clustered rearrangements in one or a few chromosomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) resulting from chromosomal shattering in micronuclei(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) or through fragmentation of dicentric chromosomes during anaphase bridge resolution(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Chromothripsis is pervasive across diverse cancer types(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), and often mediates malignant transformation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) and drug resistance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). A remarkable example of a cancer characterised by chromothripsis is osteosarcoma, the most common primary malignancy of bone for which therapeutic options and survival rates have not improved for over four decades(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Although the remarkable karyotypic complexity of osteosarcoma has long been established(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), the mechanisms underpinning osteosarcoma genome complexity and the impact of chromothripsis during tumour evolution remain elusive.</p><p id="P3">Chromothripsis can be identified by the presence of rearrangement profiles characterised by interleaved structural variants (SVs) with variable levels of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), which reflect the random rejoining of DNA fragments following chromosome fragmentation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). However, in osteosarcoma, chromothripsis events remarkably often involve &gt;10 chromosomes and co-localize with other genomic aberrations, such as whole-genome doubling (WGD) and segmental amplifications(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), the acquisition of which cannot be fully explained by rearrangement mechanisms already described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Here, through the analysis of multi-region long and short-read WGS data, we show that chromothripsis is an ongoing mutational process throughout osteosarcoma evolution and drives remarkable karyotypic heterogeneity. In fact, we detect subclonal chromothripsis events in 74% of tumours. In addition, we report a novel mechanism, loss-translocation-amplification (LTA) chromothripsis, which mediates <italic>TP53</italic> loss, oncogene amplification and WGD in about half of both paediatric and adult high-grade osteosarcomas, leading to malignant transformation and punctuated evolution over the course of a few cell divisions. LTA chromothripsis leads to the formation of highly unstable derivative chromosomes, the evolution of which drives the formation of the most complex chromothripsis events detected in human cancers, often involving &gt;15 chromosomes. We find that LTA chromothripsis also occurs in other sarcoma subtypes but not across &gt;2,600 tumours spanning 31 cancer types, including those driven by <italic>TP53</italic> inactivation, such as ovarian and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Our findings suggest that LTA is a mechanism specific to the evolution of high-grade osteosarcoma, and to a lesser extent, other sarcomas.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Clinical samples and whole-genome sequencing data</title><p id="P5">We processed WGS data uniformly for 356 primary and metastatic osteosarcoma samples from 197 patients, including published data for 128 tumour samples(<italic>19, 21, 23, 24</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

New data include high-depth multi-region WGS for 228 tumour regions from 85 patients (2-8 regions per tumour; median 4 regions) generated as part of the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project (G100k). Additionally, we sequenced 13 samples from uncommon histological variants of primary bone sarcomas (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S1 and S2</xref>). The final data set included 246 high-grade conventional (HGOS), 43 parosteal, 15 periosteal, 9 low-grade central, and 30 soft-tissue extraskeletal osteosarcomas, as well as 13 osteoclast-rich primary high-grade bone sarcomas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

The average patient age was 30 years (range 4 to 89 years; 40% of patients under 18 years old), and 40% of samples were from tumours treated with the MAP chemotherapy protocol (methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) or variations thereof (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Clonal evolution in osteosarcoma is driven by complex genomic rearrangements</title><p id="P6">Driver gene analysis identified genes known to be involved in osteosarcoma evolution, including <italic>TP53</italic> (altered in 136/197 tumours, 69%, primarily by rearrangements in intron 1), <italic>RB1</italic> (58/197, 29%), and <italic>CDKN2A</italic> (32/197, 16%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

We estimated an average burden of 1.85 SNVs per Mb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). We detected genomic features associated with activation of the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway in 53% (104/197) tumours, suggesting a predominant role of this pathway in driving replicative immortality in osteosarcoma(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

Among HGOS, 15% did not harbour alterations in <italic>TP53</italic> pathway genes (<italic>i.e</italic>., <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>MDM2</italic>). These cases did not show an enrichment of mutations in other driver alterations compared with <italic>TP53</italic>-mutant HGOS. On average, 55% of SNVs were subclonal (median: 53.4%), indicating high levels of intra-tumour heterogeneity. However, most driver mutations were clonal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2</xref>), and we did not detect positive selection in subclonal mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>), indicating neutral subclonal evolution at the level of point mutations. <italic>De novo</italic> mutational signature analysis of single-base substitutions (SBS) revealed that all signatures detected showed a comparable contribution to clonal and subclonal mutations, except for those associated with platinum therapy (SBS31 and SBS35)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

Platinum-associated signatures revealed clonal sweeps driven by single chemoresistant clones in relapse and metastatic samples, and the survival and outgrowth of multiple subclones in primary tumours upon treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In contrast to SNVs, the SV burden was high, with a median of 414 SVs per tumour (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1</xref>). The majority of SVs mapped to rearrangement clusters showing an equal distribution of SV types, a hallmark of chromothripsis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), templated insertions and microhomology tracts at the breakpoints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S5</xref>). However, only 11% (54/502) of SV clusters were classified as canonical chromothripsis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). The remainder co-localized with other events, such as extrachromosomal circular DNA (ecDNA) and segmental amplifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>), which masked the oscillating copy-number pattern characteristic of canonical chromothripsis. Thus, we collectively refer to such complex SV clusters as complex genomic rearrangements (CGRs). HGOS tumours showed high rates of WGD (99/141 tumours; 70%) and CGRs (131/141 tumours; 93%). High-level oncogene amplification often occurred in the context of CGRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In parosteal osteosarcomas, co-amplification of <italic>MDM2</italic> and <italic>CDK4</italic> mapped to ecDNA events in all cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1</xref>). In HGOS, 57% (81/141) of tumours harboured at least one high-level oncogene amplification, which were significantly enriched in chromosome arms with CGRs and associated with foldback inversions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

We classified SVs as clonal, subclonal and private based on whether they were detected in all, a subset or just one of the tumour regions analysed, respectively. We found a high frequency of subclonal CGRs in high, intermediate (periosteal) and low-grade osteosarcoma subtypes, with 62% (130/210) of tumour regions and 74% (40/54) of tumours showing subclonal chromothripsis, often leading to highly divergent karyotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, figs. S6 to S9, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>). Thus, these results indicate that chromothripsis is a common subclonal mutational process.</p><p id="P9">Previous studies suggest that chromothripsis can precede or follow other mutational processes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), and that rearranged chromosomes are subject to ongoing genomic instability(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). However, studying the evolutionary trajectories of rearranged chromosomes has been challenging due to the limited sensitivity for subclonal SV detection using bulk WGS data and the lack of multi-region or single-cell WGS data. Here, to investigate the evolutionary trajectories of chromosomes affected by chromothripsis, we mapped the rate of subclonal SVs across the genome using the multi-region WGS data. This analysis revealed that genomic regions with clonal CGRs are significantly enriched for subclonal SVs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; Fisher’s exact test), indicating that CGRs prime the cancer genome for ongoing chromosomal instability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figs. S10 to S12</xref>). Canonical chromothripsis events do not acquire subclonal or private SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). However, we detected hundreds of subclonal and private SVs in genomic regions affected by clonal chromothripsis with segmental amplifications, even when the clonal chromothripsis event only affected a small region of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S10</xref>). High-level amplifications showed marked heterogeneity caused by subclonal rearrangements, including translocations to multiple chromosomes, as observed in other ecDNA-driven cancers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Together, these results show that derivative chromosomes resulting from chromothripsis events are unstable and evolve through complex rearrangement processes, thereby driving intra-tumour heterogeneity and clonal diversification.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Loss-Translocation-Amplification (LTA) chromothripsis triggers punctuated tumour evolution</title><p id="P10">Given the high burden of SVs in HGOS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1</xref>), we next sought to identify genomic regions recurrently affected by breakpoints (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). Consistent with previous studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), the <italic>TP53</italic> locus was significantly rearranged in both adult and paediatric HGOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S13A</xref>). Investigation of the rearrangement profiles in chromosome 17 revealed frequent co-occurrence of terminal loss of 17p, including the <italic>TP53</italic> locus, and segmental amplification of 17p downstream of <italic>TP53</italic> together with other genomic regions across one or multiple chromosomes, with or without WGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figs S11 to S17</xref>). Analysis of tumour phylogenies reconstructed using SNVs and SVs detected in multi-region WGS data revealed that a single double-strand break in chromosome 17p (commonly in intron 1 of <italic>TP53</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1C</xref>) generates an unprotected terminal end that translocates to another chromosome or its sister chromatid to form a dicentric chromosome, the resolution of which triggers a series of BFB cycles during mitosis that generate segmental amplifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S18 to S20</xref>, and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). As a result, genomic regions and oncogenes from multiple chromosomes can be amplified as part of this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figs. S11 to S17</xref>). We detected this rearrangement pattern, which we term loss-translocation-amplification (LTA) chromothripsis, in 48% (68/141) of HGOS, including paediatric and adult HGOS in all cohorts analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figs S1 and S13 to S17</xref>), which we validated using long-read nanopore WGS of selected cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S18</xref>). Specifically, we detected LTA chromothripsis in 48% (48/99) of HGOS with WGD, and in 48% of HGOS cases without WGD (20/42). In 66% (45/68) of HGOS with LTA chromothripsis (32% of all HGOS, 45/141), the amplified regions encompassed oncogenes, often in the form of ecDNA, indicating that LTA chromothripsis is a frequent mechanism of oncogene amplification in HGOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figs. S1, S11 to S17</xref>). In the other 23 cases, the complexity of the derivative chromosomes was comparable, but the segmental amplifications caused by LTA did not encompass recurrently amplified oncogenes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figs. S19 to S20</xref>). LTA chromothripsis occurred in cells with one <italic>TP53</italic> allele already inactivated by somatic point mutations (24%, 16/68), somatic rearrangements (71%, 48/68), or germline pathogenic variants (6%, 4/68; 4/6 tumours from Li-Fraumeni individuals) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1</xref>). Notably, the SV burden and the number of chromosomes involved in chromothripsis are significantly higher in cases with LTA chromothripsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-D</xref>), indicating that the most complex chromothripsis events in osteosarcomas are caused by LTA chromothripsis.</p><p id="P11">The patterns of clonal dynamics in HGOS with LTA chromothripsis inferred from the tumour phylogenies are consistent with a model of punctuated evolution. Specifically, macroscopically distant tumour regions mapping centimetres apart from each other (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figs. S21 to S23</xref> for an example) only share a small set of point mutations and the rearrangements that initiated LTA chromothripsis, which show high allele fraction values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). The lack of shared mutations across regions that harbour tens to hundreds of private SNVs and SVs indicates that clonal diversification occurred rapidly, probably within a few cell divisions. Thus, the genomic instability cascade triggered by LTA chromothripsis following a single double-strand break in the <italic>TP53</italic> locus prompts malignant transformation within a few cell divisions.</p><p id="P12">We next investigated the frequency of LTA chromothripsis in other sarcomas and common cancers using WGS data from ~2,800 tumours from the TCGA sarcoma cohort (TCGA-SARC) and the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project. We did not detect evidence of LTA in epithelial cancers, including cancers with frequent <italic>TP53</italic> mutation, such as ovarian and oesophageal cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figs. S24 to S27</xref>). By contrast, we detected LTA chromothripsis at low frequency in soft-tissue sarcomas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figs. S28 to S29</xref>). Together, this indicates that LTA chromothripsis is rare in cancers other than osteosarcoma.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Whole-genome doubling is a late clonal event that triggers genomic instability</title><p id="P13">Motivated by the high frequency of WGD in osteosarcoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

The timing of genomic aberrations relative to WGD can be estimated by counting the fraction of somatic SNVs acquired before WGD, which should be present in at least two chromosomal copies (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). Due to low SNV burdens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

WGD, which we determined computationally and experimentally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table <bold>S7</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>), was a late event in 96% (53/55) of tumours, with WGD occurring on average at 80% of mutation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). No significant differences in WGD timing were observed between HGOS and other osteosarcoma subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).

We estimated an average latency period of 0.6 years (95% CI: 0.4-0.8) between WGD and the expansion of the MRCA in patients under 40 years old, as compared to 1.7 years (95% CI: 1.1-2.4) in those over 40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P14">These results, which are in agreement with the findings from PCAWG, represent a relatively shorter period between WGD and MRCA emergence compared to other cancer types(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).

Overall, we found that in 98.8% (815/825) of CGRs, the majority of breakpoints per chromosome arm occurred after WGD. In 11% of these events, at least 5 breakpoints occurred prior to WGD, suggesting an initial pre-WGD event. At the rearrangement level, only 0.4% (7/1863) of foldbacks associated with an oncogene amplification were predicted to occur prior to WGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E-H</xref>).

We describe a novel rearrangement process, LTA chromothripsis, which provides a mechanistic basis for the generation of the most complex derivative chromosomes frequently observed in high-grade osteosarcoma of bone, which are characterised by chromothripsis patterns interleaved with segmental amplifications across multiple chromosomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). We find that such complex events are the result of a karyotypic evolution process in which the resolution of an initial dicentric chromosome generated by a single double-strand break in the <italic>TP53</italic> locus triggers chromothripsis, oncogene amplification in the form of ecDNA and segmental amplifications across multiple chromosomes. LTA chromothripsis is different from translocation-bridge amplification(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) and classical BFB cycles(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) in that LTA causes concomitant biallelic inactivation of <italic>TP53</italic>, leading to tolerance to WGD and genomic instability, and a multi-generational BFB cycle process that can engage additional chromosomes, thus leading to the amplification of oncogenes across multiple chromosomes. LTA chromothripsis also explains mechanistically the generation of segmental amplifications commonly detected in osteosarcomas(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Through phylogenetic analysis, we show that LTA drives rapid karyotype evolution and clonal diversification, providing evidence for the role of chromothripsis in punctuated evolution and promoting rapid tumour growth. Somatic inactivation of one copy of <italic>TP53</italic> before LTA chromothripsis is required for malignant transformation in sporadic HGOS tumours. However, in Li-Fraumeni individuals, LTA is the only somatic event required to cause biallelic inactivation of <italic>TP53</italic> and oncogene amplification within a few cell divisions. Finally, we show that the degree of genome-wide LOH has strong prognostic power for HGOS, which may help improve the management of osteosarcoma patients, especially given the increasing availability of genome sequencing technologies in clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Data sets</title><sec id="S12"><title>-G100k RNOH cohort</title><p id="P19">Paediatric and adult fresh frozen tumour samples were obtained from patients consented and enrolled in both the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project (G100k) as well as the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) Biobank satellite of the UCL/UCLH Biobank for Health and Disease (REC reference 20/YH/0088).

Specifically, the CGR span in each chromosome and tumour region was defined as the genomic coordinate of the most upstream and downstream breakpoint coordinates across the tumour regions showing the CGR.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Timing of WGD and the expansion of the MRCA</title><p id="P43">Timing analysis of WGD events was performed as previously described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). Briefly, the multiplicity (i.e., number of chromosomal copies harbouring a given mutation), cancer cell fraction and copy number of clock-like SNVs (C&gt;T mutations in NpCpG contexts) were used to determine subclonal versus clonal mutations using 1,000 bootstrap resamples. Major allele copy number information was then used to stratify clonal mutations based on their occurrence before or after WGD (pre-WGD and post-WGD, respectively). Tumours with at least 50 clock-like SNVs, tumour purity &gt;0.3 and with patient age data available were selected for WGD timing analysis. We estimated the relative timing of WGD as the average fraction of pre-WGD clonal clock-like mutations in non-amplified regions (i.e., genomic regions with major and minor allele copy number values of 2 and 2, and 2 and 0, respectively). The relative timing for the MRCA was determined as the average proportion of clonal clock-like mutations across resamples.</p><p id="P44">To estimate the absolute timing of WGD and the expansion of the MRCA, we used the age at diagnosis to compute the mutational rate per sample as the number of clonal clock-like mutations per year adjusted for the effective genome size. Pan-cancer analysis of matched primary and relapse samples demonstrated that there is an acceleration in the mutation rate during the last stages of clonal evolution(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). To account for mutation acceleration, we applied an acceleration rate of 5x to the base mutational rate as previously reported(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Absolute timing of WGD (using years as unit of time) was calculated using the number of clock-like mutations estimated to occur before WGD. Specifically, we multiplied the total number of clonal clock-like mutations by the estimated relative timing for the WGD events, and adjusted the mutation rate using an acceleration rate of 5x(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Timing of SVs relative to WGD</title><p id="P45">To determine the timing of SVs relative to WGD, we used the copy number values on each side of the breakpoints, the jump in copy number between the genomic segments connected by each rearrangement, as well as the allelic fraction of rearrangement breakpoints(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Specifically, we defined copy number jump (CN jump) as the change in copy number between the two genomic regions bridged by each SV, and copy number junction (CN junction) as the number of DNA copies (also known as multiplicity) in which each breakpoint was detected. In addition, we computed the purity-adjusted allele frequency (AF) for each breakpoint. We defined a timing score based on the following principles. <list list-type="bullet" id="L3"><list-item><p id="P46">We consider that a given breakpoint only occurs once in each tumour. That is, that the probability for the same exact SV to occur more than once in a tumour is zero.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P47">The reordering and reassembly of DNA fragments in a chromothripsis event does not cause copy number amplification.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P48">Genomic regions with a minor allele copy number of 0 and a total copy number of 2 or more are considered to be the result of a loss followed by whole-genome doubling, as we consider the probability of two independent losses in the two copies of the same parental chromosome after WGD to be negligible(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="P49">For this analysis, we focused on 158 regions from 92 tumours showing WGD. Due to the lack of reliable copy number jump and junction information, we did not perform timing analysis for breakpoints in haploid or diploid regions (total copy number of 1, or major and minor allele copy number values of 1), and breakpoints mapping to copy number segments less than 100bp in length.</p><p id="P50">AF, CN jump and CN junction information for each breakpoint were scored as follows: <list list-type="bullet" id="L4"><list-item><p id="P51">AF score (AF_score). We computed AF values for all breakpoints in each chromosome and assigned AF scores as follows: AF_score=1: breakpoints with an AF value above the 50th percentile; AF_score=2: breakpoints with an AF value between the 25th and the 50th percentiles; and AF_score=3: breakpoints with an AF value below the 25th percentile.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P52">Copy number jump scores (CN_jump_score). We assigned a CN_jump_score of 1 to breakpoints with CN jump values of 0, and a CN_jump_score of 0 otherwise.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P53">Copy number junction scores (CN_junction_score). CN_junction_scores were assigned on the basis that breakpoints occurring prior to WGD would be present in all copies of the affected allele. Thus, we assigned a CN_junction_score of 1 to breakpoints with a multiplicity equal to the major allele copy number (i.e., the number of copies of the most amplified allele). We assigned a CN_junction_score of 2 to breakpoints with a multiplicity at least two thirds the major allele copy number, a CN_junction_score of 3 to breakpoints with a multiplicity of at least one third but less than two thirds of the major allele copy number, and a CN_junction_score of 4 to breakpoints with a multiplicity less than a third of the major allele copy number.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="P54">The final timing score was calculated as the sum of the AF, copy number jump, and copy number junction scores. Thus, the timing score has a minimum and a maximum value of 3 and 9, respectively. Manual inspection of canonical chromothripsis events with clear evidence of occurring before or after WGD was used to set thresholds for likelihood of breakpoints occurring before and after WGD (see examples in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S30</xref>). Breakpoints with a total score ≤4 were classified as pre-WGD, and as post-WGD otherwise.</p><p id="P55">Next, we assessed the timing of CGR-associated breakpoints on a per chromosome arm basis. First, we considered a chromosome arm to be rearranged by a CGR before WGD when at least 50% of the breakpoints mapping to the CGR had a timing score of 3 or 4. Because chromosome arms are sometimes rearranged by multiple mechanisms throughout tumour evolution (e.g., LTA followed by WGD and chromothripsis), we considered chromosome arms to have a pre-WGD component when 5 or more CGR-associated breakpoints had timing scores ≤4.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Phylogenetic analysis using short-read whole-genome sequencing data</title><p id="P56">We constructed a binary matrix for each tumour with rows indexed by somatic SNVs or SVs, and columns by tumour regions such that the <italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic> entry in each matrix was set to one if mutation <italic>i</italic> was present in region <italic>j</italic>, and to zero otherwise.

The most representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) block was selected for each case. For each case, 50 μm scrolls were cut and deparaffinized by xylene, then rehydrated with ethanol and water. Samples were then dissociated into single nuclear suspensions using Proteinase from <italic>Bacillus licheniformis</italic> (Sigma-Aldrich P5380). Nuclear suspensions were filtered through 40 μm filters and resuspended in FACS buffer with 2 μM EDTA. Nuclear density (nuclei/mL) was estimated for each sample by haemocytometry, and samples were standardised to approximately 2,000,000 nuclei/mL. Samples were stained with DAPI (Thermo Scientific 62247) at a concentration of 1:1000 and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1h. Stained samples were run through the Fortessa A flow cytometer (BD Fortessa X20), using a wavelength of V450/50. Events were gated using forward scatter and side scatter to exclude doublets and debris. Prior to the tumour samples being processed, an external control sample (normal adult kidney) was run to obtain the approximate mean DAPI fluorescence intensity of a diploid population. To calculate tumour ploidy, the mean DAPI fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the background diploid cell population was taken as the MFI representing the ploidy of a diploid cell (MFI-2n). The MFI of the largest, discrete tumour subclone was taken as the tumour MFI(MFI-t). Ploidy was then calculated as 2(MFI-t/MFI-2n).</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>DNA extraction and processing for nanopore sequencing</title><p id="P59">Tumour genomic DNA was extracted from fresh-frozen tissue with the Nanobind tissue kit (Circulomics NB-900-701-01, now PacBio SKU 102-302-100) and Germline DNA from blood with the Nanobind CBB kit (Circulomics NB-900-001-01, now PacBio SKU 102-301-900). After extraction, the genomic DNA (gDNA) was homogenised by 3-10 passes of needle shearing (26G) and 1h of incubation at 50°C. All samples were quantified on a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen, Q33226) with the Qubit BR dsDNA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q32853) and manual volume checks were performed.
