Aberrant response of endometrial cells to hormones is associated with multiple disorders, including endometriosis. Previous single-cell studies of the endometrium profiled a limited number of donors and lacked consensus in defining cell types and states. Here, we introduce the Human Endometrial Cell Atlas (HECA), a high-resolution single-cell reference atlas, combining published and newly generated single-cell transcriptomics datasets of endometrial biopsies of women with and without endometriosis. The HECA assigned consensus cell types and states, and uncovered novel ones, which we mapped in situ using spatial transcriptomics. We quantified how coordinated interactions between cell states in space and time contribute to endometrial regeneration and differentiation. In the continuously changing <italic>functionalis</italic> layer, we identified an intricate coordination of TGFβ signalling between stromal and epithelial cells, likely crucial for cell differentiation. In the <italic>basalis</italic> layer, we defined signalling between fibroblasts and a new epithelial cell population expressing epithelial stem/progenitor markers, suggesting their role in endometrial regeneration. Additionally, integrating the HECA single-cell data with genome-wide association study data and comparing endometrial samples from women with and without endometriosis, we pinpointed subsets of decidualised stromal cells and macrophages as the most dysregulated cell states in endometriosis. Overall, the HECA is an invaluable resource for studying endometrial physiology, investigating endometrial disorders, and guiding the creation of endometrial microphysiological <italic>in vitro</italic> systems.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Human reproduction depends on the endometrium, the inner mucosal lining of the uterus. It prepares an optimal environment for embryo implantation and supports pregnancy if implantation is successful. In the absence of a pregnancy, the endometrium sheds each month during menstruation. Morphologically, the endometrium is composed of two layers: the ever-changing <italic>functionalis</italic> (adjacent to the uterine cavity) and the relatively constant <italic>basalis</italic> (adjacent to the myometrium). In response to ovarian steroid hormones, the <italic>functionalis</italic> undergoes repeated cycles of shedding and repair without scarring, extensive growth and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">At the cellular level, the endometrium has a heterogeneous architecture. The endometrial epithelium consists of a horizontally interconnected network of <italic>basalis</italic> glands <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> contiguous with coiled <italic>functionalis</italic> glands extending vertically towards the uterine cavity, where a layer of <italic>functionalis</italic> luminal cells lines the endometrial surface. The <italic>basalis</italic> glands harbour epithelial stem/progenitor cells needed to regenerate the <italic>functionalis</italic> layer after menstruation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The <italic>functionalis</italic> epithelium provides a site for embryo implantation, and produces secretions to nourish it. Stromal, fibroblast, perivascular and endothelial cells provide support and structural integrity, including rich vasculature within the tissue. An array of immune cells play crucial roles in endometrial shedding and repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, as well as embryo implantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Cell-cell communication between the endometrial cells is key in maintaining tissue homeostasis and menstrual cycle progression.</p><p id="P5">During female reproductive years, the endometrium is highly heterogeneous, both inter- and intra-individually, and thus a large sample size is required to account for the dynamic changes it undergoes both in time (across the menstrual cycle) and space (across different tissue microenvironments). In recent years, several foundational studies atlasing the cellular composition of the human endometrium in health and pathologies with single cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and spatial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> technologies have been published. However, these cell censuses have so far profiled a limited number of samples, lacked even coverage of the menstrual cycle phases, and lacked consensus cell state annotation and reproducible marker gene signatures. In addition, they varied considerably in terms of clinical and phenotypic characterisation of the individuals from whom the samples were obtained. These factors have complicated comparisons across studies, with, for example, inconsistencies in the identification and naming of epithelial and stromal cell states. An integrated single-cell reference atlas of the human endometrium, encompassing the widest possible range of cell states and samples, is now warranted.</p><p id="P6">Endometrial heterogeneity is further increased by endometrial/uterine disorders which are highly prevalent globally. For example, abnormal menstrual bleeding affects up to a third of all women in their lives, ∼417,000 new cases of endometrial cancer are diagnosed yearly, and ∼190 million women world-wide suffer from endometriosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In endometriosis, endometrial-like cells grow outside of the uterus (i.e. ectopically), and are associated with debilitating chronic pain and subfertility that can have a substantial negative impact on quality of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Conflicting evidence exists about whether and to what extent the endometrium itself (i.e. the eutopic endometrium) differs between those with and without endometriosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Recently, single-cell studies analysing small sample sizes, reported dysregulation of the stromal and immune compartments in the endometrium of women with endometriosis to various degrees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Larger sample sets are now needed if we are to unpick whether and how the endometrium differs in those with and without the condition. In this context, well-annotated reference cell atlases can provide invaluable insights.</p><p id="P7">Here, we assemble a consensus cell atlas of the endometrium, the Human Endometrial Cell Atlas (HECA), by harmonising the transcriptomic and donor metadata information of ∼626,000 cells and nuclei from previously published and newly generated datasets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.reproductivecellatlas.org/">https://www.reproductivecellatlas.org/</ext-link>). We identify new cell populations, including an epithelial <italic>CDH2+</italic> population in the <italic>basalis</italic> and distinct populations of <italic>functionalis</italic> epithelial and stromal cells characteristic of the early secretory phase. We describe the molecular signals likely mediating the spatiotemporal organisation and function of cellular niches throughout the menstrual cycle and provide a new interactive portal to visualise and query the predicted cell-cell communication. Finally, we use the HECA to give cellular context to genetic associations identified by the largest endometriosis genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. This analysis identifies macrophages and subsets of decidualised stromal cells as the endometrial cell types expressing the genes affected by the variants associated with endometriosis.</p><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Harmonised data to generate the HECA</title><p id="P8">To comprehensively define endometrial cell types and states and how they change across the menstrual cycle, we analysed a total of ∼626,000 high-quality cells and nuclei from 121 individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a-b</xref>). We started by creating a single-cell reference atlas, which we termed the HECA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). To create the HECA, we integrated six publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets (Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, Garcia-Alonso et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, Tan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, Lai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, Fonseca et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, Huang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>) with our newly generated dataset (termed Mareckova (cells) dataset) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Harmonisation of metadata across the studies and application of strict data quality control filters (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>) was essential for the integration. The final integrated HECA consisted of ∼314,000 high-quality cells from 7 datasets, of which ∼76,000 cells were newly profiled by us (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). It included a total of 63 individuals both with endometriosis (i.e cases) and without endometriosis (i.e. controls), with samples collected either during natural cycles or when taking exogenous hormones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b &amp; c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The majority of samples analysed were superficial biopsies of the endometrium, predominantly sampling the <italic>functionalis</italic> layer from living donors. Three samples from the uteri of donors who died of non-gynaecological causes contained full-thickness endometrium, encompassing both the <italic>functionalis</italic> and <italic>basalis</italic> layers, with attached subjacent myometrium.</p><p id="P9">We observed striking differences between the cellular composition of the integrated scRNA-seq datasets, with variable recovery of epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial and immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). Choice of tissue digestion protocol, sampling bias (technical variation), menstrual cycle stage and use of exogenous hormones (biological variation) could all be responsible for the differences observed (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The dataset-specific cellular proportions prompted us to generate an independent single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) dataset for 63 additional donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b &amp; d</xref>). The large number of individuals in this dataset allowed us to overcome the technical variation introduced when data are generated by different laboratories. We profiled ∼312,000 high-quality nuclei from snap-frozen samples of superficial endometrial biopsies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b &amp; d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), collected during natural cycles, when taking exogenous hormones, and included samples for donors with and without endometriosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Together, this dataset represents the largest set of human endometrial samples profiled at the single-cell/-nucleus transcriptomic level by a single laboratory so far. To align the cell state annotations across the scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq datasets, and determine the robustness of the HECA, we transferred cell states labels between datasets using machine learning tools (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). Out of the endometrial cells identified by scRNA-seq, the majority were validated in the nuclei dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2b-c</xref>).</p><p id="P10">As expected, the majority of the cell populations were of endometrial origin, but the atlas also contained populations exclusively present in the myometrium from the whole uterine samples (e.g. uterine smooth muscle cells (uSMCs) and myometrial perivascular cells (mPV)). In addition, we detected a small number of mesenchymal HOXA13+ and epithelial KRT5+ cells, which based on their marker gene expression were likely cervical cell contamination. This was supported by their transcriptomic similarity to cervical cells when we compared the HECA with a publicly available scRNA-seq dataset of the cervix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1e-i</xref>). We did not detect any endometriosis-specific cell state in neither the scRNA-seq nor snRNA-seq data, providing further evidence that at the cellular level of the endometrium, differences between controls and cases may be more subtle. However, additional cell states appeared in samples from donors taking exogenous hormones, indicating that exogenous hormones strongly impact the global transcriptome of epithelial cells, an observation supported by both data sources (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Altogether, we generated the most comprehensive reference atlas of the human endometrium (i.e. the HECA), which can now be used to map and contextualise newly processed samples and external datasets using the transfer learning framework scArches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. To facilitate this process, we prepared computational tutorials (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>) and provide the weights from the trained scANVI model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> of the HECA available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.reproductivecellatlas.org/">https://www.reproductivecellatlas.org/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Spatiotemporal complexity of the endometrial epithelium</title><p id="P12">The endometrial epithelium consists of a complex network of <italic>basalis</italic> glands, which house the stem/progenitor cells needed to regenerate the <italic>functionalis</italic> glands extending into the uterine cavity, lined by a layer of luminal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Here, we characterised, with fine granularity, the cell states forming the different regions of the endometrial epithelium across the proliferative and secretory phases of the menstrual cycle.</p><p id="P13">We identified a novel population, the SOX9 basalis (<italic>CDH2</italic>+) cells, that was not reported by previous single-cell transcriptomics atlases. These cells expressed markers described for endometrial epithelial stem/progenitor cells (<italic>SOX9, CDH2, AXIN2, ALDH1A1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Using spatial transcriptomics and single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridisation (smFISH) imaging, we mapped this population to the <italic>basalis</italic> glands region in full thickness endometrial biopsies from both proliferative and secretory phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b-c</xref>). Cell-cell interaction analyses indicated that the SOX9 basalis (<italic>CDH2+</italic>) population interacts with the fibroblast basalis (i.e. Fibroblast basalis <italic>C7</italic>+) population via the expression of <italic>CXCR4</italic> and <italic>CXCL12</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). The <italic>CXCL12/CXCR4</italic> axis is known to have a role in the maintenance of the stem cell niche in other tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, providing further evidence for the stem/progenitor nature of this cell subset.</p><p id="P14">The cellular composition of the <italic>functionalis</italic> glands showed highly dynamic changes across the proliferative and secretory phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). During the proliferative phase, we uncovered further heterogeneity within the known SOX9+ cell population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Specifically, we identified two SOX9+ subpopulations: SOX9 functionalis I and II, which we mapped to the functionalis glands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>). The SOX9 functionalis I population expressed <italic>CDH2</italic>, high levels of <italic>SOX9</italic> and was marked by the expression of <italic>PHLDA1</italic> and <italic>SLC7A11</italic>. The SOX9 functionalis II population exhibited lower expression of <italic>SOX9</italic>, was negative for <italic>CDH2</italic> and distinctly expressed <italic>KMO, IHH</italic> and <italic>EMID1</italic>. The luminal proliferative epithelium was defined by the presence of SOX9 luminal (<italic>LGR5</italic>+), pre-ciliated and ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>), as previously described by us<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. As expected, we also detected a larger proportion of cycling epithelial cells in the proliferative phase endometrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>).</p><p id="P15">During the secretory phase, the SOX9+ populations were markedly reduced as the endometrium underwent further differentiation in order to prepare a receptive environment for blastocyst implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). During the differentiation process, both the glandular and luminal epithelium undergo dramatic transcriptomic and morphological changes. Having a larger number of samples allowed us to further subdivide the secretory phase into early, early-mid, mid and late secretory phases and define the populations associated with these stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). For the first time, we uncovered the transcriptomic profiles of cells characteristic of the <italic>functionalis</italic> layer during the early secretory phase (i.e. the preGlandular and preLuminal populations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a &amp; e-f</xref>). These populations were transcriptomically similar to the previously described glandular and luminal populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, but appeared at earlier stages of the cycle and expressed markers not defined previously. For the preGlandular population these included <italic>OPRK1, SUFU, CBR3, HPRT1</italic>, and for the preLuminal population <italic>SULT1E1</italic> was the most specific marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Using spatial transcriptomics, we confidently mapped both populations to early, but not mid-secretory samples. Specifically, the preLuminal population mapped to the lumen and the preGlandular population to the <italic>functionalis</italic> glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4b</xref>). We further confirmed the preGlandular subset using smFISH imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The number of preGlandular and preLuminal cells decreased in the early-mid and mid-secretory phase samples, with the dominant cell states being the previously described glandular, luminal and ciliated populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). Lastly, analysing a single sample profiled from the late secretory phase, we observed the presence of a glandular secretory population that upregulated <italic>FGF7</italic>, a mitogen found to have a role in wound healing in other contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">We detected a previously described population of MUC5B epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> expressing <italic>MUC5B, TFF3, SAA1, BPIFB1</italic>.

We found that the eStromal MMPs population (characteristic of the menstrual phase) expressed integrins and cytokines (<italic>CCL5, RARRES2)</italic> which can bind their cognate receptors upregulated by uMs (<italic>CCR1, CCRL2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7a</xref>).

In this study, we present the HECA: the most comprehensive cellular atlas of the human endometrium assembled for individuals with/without endometriosis so far. The HECA provides a crucial step towards improving our understanding of endometrial cell heterogeneity in health and disease as it: (a) incorporates a large number of cells and individuals, (b) presents data-driven consensus cell annotation across multiple studies, (c) provides a platform for easy and rapid annotation of future scRNA-seq studies of the endometrium, and (d) enables the contextualisation of genetic association screens for endometrial/uterine disorders.</p><p id="P33">By comprehensively analysing ∼614,000 high-quality cells and nuclei from 121 individuals, we substantially surpassed the number of donors and cells profiled by the initial, pioneering endometrial single-cell studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.

Functional and single-cell studies that deeply characterise the seldomly sampled <italic>basalis</italic> layer of the endometrium (where these rare cells reside and are reported to be a heterogeneous population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>) are now warranted in a larger number of individuals.</p><p id="P34">The HECA provides the most granular endometrial cell state annotation to date, including their spatial location in situ. Such spatial mapping was crucial for inferring the regulation and function of these cells given the spatiotemporal complexity of the endometrium. We captured multiple novel transitory cell states (e.g. preLuminal, preGlandular, subsets of decidualised stromal cells) during the early/mid secretory phase - a period crucial for endometrial receptivity preparation in response to rising progesterone levels. A tightly regulated cellular response to the changing levels of oestrogen and progesterone is essential for menstrual cycle progression, maintenance of tissue homeostasis and fertility. Thus, the newly identified cell states could present promising targets for therapy in endometrial/uterine disorders that are characterised by the disruption of hormone-dependent downstream signalling and cellular responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P35">Additionally, local paracrine factors and cellular crosstalk are essential for menstrual cycle progression and we provided a detailed account (and an interactive platform) of the predicted in vivo cell-cell communication across the cycle. This is an important addition to the body of existing knowledge predominantly derived from in vitro cell cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. Of particular interest is how TGFβ activity is controlled by various epithelial and mesenchymal cell states in both space and time. TGFβ signalling is known to suppress the activity of matrix metalloproteinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>, which are key to initiating endometrial shedding. The observed reduction in TGFβ signalling during the mid-to late secretory phase could suggest a mechanism for preparing the endometrium for shedding, or embryo implantation, and requires further studies. Interestingly, the identification and detailed description of in vivo signalling pathways involved in menstrual cycle progression could be used to refine the media used for in vitro culture of endometrial cells. For example, endometrial organoids are cultured in media supplemented with TGFβ inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>, even when they are treated with hormones to mimic the menstrual cycle. Incorporating the spatial and temporal TGFβ signalling could help improve the physiological response and differentiation of these cells during the hormonal treatment, and thus eliminate some of the previously observed differences between in vivo and in vitro endometrial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P36">We also revealed a range of novel interactions by which uM may aid the process of scarless endometrial regeneration, supporting previous research that proposed a role for uM in this process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. The new interactions we found pinpoint uMs pivotal roles in enhancing wound healing, boosting cellular proliferation, modulating inflammation, and stimulating angiogenesis. We also discovered that uNK1, a subset of resident NK cells which we identified to increase in proportion during the secretory phase, also expressed some angiogenic molecules, although to a lesser degree than uMs. This suggests that uMs may take on a larger role than uNKs in endometrial regeneration and angiogenesis in the non-pregnant endometrium. Interestingly, interactions between uMs and stromal cells became more evident during menstruation, emphasising the crucial role that uMs play during this phase of the cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. Understanding how the disruption of these macrophage-stromal interactions contribute to widely common menstrual disorders (e.g. abnormal uterine bleeding) could pave new paths for the development of immunology-based treatment.</p><p id="P37">Lastly, we demonstrated the utility of HECA to give cellular context to a large-scale endometriosis GWAS meta-analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.

For example, some studies reported an increase in stromal cells in endometriosis cases, while others reported no changes. At the molecular level, our data indicated sustained WNT and dysregulated insulin signalling to be a feature of the dStromal early/mid populations in endometriosis cases. This is in line with previous observation of downregulation of <italic>IGF2</italic> and lack of WNT inhibition in the endometrium of women with endometriosis during the secretory phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. At the cellular level, we previously showed that inhibition of WNT signalling by stromal cells in response to progesterone is crucial in supporting the differentiation of glandular epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Our current findings suggest that this process may be disrupted in endometriosis. Yet, the observed differences were subtle (i.e. exhibited small fold changes between cases and controls), requiring further validation in a larger set of samples with detailed metadata and menstrual phase annotation. To dissect the molecular pathways and validate the involvement of WNT and insulin pathways in progesterone-mediated cellular responses could now be tested using 3D in vitro models of the endometrium encompassing both stromal and epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P38">The HECA is a key stepping stone towards the generation of a future pan-endometrial atlas encompassing endometrial cellular heterogeneity across the lifespan and in diseases. We envision a number of endometrial/uterine atlases will be generated in the coming years, and that the HECA will guide dataset integration, cell annotation and ensure reproducibility across studies. Incorporation of datasets profiling biopsies from late secretory, peri-menstrual, menstrual and generally more finely assigned menstrual cycle phases will enrich the atlas and further improve its quality. As the atlas grows both in the number of cells and individuals profiled, it will become possible to not only look at cellular variation, but also variation at the level of individuals and link genotype to phenotype. To do so, detailed and standardised phenotypic data about the individuals studied will need to be collected (e.g. BMI, race/ethnicity, fertility status, regularity of menstrual cycles) as these factors could influence the transcriptomic profile of endometrial cells and need to be evaluated.</p><p id="P39">In summary, the HECA is the first large-scale integrated reference atlas of the human endometrium, providing a conceptual framework upon which future studies can be built.

The analysis was performed on the scRNA-seq datasets, and we reported as differentially expressed genes with FDR &lt; 0.1.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS190619-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d8aAdIbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="S39" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Datasets are available from ArrayExpress (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress">www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress</ext-link>), with accession number pending.
