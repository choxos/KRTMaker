Genomic approaches like family studies or genome-wide association studies (GWASs) can help in this quest for causal processes by exposing genes that are mutated before disease onset. For finding causal processes, studying the genome, rather than the transcriptome or epigenome, is advantageous because the chronology from genomic variant to disease is unambiguous, providing a strong argument for causality. In theory, all we need to do after a genomic study is follow the thread from each gene to the biological process in which it is involved. We know from the genomic study that this process increased or reduced risk when it was altered by mutations in the gene, so modulating more forcefully the process with a drug may unlock a larger therapeutic benefit. In practice, the path from genomic variant to druggable process is far from straightforward.</p><p id="P3">Research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exemplifies well both the benefit and challenge of translating genomic studies into druggable biological processes. Family studies of early-onset AD in the 1990’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> identified causal mutations in amyloid precursor protein (<italic>APP</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, presenilin 1 (<italic>PSEN1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, and presenilin 2 (<italic>PSEN2</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Subsequent work demonstrated that amyloid beta (Aβ), a small peptide which forms aggregates in AD patients’ brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, was generated by cleavage of APP by γ-secretase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, of which the catalytic subunit is PSEN1 or PSEN2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Consequently, the field naturally converged on the amyloid hypothesis of AD, which posits that the disease is caused by toxic aggregates of Aβ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Today, antibodies against Aβ such as lecanemab show promise in slowing down disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. This story shows that, although a great challenge, genomic studies (family studies of early-onset AD) can be successfully translated into a causal process (Aβ aggregation) that is now targeted by disease-modifying drugs (lecanemab).</p><p id="P4">However, the beneficial effects from targeting Aβ aggregation currently remain modest despite substantial reductions in brain amyloid burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. To completely stop disease progression, anti-amyloid therapy will likely need to be combined with drugs modulating other processes that contribute to the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. GWASs have identified tens of genomic loci where sequence variation is associated with late-onset AD, offering an opportunity to discover new causal processes of AD that potentially go beyond the amyloid hypothesis. For example, analysis of cell types enriched for open chromatin at AD-associated loci pointed to a possible critical role of monocytes, macrophages, and microglia in AD progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Although GWASs are designed to generate new hypotheses, AD-associated loci have rarely been exploited to find new causal processes in an unbiased, systematic manner. Given the challenges inherent to linking genomic variants to causal biological events, new genomic associations are often first more narrowly interpreted in the context of the amyloid hypothesis. While this interpretation may be correct, it tends to create a self-fulfilling prophecy which leaves little room for the discovery of new causal processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">As AD is primarily a disease of the old age, research often focuses on patients or animal models after disease onset. However, this approach also hinders the discovery of new <italic>causal</italic> processes from genomic studies because it largely annuls the advantage of unambiguous chronology—since genomic variants were unambiguously present before disease onset, they must have modulated a process which contributed causally to disease initiation. In patients or animals after disease onset, many biological processes are disrupted, but only a small proportion may be genuinely causal for disease progression and therefore make suitable targets for disease-modifying therapies. For example, one may find that dopamine is lacking in the basal ganglia of patients and animal models of Parkinson’s disease. Treatment with levodopa, a dopamine precursor, temporarily relieves motor symptoms, but does not slow down disease progression, so dopamine deficiency was not in fact a causal process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Therefore, perhaps counterintuitively, studying the consequences of AD-associated mutations <italic>early</italic> in life seems more likely to identify processes that are genuinely causal to disease, as any disrupted process that is identified is less likely to be a secondary disease consequence.</p><p id="P6">In practice, how can we quickly follow the thread from a disease-associated gene to a (druggable) biological process in which it is involved? In this work, we describe a behavioural pharmacology approach to link genes associated with a disease to likely causal biological processes using zebrafish larvae. Our strategy predicts from the behavioural profile of knockout zebrafish the likely causal processes and potential compounds that rescue the phenotype. In previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, we introduced the use of zebrafish F0 knockouts to study complex traits such as behaviour. In this study, we demonstrate how the F0 knockout method renders this behavioural pharmacology approach fast and scalable to the parallel study of tens of disease-associated genes, rather than one at a time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. As genomic studies of AD can likely be further exploited to find causal processes, we used Alzheimer’s risk genes as a case study for our strategy. The strategy is not specific to any one disease or set of genes. In theory, any measurable change in behaviour could be used to predict the underlying causal pathways and small molecules that normalise this change.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Most Alzheimer’s risk genes are present in zebrafish and expressed early in development</title><p id="P7">GWASs point to small portions of the genome where variation in sequence is associated with variation in disease risk, but do not readily specify the genes whose altered function are responsible for this association. Therefore, as a starting point, we used a meta-analysis of GWASs on AD that found 37 significant loci and annotated each with the most likely causal gene using mainly statistical colocalisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. To add confidence to these calls, we cross-referenced these causal gene predictions with a transcription-wide association study and risk gene pre-mRNAs that undergo differential splicing in AD brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Finally, we added to our list the three genes which can cause early-onset AD when mutated: <italic>PSEN1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, <italic>PSEN2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup></italic>, and <italic>APP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup></italic>, yielding a list of 40 genes associated with AD risk (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Of these 40 Alzheimer’s risk genes, 30 (75%) had at least one annotated orthologue in the zebrafish genome (source: Ensembl). Of those, 17 had one orthologue (e.g. the only zebrafish orthologue of human <italic>SORL1</italic> was <italic>sorl1</italic>); 11 had two orthologues (e.g. the zebrafish orthologues of human <italic>APP</italic> were <italic>appa</italic> and <italic>appb</italic>); and 2 had more than two orthologues (e.g. the zebrafish orthologues of human <italic>MS4A6E</italic> included <italic>ms4a17a, ms4a17c.2, tmem176l</italic>, and more) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). A human gene often has two or more zebrafish orthologues because of a teleost-specific whole-genome duplication event around 340 million years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. There were no annotated orthologues for 10 Alzheimer’s risk genes, including <italic>TREM2.</italic></p><p id="P9">Next, we used a published single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of the developing zebrafish brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> to ask whether the orthologues of the Alzheimer’s risk genes were expressed in zebrafish embryos and larvae. Most of the genes (33/42) were detectable as early as 12 hours post-fertilisation (hpf) and remained expressed throughout development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). At 5 days post-fertilisation (dpf), 38 of the 42 orthologues (90%) were expressed.</p><p id="P10">From these observations, we selected seven high-confidence Alzheimer’s risk genes for further study in zebrafish; the orthologues of the three early-onset Alzheimer’s genes: <italic>psen1, psen2, appa/appb;</italic> and four genes associated with late-onset AD: <italic>apoea/apoeb, cd2ap, clu, sorl1</italic>. We chose <italic>APOE</italic> as it is the most well-known genetic risk factor for late-onset AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. <italic>CD2AP</italic>, <italic>CLU</italic>, and <italic>SORL1</italic> were chosen because non-coding variants within or near those genes are repeatedly found by GWASs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. At the <italic>CD2AP</italic> locus, <italic>CD2AP</italic> was highly likely to be the causal gene by colocalisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. At the <italic>CLU</italic> locus, both <italic>PTK2B</italic> and <italic>CLU</italic> were likely causal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, but differential splicing of <italic>CLU</italic> correlated with risk of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The top variant at the <italic>SORL1</italic> locus was within an intron of <italic>SORL1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup></italic>, but rare protein-coding variants in <italic>SORL1</italic> were likely causal for some early-onset AD patients through haploinsufficiency or deleterious effects on protein function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">For these selected Alzheimer’s risk genes, we more carefully examined their expression patterns in larval zebrafish. From the scRNA-seq dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, most of these genes were broadly expressed in the 5-dpf larva in different neuronal populations and other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">2</xref>). <italic>apoeb</italic> was highly expressed specifically in epidermis progenitors, Müller glia in the retina, and microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), as observed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

To confirm and extend these observations, we used in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to label mRNA in 6-dpf larvae. As we observed in the scRNA-seq data, most genes tested (<italic>appa</italic>, <italic>appb, psen1, psen2, apoea, cd2ap, sorl1</italic>) were broadly expressed throughout the 6-dpf brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 1–supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">4</xref>). <italic>apoeb</italic> expression was restricted to cells in the forebrain and optic tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">supplement 4b</xref>). Based on the scRNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) and literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, these cells are likely <italic>ccl34b.1</italic><sup>+</sup> amoeboid microglia derived from primitive myeloid precursors from the rostral blood island.

Contrary to the widespread expression found in the scRNA-seq dataset, <italic>clu</italic> expression was largely restricted to the diencephalic and myelencephalic choroid plexuses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 1–supplement 4d</xref>), confirming a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">In summary, around 75% of Alzheimer’s risk genes had at least one clear orthologue in zebrafish and most of these were expressed in the brain of 5–6-dpf zebrafish larvae, suggesting they play a role in early brain development or function.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The FramebyFrame R package for analysis of sleep/wake behaviour from high-throughput video-tracking data</title><p id="P13">The next stage in our behavioural pharmacology strategy is to measure sleep/wake behaviour of F0 knockout larvae for the genes under study. To uncover even subtle behavioural phenotypes caused by the loss of Alzheimer’s risk genes, we developed a high-throughput sleep/wake tracking assay for zebrafish larvae capable of analysing behaviour at the sub-second resolution over multiple days and nights. To achieve this, we combined previous sleep/wake analysis methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> with some aspects of the frame-by-frame analysis developed by Ghosh and Rihel (2020)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> into a single software tool, the FramebyFrame R package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame">github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame</ext-link>). We also designed a 3D-printed mesh-bottom plate that supports long-term (up to 8.5 days tested) tracking of larvae with minimal intervention by regulating the water level with a small pump and delivering paramecia for feeding through the mesh from the water bath below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The FramebyFrame package extracts and analyses 17 behavioural parameters from frame-by-frame Δ pixel data, which represent the number of pixels that changed intensity at each frame-to-frame transition. These parameters capture both behaviours that unfold over multiple minutes or hours, such as sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), and actions at smaller time scales (&lt; 1 sec), such as individual swimming bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The parameters are grouped into three categories: activity parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 2–supplement 1a</xref>), which describe the overall activity of each larva during a complete day or night; active bout parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 2–supplement 1b</xref>), which describe the structure of individual swimming bouts; and sleep parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>) such as sleep latency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 2–supplement 2d</xref>). In zebrafish larvae, sleep is defined as any period of inactivity (Δ pixel = 0) lasting longer than one minute, a definition based on increases in arousal threshold and homeostatic rebound following deprivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. This frame-by-frame analysis has several advantages over previous methods that analysed activity data at the one-minute resolution. First, individual swimming bouts could not be resolved by these methods as single bouts last ~0.2 sec on average. Second, the one-minute methods missed around one third of all sleep bouts because of how the Δ pixel data is binned in one-minute epochs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 2–supplement 2a</xref>). At the frame-by-frame resolution, the start and end frame of each sleep bout can be precisely determined, which also improves the measurement accuracy of sleep bout duration and sleep latency, the delay from lights-off to first sleep bout. For example, during a sample 10-hr night (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 2–supplement 2b</xref>), the frame-by-frame analysis detected 35 ± 14 more sleep bouts, longer average sleep bout lengths (+0.2 ± 0.2 min), and shorter sleep latencies (1.6 ± 2.3 min earlier), resulting in a 42% increase in total sleep time (+2.3 ± 0.4 hr). During the day, the FramebyFrame analysis also detected more sleep and more sleep bouts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 2–supplement 2c</xref>). Most behaviour plots included in this study were created using the FramebyFrame package in just a few commands from the raw frame-by-frame data.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>psen2</italic> knockouts sleep more during the day</title><p id="P15">Next, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate F0 knockouts for the zebrafish orthologues of the three genes that can cause early-onset AD when mutated in humans—<italic>psen1, psen2, appa/appb—</italic>and tested these mutants for behavioural and other phenotypes. We focused first on <italic>psen1</italic> and <italic>psen2</italic>.</p><p id="P16">Zebrafish Psen1 and Psen2 are highly similar to their human counterparts (~70% identical amino acid sequence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>), with the same critical amino acid at the four annotated active sites (two per presenilin). Mismatches between the human and zebrafish proteins were largely clustered into disordered domains, suggesting that the zebrafish presenilins have the same catalytic activity as in humans. The Cas9/guide RNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) used to generate F0 knockouts mutated virtually every copy of the genome at each of the three targeted sites. At each targeted locus of <italic>psen1</italic>, 99.0 ± 2.7% of reads were mutated and 78.6 ± 29.7% of all reads had a frameshift mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). At each targeted locus of <italic>psen2</italic>, 99.9 ± 0.1% reads were mutated and 82.0 ± 33.6% of all reads had a frameshift mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). As each gene is mutated at three loci, the biallelic knockout probability, that is, the probability of having at least one frameshift mutation on both alleles, cumulatively reached &gt; 98% (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://francoiskroll.shinyapps.io/frameshiftmodel/">francoiskroll.shinyapps.io/frameshiftmodel/</ext-link>), indicating that most <italic>psen1</italic> and <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout larvae were complete loss-of-function mutants.</p><p id="P17">In humans, PSEN1 or PSEN2 acts as the catalytic subunit of the γ-secretase protein complex, which is responsible for the cleavage of more than 90 substrates, such as Notch. It also performs the last cleavage of APP to release Aβ, which aggregates in the brains of patients with AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Do presenilins also cleave zebrafish Appa/Appb into Aβ?

In contrast, Aβ40 and Aβ42 were detectable in <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts, suggesting that most Aβ is generated by psen1 in zebrafish and that Psen2 alone cannot compensate. This result extends previous findings that Aβ production in zebrafish is blocked by the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> and matches closely observations in mice, in which loss of PSEN2 had no measurable effect on Aβ40/42 production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">In mice, knockout of <italic>Psen1</italic>, but not of <italic>Psen2</italic>, causes severe skeletal malformations and brain haemorrhages, likely because of impaired Notch signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Homozygous animals die within minutes after birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Morphologically, our <italic>psen1</italic> F0 knockout larvae developed normally (tested up to 16 dpf) and were indistinguishable from their wild-type siblings, as observed in a <italic>psen1</italic> stable knockout line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout larvae had a mild pigmentation defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 3–supplement 2a</xref>), which has been previously reported in a <italic>psen2</italic> stable knockout line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. This difference suggests a specific function of Psen2 in melanophores which cannot be fulfilled by Psen1.

We extracted the maximum Δ pixel value each larva reached during the startle response at lights off (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 3–supplement 2b</xref>). These vigorous swimming bouts can displace the whole larva in a tenth of a second, providing a measure of how many dark pixels are detectable for each larva. <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout larvae indeed displaced fewer pixels during the startle response than scrambled-injected controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 3–supplement 2c</xref>, clutch 1: <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts displaced 78 ± 10 pixels vs 82 ± 8 pixels for scrambled-injected controls, clutch 2: 71 ± 8 pixels vs 80 ± 8 pixels). We then downscaled the Δ pixel values of the scrambled-injected larvae proportionally to the ratio of the startle response means (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 3–supplement 2c,d</xref>), akin to artificially making the scrambled-injected larvae appear less dark.

Presumably, the same processes are disrupted in zebrafish <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts, and some caused the behavioural alterations we observed. Can we now follow the thread backwards and predict some of the biological processes in which Sorl1 is involved based on the behavioural profile of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts?</p><p id="P28">To predict disrupted biological processes from the <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout behavioural profile, we developed a behavioural pharmacology approach based on a database of 5,756 small molecule behavioural fingerprints (3,674 unique compounds) obtained in wild-type larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. First, we used information from the Therapeutic Target Database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> to annotate each compound with its indications (e.g. triprolidine is used to treat hay fever), targets (e.g. triprolidine targets the histamine H1 receptor), and the pathways it affects through its targets (e.g. triprolidine affects the “inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels”). Second, we converted the frame-by-frame behavioural fingerprint of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts to the one-minute format used by the database. We then compared the mean <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout fingerprint with each small molecule behavioural fingerprint, creating a ranked list from the small molecule fingerprint most similar to the <italic>sorl1</italic> fingerprint (SU6656: cosine similarity = 0.83) to the small molecule fingerprint most opposite to the <italic>sorl1</italic> fingerprint (flumazenil: cos = −0.80). Third, we tested using a custom permutation test whether specific indication, target, or pathway annotations were significantly enriched at the top and/or the bottom of the ranked list. More present among the small molecules most (anti-)correlating with the <italic>sorl1</italic> fingerprint were drugs used to treat depression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 5–supplement 1a</xref>, simulated p-value = 0.0129), targeting the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>, simulated p-value = 0.0112), and affecting the “serotonergic synapse” pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 5– supplement 1b</xref>, simulated p-value = 0.0003). Thus, <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout larvae behaved similarly to larvae treated with small molecules targeting serotonin signalling, suggesting that the loss of Sorl1 disrupted serotonin signalling.</p><p id="P29">If serotonin signalling is disrupted in <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts, they should react differently to serotonergic drugs than wild-type animals. To test this hypothesis, we treated <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts and controls with citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used to treat depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Citalopram binds the serotonin transporter SLC6A4, preventing the reuptake of serotonin from the synaptic cleft. At a low dose of citalopram (1 μM, added directly to the fish water), <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts and scrambled-injected controls reacted similarly, sleeping about 1.1 hr more during both day and night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). In contrast, at a higher dose of citalopram (10 μM) <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts had a stronger reaction than their control siblings. For example, sleep during the day increased 2.5× in <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts, while it only increased 2.2× in controls. The heightened sensitivity of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts to citalopram was also apparent when taking all parameters into account by measuring each larva’s Euclidean distance from the average H<sub>2</sub>O-treated sibling of same genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Indeed, 10 μM citalopram displaced the <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout larvae further from their behavioural baseline than it pushed controls from theirs. Thus, our behavioural pharmacology approach correctly predicted from behaviour alone that serotonin signalling was disrupted in <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts.</p><p id="P30">There are at least two ways <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts could be more sensitive to citalopram. First, compared to wild types, <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts could undergo a larger spike of serotonin in the synaptic cleft when reuptake is blocked. This may be because <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts synthesise more serotonin, either because they have more serotonergic neurons or a higher expression of the enzymes required to make serotonin, or because they produce less of the serotonin transporter, making them more sensitive to citalopram as a given dose would inhibit a larger proportion of the transporter than in wild-type animals. Second, <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts may be overly sensitive to serotonin itself because post-synaptic neurons have higher levels of serotonin receptors.</p><p id="P31">To distinguish between these two hypotheses, we used HCR to label serotonergic neurons by tagging mRNA coding for tryptophan hydroxylases (in zebrafish: <italic>tph1a, tph1b, tph2;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>), an enzyme required for the synthesis of serotonin, and serotonin transporters by tagging <italic>slc6a4a</italic> and <italic>slc6a4b</italic> mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 5–supplement 1c</xref>). We registered the brain stacks to a common atlas (Zebrafish Brain Browser) and segmented them into 168 anatomical regions. In each region with expression, we counted the number of positive voxels and measured the total signal intensity in each channel (channel 1: <italic>tph1a</italic> + <italic>tph1b</italic> + <italic>tph2;</italic> channel 2: <italic>slc6a4a</italic> + <italic>slc6a4b). sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts had slightly more (+2%) <italic>slc6a4a/b</italic> positive voxels than controls across regions, but this difference was not definite for any one region and not replicated when looking at total signal intensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 5–supplement 1d</xref>). <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts had on average 18% lower <italic>tph1a/1b/2</italic> signal intensities across regions, particularly in the hypothalamus (hypothalamus – caudal zone 1: –24%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e,f</xref>). Therefore, although we see small differences in the levels of serotonin transporters or synthesis enzymes, these were opposite to our hypotheses so do not readily explain the heightened sensitivity of <italic>sorl1</italic> to citalopram. Additionally, at least one study did not find changes in serotonin levels in the striatum of <italic>SORL1</italic> knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, and we did not find genes related to serotonin signalling to be differentially expressed in a bulk RNA-seq dataset of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout zebrafish brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>.

We ranked the 5,756 small molecule behavioural fingerprints in comparison with the mean <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout fingerprint and focused on compounds that generated the most opposite (anti-correlating) fingerprint when applied on wild-type larvae.

Tinidazole did not reduce the abnormally high day-time sleep characteristic of <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref> left). It rescued the swimming bout alterations (active bout parameters) during the day but not at night.

Fenoprofen performed worse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref> middle, 8/18 altered parameters rescued), rescuing some of the swimming bout alterations during the day but aggravating them at night. Furthermore, fenoprofen made <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae drowsier than they were during the day, causing sleep to increase further and activity to decrease. Strikingly, betamethasone completely resolved the excess day-time sleep without causing hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 6–supplement 1b</xref>). Betamethasone rescued most, but not all, of the swimming bout alterations during both the day and night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref> right, 14/18 altered parameters rescued). Betamethasone did cause a few side effects, likely by making <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae overly aroused at the start of the night, extending sleep latency and decreasing the slope in activity and the startle response.

Could disrupted sleep itself be a causal process in AD? AD patients often take longer to fall asleep, have higher sleep fragmentation, and spend sharply less time in NREM sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. Sleep disruption can be present before the onset of cognitive deficits. For example, very high sleep fragmentation in elderly people is associated with subsequent diagnosis of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Experiments on humans and animal models also point to disrupted sleep being a causal process in some cases. In healthy adults, one night of sleep deprivation was sufficient to cause a 25–30% increase in Aβ signal on PET scans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, a ~30% increase in CSF concentrations of Aβ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, and a ~50% increase in CSF concentrations of tau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. In wild-type rats and mice overexpressing mutated human <italic>APP</italic> and <italic>PSEN1</italic>, restricting sleep for 21 days increased Aβ deposits in the cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Conversely, pharmaceutically or chemogenetically consolidating sleep in AD mouse models for 1–2 months delayed Aβ plaque formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. Disrupted sleep is therefore likely to be a causal process in AD. Can it become a therapeutic target? An ongoing clinical trial (NCT04629547) is underway to test whether suvorexant, an orexin receptor antagonist that increases sleep, can reduce Aβ accumulation by consolidating sleep in older adults without dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. Our observation that disruption of genes associated with AD diagnosis after 65 years reduces sleep in 7-day zebrafish larvae suggest that disrupted sleep may be a common mechanism through which these genes exert an effect on risk. Impaired sleep early in life may be especially deleterious as it is likely essential for brain development: infants spend most of their time asleep during the first year of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. Incidentally, infants who are <italic>APOE ε4</italic> carriers show differences in grey matter volume and myelin content in multiple brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. Differences are also present in children 9–17 years old who carry the disease-causing <italic>PSEN1</italic> E280A mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. Future work should assess whether sleep is impaired in infants at higher genetic risk of AD and whether it is related to these structural differences.</p><p id="P37">Our behavioural pharmacology approach also predicted that loss of Sorl1 impaired serotonin signalling, which was confirmed by increased sensitivity of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts to citalopram. SORL1 acts as an adaptor protein between retromer and several cargo proteins, such as APP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>, GDNF receptor α1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, and glutamate receptor 1 (GLUA1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. Retromer is a large protein complex which ‘rescues’ proteins from endosomes, targeting them to recycling instead of lysosomal digestion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. By disrupting retromer function, mutations in SORL1 disrupt endosomal recycling, which appears as swelling of early endosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. As a result, APP remains in endosomes for longer, where it is more likely to be cleaved by β-secretase, the first step towards production of Aβ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. Similarly, retromer dysfunction also lowers the level of GLUA1 receptors on the neuron membrane, likely because endocytosed receptors are not recycled back to the membrane, which can result in both increased or decreased firing rates <italic>in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>.</italic> We speculate that some serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptors are also recycled via retromer and SORL1. Consequently, <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts would react differently to a large spike in serotonin (citalopram treatment) as they have different levels of 5-HT receptors on the synaptic membrane. In support for this idea, both 5-HT type 4 receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup> and SORL1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup> interact with sorting nexin 27, a subunit of retromer. Furthermore, the 5-HT receptor type 2 was also an enriched target for <italic>sorl1</italic> (simulated p-value = 0.046). Other observations are consistent with serotonin signalling being a causal process of AD. For example, treatment of an AD mouse model with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram caused a rapid decrease in Aβ concentrations in the ISF and eventually reduced amyloid plaque load. Additionally, humans treated with SSRIs within the past 5 years had significantly lower cortical amyloid plaque load on PET scans, suggesting a causal relationship<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. While much work remains to be done, SSRIs can generally be used continuously with no adverse effects, so modulating serotonin signalling may be an attractive approach to reduce Aβ levels for years before the onset of cognitive symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Limitations and future directions for predictive behavioural pharmacology</title><p id="P38">Currently, the hypotheses that our behavioural pharmacology approach can test are limited by the small molecule screen dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, which was biased towards specific themes and targets. For example, of 1,551 compounds with an annotated target, 60 (3.8%) target the dopamine D2 receptor but only 1 (0.06%) targets mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP1, 2, 3). Consequently, the approach presumably has high sensitivity for disruptions in dopamine signalling, while some hypotheses, such as impairment in mitochondrial coupling, are never formally tested. Broadly, this means that a negative (non-significant) result may not be meaningful if the biological process in question is underrepresented. Additionally, about 30% of the annotated compounds in the database have more than one target. While this is not necessarily an issue when the goal is to find any small molecule which rescues the phenotype, this lack of specificity likely blurs the signal from modulation of a specific target to effect on behaviour. For example, all five compounds which target the histamine H4 receptor also target the histamine H3 receptor, so if the H3 receptor is detected as significantly enriched, the H4 receptor is certain to be significant too, regardless of whether the H4 receptor is indeed specifically disrupted. To develop the biological process prediction, future work should focus on selecting specific agonists and antagonists for a set list of targets, such as the compound VUF-6002 to selectively target the histamine H4 receptor without also activating H3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P39">A way to improve the specificity of the approach is to enhance the resolution of the behaviour tracking so that targets which give similar but unique effects on behaviour can be distinguished. We introduced the FramebyFrame R package to enable analysis at sub-second resolution, but the original small molecule screen dataset was collected at the one-minute resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, so comparing a new behavioural profile to the small molecule database first involves losing resolution to make the fingerprints comparable. During a new small molecule screen, one could use SLEAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup> or DeepLabCut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup> to extract additional behavioural parameters from video recordings such as speed or position in the well. A faster and higher definition camera could be introduced to allow fine tracking of tail and eye movements. Exposing the larvae to various stimuli is also a way to increase the number of parameters while avoiding redundancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>. With more behavioural parameters, the prediction of therapeutics using behavioural pharmacology would also be more precise and the detection of possible behavioural side effects more thorough. Analytically, an improvement could be to represent larval behaviour as a sequence of movements, rather than parameter averages. For example, the Δ pixel time course from our experiments can be encoded as a sequence of bout types termed modules, themselves organised in motifs which are 2–20-module long<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Alternatively, behaviour could be represented as sequences of known types of swimming bouts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup> or automatically discovered ‘syllables’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>. In mouse, this sequence representation was better than a fingerprint one at differentiating similar compounds or even doses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>, so should also improve the predictive power of the behavioural pharmacology approach.</p><p id="P40">This leads to a thought experiment: assuming absolute resolution in behaviour tracking, does every knockout give a unique effect on behaviour? In other words, are there ~26,000 distinct knockout fingerprints or do multiple genes converge on a smaller set of possible fingerprints? How much resolution is required to distinguish every possible fingerprint?</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P41">In summary, we present a behavioural pharmacology approach which uses the sleep/wake behaviour of zebrafish larvae as a tool to translate genomic findings into druggable biological processes and candidate therapeutics.

More generally, it is crucial never to perform comparisons where treatment larvae (e.g. mutant, transgenic, drug-treated) are from one clutch and the control larvae are from another (i.e. controls are not siblings), as any difference discovered with such an experimental design could be caused by clutch-to-clutch variability.</p><p id="P63">At 5 dpf, individual larvae were transferred to the wells of 3D-printed mesh-bottom plates (see <italic>3D-printed 96-well mesh-bottom plate)</italic>, each sitting in the water bath of a ZebraBox (ViewPoint Behavior Technology).

From each well, the video-tracking software (ZebraLab, ViewPoint Behavior Technology) recorded the number of pixels that changed intensity between successive frames. To be counted, a pixel must have changed grey value above a sensitivity threshold, which was set at 20.

Therefore, a correction was then applied to extend each sleep bout 60 seconds in the past by switching the ~1,500 frames of <italic>false</italic> before each sleep bout start to <italic>true.</italic> The time spent asleep in 10-min epochs (~45,000 rows) was calculated by counting the number of <italic>true</italic> frames in each epoch and multiplying the counts by 1/frame rate (typically 1/25 frames per second), which was converted into minutes for the sleep trace. For example, if larva #3 had 10,000 out of 45,000 frames marked <italic>true</italic> (i.e. these frames are part of a sleep bout) from minute 20 to 30 of tracking, that represented <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>000</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>25</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>60</mml:mn><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>6.67</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> <italic>minutes asleep</italic> for that epoch.

Two additional parameters, startle response at sunset and sleep latency, were only defined for nights, for a total of 32 unique parameters (15 day parameters and 17 night parameters). Full days/nights during the experiment were: night0, day1, night1, day2, night2. Larvae were 5 dpf during night0, 6 dpf during day1/night1, 7 dpf during day2/night2, and the experiment was stopped in the morning of 8 dpf. Night0 (5 dpf) was excluded from the analysis as a habituation period; therefore, two day data points and two night data points were calculated for each larva and behavioural parameter. Definitions of the behavioural parameters can be found in the documentation of the FramebyFrame package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame">github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame</ext-link>).</p><p id="P77">To build the behavioural fingerprints, a z-score was calculated for each day/night, each larva, and each unique parameter. For example, to calculate the z-score for parameter active bout length of larva #5 for day1, we first calculated the mean and standard deviation of all active bout length data points for control larvae during day1. These were then used to calculate larva #5’s z-score as: <disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>day</mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P78">Where <italic>x</italic> was larva #5’s day1 data point, μ<sub><italic>con</italic></sub> was the mean of control day1 data points,σ<sub><italic>con</italic></sub> was the standard deviation of control day1 data points. The calculation was repeated for day2. The day1 and day2 z-scores were then averaged to produce a common day z-score for active bout length of larva #5. The process was repeated for each unique parameter, producing 32 z-scores for each larva, which we term each larva’s behavioural fingerprint. To draw the fingerprint plots (e.g. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. 3–supplement 1c</xref>), the mean and SEM of all z-scores were calculated for each unique parameter and group of larvae. By definition of the z-score, the mean z-score for the control larvae was always 0 and the SEM constant for each experiment (dependent on the number of control larvae), so the controls’ fingerprint was omitted from the plot.</p><p id="P79">In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, for each parameter, the mean and SEM of all z-scores from each clutch were calculated separately.

The limit of detection (LOD) for each Aβ species was the concentration of the most diluted standard in pg/mL. We calculated a sample-specific LOD by calculating the Aβ concentration (pg Aβ/μg total protein) that would have given exactly the LOD in pg/mL. For example, the LOD for Aβ40 was 39.79 pg/mL. Therefore, for a sample whose total protein content was 3788 μg/mL, Aβ40 concentration should have been 0.0105 pg Aβ40/g total protein to give exactly the LOD (39.79 pg/mL). Each data point represents the mean of the four technical replicates, except if both diluted replicates were below the sample-specific LOD, in which case the data point represents the mean of the two undiluted technical replicates. If one undiluted sample was below the LOD but not the other, we replaced the below-LOD measurement by the sample-specific LOD itself. If all four technical replicates (undiluted and diluted) were below the sample-specific LOD, the sample was marked with a cross in the plot.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Annotation of the Rihel et al., 2010 small molecule behavioural database</title><p id="P109">From the Rihel et al., 2010 small molecule zebrafish behavioural database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, we extracted the name of each compound tested and the 5,756 behavioural fingerprints, which are the mean z-score for each sleep/wake parameter (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref> for the one-minute parameters). The same compound could have alternate database names (e.g. “Dopamine hydrochloride” and “Dopamine HCl”), and could vary by its stereochemistry or salts (e.g. atropine sulfate vs. atropine methyl nitrate). Therefore, we first simplified as much as possible each compound name by removing various stereochemistry and salt information. This reduced the number of unique compound names from 5,149 to 4,731. We then used the webchem R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R114">114</xref></sup> to automatically search each name in the PubChem database and return the PubChem CID. CID could be retrieved automatically for 4,365 (92%) of the names. We manually searched the remaining 366 compound names, eventually leaving only 12 of 4,731 compound names without a CID. The final number of unique CIDs was 3,674.

We then ranked the 5,756 small molecule fingerprints from the most positive cosine (SU6656: cos = 0.83) to the most negative cosine (flumazenil: cos = −0.80).</p><p id="P112">At this stage, the general goal of the analysis is to detect whether compounds with a given annotation (indication, target, or KEGG pathway) are found more towards the top and/or bottom of the ranked list than expected by chance. For example, two cases suggest that inhibition of a pathway is what causes the knockout behavioural phenotype: all compounds <italic>inhibiting</italic> this pathway are found towards the top of the list (positive cosines); or all compounds <italic>activating</italic> this pathway are found towards the bottom of the list (negative cosines). The database may include both agonists and antagonists for a given pathway, so we also want to detect cases where compounds interacting with the pathway are found both towards the top <italic>and</italic> towards the bottom of the ranked list. Therefore, the null hypothesis for a given annotation is specifically that fingerprints with this annotation are found across the ranked list in a pattern that can be explained by chance, or that they are mostly found around the centre of the list (cos ~ 0 position).</p><p id="P113">In practice, we counted fingerprint positions starting at the centre (cos ~ 0 position) and counting in both directions. Namely, the fingerprint with the smallest positive cosine (6,7-dichloroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, cos = 0.0003) was position #1, then position #2 for the next smallest positive cosine, etc. We did not set negative positions, so the fingerprint with the smallest negative cosine (L-Histidine hydrochloride, cos = −0.0003) was also position #1, then position #2, etc. The fingerprint with the smallest positive cosine was not always at the centre of the list, as there could be more fingerprints with positive cosines than fingerprints with negative cosines, or vice-versa. In a case where there were more fingerprints with positive cosines, using these positions directly as ranks would have biased the analysis against detecting negative enrichment (i.e. more fingerprints towards the bottom of the list than expected by chance) as the random draws (see below) would have mostly picked fingerprints with large ranks on the positive-cosine side simply because there were more of them. We controlled for this by forcing ranks to be on the same range (same maximum rank) on either side of the list. Namely, we set the ranks of the fingerprints with positive cosines as: <disp-formula id="FD4"><mml:math id="M5"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1000</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P114">The same was done for the ranks of the fingerprints with negative cosines (i.e. no negative ranks). Using 1000 as the maximum rank was arbitrary; any number could have been used.</p><p id="P115">For example, there were 3,201 positive-cosine fingerprints for <italic>sorl1</italic>. Therefore, the rank of the fingerprint with the smallest positive cosine was 1 × 1000/3201 = #0.31; the next fingerprint was rank 2 × 1000/3201 = #0.62, etc., until the fingerprint with the largest positive cosine which had rank 3201 × 1000/3201 = #1000.00. On the opposite side, there were 2,555 negative-cosine fingerprints. Therefore, the rank of the fingerprint with the smallest negative cosine was 1 × 1000/2555 = #0.39; the next fingerprint was rank 2 × 1000/2555 = #0.78, etc., until the fingerprint with the largest negative cosine which had rank 2555 × 1000/2555 = #1000.00.</p><p id="P116">At this stage, we had a list of fingerprints from largest positive cosine to largest negative cosine, each with a rank representing its distance from the cosine ~ 0 position. We swapped each compound for its annotations, for example its target(s). If a compound had no annotated target (or indication or KEGG pathway), it was simply deleted without editing any of the ranks. If a compound had multiple annotated targets (or indications or KEGG pathways), all targets received the same rank. For example, aspirin had rank #874.36 (cos = −0.50) and two annotated targets: HMG-CoA reductase and Prostaglandin G/H synthase. Therefore, swapping aspirin for its targets generated two rows with the same rank #874.36. The same compound could appear multiple times in the list, in which case its targets (or indications or KEGG pathways) were simply repeated.</p><p id="P117">To measure enrichment of a given annotation towards the top and/or bottom of the list, we summed the ranks of all its instances. For example, the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) appeared 59 times in the list for <italic>sorl1</italic>. The sum of those 59 ranks was 34,958. Was this sum of ranks surprising or could it be explained by chance? To test this, we randomly drew 59 positions and measured the sum of ranks 100,000 times to generate a null distribution of sum of ranks (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). We counted how many random draws gave a larger sum of ranks than the observed sum of ranks (34,958) to calculate a simulated p-value. In the case of SLC6A4, 1,127 random draws gave a larger sum of ranks; therefore, the probability that a sum of ranks as high as 34,958 was obtained by chance was estimated at 1,127/100,000 = 0.01127, which we reported as the simulated p-value.</p><p id="P118">A simpler alternative for this analysis may be to sum absolute cosines directly, instead of ranks, as a measure of enrichment. In theory, this option would consider more directly how well the knockout fingerprint and the small molecule fingerprints match.</p></sec><sec id="S36"><title>Behavioural pharmacology from psen2 F0 knockout’s fingerprint</title><p id="P119">We measured the cosine similarity between the mean fingerprint of the two <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout clutches and each of the 5,756 small molecule fingerprints from the Rihel et al., 2010 database.

We searched within the ~100 fingerprints with the most negative cosines (range of cosines: −0.72–0.87) for compounds which Rihel et al., 2010 labelled as shortlisted because it affected one behavioural parameter with a large effect size and/or affected the same parameter in the same direction across the two days/nights.

The ranks of the fingerprints of drugs interacting with SLC6A4 (n = 59) were summed, giving sum of ranks = 34,958. To simulate a null distribution, 59 fingerprints were randomly drawn 100,000 times, generating a distribution of 100,000 random sum of ranks. Here, only 1,127 random draws gave a larger sum of ranks than the observed one, so the simulated p-value was p = 1,127/100,000 = 0.011 *.</p><p><bold>c</bold>, (top) Behavioural fingerprints of <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts and scrambled-injected siblings treated with 1 μM citalopram.
