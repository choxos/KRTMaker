Our analyses confirmed known TFs orchestrating M1 and M2 macrophage programs, unveiled key regulators, and demonstrated extensive enhancer rewiring. Integration with GWAS data further pinpointed the impact of specific TFs on a set of immune traits. Notably, inferred enhancers regulated by the STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 (ISGF3) complex were enriched for genetic variants associated with Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis, and their target genes included known drug targets. This highlights the potential of SUM-seq for dissecting molecular disease mechanisms.

Moreover, many diseases manifest through an imbalance of cellular differentiation, highlighting the importance of studying enhancer dynamics in the context of cellular differentiation. For example, many autoimmune diseases are characterized by an imbalance of pro- and anti-inflammatory immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, studying such disease mechanisms requires a technology that allows the joint analysis of enhancer and transcription factor (TF) dynamics along a differentiation time course at single-cell resolution.</p><p id="P4">Recent developments in scalability of single-cell omics technologies, specifically single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus (sn)ATAC-seq have revolutionized our understanding of the diversity of cell states and cellular responses to perturbations (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>). Particularly, multimodal profiling has enhanced our ability to unravel gene regulatory dynamics governing fundamental biological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, while scalability for individual modalities has become available (e.g., scifi-RNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, sci-RNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, dsci-ATAC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, sci-ATAC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>), the majority of current multiomic methods are limited in scalability, multiplexing capability, or cost effectiveness (e.g., 10x multiome, ISSAAC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>), with a handful providing scalability in terms of number of cells assayed (e.g., SHARE-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, Paired-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>), but at the expense of complexity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Here, we present SUM-seq (<bold>S</bold>ingle-cell <bold>U</bold>ltra-high-throughput <bold>M</bold>ultiomic sequencing): a cost effective and scalable sequencing technique for multiplexed multiomics profiling. SUM-seq enables simultaneous profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in single nuclei at ultra-high-throughput scale (up to millions of cells and hundreds of samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>). To this end, we refined the two-step combinatorial indexing approach, originally introduced by Datlinger et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> for snRNA-seq, tailoring it to the multiomic setup. In brief, accessible chromatin and nuclear mRNA first receive a sample-specific index by transposition and reverse transcription, respectively. Subsequently, a second index is introduced using a droplet-based microfluidic platform (e.g. 10x Chromium). The dual indexing allows overloading of microfluidic droplets while retaining the capacity to assign matched RNA- and ATAC-seq reads to the same individual cell.</p><p id="P6">We demonstrate the application of SUM-seq in two independent experimental setups, a species-mixing benchmarking experiment and a macrophage M1 and M2 polarization time course experiment, exemplifying its flexibility to accommodate complex experimental setups. We use both modalities to resolve temporal patterns of gene regulation, and integrate with genetic evidence to link regulatory networks to disease. Additionally, we validate the feasibility of decoupling sample collection from library generation, rendering the method well-suited for extensive atlas projects, time course experiments, and other experimental designs that involve prolonged sample collection periods.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Main</title><sec id="S3"><title>Overview of the SUM-seq method</title><p id="P7">SUM-seq is built upon the concept of a recently developed combinatorial fluidic indexing scRNA-seq approach, scifi-RNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and a low-throughput multiomic assay, ISSAAC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. SUM-seq has 5 key steps: In the first step, nuclei are isolated and fixed with glyoxal, then split into equal bulk aliquots in a multi-well format. In the second and third steps, unique sample indices (one per well) are introduced for the ATAC and RNA modalities. For ATAC, accessible genomic regions are indexed by Tn5 loaded with barcoded oligos. For RNA, the mRNA molecules are indexed with barcoded oligo-dT primers via reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <bold>detailed library structures in</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Figure 1a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In step four, samples are pooled for Tn5-based tagmentation of the cDNA-mRNA hybrids to introduce a primer binding site necessary for binding of the barcoded oligonucleotides in the microfluidic system. In step five, nuclei are overloaded onto the microfluidic system (e.g., 10x Chromium), facilitating the encapsulation of multiple nuclei in a single droplet. Within these droplets, fragments are barcoded with the microfluidic barcode, resulting in dual barcoding of fragments with both a sample index and a droplet barcode enabling downstream demultiplexing and assignment of sequencing reads to individual nuclei. This is followed by an initial amplification of both modalities after which the library is split into two equal proportions and subjected to modality-specific amplification. At this stage, a library index can be introduced to enable multiplexing libraries from independent experiments on the sequencer. snATAC and snRNA libraries are sequenced using standard Illumina sequencing primers. Additionally, we have developed a scalable and reproducible Snakemake pipeline for processing SUM-seq data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg/SUMseq">https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg/SUMseq</ext-link>; available upon publication), in which reads are assigned to sample indices and further demultiplexed to single-cell resolution by the droplet barcode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). From here, reads are mapped and a gene expression matrix and tile matrix are generated for RNA and ATAC, respectively. Modalities can be matched based on the assigned sample index-cell barcode combinations. The pipeline provides reproducibility, high scalability and flexibility for execution on any system (local, cluster, cloud). In brief, SUM-seq offers a user-friendly and rapid workflow for ultra-high-throughput single-cell multiomic sequencing that doesn’t require specialized instrumentation and is compatible with a widely available microfluidic platform.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>SUM-seq enables efficient and scalable single-cell multiomics analysis</title><p id="P8">To evaluate the performance of SUM-seq and the data quality, we performed SUM-seq on an equal mixture of human leukemia (K562) and mouse fibroblast (NIH-3T3) cell lines. For this species-mixing benchmarking experiment, we loaded 100,000 nuclei into a single channel of the 10x Chromium system which equates to ~7-fold overloading compared to the standard 10x workflow. To limit the sequencing requirements, we processed only 20 % (20,000 nuclei) of the generated microfluidic droplets for final library preparation. After combinatorial index demultiplexing, human and mouse reads were well-separated with a collision rate of 0.1 % (UMIs) and 3.8 % (ATAC fragments), resulting in 6,215 human cells and 7,607 mouse cells with data from both modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c,d</xref>). This translates to a ~70 % recovery rate of input loaded to the 10x Chromium system and represents a ~7-fold increase in throughput at low collision rates compared to the standard 10x workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Figure 1d</xref>). Key performance metrics of snRNA (UMIs and genes per cell) and snATAC (fragments in peaks per cell, TSS enrichment score, fragment size distribution) were consistently of very high quality for both modalities in SUM-seq and outperformed other high-throughput assays for scRNA, snATAC, and multiomic approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figure 2c-g</xref>). Notably, there was no reduction in data quality for nuclei in overloaded droplets compared to droplets containing a single nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). Lastly, the aggregate of snRNA and snATAC data resembled the published bulk RNA-seq and ATAC-seq in the K562 benchmarks from ENCODE data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>; GSE86660<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> (RNA), GSE170214<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> (ATAC)).</p><p id="P9">During protocol optimization, we evaluated the effects of three factors on data quality: I) adding polyethylene glycol (PEG), II) methods to mitigate barcode hopping, and III) freezing of samples. (I) We found that, consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, the addition of 12 % PEG to the reverse transcription reaction increased the number of UMIs and genes detected per cell (~2.5- and ~2-fold, respectively) with minor impact on the quality metrics of the ATAC modality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figure 2h,i</xref>). (II) We observed that barcode hopping can occur within multinucleated droplets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, primarily affecting the ATAC modality. However, we were able to mitigate it by using two complementary strategies: adding a blocking oligonucleotide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> in excess to the droplet barcoding step and reducing the number of linear amplification cycles during droplet barcoding from twelve to four (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figure 2a</xref>). (III) To assess the suitability of SUM-seq for asynchronous sample collection (e.g. time course data or clinical samples), we tested glycerol-based cryopreservation following glyoxal fixation and found that it had minimal impact on the performance metrics of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figure 2j</xref>). Thus, SUM-seq can be employed for gathering, fixing, and cryopreserving samples prior to library construction, which enables multiplexing samples in one experiment and thereby reducing costs and batch effects.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>SUM-seq recapitulates regulatory dynamics during M1/M2 macrophage polarization</title><p id="P10">SUM-seq is a suitable method for unraveling gene regulatory networks during cellular differentiation. As a model system for cellular polarization, we used macrophages, innate immune cells that can polarize towards a pro-inflammatory M1 or an anti-inflammatory M2 state depending on microenvironmental signaling. Despite the inherent complexity and heterogeneity observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, the M1/2 dichotomy serves as a useful framework for elucidating major transcriptional events and regulatory elements governing macrophage polarization. Previous research has determined TFs including STAT1, IRF5, and NF-κB as key factors involved in M1 polarization, and STAT6, PPARγ, and IRF4 in M2 polarization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. However, the complex regulatory networks orchestrating macrophage polarization over time remain elusive.</p><p id="P11">To unravel these intricate regulatory networks, we applied SUM-seq to profile hiPSC-derived macrophages across a polarization time course from the naive M0-state to the M1- and M2-states. We stimulated the M0 macrophages with LPS and IFN-γ to induce M1 polarization or IL-4 to induce M2 polarization. To discern early and sustained responses at chromatin accessibility and gene expression levels, we collected samples at five time points along the two polarization trajectories; prior to stimulation (M0) and at 1-hour, 6-hour, 10-hour, and 24-hour intervals, each sampled in duplicates totaling 18 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Leveraging the overloading capacity of SUM-seq, we loaded 150,000 nuclei into a single microfluidic channel of the 10x Chromium system, resulting in multiomic data from 51,750 high-quality nuclei evenly distributed across samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 3</xref>). For the snATAC, nuclei passing the QC filters (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) exhibited an average of 11,900 unique fragments, a TSS score of 8, and 40 % of reads in peaks. For the snRNA-seq readout, nuclei displayed on average 407 UMIs and 342 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 3a-c</xref>). The lower average UMI and gene counts per nucleus in the macrophage experiment, in comparison to the mixed-species experiment, are a consequence of the omission of PEG during reverse transcription due to a technical issue (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). However, the high number of nuclei that passed the quality filter enabled effective downstream analyses.</p><p id="P12">After preprocessing the data (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>), we obtained a joint visualization of the two modalities by constructing a weighted nearest-neighbor (WNN) graph, which was further used to determine a uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). The resulting UMAP separated cells along the M1 and M2 polarization trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). By calculating M1 and M2 scores from the expression of literature-based marker genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>), and mapping them onto the UMAP, we observed increased M1 and M2 scores during the respective polarization trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>), confirming the validity of our experimental setup. M2 cells were not clearly distinguished from the M0 state and underwent only gradual changes throughout the time course. In contrast, during M1 polarization, we observed a clear separation of cells from the M0 state, with a substantial shift between the 1-hour and 6-hour time points. This separation of cells from different timepoints along the M1 and M2 trajectories underscores the capacity of our system to effectively capture distinct early and late polarization stages.</p><p id="P13">To delineate the key features that influence gene expression and chromatin accessibility during macrophage M1/M2 polarization, we performed Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> to establish a shared low-dimensional representation for the snATAC- and snRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 3d,e</xref>). Investigating the association of the MOFA factors with metadata, we pinpointed three factors associated with M1 polarization, explaining the early response (Factor 4), sustained response (Factor 1), and late response (Factor 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 3d</xref>). Notably, the early response was predominantly driven by chromatin accessibility, while the sustained and late responses were influenced by both gene expression and chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 3d</xref>). For M2 polarization, we identified an early response (Factor 7) and two distinct sustained response factors (Factors 3 and 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). For functional interpretation of the MOFA factor associated genes, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). Genes associated with the early M1 response were enriched in IFN-γ and cytokine signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>). IFN signaling was also enriched in genes associated with the sustained response (Factor 1), along with general immune system processes, IL-1 signaling, and metabolic terms, in line with metabolic reprogramming previously observed in M1 macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Genes associated with the M1 late response were predominantly enriched for terms related to antigen (cross-) presentation and RHO signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>). The early M2 polarization factor was enriched for IL-4 signaling, while the two M2 sustained factors were enriched in biological oxidation - likely signifying the switch in metabolism of M2 macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, and non-canonical NF-κB-signaling and Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>SUM-seq uncovers key TF motif activity dynamics along the M1/M2 polarization</title><p id="P14">Next, we investigated which TFs underlie the chromatin remodeling during M1 polarization. Using chromVAR, we quantified TF motif accessibility variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and use this as a proxy for the activity of a TF binding a particular motif (here referred to as TF motif activity). We selected the top 10 % most variable TF motifs and filtered for those enriched in peaksets associated with either the early, the sustained, or the late response of M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 4a</xref>), resulting in 103 unique TFs (139 motifs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).</p><p id="P15">When plotting the chromatin-based TF motif activity in cells from M0 and M1-1h along the early response (Factor 4) trajectory, we observed increasing motif activity for prototypical M1 TFs, such as STAT1 and IRF5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, followed by NF-κB (NFKB1, NFKB2, RELA, REL, TF65; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2h</xref>). Furthermore, we observed a transient upregulation of the AP-1 complex motifs (JUN, FOS, etc.), indicative of a cellular activation state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, the myeloid differentiation factors of the ETS family, including SPI1 (PU.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, were active in M0 macrophages and slightly decreased their activity upon polarization. To investigate the M1 response at later time points, we ordered all M1 cells along the sustained response factor (Factor 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2h</xref>). This revealed a switch-like increase in motif activity for many prototypical M1 TFs, including STATs and IRFs, such as IRF5. STAT1 can function as a homodimer (also called IFN-γ activated factor (GAF)) or can form, together with STAT2 and IRF9, the interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3) complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. STAT1 has two motifs in the HOCOMOCO database: one motif is bound by the STAT1 homodimer (STAT1.H12INVIVO.0.P.B), and the other motif (STAT1.H12INVIVO.1.P.B) is highly similar to the motif of STAT2. In the JASPAR database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, this second motif is classified as the interaction of STAT1 and STAT2. As such, herein, we refer to the second motif as the STAT1 heterodimer motif. Notably, we observed a steady drop in STAT1 homodimer motif activity over time, which coincided with a marked increase of its heterodimer motif activity as well as the motifs of STAT2 and IRF9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2h</xref>). These observations highlight the role of STAT1 homodimer in initiating chromatin remodeling in response to IFN-γ. Meanwhile, the sustained response to IFN-γ is maintained by partnering with STAT2 and IRF9 in the ISGF3 complex, the driver of type-I IFN response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Additional factors like AP-1 and ETS family members also exhibited switch-like activity patterns, increasing and decreasing with time, respectively. In contrast to the switch-like dynamic of the IRFs, STATs, AP-1 and ETS, the NFKB2 motif activity presented a more gradual increase along the M1 polarization. In the late response phase we observed only subtle changes in TF motif activity, including a slight increase in NFY motifs and a slight decrease in CEBP motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 4c</xref>). This pattern suggests that TF-driven gene regulation is stable between 6 and 24 hours of M1 polarization.</p><p id="P16">A similar analysis of TFs along the M2 polarization focused on 93 TFs (121 motifs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Overall, we observed less striking dynamics along the M2 polarization trajectories compared to the M1 response. The most notable pattern was observed for the IL-4-responsive STAT6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, which showed increasing motif activity along the early M2 response trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2i</xref>).

Some evident exceptions to this were STAT1, STAT3, NFKB1, NFKB2 and RELB. For NFKB1, we observed a slightly delayed expression of its regulon despite the gradual increase in NFKB1 motif activity from an early time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>).

After IFN-γ/LPS stimulation, we first observe increased activity for the STAT1 homodimer and other early response TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2h</xref>).

Specifically, we observed a marked shift in STAT1-mediated regulation, from its homodimer-driven chromatin remodeling during the early M1 polarization, to an ISGF3-driven response reflected in both accessibility and transcription at later time points.

The eGRN peaks were enriched for specific immune-related traits including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), two subtypes of IBD (ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD)), hayfever and multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>). Mapping the putative genome-wide SNPs (p &lt; 10<sup>-6</sup>) for the top heritability-enriched diseases and traits (p &lt; 0.1), we found 112 unique SNPs that directly overlap with the peaks in the eGRN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). For UC, the most significant overlapping SNP was rs153109, located in an intron of the Interleukin-27 (IL-27) gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 7b</xref>). This SNP has also been associated with CD and with IBD. These diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation of the digestive tract.

Although this subset consisted of only half as many peaks as the full eGRN (1673 vs. 3217), the enrichments for the autoimmune diseases remained significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>). This suggests that STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 play an important role in autoimmune diseases involving macrophages. Indeed, disease SNPs mapping specifically to the ISGF3 regulon resulted in prioritizing 19 genes for IBD, 16 for CD, and 37 for eosinophil counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>).

Another example bridging the M1 polarization and genetics is rs4810485, which overlaps with the ISGF3 regulon.

Specifically, we identified TFs that clearly act in a stepwise manner (i.e. STAT1), whereas others exhibited a continuous activation profile (i.e. NFKB1). We could recapitulate the hierarchy of STAT1 homodimer activity preceding STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 activity. A potential explanation for the delay in the activity of the NFKB regulon with respect to its motif activity is the previously reported observation that enhancers of NF-κB response genes are primed by NF-κB but their expression additionally requires activity of the IFN-I-induced ISGF3 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">Genes with genetic links to disease have been shown to be better drug targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.

For this, nuclei were resuspended in a glycerol-based buffer, layered on top of an additional 500 µl glycerol-based buffer and centrifuged at 800 x g for 15 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed twice with RSB-1%BSA and filtered through a 40 µM Flowmi cell strainer (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. BAH136800040). The nuclei were counted and loaded into the Chromium Controller (10x Genomics) according to 10x Genomics single-cell-ATAC standard protocol. 100,000 nuclei were loaded for the NIH-3T3/K562 species-mixing experiment and 150,000 for the macrophages experiment. In brief, nuclei in 1x Nuclei buffer (10x Genomics) were mixed with barcoding reagents (Barcoding Reagent B, Reducing Reagent B and Barcoding Enzyme). For the NIH-3T3/K562 species mix experiment, this reaction mix was supplemented with ~500 nM of a blocking oligonucleotide to prevent Tn5-barcode hopping in multinucleated droplets. In brief, barcode hopping may occur when residual barcoded Tn5 molecules, which contain the ATAC sample index, are carried over to the droplets. During droplet barcoding, these residual transposomes are disassembled, and barcoded oligonucleotides released. These oligonucleotides have complementarity to sequence on ATAC fragments downstream of the sample index, which can lead to fragment swapping within multinucleated droplets. To circumvent this, we employed two complementary strategies: first, we added a blocking oligonucleotide in excess to the droplet barcoding step with a 3’-inverted dT-end. These blocking oligonucleotides compete with the carry-over Tn5-barcodes for binding of ATAC fragments. Their 3’-inverted dT-modification prevents further amplification of these fragments, preserving the balance of ATAC and RNA fragments and the correct sample barcodes in the library. Second, we decreased the number of thermal amplification cycles during droplet barcoding from twelve to four. By reducing the number of linear amplification cycles, the probability of a carryover Tn5-barcode binding a fragment and erroneously barcoding and exponentially amplifying it decreases. For Chip loading, the standard 10x workflow was followed. In brief, 70 µl of the sample, 50 µl of Barcoding Gel Beads, 40 µl Partitioning Oil were loaded into the respective channels. After the Chromium run, the droplet emulsion was transferred to 10x verified PCR tubes (Eppendorf, catalog no. EP0030124359) and the cell barcoding reaction was run in the thermocycler as follows: 5 min at 72 °C, 30 seconds at 98 °C, 12 cycles (98 °C 10 seconds, 59 °C 30 seconds and 72 °C 1 min). In the NIH-3T3/K562 species mix experiment, the droplet emulsion was split into two fractions to test 12 versus 4 cycles of linear amplification, and 20 % of each fraction was further processed to limit the sequencing requirements. Sample cleanup was performed following the standard 10x Genomics protocol with minor modifications: 125 µl Recovery Reagent was added to sample and inverted 10-15 times. After brief centrifugation, 125 µl of the pink oil phase was discarded and the aqueous phase was mixed with a dynabead cleanup mastermix (182 µl Cleanup Buffer, 13 µl Dynabeads MyOne SILANE and 5 µl Reducing Agent B (10x Genomics)) and incubated for 10 min at RT. Samples were placed on a magnetic separator and washed 2 times with 80 % ethanol before eluting them in 42 µl of elution buffer. Finally, samples were subjected to a 1.4x SPRI cleanup (Beckman Coulter, catalog no. B23318).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Pre- and final library amplification</title><p id="P44">Following GEM generation, cell barcoding and cleanup, samples containing a mixture of single-cell ATAC and RNA libraries were resuspended in the pre-amplification mastermix containing 1x NEBNext HF 2x PCR Master Mix (NEB, catalog no.

The GAF-homodimer then translocates into the nucleus and binds the GAS motif, activating the expression of 8 downstream targets identified in our eGRN. As a secondary response, STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 undergo phosphorylation and activation, forming the ISGF3 complex. The ISGF3 complex binds the ISRE motif, potentially activating the expression of 1008 downstream genes identified in our eGRN. <bold>f</bold>, Identification of diseases and traits associated with genetic variants enriched in open regions of all GRN peaks and a highly connected regulon in the eGRN (the STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 - putative ISGF3 complex) using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC).
