We found that protein-coding genes positively selected in the CRISPR screens were enriched of miR-4787-3p putative targets. Amongst these identified key targets, we selected ARHGAP17, FOXO3A, and PDCD4 because are known tumour suppressors in cancer and experimentally validated the interaction of miR-4787-3p with their 3’UTRs. Our work illuminates the molecular mechanisms underpinning miR-4787-3p’s oncogenic role in BC.

Around 70-80% of early-diagnosed BC cases can be treated successfully. However, advanced-metastatic BC remains challenging, currently lacking a cure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Through analysis of gene expression signatures, BC has undergone systematic classification into well-defined molecular subtypes, namely Luminal A, Luminal B [both distinguished by the presence of the Estrogen receptor (ER)], HER2-enriched, and Basal-like. Each of these subtypes exhibits distinct molecular features, clinical characteristics, and therapeutic implications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Furthermore, an alternative classification method is based on immunohistochemistry profiles, wherein BC can be categorized according to the expression of specific biomarkers such as ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2. In cases where ER, PR, and HER2 are not detected, the subtype is referred to as triple-negative BC (TNBC).</p><p id="P6">Like many other malignancies, BC is characterized by a heterogeneous population of cancer cells. Within the tumour mass, a minor subset comprising of only a small fraction (0.1-1%) consists of tumour-initiating cells (TICs), which are also referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. TICs possess the unique ability to undergo self-renewal, leading to the generation of non-tumourigenic, proliferating progeny, as well as the capacity to initiate the formation of new tumous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Given their pivotal role, TICs are considered the driving force behind cancer progression and are implicated in conferring resistance to various therapeutic approaches. Consequently, strategies focused on targeting TICs hold significant promise in combating metastatic cancers and preventing disease recurrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. TICs can be studied by exploiting models based on three-dimensional (3D) culturing conditions and low plating densities to form clonal cultures of TIC-enriched tumourspheres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNA molecules, approximately 22 nucleotides in length, that play a pivotal role in the post-transcriptional control of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Their biogenesis initiates with the transcription of a primary miRNA (pri-miRNA). In the nucleus, the Microprocessor complex, composed of DROSHA and DGCR8, processes the pri-miRNA into a precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). Subsequently the pre-miRNA is cleaved by DICER1 in the cytoplasm to form the mature miRNA. Some miRNAs, however, can bypass the need for the Microprocessor or DICER1 in their biogenesis mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">They have emerged as key contributors to various human diseases, with significant implications for different aspects of cancer progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Through base-pair complementary interactions, they suppress the post-transcriptional expression of mRNA targets. However, each miRNA is predicted to target thousands of mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Given this extensive capacity for direct gene co-regulation, identifying which of these targets serves as the key effector impacting the phenotype controlled by the miRNAs becomes challenging.</p><p id="P10">The exploitation of miRNAs as therapeutic targets in tumours holds great promise, owing to all miRNAs being inherently targetable. Oncogenic miRNAs can be effectively and selectively suppressed using synthetic, complementary anti-miRNAs (anti-miRs), which interfere with their function, thus attenuating their detrimental effects on tumourigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Conversely, in the case of tumour suppressor miRNAs, their expression can be enhanced or re-established in tumour cells to restrain tumour growth and potentially reverse cancer-associated phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">The role of miRNAs in cancer, including BC, has primarily been elucidated through miRNA expression profiling studies conducted in cancerous versus normal samples, comparison of tumour stages or within cancer cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, this approach relies on the averaged expression levels of miRNAs, and thus, it may not fully uncover their functional significance. Consequently, crucial miRNAs that possess the ability to impact cancer vulnerabilities might be overlooked, especially when their expression levels remain unchanged under such conditions.</p><p id="P12">CRISPR pooled screens have allowed for uncovering pivotal cancer gene drivers, revolutionising our comprehension of the intricate mechanisms through which genes and pathways contribute to tumourigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, CRISPR screens have predominantly been carried out in 2D cell cultures, which often fail to fully capture the intricate complexities of tumour biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. To help address these limitations, recent studies have conducted screens in 3D cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. These investigations have demonstrated that screens exhibiting stronger effects in 3D cultures, as compared to 2D cultures, are enriched for genes that have been found to be mutated in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. This finding emphasizes the potential of CRISPR screens in 3D cultures as an ideal model for effectively identifying key players in cancer.</p><p id="P13">Importantly, despite their transformative impact, to date, CRISPR screens have not been exploited for identifying the miRNAs that exert influence on breast tumourigenesis. miRNA-focused CRISPR screens may unveil novel therapeutic targets and pivotal molecular pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">To discover the miRNA-dependent vulnerabilities in breast tumourigenesis, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR-CAS9 screens targeting genes and miRNAs in both ER+ and TNBC cancer cells, employing both 2D monolayer and 3D tumoursphere models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This approach allowed us to reveal the miRNAs and their critical targets controlling TIC viability in BC. By therapeutically addressing these critical miRNAs, we hold the potential to combat metastatic cancers and significantly reduce the risk of disease recurrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CRISPR-CAS9 screens in 3D tumourspheres versus 2D cultures identify miRNA-dependent vulnerabilities of breast TICs</title><p id="P15">Given that 3D tumourspheres are enriched with TICs, which are able to self-renew, and are known to play a pivotal role in tumour progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, we conducted simultaneous CRISPR-Cas9 screens in two BC cell lines under both 3D tumoursphere and 2D growth conditions to identify the miRNAs and their targets that affect tumoursphere growth. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). By using both culture types in the screens we could specifically identify factors that influence 3D breast tumoursphere growth. To ensure a comprehensive exploration across two BC subtypes, we utilised MCF7 cells, representing the luminal A subtype (ER+, PR+), and HCC1395 cells, which belong to the aggressive TNBC subtype (ER-, PR-, HER2-). For the screens, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) v2 library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. This library allows to systematically target a total of 19,052 genes and 1,864 miRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, enabling us to identify the miRNAs and their crucial target transcripts essential for breast tumourigenesis.</p><p id="P16">To perform this experiment, we first optimized 3D tumourspheres for large-scale culture necessary to conduct the screens. Next, we subjected the cells to lentiviral infection with the pooled GeCKO v2 library (MOI 0.3) and applied antibiotic selection, then split the screen into 2D/3D growth conditions and cultured for 4 weeks. After this step, we conducted next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyse the incorporation of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) into the genome. Subsequently, we utilised Model-Based Analysis of Genome Wide CRISPR-CAS9 Knockout (MAGeCK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> to analyse the NGS data. The screen performance was excellent with over 80% of the library mapped at time 0 (T0) and in the 2D or 3D samples that we left to grow for 4 weeks, in both cell lines. For ER+ MCF-7 cells, using MAGeCK analysis we identified negatively selected sgRNAs (FDR&lt;0.05 in 3D condition versus T0) targeting 235 protein coding genes (PCGs) with a negative 3D-2D ß-score cutoff of &lt; -0.4 and positively selected sgRNAs that target 17 PCGs with a positive 3D-2D ß-score of &gt; 0.4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Furthermore, for TNBC, HCC1395 cells, we identified negatively selected sgRNAs targeting 320 PCGs (FDR&lt;0.05 in 3D condition versus T0) with a negative 3D-2D ß-score &lt; -0.4 and positively selected sgRNAs targeting 24 PCGs with a positive 3D-2D ß-score &gt; 0.4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Supporting the validity of our CRISPR screens, the identified PCGs with 3D-2D ß-score &lt; -0.4 are known to be important for TIC expansion and stemness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S1</xref>). Accordingly with that, pathway enrichment analysis using EnrichR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> showed that in both MCF-7 and HCC1395, genes with negative 3D-2D ß-score were enriched for genes that have MYC interacting with their promoter in both mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) or BC cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S1a, d</xref>). Correspondingly, it is known that MYC controls a transcriptional program promoting self-renewal in both mESCs or BC cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore, genes with negative 3D-2D ß-score in MCF-7 where mostly enriched for regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathways, which has been shown to promote TICs expansion and tumour progression in BC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S1b and c</xref>). Interestingly, in HCC1395 there was a specific enrichment in PCGs involved in telomere maintenance and extension (Fig. 1Sf).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The screen identified selected miRNAs which KO produces large negative ß-scores in BC 3D cultures</title><p id="P17">Next, to capture essential miRNAs for 3D growth, we considered the miRNAs that have large and significant negative ß-scores in 3D culture in both MCF-7 and HCC1395 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). We selected the top 7 miRNAs per cell line that have the lowest negative ß-scores in 3D culture for the specific cell line, are successfully KO by more than 3 gRNAs after infection with the Gecko library and are expressed in the cell lines and in BC specimens. To evaluate miRNA expression in tumour specimens and cell lines, we used miRNA-seq data from the DIANA-miTED <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, the TCGA and the NCBI GEO databases (GSE100769) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">Those we observed with large negative ß-scores are acting as onco-miRs, meaning that in the 3D culture conditions they are normally acting to drive 3D growth. We decided to focus on this group as the endogenous miRNAs could be potentially and selectively targeted for therapeutic intervention. Most of those miRNAs (miR-4787, miR-1468, miR-130a, miR-4446, miR-1250, miR-127 and miR-301a) have negative 3D-2D ß-scores in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), indicating that they specifically affect tumoursphere growth and that they can be potentially used to target both ER+ and TNBC types. We also identified miRNA which are specifically essential for MCF-7 3D tumoursphere growth (miR-323a, miR-369, miR-30e and miR-483) or only for HCC1395 3D tumoursphere growth (miR-6501 and miR-627) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Validation of miRNA screen hits using inhibitors and measuring 3D versus 2D growth</title><p id="P19">In order to validate the hits, we tested the effect of miRNA inhibition on cells grown in monolayers (2D) and cells grown in 3D spheres for both cell lines. To this end, we first measured the abundance of the miRNAs in BC specimens and cell lines, and we specifically inhibited the most abundant miRNA arm of each miRNAs using ZEN modified 2′-<italic>O</italic>-methyl RNA steric blocking oligonucleotides to test their phenotypic effect in BC. Cells were transfected with the specific inhibitors every 4 days for 2 weeks following measurement of 2D or 3D growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-d</xref>). We observed small changes in the 2D growth phenotype but nothing of statistical significance. In contrast we did observe a significant decrease in 3D tumoursphere growth after targeting some of the miRNA hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). MiR-301a-3p, miR-483-3p, miR-1468-5p, miR-4787-3p significantly reduced tumoursphere growth in both MCF-7 and HCC1395. In contrast inhibition of miR-6501-5p and miR-627-5p significantly reduced tumoursphere growth in MCF-7 rather than HCC1395. Whereas inhibition of miR-4446-3p specifically reduced the formation of HCC1395 tumourspheres. Based on these results, we selected miR-301a-3p, miR-483-3p, miR-627-5p, miR-1468-5p, miR-4446-3p, miR-4787-3p and miR-6501-5p for further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>High expression of these miRNAs negatively correlates with BC patient survival</title><p id="P20">To evaluate the clinical significance of the selected miRNAs we first examined their expression values in BC in combination with survival clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancer.gov/tcga">https://www.cancer.gov/tcga</ext-link>) and the METABRIC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ega-archive.org/studies/EGAS00000000122">https://ega-archive.org/studies/EGAS00000000122</ext-link>) databases. Amongst selected miRNAs, they were all present in the TCGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-g</xref>), but only miR-301a and miR-627 were measured in the METABRIC study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2</xref>). Therefore, we could only test these two miRNAs from the METABRIC study. In summary, with the exception of miR-627, whose high expression correlates with a favourable prognosis, the expression levels of the other miRNAs serve as predictors of an unfavourable prognosis, which is in line with their oncogenic role predicted by our CRISPR screen.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of 6 miRNAs from the CRISPR signature is sufficient to separate BC molecular subtypes</title><p id="P21">Next, we used miRNA-seq data from the BC study from the TCGA database (TCGA-BRCA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-BRCA">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-BRCA</ext-link>) to evaluate the expression of those miRNAs in tumours versus matched normal samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). The expression of miR-301a, miR-4446, miR-4787 and miR-6501 was higher in cancers in comparison to normal samples (p&lt; 0.00001). In contrast, the expression of miR-1468 and miR-483 was lower in cancer compared to normal (p&lt; 0.00001), whereas the expression of miR-627 did not change between the two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). We then used unsupervised hierarchical clustering, based on the expression of all these miRNAs except from miR-627 [no change between cancer and normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>) nor a predictor of worse survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2b</xref>)], to assess whether the expression of these 6 miRNAs in BC (n=1149) was sufficient to detect the different BC molecular subtypes. We identified that they were able to separate Basal-like subtypes from Normal samples and ER+ BC, but could not distinguish HER2-enriched tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>). Interestingly, this miRNA signature identified a subgroup of Luminal A BC which clusters with Normal samples that could be classified as a distinct BC subtype. Next, we assessed the differential expression of these miRNAs in BC molecular subtypes. This analysis identified that the expression of those miRNAs in different molecular subtypes is variable and found that only miR-4787, miR-301a and miR-6501 are highly expressed in TIC-enriched Basal-like cancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>RNA-seq analysis on cells treated with miRNA inhibitors reveals repression of cell cycle and growth-related genes as a general mechanism of TICs expansion controlled by essential miRNAs</title><p id="P22">To investigate the mechanism of action of these miRNAs in BC, we subjected MCF-7 and HCC3519 tumourspheres to miRNA inhibitors targeting the most abundant miRNA arm (anti-miR-301a-3p, anti-miR-4787-3p, miR-1468-5p, miR-4446-3p, miR-483-3p and miR-6501-5p) or a scrambled control, followed by RNA-seq experiments. Using DESeq2, we identified differential gene expression resulting from the inhibition of each these miRNAs in tumourspheres from both BC subtypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3</xref>). Subsequent GSEA enrichment analysis unveiled the molecular pathways regulated by these miRNAs in both ERα+ and TNBC cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S4</xref>). The genes upregulated upon inhibition of these miRNAs were found to be associated with cell cycle activation and growth, specifically involving Myc targets, E2F targets, and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S4</xref>). These findings suggest a common mechanism wherein these miRNAs repress highly proliferating cancer cells, thereby promoting the growth of low-proliferating TICs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>miR-4787-3p is a DROSHA and DICER1-dependent TSS-miRNA that induces tumorigenesis by targeting genes associated with a positive 3D-2D β-score in CRISPR screens, including important tumour suppressors</title><p id="P23">We next focused on miR-4787-3p, as its role in BC had not been previously described. We conducted comprehensive miR-4787-3p target identification by data integration from the RNA-seq and the CRISPR screens following validation studies. Interestingly, miR-4787-3p maps closely and downstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) of the protein-coding gene DOCK3, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S5a</xref>). Therefore it can be considered as a TSS-miRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In line with the fact that miR-4787-3p originates from the DOCK3 transcript, the expression of miR-4787-3p and DOCK3 shows a positive correlation in BRCA specimens from the TCGA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S5b</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = 0.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2e-16). The biogenesis of miRNAs that map within the 5’UTR of protein-coding genes has been described to be independent from DROSHA and therefore from Microprocessor complex, but dependent on DICER1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. miR-4787-3p is expressed in MCF-7 or HCC3519 BC cell lines, but also in HCT116 and A549 that are colon and lung cancer cell lines respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S5c</xref>). To evaluate whether similarly to other TSS-miRNA the biogenesis of miR-4787-3p is Microprocessor independent but DICER1 dependent, we measured its expression in HCT116 cells that have been knockout (KO) for DROSHA or DICER1 through CRISPR/CAS9 editing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S5d</xref>). However, we observed that miR-4787-3p is not expressed in both DROSHA and DICER1 KO cells, indicating that this particular TSS-miRNA undergoes canonical miRNA maturation.</p><p id="P24">Next, considering that miRNAs act by repressing gene expression post-transcriptionally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, we used the RNA-seq experiments performed after inhibition of miR-4787-3p in MCF-7 or HCC1395 BC cells to identify <italic>in silico</italic> predicted miR-4787-3p targets by TargetScan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> that are up-regulated by miR-4787-3p silencing. This signature has a high probability to be enriched in direct miR-4787-3p targets. We then cross-examined the behaviour of those targets in the CRISPR screens when grown in 3D tumoursphere culture conditions. Therefore, we filtered the entire RNA-seq dataset from MCF-7 cells for hits that are putative targets of miR-4787-3p and showed a significant positive fold change (FDR&lt;0.05) after miR-4787-3p silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Furthermore, to identify the key targets that the miRNA represses for TIC formation through 3D tumourspheres, we selected hits that were also identified in the CRISPR 3D screens and showed a high positive ß-score. From that pool we then ranked the hits by RNA-seq log2FC and significance and CRISPR ß-score in the 3D conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a small but significant increase in expression for all the miR-4787-3p targets found in the CRISPR screen 3D condition compared to the 2D condition, with no significant increase in expression of a random gene list from the CRISPR screen 2D vs 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This indicates that miR-4787-3p targets tend to have a positive 3D-2D β-score and further confirming the importance of miR-4787-3p in promoting TIC formation and tumourigenesis.</p><p id="P25">The combined unbiased selection produced a final list of 18 significant targets. Querying these targets in the scientific literature and using the human protein atlas (proteinatlas.org) we found that a large majority (88%) were associated with cancer, with 61% specifically associated with BC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). We refined the list to a few top hits that has both BC and tumour suppressor association or that showed a positive prognosis when their expression is high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). From those we randomly selected 2 targets for further experimental validation: PKND and PDCD4.</p><p id="P26">Similarly, we combined the Gecko 3D screen and RNA-seq data for miR-4787-3p in HCC1395 cells. As before, we filtered the entire RNA-seq dataset for hits that are predicted targets of miR-4787-3p and showed a significant positive fold change after miR-4787-3p inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), then selected those hits that also were found in the Gecko 3D screen and produced a high positive ß-score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). We then ranked the hits by RNA-seq log2FC and significance or CRISPR screen ß-score in the 3D or 2D/3D conditions. Consistently with results from MCF-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), we observed a significant increase in all the miR-4787-3p targets found positive in the CRISPR screen 3D condition compared to the 2D condition, with no significant increase in a random list from the CRISPR screen 2D vs 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4g</xref>), reinforcing the importance of miR-4787-3p in promoting TIC formation and tumourigenesis in both ER+ and TNBC cell lines.</p><p id="P27">The selection process produced a final list of 22 significant targets. Querying these targets in the scientific literature and using the human protein atlas (proteinatlas.org) we found that a large majority (95%) were associated with cancer, with 36% specifically associated with BC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). We refined the list to top hits that has both cancer and tumour suppressor association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). From those we randomly selected 3 for further experimental validation: FOXO3A, BVES and ARHGAP17.</p><p id="P28">In order to test whether the final hits from the screen are indeed direct targets of miR-4787-3p we evaluated whether miR-4787-3p interacts with the target genes within their 3’ untranslated regions (3’-UTR) through the miR-4784-3p-mRNA seed complementarity predicted by TargetScan. To this end we transfected 3’-UTR reporter plasmids of the putative gene targets into MCF7 cells and performed luciferase activity assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5</xref>). When we co-transfected with an RNA mimic for miR-4787-3p we saw a reduction in luciferase activity for all target reporters, suggesting that the miRNA can indeed bind to the target site and inhibit the 3’-UTR. The reduction in activity was significant for: ARHGAP17, FOXO3 and PDCD4. The miR-4787-3p mimic had no significant effect on the luciferase activity of a GAPDH reporter and a random negative control reporter construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p id="P29">In contrast, a control mimic had no effect on any of the reporter constructs luciferase output, suggesting the effect is specific for miR-4787-3p. The inhibitory effect of the miR-4787-3p mimic could be abolished by co-treating with an inhibitor against miR-4787-3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), providing further evidence for a miR-4787-3p specific effect.</p><p id="P30">As a further control we produced mutated versions of the ARHGAP17, FOXO3A and PDCD4 reporters with the miR-4787-3p seed region mutated. Using these reporters, the miR-4787-3p mimic was now not able to impact on the luciferase signal reported, indicating that it is indeed binding to the miR-4787-3p seed sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">In this study, we conducted pooled CRISPR screens employing libraries of sgRNAs targeting a total of 19,052 genes and 1,864 miRNAs using cells grown in monolayers (2D) and cells forming tumourspheres in 3D. To our knowledge, this experimental setup has never been employed to identify miRNAs and their target transcripts crucial in tumourigenesis. We specifically focused on BC, utilising two BC cell lines, MCF7 and HCC1395, representative of two distinct BC subtypes: ER+ and TNBC. To identify essential miRNAs for tumoursphere growth, post the pooled CRISPR screen, we selected miRNAs exhibiting the lowest ß-score in the 3D culture condition. This analysis enabled the identification of a novel miRNA signature crucial for BC tumoursphere growth. In summary, further experimental validation led us to discover that miR-301a-3p, miR-483-3p, miR-1468-5p, and miR-4787-3p are indispensable for tumoursphere growth in both MCF-7 and HCC1395. Conversely, inhibiting miR-6501-5p and miR-627-5p was crucial for tumoursphere growth in MCF-7 but not in HCC1395. Notably, inhibiting miR-4446-3p specifically reduced the formation of HCC1395 tumourspheres. Interestingly, when integrating expression values of this miRNA signature with unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithms using the TCGA-BRCA dataset, we successfully differentiated Luminal A, B, and Basal BC subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>). Importantly, we identified miR-301a, miR-4787, miR-4446, and miR-6501 as predictors of poor prognosis (log-rank p &lt; 0.005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S2</xref>), suggesting their potential as prognostic biomarkers in BC. In line with our findings, high expression of miR-310a promotes breast tumourigenesis and predicts poor prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. It acts by inducing master regulators of self-renewal, tumourigenesis, and metastasis through the CPEB1/SIRT1/SOX2 axis and downregulating MEOX2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. However, miR-4446, miR-6501, and miR-4787 remain understudied in BC. miR-4446 is part of a miRNA signature predicting high-risk BC cases from liquid biopsies, while miR-6501 serves as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. miR-4787-3p, a less-studied miRNA in BC, has not previously been associated with the disease. To evaluate the role of miR-301a, miR-4787, miR-4446, miR-6501, miR-1468, and miR-483 in BC, we inhibited the expression of their predominant miRNA arm in BC specimens (miR-301a-3p, miR-483-3p, miR-627-5p, miR-1468-5p, miR-4446-3p, miR-4787-3p, and miR-6501-5p), alongside a scrambled control inhibitor, and conducted RNA-seq. Intriguingly, we observed that genes up-regulated following the inhibition of these miRNAs were predominantly involved in cell growth and proliferation, especially enriched in MYC or E2F targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S4</xref>). As we and others have indicated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, downregulation of genes crucial for cell growth can lead to the formation of low-proliferating TICs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. This suggests that miRNAs induce tumourigenesis by paradoxically repressing genes promoting cell proliferation and growth. Our subsequent focus on miR-4787-3p stems from its never-before-evaluated role in BC. We found significant up-regulation of this miRNA in BC versus healthy control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), particularly in basal-like BCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3</xref>), the most aggressive subtype and highly enriched in TICs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Interestingly, miR-4787-3p is situated within the 5’UTR region of the protein-coding gene DOCK3. It is known that pre-miRNAs mapping close to the TSS of host genes, like miR-4787-3p, are 7-methylguanosine (m7G) capped and processed by DICER1, but their maturation occurs independently from the Microprocessor complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Contrary to DICER1 processing of canonical pre-miRNAs, DICER1 cleavage of TSS-miRNA generates a single 3p-miRNA. However, our analysis by measuring miR-4787-3p in cells KO for DROSHA and DICER1 unveiled its dependence on both (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S5</xref>). Additionally, although pre-miR-4787-3p maps within the 5’UTR of DOCK3 is located 166 nucleotides from its TSS, suggesting that that length include enough nucleotide sequence of the 5’UTR to become a Microprocessor complex substrate. We then integrated RNA-seq data upon miR-4787-3p inhibition with the CRISPR screens conducted in both MCF-7 and HCC1395, along with a miRNA-target identification algorithm (TargetScan) to identify its crucial target transcripts. Our reasoning was that as miR-4787-3p is essential for tumoursphere formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), leading to a negative ß-score in the 3D tumoursphere screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), and as miRNAs act by post-transcriptional repression of direct targets, the upregulation of genes in RNA-seq following its inhibition with positive ß-scores in CRISPR screens would denote crucial target transcripts. Consistent with our hypothesis, the ß-score values of potential miR-4787-3p targets were significantly more positive than those of a random gene list, specifically in the 3D screens for both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c and 4g</xref>). Among these transcripts, we experimentally validated ARHGAP17, FOXO3A, and PDCD4 as significant direct targets of miR-4787-3p in BC tumourigenesis. ARHGAP17 is thought to have a Tumor Suppressive Role in Colon cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and Cervical cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. FOXO3A is a known tumour suppressor and has recently been shown to be antagonised by miRNAs in several cancer types, including in BC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. PDCD4 inhibits protein translation to suppress tumour progression and is often decreased in BC. Numerous regulators including non-coding RNAs control PDCD4 expression in BC. PDCD4 loss is responsible for drug resistance in BC. Modulating the microRNA/PDCD4 axis is suggested as a strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in BC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P32">In conclusion, our study underscores the critical role of miR-4787-3p in BC tumorigenesis, particularly in the aggressive basal-like subtype enriched in tumour-initiating cells (TICs). Targeting miR-4787-3p showed significant inhibition of tumoursphere formation, revealing its potential as a therapeutic target in BC. Moreover, our study suggests that elevated miR-4787-3p expression could serve as a prognostic biomarker for poor outcomes in BC patients. The validated targets of miR-4787-3p, such as ARHGAP17, FOXO3A, and PDCD4, shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying its oncogenic role in BC. Further investigations and clinical studies focusing on miR-4787-3p inhibition and its prognostic utility hold promise for improved therapeutic strategies and prognostic assessments in BC.”</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P33">BC cell lines MCF7 and HCC1395 were obtained from ATCC.
