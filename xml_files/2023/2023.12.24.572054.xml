When this process fails, it contributes to respiratory diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. While advances in single-cell transcriptomics have revealed the complexity of airway composition, much of what we know about how airway structure impacts clearance relies on animal studies. This limits our ability to create accurate human-based models of airway diseases. Here we show that the airways in female rats and in humans exhibit species-specific differences in the distribution of ciliated and secretory cells as well as in ciliary beat, resulting in significantly higher clearance effectiveness in humans. We further reveal that standard lab-grown cultures exhibit lower clearance effectiveness compared to human airways, and we identify the underlying structural differences. By combining diverse experiments and physics-based modeling, we establish universal benchmarks to assess human airway function, interpret preclinical models, and better understand disease-specific impairments in mucociliary clearance.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Mucociliary clearance (MCC) is a critical mechanical barrier mechanism of the human airways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In MCC, the beating of specialized multiciliated cells propel a layer of mucus across the epithelial surface, effectively trapping and removing inhaled particles and pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The mucus is produced by the submucosal glands and a variety of secretory cells interspersed among ciliated cells. These secretory cells include mucin-secreting goblet cells, club cells and their intermediate stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The composition of secretory cell types has a profound impact on the rheology and flowability of mucus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Failure of MCC contributes to the debilitating pathophysiology of many respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), primary ciliary dyskinesia, asthma, and cystic fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, our understanding of how diseases impair MCC remains limited by an incomplete knowledge of the mechanics that link secretory and ciliated cell organization to MCC in native human airway tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> since most <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> data has come from animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Obtaining data on live ciliary beat and clearance function in human tissue poses challenges and remains exceedingly rare in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the organization of secretory and ciliated cells at the epithelial surface is underexplored, as conventional histology typically reveals cross-sectional rather than surface-lining tissue architecture. While providing important insights about cellular heterogeneity, transcriptional profiling commonly does not resolve spatial organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and may not accurately reflect protein expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The lack of such crucial data limits not only our understanding and capability to model human MCC but may also undermine correct diagnosis and early intervention in disease. For instance, a recent study revealed that while luminal surface ciliation in the mouse trachea is relatively low (approximately 40%), the specific distribution and orientation of ciliary beat ensure robust and efficient particle clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, the authors could only speculate whether these design principles directly translate to humans, where such quantitative insights could help refine treatments for conditions impairing ciliary beat, such as PCD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, or causing loss of ciliated cells, such as asthma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The limited human-relevancy of animal studies has spurred the development of innovative <italic>in vitro</italic> human airway epithelial models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, without quantitative benchmarks of MCC in humans, the ability of these models to accurately represent human physiology remains unproven. Furthermore, the proportions of ciliated and various secretory cell types are believed to vary along the airway tree within and between humans and rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. It remains unclear whether this heterogeneity results in species-specific regional differences in MCC, which is pertinent for studying diseases that alter the regional proportions of airway epithelial cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">To address these gaps, we have established a quantitative map of the distribution of ciliated, club, and goblet cells along the surface lining of the human and rat airway tree. We have evaluated species-specific differences in the associated particle clearance and utilized these data to develop quantitative metrics and physics-based computational models capturing key MCC characteristics in lower airway epithelia. Finally, we deploy our comprehensive quantitative framework to benchmark the structural and functional properties of a variety of <italic>in vitro</italic> human airway epithelial culture conditions against native human airway epithelia. The data presented significantly enhances our understanding of MCC mechanics and, by providing means of MCC quantification and quality control, will improve the translational potential of <italic>in vitro</italic> models for studying diseases and therapeutic interventions affecting MCC.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Tracheo-bronchial ciliation is higher in human airways compared to rat</title><p id="P6">Live ciliary beat and particle clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> was measured in freshly isolated airway epithelial tissue originating from the ventral wall of the respiratory tree branching generation (BG)0 through BG6 derived from 4 human whole lungs with no prior history of chronic lung disease, and BG0 through BG5 from healthy rat whole lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>; for detailed donor information and numbers see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1 &amp; 2</xref>). The human BG6 samples were at, or below, 2 mm in diameter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) and therefore constituted the transition to small airway morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. While such a definition of small airways does not exist for rodents, our analysis covered a comparable fraction of the conducting airways along the proximal-distal axis in both systems (7 BGs of 16 BGs in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and 6 BGs of 14 BGs in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>). Subsequently, we quantified the luminal (i.e., surface-lining) cell type composition in these samples and, to increase donor numbers, in additional fixed human bronchial rings. Where unknown, their BG was estimated based on their diameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) using a calibration curve (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The percentage of cells at the mucosal surface expressing cell-specific markers was quantified using mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) to mark goblet cells, secretoglobin family 1A member (SCGB1A1) to label club cells, and acetylated alpha-tubulin (ATUB) to stain ciliated cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-c</xref>). Luminal cell boundaries were revealed by F-actin staining of the cytoskeleton, allowing us to segment the cell outlines using image processing and thereby determine total cell numbers in each field of view. By overlaying the signal of each marker onto the cell outlines, we computed the percentages of different cell types and their overlaps (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 2 &amp; 3</xref>). The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, for details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 3 &amp; 5</xref>. Intriguingly, human airways exhibited a robustly high ciliated cell proportion, or cilia coverage, of 86 ± 9% (mean±STD) across all analyzed BGs, whereas cilia coverage in rat airways gradually increased along the airway tree, ranging from 49 ± 12% in trachea to 92 ± 2.3% in BG5. Of note, the trachea in rat exhibited a pattern of alternating lower (ca. 30-40%) and higher (ca. 45 - 60%) ciliation levels, corresponding to cartilage rings and the interspersed tracheal ligaments, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. We did not observe such regular ciliation patterns in the human airways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). The dense luminal ciliation of the human airways contrasted with results obtained from classic histology or gene expression data, which, likely by including both luminal and subluminal cell populations in the analysis, have suggested a lower ciliation level of 30-50% in human trachea and increasing ciliation in higher BGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Our data hence suggest that surface ciliation cannot be easily predicted from bulk tissue percentages. On the other hand, our analysis of secretory cell levels matched trends reported in these studies. In all human BGs examined, 10-20% of luminal cells were positive for either MUC5AC, SCGB1A1, or both. Within this secretory cell population, the proportion of MUC5AC+ SCGB1A1- (goblet) and MUC5AC- SCGB1A1+ (club) cells varied as a function of BG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, inset). Goblet cells dominated the trachea-bronchial region whereas club cells became increasingly frequent in BG3 and higher. On average, 15 and 30% of the labeled secretory population were MUC5AC+ SCGB1A1+ (double-positive hybrid/transitionary) cells, consistent with transcriptional and histological studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> (for additional staining see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6A &amp; B</xref>). A comparable analysis was inconclusive for the rat secretory cells due to the spatially variable, but overall low (&lt;10%), abundance of cells positive for MUC5AC and/or SCGB1A1, which matches literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. As noted by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, there was spatial variability of secretory cell density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6C</xref>). Since rat airways are thought to contain a high abundance of so-called “serous” secretory cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> for which no protein markers have been reported, additional secretory cells could be present.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Human airways achieve greater clearance per ciliary beat than rat airways</title><p id="P7">The differences in cilia coverage between species suggested differences in particle clearance, which we proceeded to explore by measuring live ciliary beat and fluorescent bead transport in the densely ciliated human airways (BG0 to BG6) compared to the more sparsely ciliated rat airways (BG0 and BG1). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-b</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Videos S1 &amp; S2)</bold>. These regions correspond to the trachea, main stem bronchi, and bronchial regions in humans and rats. Matching cell type composition analysis, we sampled multiple fields of views along the ventral airway tube. As the human explant tissues had been submerged in buffer for many hours prior to live recordings, the naturally occurring periciliary liquid and mucus layers were likely diluted or removed. Hence, in order to enable a direct comparison of ciliary beat and clearance between human explants and other samples, we chose to gently wash all apical surfaces to remove any build-up of mucus, and to then image the samples submerged in aqueous buffer. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) recorded at room temperature was 2.6 ± 0.5 Hz in human tissue and 4.5 ± 1.3 Hz in rat tissue. Associated particle clearance speed reached 16.5 ± 8.2 µm s<sup>-1</sup> in humans and 4.8 ± 2.0 µm s<sup>-1</sup> in rats. Therefore, clearance speed was significantly higher in humans despite significantly lower CBF than in rat tissues. To assess this imbalance further, we derived the normalized “clearance speed per beat” (CPB) by dividing the average clearance speed by the average CBF for each field of view. CPB measures how far a particle is transported per ciliary beat cycle and has the units µm per beat. CPB can be considered a measure of stroke effectiveness and is independent of CBF. Our analysis revealed a significantly higher CPB in human tissue (6.2 ± 2.5 µm per beat) compared to rat tissue (1.1 ± 0.3 µm per beat) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We also investigated particle clearance directionality <italic>D</italic> as a function of distance <italic>R</italic>, defined as <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mo>〈</mml:mo><mml:mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mstyle><mml:mo>〉</mml:mo><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>〈</mml:mo><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mstyle><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mo>〉</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>,where ⟨⟩ indicates the mean, || indicates the magnitude, and v indicates flow velocity. <italic>D(R)</italic> ranges from 0 to 1, where a number near zero indicates highly convoluted flow and a number near 1 indicates straight and unidirectional flow, and it decays with increasing distance.

All measurements were completed in tissues from healthy, adult lungs that were washed, mucus-free and submerged in aqueous saline buffer, suggesting that the differences in CPB and clearance directionality were due to species-specific properties of ciliary beat and organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> rather than defective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> or immature ciliary beat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, or altered mucus properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">To capture these species-to-species differences in ciliary activity, we measured multiple ciliary properties at the single cell and tissue level.

Shown by the proximal-distal cell type analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), coverage with ciliated cells in these regions was significantly higher in the human airways (86.1 ± 9.2%) compared to rat airways (53.1 ± 14.4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). We found that cilia length was significantly higher in human compared to rat tissue (human: 7.1 ± 0.5 µm; rat: 5.2 ± 0.4 µm), consistent with literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Ciliary beat OP was also significantly higher in human samples compared to rat samples (human: 0.9 ± 0.02; rat: 0.6 ± 0.2), as was ciliary beat amplitude (human: 12.2 ± 1.3 µm; rat: 7.5 ± 1.2 µm). Ciliation gap sizes were similar in human (λ = 27.8 ± 6.8 µm) and rat airways (λ = 28.3 ± 4.2 µm) and, notably, were thus comparable to the mean correlation length <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> of the cilia-driven flow (23 µm and 29 µm, respectively). This is consistent with prior studies in mice showing that the spatial organization of ciliated cells imprints onto the emergent flow patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Crystalline OP was also of similar magnitude between human and rat tissue.</p><p id="P10">To understand how the functional “output metrics” of clearance effectiveness, namely CPB and clearance directionality, emerge from structural “input metrics,” we developed a simple hydrodynamic model inspired by force singularity models of cilia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> to simulate particle clearance due to cilia submerged in aqueous liquid, similar to our experimental measurement conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 7 &amp; 8, Supplementary Methods</xref>). Here, we model each ciliated cell as a single regularized Stokeslet that scales with cilia beat amplitude, points horizontally in the effective stroke direction, and is located at one cilia length above a no-slip wall that represents the stationary cell surface. The position of ciliated cells and the orientation of the corresponding Stokeslets are chosen such that the simulated epithelium conforms to the desired input metrics such as cilia coverage and ciliary beat OP, patchiness, and crystalline order parameter. Next, the resulting fluid velocity field and tracer particles trajectories were computed to derive CPB and clearance directionality as a function of cilia coverage. To validate the model, we confirmed that it correctly predicted the most dependable clearance measurements in human and rat samples, i.e., from recordings with minimal sample warp where particles could be recorded right above the cilia layer, thereby minimizing distance dependent loss of speed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). In these human recordings, the mean cilia coverage of 95 ± 2.6% was associated with a mean clearance performance of CPB= 8.3 ± 1.2 µm per beat and a mean directionality value of 0.97 ± 0.01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, “human benchmark”). The model further predicted that CPB is linearly dependent on cilia coverage, while clearance directionality is a steeply rising function that exponentially converges to its maximum above a certain coverage fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, red curves). We also computed these curves using the input parameters measured in rat airways. The predicted rat-specific curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, blue curves) fall below the human-specific curves because of the lower values in ciliary beat OP, amplitude, and cilia length in rats compared to humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). This means that for identical cilia coverage, the maximal CPB and clearance directionality are lower in rats. Intriguingly, the experimentally determined mean benchmark value in rat airways with mean cilia coverage of 45.6 ± 8.7%, mean CPB of 0.96 ± 0.3 µm per beat, and mean directionality of 0.55 ± 0.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, “rat benchmark”) match the range predicted by the model, suggesting that despite its simplicity, our model captures key structure-function relationships.

ALI cultures are typically used to study human airway diseases and hence there is great interest in establishing human airway-like, aka “organotypic”, phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that we could generate different luminal epithelial cell type compositions in the same cell donor by using a variety of cell culture differentiation media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, thereby enabling us to compare these tissues to native human <italic>ex vivo</italic> tissues both in terms of structural organization and clearance function. After expanding the airway epithelial cells of multiple donors (n=4-7; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1 &amp; 2</xref>) in a common medium, we differentiated them for 28 days at ALI in 5 commonly used cell culture media: BD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, mAir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, SAGM™, PC, or PC-S (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>).

We reasoned that key organizing metrics would include cilia coverage, which is a major determinant of clearance function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), percentage of MUC5AC+ cells since the presence of mucin 5AC strongly impacts mucus rheology and flow behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, and the ratio of SCGB1A1+ to MUC5AC+ cell proportions since this ratio changes along the healthy airway tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Here, the definition of SCGB1A1+ and MUC5AC+ cells each includes hybrid MUC5AC+ SCGB1A1+ cells. Mapping the data onto these three dimensions showed that PC-generated cellular compositions were most like human <italic>ex vivo</italic> BG2-6 samples, whereas all other media conditions differed starkly from the human <italic>ex vivo</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). For further insight into the proximal-distal identity of the <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures, we also analyzed the proportions of MUC5B positive secretory cells, a major cell type present throughout the airway epithelium with highest frequency in the trachea and primary bronchi <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. We found that human trachea contained on average 3.3 ± 1.7% Muc5B positive luminal cells, which was matched by similar values across all large airway media conditions (BD: 5.3 ± 2.6%, mAir: 3.1 ± 2.4%, PC: 2.4 ± 1.6%) and lower values in small airway media (SAGM: 1.2 ± 1.6%, PC-S: 1.1 ± 0.1%) which is consistent with a small airway identity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). As reported previously for both proximal and distal sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, a sizable share of MUC5B positive cells also co-expressed MUC5AC and/or SCGB1A1 both in trachea explants and in all media conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We proceeded by measuring ciliary beat and clearance function in washed and submerged <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures, to directly compare to the measurements in <italic>ex vivo</italic> samples. Whereas ciliary beat frequency was comparable in all media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>), only PC-cultured epithelial tissues approached human <italic>ex vivo</italic>-like particle clearance function with mean CPB of 6.4 ± 2.0 µm s<sup>-1</sup> and mean directionality of 0.81 ± 0.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Video 3</bold>). In contrast, particle clearance in tissues differentiated in other media performed well below the human <italic>ex vivo</italic> benchmarks and more closely resembled rat <italic>ex vivo</italic> clearance. To understand the mechanistic underpinnings of these results, we assessed all ciliary input metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Cilia coverage, cilia length, beat amplitude, and ciliation gap size varied the most in response to different differentiation media. On average, BD and SAGM-cultured tissues had shorter cilia than human <italic>ex vivo</italic> samples whereas PC-S cultures had longer cilia, and mAir and PC cultures matched human cilia length (BD: 5.9 ± 0.9 µm; mAir: 6.7 ± 0.8 µm; SAGM: 4.8 ± 1.5 µm ; PC: 7.0 ± 0.4 µm; PC-S: 7.7 ± 0.9 µm; human: 7.1 ± 0.5 µm). Notably, only PC-cultured tissues reached human organotypic ciliary beat amplitudes whereas all other culture conditions fell short (BD: 9.3 ± 1.3 µm; mAir: 8.1 ± 1.4 µm; SAGM: 7.1 ± 0.5 µm; PC: 12.4 ± 1.5 µm; PC-S: 7.2 ± 0.6 µm; human: 12.2 ± 1.3 µm). Compared to human and rat airways, mean ciliation gap size λ was notably smaller in PC and PC-S cultures (BD: 24.5 ± 9.0 µm; mAir: 21.0 ± 6.4 µm; SAGM: 28.1 ± 5.2 µm; PC: 16.6 ± 5.9 µm; PC-S: 14.8 ± 3.7 µm; human: 27.8 ± 6.8 µm), which is consistent with the comparatively small cell size in PC and PC-S cultured epithelia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>). To assess the functional impact of these differences, we entered the ciliary input metrics of each medium condition into our computational model to predict CPB and particle clearance directionality as a function of cilia coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref><bold>, top</bold>). Overlaying the measured CPB and directionality values demonstrated a good fit with the model predictions overall. We then replaced individual medium-specific cilia input parameters with the <italic>ex vivo</italic> values and computed the impact on CPB and directionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref><bold>, bottom</bold>). These results suggest that our ciliary input metrics alone can be used to predict particle clearance function, explain its divergence from organotypic performance and estimate the impact that rescuing defective ciliary beat features would have on clearance.</p><p id="P14">An obvious limitation of our analysis is the washing step prior to recording, thus likely removing most of the mucus, which plays a vital role in trapping particles but also aligning flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, and the underlying periciliary liquid, which has been shown to contain ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, a potent stimulator of ciliary beat frequency and amplitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. To gauge the robustness of our results in physiological mucus conditions, we compared ciliary activity and particle clearance in PC and PC-S cultures with mucus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and without mucus. We found that, in samples with similar cilia coverage, the presence of mucus did not lead to significant changes in average CPB, or directionality compared to washed samples, although beat amplitude was increased in mucus samples (+20.5 ± 14%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 14A to D</xref>). As a positive control, we dosed the washed samples with 50 µM ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. After 2 minutes of incubation, ATP induced a slight increase in average CBF (+3.5 ± 6%) and a much greater increase in ciliary beat amplitude (+51 ± 25%), associated with a similar rise in clearance distance per beat (+75.7 ± 50%) compared to control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 14A to D</xref>). Our results match the reported ranges of ATP-mediated changes in CBF, beat amplitude, and CPB in healthy airway epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. We then used our computational model to simulate the impact of the measured changes in ciliary beat amplitude on CPB and directionality, and we compared the predictions to experimentally determined values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 14E and F</xref>). Since the model explicitly accounts for ciliation levels, we were able to increase the data set shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 14C and D</xref> by including samples varying in cilia coverages. The model curves correctly predicted the similar distribution of washed and mucus-containing samples, while capturing a slight increase in CPB and directionality in mucus samples associated with the higher beat amplitude. The model also recapitulated the notable increase in CPB due to ATP treatment. Taken together, these findings suggest that the presence of an intact mucus layer may indeed increase extracellular ATP levels and hence raise ciliary beat amplitude, thereby slightly increasing CPB and directionality; however, donor-to-donor variability was high, and, on average, there was little difference. Therefore, for modeling average healthy conditions, our structure-function model provides reasonable estimates in both absence and presence of mucus but additional parameters accounting for mucus properties are likely required to predict specific donor responses and disease conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Structural and functional maps enable phenotypic benchmarking</title><p id="P15">In <italic>in vitro</italic> airway cultures, the physiological development of directional particle clearance depends on the hydrodynamic interaction of dense ciliation with a mucus layer that is neither too high nor too low in viscosity; the long-range forces transmitted via flowing mucus aligns ciliary beat during differentiation, leading to long-range clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.

Other input combinations worsened the prediction, including using the percentage of ciliated cells as sole input, or removing it (R<sup>2</sup>=0.77 and R<sup>2</sup>=-1.34, respectively), or replacing the secretory cell percentage with only MUC5AC, MUC5B, or SCGB1A1 positive cell percentages (R<sup>2</sup>=0.56, R<sup>2</sup>=0.8, R<sup>2</sup> =0.55), respectively). Hence, combining information on both ciliated and major secretory cell proportions was most predictive for clearance directionality.</p><p id="P16">Collectively, our analysis has uncovered the following key findings: (1) structural ciliary metrics, particularly the extent of ciliated cell coverage, are mechanistic predictors of particle clearance function; (2) the selection of cell culture medium significantly influences ciliary metrics and consequently particle clearance function, and (3) the composition of luminal secretory and ciliated cell types may act as a statistical predictor of particle clearance directionality in airway epithelia.</p><p id="P17">Finally, to demonstrate the broader applicability of our analysis for tissue phenotyping, we leveraged the structural cell-type composition map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) and the functional CPB-against-ciliation map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>) to assess the mucociliary machinery in additional culture conditions and animal models, where the data was derived from published literature or via proof-of-concept experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a-b</xref>). The systems evaluated included mature and developing mouse trachea, human airway epithelial cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, and primary human airway epithelial cultures subjected to asthma-like inflammatory conditions (interleukin-13 (IL-13) treated) or differentiated under mechanical stimulation (Organ-on-Chip models). We found that the pluripotent stem cells-derived airway epithelial tissue differentiated in PC at ALI (iALIs) as described earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> greatly increased cilia coverage between day 14 and day 35 at ALI; however, CPB remained much lower than expected from the extent of cilia coverage, suggesting immature ciliated cell function and organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>, orange triangles). Secretory cell type composition in iALIs was dominated by SCGB1A1+ cells and showed relatively low levels of MUC5AC+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). The CPB of primary human airway epithelial cultures differentiated in BD was also below the human benchmark curve at day 14 of ALI when cultured in conventional static inserts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>, unfilled square) but approached the curve when cultured in continuously perfused Organ-on-Chips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>, inverted triangle). Further, after a prolonged culture time of 35 days, the static insert cultures increased ciliation and reached the human CPB benchmark curve, indicating maturation of ciliary beat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>, solid square). Luminal cell type composition in both insert and chip conditions reflected a lack of ciliation compared to the human benchmark; however, the Organ-on-Chip cultures reached nearly organotypic proportions of MUC5AC+ cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). The CPB of primary human airway epithelial cultures cultured in Vertex ALI medium, a popular medium choice for modeling cystic fibrosis and asthma due to the high proportion of secretory cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, lay below the benchmark curve at day 35 of ALI. Cultures treated with IL-13 for the final 14 days lost cilia coverage and, despite ciliary beat, generated almost no flow at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>, stars). The structural map reflects the high proportion of secretory cells expected from culture in Vertex ALI medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, and IL-13 treatment creates the expected goblet-cell dominated Th2-like asthmatic phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>).

The ciliation-dependent increase in CPB parallels the observed and predicted trends in the rat trachea-bronchial airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>, filled star and blue model prediction), and hence it is possible that mouse and rat trachea share similar ciliary beat properties.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7"><title>DISUSSION</title><p id="P18">We developed a framework to predict how airway morphology influences particle clearance effectiveness and established benchmarks for comparing experimental airway models against the gold standard, the human airways.

Analysis was also limited by the availability of healthy human airway samples (15 donors total, as detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), some of which were extracted from peritumoral tissue. Many of the human donors were above the age of 60, raising the possibility of aging-related changes to MCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. Despite these limitations, the robustly high ciliation levels provide confidence that this is a key characteristic of human large airways. While more studies are needed to also characterize MCC in the small airways, 85% luminal cilia coverage was reported in the human small airways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>, suggesting continuously high ciliation levels throughout the conducting airways. We washed all samples prior to live imaging to enable direct comparison between buffer-stored explants and <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures, thereby lacking an intact periciliary liquid and mucus layer in our analysis. However, MCC recordings in unwashed mice trachea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup> suggest a CPB of about 1-2 µm per beat (assuming a physiological CBF of 15 Hz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>), comparable to the CPB measured in washed mouse trachea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. We also showed that our clearance metrics resulted in comparable average values between washed and unwashed conditions, but the high donor-to-donor variability indicates that further studies are warranted. We propose that in the case of airway disease, where mucus properties are often abnormal, comparing our metrics with and without mucus will help dissect the contribution of secretory compared to ciliary dysfunction.

The regularized Stokeslet’s strength is proportional to ciliary beat amplitude, with its direction corresponding to power stroke direction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7A</xref>).

We derive ciliary flow characteristics from the trajectories of simulated tracer particles injected near cilia tip. Tracers are subject to both cilia-driven flow and random fluctuations. All flow experiments were done using 1 µm diameter particles suspended in buffer after the mucus was removed.
