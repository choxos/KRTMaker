Here, we describe GRITIC, a generic method for timing genomic gains leading to complex copy number states, using single-sample bulk whole-genome sequencing data. By applying GRITIC to 5,656 tumors, we found that non-parsimonious evolution is frequent in the formation of complex copy number states in genome-duplicated tumors. We measured CIN before and after genome duplication in human tumors and found that late genome doubling was followed by an increase in the rate of copy number gain. Copy number gains often accumulate as punctuated bursts, commonly after genome duplication. We infer that genome duplications typically affect the selection landscape of copy number losses, while only minimally impacting copy number gains. In summary, GRITIC is a novel copy number gain timing framework that permits the analysis of copy number evolution in chromosomally unstable tumors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Tumor evolution</kwd><kwd>chromosomal instability</kwd><kwd>gain timing</kwd><kwd>molecular archeology of cancer</kwd><kwd>whole genome duplication</kwd><kwd>copy number gains</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Copy number gains and losses are common somatic alterations in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). While somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels linked to cancer drivers are found in ostensibly healthy tissues, copy number events rarely occur in normal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Identifying when copy number events occur is important for screening purposes and for gaining an understanding of the key molecular mechanisms underlying cancer development.</p><p id="P4">Of particular interest is the evolution of copy number events in tumors with the most aberrant genomes, as CIN is linked to poorer outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Tumors that have undergone whole genome duplication (WGD) often show elevated aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) which arises from multiple factors, including chromosomal missegregation from centrosomal amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and a shortage of replication machinery proteins immediately following WGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). While increased aneuploidy supports CIN, the temporal relationship between WGDs and CIN is difficult to assess from single-timepoint biopsies in human tumors. The extent of genomic aberration, often used as an indirect proxy for CIN, does not convey the temporal dynamics that define CIN.</p><p id="P5">To observe the evolution of genomic gains in genome-doubled tumors, the timing of copy number gains and WGDs relative to the accumulation of SNVs can be inferred from wholegenome sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Clonal copy number gains, which are present in every tumor cell, can be placed on a timeline from 0 to 1, where 0 represents conception and 1 represents the end of the tumor’s clonal evolutionary period. Previous approaches that have used this principle to time copy number gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) were unable to fully time gains leading to complex copy number states (those with three or more copies of one parental allele). This is because of the higher ambiguity in the route history of these complex states relative to simpler states. Either the most parsimonious route history was assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) or these states were not timed at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Recently, a method was developed that can provide bounds on the timing of the first and last gains for complex copy number states (bioRxiv 2022.06.14.495959); however, it does not resolve the timing of the intermediate gains.</p><p id="P6">Here, we present GRITIC (Gain Route Identification and Timing In Cancer), a method that can time sequential gains leading to complex clonal copy number states, thereby elucidating the genome-wide evolution of gains in tumors with high CIN. As GRITIC is designed to time clonal copy number gains, it is well suited to unravel the evolution of the earliest genomic events in tumors, those that arise before the emergence of the tumor’s most recent common ancestor. We applied GRITIC to a cohort of 1,897 tumors from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and 3,759 metastases from the Hartwig Medical Foundation dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed that the commonly held principle of maximum parsimony (i.e., that copy number states are formed through the simplest possible route) is frequently violated for complex copy number gains in WGD tumors. We found that synchronous bursts of gains, independent of WGD, were common across cancer types. We infer the rate of gains pre- and post-WGD across our cohort and observe that late WGD causes an immediate increase in the rate of gains, a proxy for chromosomal instability. By considering the landscape of copy number events before and after a WGD, we found that WGD appears to have a low impact on the selection of copy number gains, but a greater impact on the selection of losses.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>GRITIC leverages SNVs to time complex copy number gains</title><p id="P7">Tumors frequently gain additional copies of their genomic regions during development. In the Hartwig and PCAWG datasets, copy number gains affected an average of 44.0% of the tumor genomes (51.6% and 31.6%, respectively). Complex gains were common, with 26.9% of the gained genome having three or more copies of one parental allele on average, predominantly major copy number three or four. This was 28.9% and 21.2% for Hartwig metastases and PCAWG primary tumors, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The frequency of a given complex copy number state was inversely correlated with the largest number of copies of the parental allele for the state, known as the major copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Metastases also had a higher rate of WGD in our cohorts: 51.9% for Hartwig metastases compared to 28.7% for PCAWG primary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>), although this appears to be a phenomenon specific to certain cancer types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Although the difference in complex copy number fraction is largely explained by the higher proportion of WGD tumors, it was still higher in metastases when controlling for WGD frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), likely reflecting increased CIN in metastatic cancers.</p><p id="P8">Clonal copy number gains can be quantitatively timed by considering SNVs in the gain region. When a gain occurs, all SNVs present on the gained allele are duplicated over to the new allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). With the reasonable assumption that each base pair in the genome is mutated at most once (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), any SNV on multiple copies in a gained region must have occurred before copy number gain. This principle can be used to infer the timing of the gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, Supplementary Methods). However, for more complex gains, further consideration of the possible routes that lead to these complex states is required. To accomplish this, we developed GRITIC, a new method that can identify, distinguish, and time the gains in these routes.</p><p id="P9">GRITIC uses a binary tree representation conceptually similar to an earlier approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) to represent the gain history of a given segment. These representations can be used to calculate all possible routes (assuming, at most, a single WGD), resulting in a particular copy number state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, Supplementary Methods). We found that the number of possible routes increases exponentially with the complexity of the copy-number state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Therefore, we limit GRITIC to the timing of copy number gains of segments with a total copy number of no more than 9. GRITIC uses a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to infer the posterior probability of all possible route histories and the corresponding set of gain timings from SNV read counts for each gained segment. GRITIC is particularly suited to timing tumors with a WGD, as it uses the simultaneous occurrence of a WGD across all genomic regions as a constraint during inference to improve timing accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We applied GRITIC to a realistic simulated cohort of WGD tumors (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>) that contained equal proportions of all routes, leading to the 20 most common complex copy number states. We found that with simulated tumor purity and sequencing coverage representative of the tumors in PCAWG and Hartwig, GRITIC can accurately measure the timing of all gains, leading to complex states under different assumptions of the prevalence of parsimonious routes and penalties applied to non-parsimony during inference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3-S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). Although more sensitive to simulation and inference conditions compared to measuring the gain timing itself, GRITIC can also accurately estimate the probabilities of different gain routes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8-S11</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Non-parsimony is common in WGD tumor gain evolution</title><p id="P11">We then applied GRITIC to time the gains that led to 131,296 clonally gained autosomal regions across 5,656 tumors in the PCAWG and Hartwig datasets. GRITIC reconstructs the timing of both the independent gains and the WGD (if present) in each sample and can time multiple sequential independent gains in the same genomic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Parsimonious route histories have often been assumed for the development of copy number states in WGD tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). This is because the total number of allelic copies gained through WGD versus individual independent gains will vary between different routes, as will the number of losses required to make the route self-consistent (Supplementary Methods). Therefore, we sought to evaluate the assumption of parsimonious evolution in WGD tumors.</p><p id="P13">We first tested this assumption by reanalyzing copy number data from isogenic tetraploid colorectal cancer HCT-116 cell lines obtained from two different passages derived from a diploid progenitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). By considering the change in copy number states between the two passages, we found that most events with a major copy number of three in the later passage arose through complex routes that would violate the assumption of parsimony if applied to the later passage in isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). This result suggests that the assumption of parsimonious copy number evolution is often invalid.</p><p id="P14">We used GRITIC to test this parsimonious evolution assumption. Owing to the inherent uncertainties (Supplementary Methods) in estimating copy number gain routes from SNVs, GRITIC assigns an average posterior probability of 51.1% to non-parsimonious routes from a simulated set of tumors with completely parsimonious evolutionary histories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12A</xref>). Although the model evidence used in GRITIC provides a natural penalty against additional independent gain timing parameters, it does not penalize the number of losses implied by a given route. Thus, to ensure a conservative estimate of non-parsimony, we applied a penalty term to the number of events required for each route in WGD tumors (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). This penalty was fitted such that the average posterior probability of non-parsimonious routes was less than 5% on a representative cohort of simulated WGD tumors with only parsimonious routes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13-14</xref>).</p><p id="P15">With this penalty term, we evaluated non-parsimonious evolution across genome-duplicated PCAWG and Hartwig tumors. Surprisingly, we found that non-parsimony was common across cancer copy number evolution: 30.0% of the total posterior probability on gained segments in WGD tumors was on non-parsimonious route histories, with 5.8% on routes with two or more events in addition to the simplest route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S12B</xref>, p&lt;0.001, permutation test). Owing to our conservative penalty term, these are likely underestimates of non-parsimony in copy number evolution.</p><p id="P16">Non-parsimony occurs in agreement with known phenomena. Gains on chromosome 5q are known to be and initiating event in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, combined with the loss of 3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). In line with this, GRITIC inferred that gains on chromosome 5 with a major copy number of 3 are significantly more non-parsimonious (<italic>i.e.</italic> earlier, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12C</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>) than the background for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, p&lt;0.001, permutation test).</p><p id="P17">Conversely, gains on chromosome 5 with a major copy number of four were more likely parsimonious (<italic>i.e.</italic> earlier, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, p=0.059, permutation test). This effect was also observed when a non-parsimony penalty term was not applied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12D-E</xref>). More generally, we found that the frequency of pre-WGD gains on chromosomes was highly correlated (Pearson’s, p&lt;0.001) across cancer types between major copy number 3 and 4 states, even though such gains were non-parsimonious for major copy number 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S15</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Applying a penalty to the number of events provides a useful lower bound on the non-parsimonious evolution of complex gains. However, we found that, as expected, this causes the inferred probability of non-parsimonious evolution to be very inaccurate for cohorts simulated to contain non-parsimonious routes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>). Therefore, for all subsequent analyses, we show the results of applying GRITIC without this non-parsimony penalty term, and display the results with a penalty term in the Supplementary Information. In general, both results are highly consistent.</p><p id="P19">We find that the initial gains that occur independently of the WGD tend to occur earlier as the major copy number (up to 8) increases. They are typically among the first gains in the tumor genome (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S16</xref>). Moreover, when considering all copy number gains that occur independently of WGD, segments with high copy numbers have gains dispersed across tumor development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S16</xref>). This suggests that moderate-level amplifications in tumor development generally begin early but can accumulate gains throughout the clonal evolutionary period.</p><p id="P20">We speculated that elevated CIN post-WGD may lead to an increase in copy-neutral events, where the loss of one parental allele is combined with a gain of the other. Post-WGD copyneutral events would cause a 2+2 state to become a 3+1 state, which may then go on to undergo further gains. Indeed, we found that regions in WGD tumors with a minor allelic copy number of one were significantly more likely to have a first gain post-WGD than other copy number states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S17A-B</xref>), much more than in the cohorts simulated without this effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S17C-D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The effect of genome doubling on the rate of chromosomal instability</title><p id="P21">Next, we evaluated the effect of genome doubling on the rate of CIN. We analyzed the copy number profiles of 260 individual tumor cells in an undifferentiated sarcoma that had undergone consecutive subclonal WGDs, as shown experimentally (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). We found progressively higher rates of inter-copy number diversity in cells with each round of WGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S18</xref>, p&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney U Test, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>), suggesting that WGD increases CIN even within the same tumor.</p><p id="P22">We used GRITIC to calculate the rate of independent gains, a proxy for the rate of CIN, relative to the occurrence of WGD across our cohort. We found that the gain rate increased after WGD but only in tumors with late genome doubling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). While this increase in the rate of gains remains upon the application of the non-parsimony penalty, owing to uncertainties in placing gains directly before or after a WGD, it leads to a greater immediate increase in the post-WGD gain rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S19</xref>).</p><p id="P23">We observed that, regardless of the penalty on non-parsimony, the tumors with the earliest genome doubling have a different trend in gain rate relative to WGD. They exhibited a high rate before early WGD and a subsequent steady post-WGD gain frequency, which was lower than that before WGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This behavior may be driven primarily by breast tumors, which were enriched in this group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S19</xref>), which is consistent with reports of highly aneuploid karyotypes of early precursor lesions of breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). While only a few individual tumors followed such clear patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), the effect of WGD on CIN in aggregate was clear.</p><p id="P24">There was also a general increase in CIN over the clonal evolutionary period in non-WGD tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S20</xref>), there was a significant further excess of gains in WGD tumors: the proportion of WGD tumors that gained post-WGD (98.3%) was significantly higher than that in a control cohort of non-WGD tumors with pseudo-WGD timing (79.4%) (p&lt;0.001, permutation test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S21A-B</xref>). Moreover, the mean mutational time between independent gains and WGD was significantly lower than expected from permuting WGD timing (p&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney U Test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S21C-D, S22</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>), suggesting that this excess is subsequent to WGD.</p><p id="P25">Although the later a WGD occurs, the less time there is for gains to accumulate post-WGD, the amount of genome gained post-WGD was only weakly negatively correlated with WGD timing (Spearman’s ρ=-0.18, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S23</xref>). Similarly, the genomic material gained pre-WGD was weakly positively correlated with WGD timing (ρ=0.10, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S24</xref>). In contrast, there was a much stronger negative correlation between WGD timing and the proportion of genome lost post-WGD (ρ=-0.35, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S25A</xref>). Generally, these trends are conserved when cancer types are considered separately and after applying the nonparsimony penalty (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S23, S24, S25A</xref>).</p><p id="P26">In contrast, there was no correlation between WGD timing and the proportion of the genome that was lost pre-WGD. This suggests that such losses pre-WGD do not accumulate steadily with respect to mutation time or are linked to WGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S25B</xref>). This could support a model whereby a major advantage of WGDs is the mitigation of the effect of deleterious mutations in regions with loss of heterozygosity (LOH), as reported by Lopez <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). If so, the greater the proportion of the genome lost in a non-WGD sample, the more likely it is that a WGD has a positive selective impact. This selective impact would remove the relationship between the amount of genome lost pre-WGD and the timing of WGD. This is supported by observations of a higher proportion of LOH in the genomes of WGD tumors than in non-WGD tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). The high frequency of post-WGD losses is consistent with the widespread hypothesis that, in many cancers, WGD serves as an evolutionary intermediate to fitter sub-tetraploid karyotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Punctuated gain evolution in WGD tumors</title><p id="P27">Next, we sought to better understand the distribution of gain timing in WGD samples. We previously found that copy number gains in non-WGD tumors occurred in bursts that were closer than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Indeed, using GRITIC, we found that gains in 19.3% of informative non-WGD samples (those with gains affecting at least three separate chromosomes) occurred over significantly shorter timespans than expected under a permutation model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S26A-D</xref>). <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Using GRITIC, we can now study the timing of gains that arise independently of the WGD.

Most of these (88.3%) occurred post-WGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S26E</xref>), suggesting that WGD may increase the likelihood of or tolerance to punctuated bursts of gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Together, these results suggest that copy number gains occur frequently in punctuated bursts, even in the most chromosomally unstable samples.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Measuring the impact of a WGD on the copy number landscape</title><p id="P29">The landscape of gains and losses along the genome is similar for WGD and non-WGD tumors across cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Therefore, we sought to determine whether the selection landscape of copy number events is different before and after a WGD. First, we compared the relative frequency of arm-level copy number gains across different cancer types pre- and post-WGD and found that they were highly correlated (Spearman’s ρ=0.81, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S27-S28</xref>).</p><p id="P30">We then investigated how arm loss frequencies were affected by WGD. After correcting for mutual exclusivity in measuring the rates of loss before and after WGD (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>), we also observed clear positive correlations (Spearman’s ρ=0.65, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S29</xref>). This suggests that losses without loss of heterozygosity (LOH) observed post-WGD are mostly derived from a continuation of the same processes that lead to pre-WGD LOH losses. However, there are clear outliers where the pre-WGD loss frequency is much higher than expected given the corresponding post-WGD loss frequency.</p><p id="P31">Of the 21 arms across different cancer types that had a higher loss proportion pre-WGD than post-WGD, 16 were 8p (n=4), 9p (n=3), or 17p (n=9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Interestingly, chromosome arms 9p and 17p contain well-known and frequently hit tumor suppressor genes, such as <italic>CDKN2A</italic> and <italic>TP53,</italic> respectively, whereas 8p harbors the helicase-encoding gene <italic>WRN,</italic> which has recently been identified as a likely tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Thus, while gains and losses are broadly unaffected by a WGD, we find specific arm-level losses that occur disproportionately pre-WGD. We note that most arms had higher event rates post-WGD than pre-WGD, reflective of increased CIN post-WGD. In agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), we found that the frequencies of chromosome arm events maintained similar levels of correlation/anticorrelation with the overall tumor suppressor gene and oncogene density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) across pre-WGD, post-WGD, and non-WGD copy number events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S30-31</xref>). Despite certain arms having significantly higher pre- than post-WGD loss, the frequency of both event types showed a similar correlation with driver gene density across chromosome arms. This suggests that the disproportionate pre-WGD loss frequency of certain chromosome arms may be due to specific genes, perhaps in the context of a second inactivating hit, rather than the overall tumor suppressor gene density.</p><p id="P32">We then normalized the relative rates of pre- and post-WGD events for both gain and loss across the genome. We found that the rates of pre- and post-WGD gains were similar when aggregated across cancer types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S32</xref>). However, there are notable differences in individual tumor types. For example, gains on 1q and chromosome 8 were disproportionately likely to occur pre-WGD relative to other events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S32-S36</xref>). Gains on chromosome 3 are often pre-WGD for small-cell lung cancers and upper respiratory tract carcinomas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S35-S36</xref>). Chromosome 7 is commonly gained pre-WGD in glioblastomas, in agreement with previous observations that these events occur very early (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S33</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Interestingly, the differences were much larger pre-<italic>vs</italic>. post-WGD for losses, both at the aggregate level and in individual cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S37-S39</xref>). As discussed earlier, chromosome arms 8p, 9p, and 17p are frequently lost pre-WGD in several cancer types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S37-S39</xref>). We observed many cancer-type specific patterns, such as high levels of pre-WGD loss of chromosome 18 in colorectal carcinomas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S37</xref>). Together, our results suggest a model in which the selection landscape for copy number changes remains broadly similar post- WGD, yet the selective pressure on certain chromosome arms is reduced if not removed, particularly for losses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P34">GRITIC is a Bayesian framework for genome-wide timing of both simple and complex gains in cancer evolution. It leverages the relationship between alternate read counts, copy number, and purity to determine the sequence and timing of gains. GRITIC theoretically allows the timing of gains from any copy number state, although in practice for computational efficiency and timing accuracy, we focus on autosomal segments with a maximum total copy number of nine and at least 20 SNVs, respectively.</p><p id="P35">By applying GRITIC to the PCAWG and Hartwig datasets, we measured the genome-wide timing of gains relative to WGD. Therefore, we describe the effect of WGD on chromosomal instability. We found that late WGDs tended to induce a spike in gain activity, which remained elevated compared with the pre-WGD gain rate. Conversely, early WGDs were preceded by an elevated gain rate, which then decreased post-WGD. This increase in genomic instability likely enables WGD tumors to have greater adaptivity in response to therapy, contributing to their poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Because losses cannot be quantitatively timed, the gain rate over mutation time was not corrected for total genomic content. However, the contrasting patterns observed for tumors with different WGD timings indicate that an increase in CIN post-WGD does not solely result from more chromosomes missegregating at the same rate as before the WGD.</p><p id="P36">We found that the landscapes of gains occurring before and after genome duplication were similar. This parallels the similarity in gain landscape between tumors with <italic>vs.</italic> without WGD. We hypothesize that this is because WGD only has a very moderate impact on the gain fitness landscape of tumors. Although the pre- and post-WGD landscapes are also broadly similar for losses, there are selective pressures to lose certain chromosome arms encoding well-known tumor suppressor genes before WGD, leading to LOH. Post-WGD losses accumulated much more linearly with respect to the overall mutation burden than other copy number events. This could suggest a lower selective impact relative to other copy number events and a role in evolution that is more akin to the accumulation of passenger mutations.</p><p id="P37">We discovered that many segments across different copy number states in WGD tumors arose through routes that violate the principle of maximum parsimony even after this was substantially penalized. It is worth noting that we inferred the most parsimonious routes from single biopsies only. Event histories that appear non-parsimonious, as measured in one biopsy, may be parsimonious when the full heterogeneity of copy number in the tumor is considered. While GRITIC can only identify non-parsimony in gain evolution in individual segments, it calls into question the validity of the assumption of maximum parsimony in cancer evolution, particularly in the context of inference from a single biopsy.</p><p id="P38">GRITIC considers the gains in different segments separately. Future work incorporating structural variant information into timing analyses would enable more integrated evolutionary analyses of copy number changes across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Similarly, as our inference is limited by ambiguities in resolving routes from SNV read counts, phasing SNVs either to haplotypes or ideally to specific alleles will substantially reduce this ambiguity and allow greater resolution of evolution. Currently, we are unable to time events in tumors with multiple WGDs, which we estimate to be 4.9% of the patients in the PCAWG and Hartwig cohorts (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). While this is theoretically possible in our framework, more work is required to build an inference pipeline that can link the complex gained states across segments.</p><p id="P39">In summary, GRITIC is a novel computational framework for inferring copy number gain evolution from a single bulk whole-genome sequencing experiment.

This can be interpreted as gains within a sample occurring closer in mutational time than expected by chance, for a given cancer type.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Inferring the pre- and post-WGD landscape of copy-number gains and losses</title><p id="P79">We assessed a chromosome arm as having a pre- or post-WGD gain in a WGD tumor if at least 50% of the total base pairs in the arm belonged to segments with at least 50% of posterior gain timing samples and at least one gain before or post-WGD, respectively. An arm was classified as having a pre-WGD loss if at least 50% of the arm had a minor copy number of zero and as a post-WGD loss if at least 50% of the arm had a minor copy number of one.</p><p id="P80">This involves a weak assumption of parsimony as a minor copy number of zero could arise from two post-WGD losses, though without any other gains, a minor copy number of one cannot arise from a pre-WGD loss.</p><p id="P81">To correct for mutual exclusivity when measuring pre- and post-WGD losses, a corrected post-WGD loss proportion was calculated by dividing the post-WGD loss proportion by 1 – the pre-WGD loss proportion, thereby changing the denominator in proportion to only the samples that did not have a pre-WGD loss.</p><p id="P82">We also produced pre- and post-WGD gain and loss proportions at base pair resolution across the genome. Each segment was rounded to the nearest 1 kb. For certain cancer types with a low number of samples, the pre-WGD loss proportion was 1.0, leading to division by zero when calculating the corrected post-WGD loss proportion. Therefore, we clipped the pre-WGD proportion to a maximum of 0.95 when calculating the corrected post-WGD loss proportion. To compare relative rates, pan-genome event proportions were normalized such that the integral of the proportions over the genome was equal to 10<sup>9</sup>, chosen to provide a normalized event frequency with a magnitude of approximately one.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS190179-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d40aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Methods</label><media xlink:href="EMS190179-supplement-Supplementary_Methods.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d40aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the Francis Crick Institute which receives its core funding from Cancer Research UK (CC2008), the UK Medical Research Council (CC2008), and the Wellcome Trust (CC2008).
