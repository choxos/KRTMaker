Diffuse light is highly detrimental to any image formation in projection tomography. Laser excitation light and Raman scattered photons undergo multiple scattering events as they propagate through a tissue, resulting in breakdown of the parallel beam assumption with resulting blurring in the reconstructed image. Consequently, to form accurate and representative images, it is essential to capture the forward scattered Raman photons while rejecting diffuse light contributions from the sample. Secondly, traditional OPT captures full 2-D images at each angular projection while it would require new optical design to facilitate the acquisition of 2-D full spectrum Raman projections. Thirdly, the optical projections in a Raman spectroscopic setting would consist of compound Raman spectra accumulated through the sample, necessitating more sophisticated data preprocessing and analysis techniques to be developed.</p><p id="P8">We have developed a Raman spectral projection tomograph (RSPT) instrument based on transmission Raman geometry by rotation and translation of the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this design we excite and collect Raman photons from a single z-slice at a time. This has an additional advantage of reducing the collection of out-of-plane diffuse Raman photon contributions. The transmission Raman instrument provides benefits compared to a back-scattered (reflective) configuration, since transmission Raman allows for the accumulation of Raman signals emanating from deep within the sample, rather than Raman signals in proximity to the surface. We employed a custom manufactured high-power (2.0 W) near-infrared (NIR) 785 nm laser excitation allowing enough Raman signals to be generated within bulk ~1 cm semi-transparent tissues. The incident laser beam was shaped into a line (power density of max ~4 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) using a long focal length cylindrical lens and illuminated the sample similar to slice-illuminated optical projection tomography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> The focal plane was situated at the midpoint of the rotation axis. As a result, each projection line-image contains Raman photons from the anterior part of the specimen (the portion closest to the laser excitation) alongside Raman signal contribution from the posterior back half of the specimen. To further filter the diffusely scattered light, we employ a long focal length and low NA imaging lens that predominantly collects the Raman scattered photons propagating parallel through the sample and project them onto a custom-manufactured line-to-line fiber bundle consisting of 43 cores (50 μm) acting as a slit. Inside the high-throughput spectrometer, the line-to-line fiber array was imaged onto a 2000×256-pixel charge coupled device (CCD) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref>). After binning the pixels representing individual fibers on the CCD, this configuration provides snapshots of 43 Raman spectra across the FOV. To accompany the instrument, we have developed a comprehensive controlling software for fully automated acquisition of data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Each projection plane generates a vast amount of hyperspectral Raman data (43 Raman spectra per projection angle), necessitating pre-processing, multivariate analysis, and reconstruction, which poses a significant computational challenge (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref>). The developed data analysis framework incorporates data pre-processing (spectrometer image aberration correction, horizontal binning of fiber projections, wavelength calibration, autofluorescence subtraction and normalization). To enable molecular specific reconstruction, we employ multivariate regression of purified components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> 3-D image reconstruction and rendering can finally be performed using inverse Radon transform - backprojection of the regression component abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Benchmarking of RSPT imaging performance</title><p id="P10">The developed projection system has a FOV of ~9 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) with a magnification factor of the projection images on the fiber bundle of ~0.4 and a voxel size of 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 mm after volumetric reconstruction. To characterise the system’s contrast, we fabricated three groups of spatial resolution targets with aperture widths of 1000, 500, and 400 μm, using transparent resin. These targets were imaged at a 45-degree angle to the optical axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This diagonal arrangement allowed us to assess the system’s capacity to resolve details at varying depths within the sample. From each sample, we collected Raman projections of the CH<sub>2</sub> stretching vibration of the polymer (2940 cm<sup>-1</sup>) along the depth of field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> We then calculated the contrast ratio defined as the intensity difference between the resin target aperture and background (<italic>see material and methods</italic>).</p><p id="P11">To quantify the RSPT system’s overall performance, we calculated the modulation transfer function (MTF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This provides a quantitative assessment of the spatial resolution and ability to reproduce varying levels of detail from the object onto the image plane (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref>). The MTF illustrates the system’s performance across a range of spatial frequencies. By examining specific points on the curve, such as the frequency at which the MTF drops to 0.5, we can determine the system’s effective resolution limit to 600 μm. Considering our voxel size of 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 mm, the system meets the Nyquist sampling theorem for our determined resolution limit, ensuring that spatial details are captured and undersampling artifacts are minimized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Label-free 3-D imaging of phantoms with molecular contrast</title><p id="P12">Supported by ray tracing simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), we evaluated the capability of RSPT imaging to reproduce 3-D printed semi-transparent resin samples with varying complex shapes (cylinder, cuboid, triangular prism and a combination of cylinder and cuboid) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). A pure reference spectrum of resin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) was measured for multivariate regression analysis.

Tissue engineering (TE) is a growing therapy degenerative pathologies (e.g. musculoskeletal, cardiovascular) that aims to regenerate functional tissues for clinical replacement of damaged or diseased tissue. TE platforms aims to adopt regenerative protocols using a variety of biomaterials, cells, and growth factors to generate repair tissues that recapitulate the composition, structure, and function of native tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> Given the influence of ECM organization on tissue functionality (e.g. mechanical load transmission),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> the ability to achieve non-destructive, label-free quantitative imaging of the spatial distribution of ECM may be critical for the clinical evaluation of the quality of engineered tissue grafts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> For cartilage TE, protocols aims to regenerate neocartilage with a native-matched cartilaginous ECM, comprised of high levels of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) interspersed within a type II collagen fibril network, which give rise to the tissue’s unique ability to provide lubricity and mechanical load support.</p><p id="P15">TE cartilage constructs were fabricated via seeding of bovine chondrocyte in agarose scaffolds and cultivated for 42 days. RPT endpoint imaging was performed on constructs at day 0 or day 42, as well as on native bovine cartilage explanted tissues for reference, to evaluate ECM heterogeneities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The Raman spectra of pure reference molecules (GAG, type II collagen, agarose, and water) were measured for the multivariate regression analysis and 3-D reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Molecular heterogeneities were extracted from the principal x-z slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). RSPT imaging of the TE constructs at day 0 showed as expected a background signal of low intensity scores of collagen and GAG largely indicating the absence of these components. By day 42, chondrocytes had deposited significant levels of GAG and collagen. ECM was distributed in a spatially dependent manner with constituents concentrated at the culture-media-exposed construct periphery (top-most region) but more dilute in the tissue center (bottom-most region), consistent with prior <italic>ex vivo</italic> characterizations of ECM heterogeneities that result from nutrient/growth factor transport gradients in TE applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> Conversely, native cartilage explants exhibited inverse heterogeneities with GAG and collagen constituents concentrated in the lower tissue regions, consistent with their established spatial distribution through the depth-dependent zonal regions in native cartilage.</p><p id="P16">Correlation analysis of the molecular gradients with biochemical assays (1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay for GAG and Hydroxyproline assay for collagen) demonstrated excellent agreement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Collagen and GAG concentrations detected by RSPT imaging were highest at the surface and decreased deeper into the TE constructs. For native tissues the gradients were opposite and increased deeper in the tissues in agreement with previous reports using microscopy and histology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Additionally, we semi-quantitatively assessed the composition of GAG and collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>) showing a significantly increase in GAG by d42 even surpassed that observed in native samples. Contrarily, the collagen content demonstrated a gradual rise towards the native levels. Hence, RSPT imaging represent a very powerful tool for non-destructive bulk tissue gradient and heterogeneity molecular analytics. It is important to note that the RSPT imaging indicated notably weak signals for water and agarose components. This suggests that RSPT may not be the most optimal method for discerning the concentrations of these two components. In a parallel tissue culturing experiment (<italic>see Material and Methods</italic>), we investigated whether tissues could be imaged in a live setting. Live chondrocytes were encapsulated in alginate hydrogels and divided into an exposed group and a control group. The exposed group was subject to imaging with the RSPT system (duration ~3 hours), the control group was taken out of the petri dish for the same duration and was subject to the same hydration as the measured sample. Afterwards a Live/Dead Cell Viability Assay was performed on both samples. The staining revealed that upon exposure to 2W laser power had negligible effects on cell viability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). The percentage of live cells in the laser-exposed sample was 73%, while the control group exhibited a slightly lower cell viability at 62%.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">At present, there are limited tools for mesoscale imaging that enable direct visualization of the molecular makeup of the ECM without requiring labelling. Raman spectral projection-based tomography offers volumetric imaging of bulk samples and effectively complements traditional Raman microscopy, such as its inability to capture depth information, as well as those of SORS, which offers depth dependent data but lacks imaging functionalities.</p><p id="P18">There are two main mechanisms enabling image formation in the developed technique. The instrument uses slice illumination, and the projections of Raman spectra are acquired using a one-dimensional fiber array. This effectively rejects Raman photons scattered out of the imaging plane reducing lateral blurring. Secondly, although the long working distance imaging lens results in lower effective numerical aperture and less signal being detected it ensures that mostly forward scattered Raman photons are captured. Hence, RSPT employs a similar approach to OPT where the imaging lens acts as a collimator, reducing the collection of diffuse photons.</p><p id="P19">We demonstrated the capability of RSPT imaging to volumetrically replicate the geometry of resin phantoms with high molecular contrast. The minor artifacts introduced during the image generation process can largely be attributed to refractive index mismatch. Immersing real tissue samples in refractive index matching liquids to eliminate refractive mismatches might be feasible but would require a sizeable Raman transparent cuvette. The reconstruction of phantoms with different molecular components demonstrates that the compound Raman spectra can largely be deconvolved using multivariate regression analysis coupled with backprojection of the molecular abundances.</p><p id="P20">We applied the technique in a TE setting aiming to produce functional tissue replacements. Mimicking the native cartilage’s ECM content and structural organization, a determinant of implant longevity, remains challenging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> Hence, the availability of a new semi-quantitative and non-destructive imaging tools such as RSPT is vital for temporally assessing living engineered tissues. Projection tomography relies on the assumption of optical transparency in the samples under imaging. However, when samples scatter light, it leads to a notable decrease in both image resolution and quality. The constructs and native tissues used represent ideal samples consisting of collagen, GAG, agarose, and water. The agarose scaffold is optically transparent, and the absence of vascularity and light absorption enables relatively intense Raman signals to be generated and captured even through ~8 mm of bulk TE and native tissues. The imaging results largely mirrored the ECM heterogeneities of engineered and native cartilage specimens and aligns with previous microscopic findings using confocal Raman microscopy of tissue sections as well as biochemical assays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> Moreover, the system proficiently imaged live TE constructs comprising chondrocytes in hydrogel matrices indicating that prolonged exposure (&lt;180 min) to a 2.0 W 785 nm laser excitation does not compromise cell viability. This is likely due to the efficient heat dissipation and absence of any significant chromophores in the sample.</p><p id="P21">RSPT imaging comes with limitations. The sample size is restricted due to the limited penetration capability of laser light in semi-transparent tissues. The reconstruction will therefore largely be sample dependent and requires prior knowledge of the key molecular makeup. Further the computational framework assumes a linear relationship between molecular abundance and Raman signal intensity. Since the laser excitation has a gaussian profile and diffuses in tissue any analysis of the absolute Raman signal intensity remains difficult. Normalization of the compound Raman spectra projections are therefore of paramount importance in obtaining relative gradients.</p><p id="P22">There is considerable potential for further enhancing RSPT. Here we used simple backpropagation reconstruction but more advanced reconstruction methods such as iterative reconstruction algorithms and scattering correction factors could potentially enhance the 3-D rendering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Further, there are multiple avenues to explore for improving instrumentation including incorporation of a telecentric optic design, slice illumination in both x, y- and z, direct imaging on to spectrometer input slit or even wavefront shaping approaches for better laser excitation control. Exploring the integration of multimodal OPT and RSPT presents exciting prospects for delving into functional imaging using diverse contrast mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P23">Raman spectral projection tomography (RSPT) offers label-free volumetric molecular mesoscale imaging of transparent and semi-transparent samples with sub-millimetre spatial resolution.

Sinograms for each of the compounds were constructed by combining false color abundance images for every measurement angle in one figure, resulting in one sinogram per every pure component. A standard backprojection (BP) algorithm was applied for the image reconstruction from each component sinogram. To ensure consistent value scaling across the values of the scores, min-max normalization was applied, transforming all feature values to lie within the 0-1 range. The precise workflow for RSPT image reconstruction including the CCD images and spectra is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>.</p><p id="P28">The gradient trends for each component are shown by calculating the mean score of the component for every slice (excluding background) across and along the sample axis and plotting it against the slice number which corresponds to the sample zone.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Benchmarking of Raman Spectral Projection Tomography instrument</title><p id="P29">The FOV is limited by the imaging lens, linear detection fiber array as well as the width of the line-shaped laser beam. The dimensions of the FOV in the RSPT instrument are 9 mm x 9 mm. The voxel size can be calculating by ratio of the FOV to the number of detectors (43). The magnification was calculated by dividing the size of the image on the detector by the actual size of the object.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup></p><p id="P30">The contrast ratio of RSPT as a function along the optical axis was measured using a set of molecularly sensitive resolution targets that were 3-D printed (Zortrax, Inkspire). These targets have different sizes of line patterns (1 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.4 mm). They were positioned at a 45-degree angle to the optical axis and three projections with an integration time of 30 s were captured. The contrast ratio was derived from the intensity variations between the peaks and valleys of the subtracted data. This ratio provides a quantifiable measure of the system’s resolution prowess. An additional second-degree polynomial fit extended our understanding of contrast dynamics across the sample, underscoring the system’s capability in detailed feature differentiation.</p><p id="P31">The Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) was ascertained using a 2-D reconstruction of a cylindrical sample. We opted to assess the MTF on a reconstructed sample to achieve a realistic representation of our system’s performance under typical imaging conditions. This approach not only accounts for possible reconstruction artifacts but also offers a basis for meaningful comparisons with other imaging systems. Within the reconstructed image, a region of interest (ROI) with a pronounced contrast edge was pinpointed. The Edge Spread Function (ESF) was then determined by averaging pixel values in the ROI along the edge direction. From this, the Line Spread Function (LSF) was derived by differentiating the ESF. The MTF was subsequently computed by evaluating the Fourier Transform of the LSF and determining its magnitude. To ensure normalization, this MTF was divided by its peak value and then graphed against spatial frequency, providing an insight into the spatial resolution and overall image quality. A 5<sup>th</sup> order polynomial fitting was employed to represent the MTF, as showcased in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, where the MTF was charted versus the spatial frequency (cycles per mm).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Optical simulations</title><p id="P32">The RSPT instrument was simulated using Zemax OpticStudio 14.2 software. The simulation included two bulk samples with distinct geometries: a cylindrical and a triangular sample. To approximate scattering, we employed Mie scattering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> The parameters used for Mie scattering, such as mean path, particle index (refractive index), size, density, minimum threshold, and transmission, were estimated based on the optical properties of 3-D printed resin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> The proportion or fraction of incident light that passes through a material or sample, the transmission parameter was estimated using Lambert-Beer’s law and the absorption coefficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> Additionally, we developed a custom script that virtually rotates the sample and records the stimulated pixel intensity at the detector for each rotation. To process the simulation results for 3-D reconstruction, we employed a custom MATLAB script that imports the detector data, generates a sinogram, and reconstructs the final image. This approach allowed us to successfully model and analyze the performance of the RSPT system.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Phantom samples development and imaging</title><p id="P33">Single component phantom samples in various shapes (cylinder, cuboid, triangular prism and a combination of cylinder and cuboid) were designed with Autodesk Inventor software and then 3-D printed with a UV resin printer (Zortrax, Inkspire) using semi-transparent resin.

Isolated chondrocytes were seeded in 2% w/v agarose (type VII, Sigma) at 30 × 106 cells/mL and cast into 2 mm-thick molds constructed using glass slides with a rubber spacer. Cylindrical tissue constructs were procured via a Ø6 mm biopsy punch.

This binding interaction leads to an observable shift in the absorption maximum, rendering the solution’s color to change from blue to a pronounced purple in response to increasing GAG concentrations. To standardize the assay, a series of standards, ranging from 0 to 50 μg/mL, were prepared. Subsequent sample digest dilutions were introduced to the respective wells, followed by an equal volume of the specific dye. Post-incubation, the absorbance values of the samples were measured and juxtaposed against those of the known standards. GAG concentrations in the samples were then discerned, factoring in the dilution and sample digest volume. The outcomes were subsequently normalized to the tissue weight to express the GAG content in terms of (%ww).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup></p><p id="P37">The quantification of collagen hinges on the presence of the amino acid hydroxyproline in cartilage collagens. Given that hydroxyproline, along with proline, contributes to roughly a quarter of the amino acid content in collagen, its quantitation serves as an indirect measure of collagen content. For the preliminary step, each sample digest was treated with 12N HCl, facilitating the liberation of hydroxyproline from its polypeptide structure. The samples were then sealed in ampoules and incubated at 110°C. Following hydrolyzation, acid evaporation was achieved by heating the ampoules at 50°C until dryness. The resultant dried samples were reconstituted in hydroxyproline assay buffer and subjected to overnight refrigeration.The assay phase initiated with the oxidation of free hydroxyproline to pyrrole using chloramine-T. Subsequent introduction of p-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde culminated in the formation of a chromophore, whose absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically. Using hydroxyproline standards with established concentrations, collagen content was extrapolated from the assay readings. Factoring in the assay buffer volume, the sample dilution ratio, and the known weight ratio of hydroxyproline to collagen, the collagen content was determined and normalized against the sample weight to derive the collagen concentration in terms of (%ww).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Encapsulation of chondrocytes in alginate hydrogels</title><p id="P38">Alginate hydrogels were fabricated as described previosuly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> Briefly, sodium alginate (Sigma-Aldrich, 71238) was treated with 3 Mrad gamma irradiation to obtain low molecular weight alginate.

Samples had diameters around 5 mm and a height of approximately ~2 mm. We measured 7 slices, with a 300 μm resolution. The samples were hydrated intermittently with 5 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) between each slice measurement. We performed imaging with a 360° rotation resolution of 20°, and an integration time of 45 seconds. However, measuring tissue-engineered cartilage presented more challenges than native samples. Prior to the commencement of the RSPT assessment, a volume of 10 μL of Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) were introduced into the sample holder. This procedure ensures that the sample remains optimally hydrated. Complementing this, a compact humidifier, containing deionized (DI) water was positioned in the chamber to create a moisture environment. Post each measurement iteration of a specimen slice, an additional 20 μL of PBS is methodically dispensed onto the sample, ensuring consistent hydration conditions throughout the measurements. Due to the lower concentration of collagen and GAGs in the engineered constructs compared to native cartilage, we extended the integration time to 45 seconds. Optimal alignment of the setup was ensured before each measurement for the best signal-to-noise ratio and spectrum quality.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Regression of purified molecular constituents</title><p id="P41">Pure components spectra of the TE constructs constituents, including collagen II (Sigma Aldrich), sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) (Sigma Aldrich) and agarose (Sigma Aldrich) were measured with a confocal Raman microscope with an integration time of 1 s, employing the same spectrometer used for the RSPT setup to ensure the transferability of the spectra for the further data analysis.

1</label><caption><title>Raman Spectral Projection Tomography (RSPT)</title><p>(A) Schematic illustration of the excitation and detection configuration for RSPT: A 2W 785 nm laser is beam shaped into a line using a cylindrical lens. The Raman scattered light is collected using a lens and imaged onto a line array comprised of 43 fiber cores coupled to a spectrometer. The sample is positioned for rotation around a 360° angle and z-axis displacement. (B) Depiction of data pre-processing and image reconstruction workflows: Pre-processing involves complex computational correction of image distortion in raw CCD images due to the spectrometer lens’s smile effect, fiber binning with mean calculations for 5 assigned pixel rows per fiber, and standard Raman processing including smoothing, baseline correction, and cropping to the spectral fingerprint region. The image reconstruction phase employs multivariate data analysis with pure component Raman spectra and 2-D reconstructions through inverse radon transformation. Sequential application to all z-slices enables the 3-D reconstruction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS188551-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Benchmarking of Raman Spectral Projection Tomography.</title><p>(A) Schematic representation of the RSPT setup, detailing the laser excitation (red) and Raman detection (carmine). The centrally located sample undergoes rotation within the 9 mm field of view, with an inset showcasing the experimentally defined voxel dimensions. (B) Evaluation of the RSPT’s spatial resolution using resolution targets that generates Raman signals. These 3-D printed targets, made from resin, were structured with three distinct aperture widths. The target’s midpoint was positioned at the cylindrical lens’s focus, with a 45° incline relative to the optical system’s perpendicular axis. (C) Resultant measurements facilitated the derivation of a plot indicating the relationship between the contrast ratio and the depth of field in RSPT imaging. (D) The calculated MTF for the RSPT system were based on Edge Spread Function from a 2-D reconstruction of a cylindrical sample. From this, the Line Spread Function (LSF) was derived and the MTF was computed by determining the magnitude of the Fourier Transform of the LSF. A demarcated cut-off at the 50% MTF threshold reveals the system’s empirical resolution capability.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS188551-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Simulated and experimental results for phantom RSPT imaging</title><p>(A) Schematic representation of the RSPT prototype simulated in Zemax OpticStudio.

(E) Normalized mean sum of GAG (green) and collagen (red) contents for d0, d42, and native samples, expressed as a proportion of the total sum of all components (GAG + collagen + water). While GAG content is minimal at d0, it experiences a significant elevation by d42, surpassing that in native samples.
