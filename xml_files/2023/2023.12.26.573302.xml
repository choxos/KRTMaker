However, their phenotypic heterogeneity impedes a holistic understanding of the cellular composition and microenvironment of the early ischemic lesion. Here we generated a single cell resolution transcriptomics dataset of the injured brain during the acute recovery from permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. This approach unveiled infarction and subtype specific molecular signatures in oligodendrocyte lineage cells and astrocytes, which ranged among the most transcriptionally perturbed cell types in our dataset. Specifically, we characterized and compared infarction restricted proliferating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), mature oligodendrocytes and heterogeneous reactive astrocyte populations. Our analyses unveiled unexpected commonalities in the transcriptional response of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and astrocytes to ischemic injury. Moreover, OPCs and reactive astrocytes were involved in a shared immuno-glial cross talk with stroke specific myeloid cells. <italic>In situ</italic>, osteopontin positive myeloid cells accumulated in close proximity to proliferating OPCs and reactive astrocytes, which expressed the osteopontin receptor CD44, within the perilesional zone specifically. <italic>In vitro</italic>, osteopontin increased the migratory capacity of OPCs. Collectively, our study highlights molecular cross talk events which might govern the cellular composition and microenvironment of infarcted brain tissue in the early stages of recovery.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq)</kwd><kwd>ischemic stroke</kwd><kwd>cerebral ischemia</kwd><kwd>oligodendrocytes</kwd><kwd>oligodendrocyte precursor cells</kwd><kwd>astrocytes</kwd><kwd>myeloid cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The brain is among the most metabolically costly mammalian organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>] and hence particularly vulnerable to ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. The sudden deprivation of oxygen and substrate availability in the brain parenchyma triggers a cascade of complex pathophysiological events, culminating in the loss of neural tissue and lasting neurological dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. In humans, this oxygen and substrate deprivation is most often caused by an acute, critical reduction of cerebral blood flow, due to the occlusion of large cerebral arteries, the most common cause of ischemic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Ischemic stroke is the second leading cause of disability and death worldwide and the global disease burden of ischemic stroke has been predicted to increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Apart from supportive care, all currently approved acute treatment strategies, that is thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, aim to reinstate cerebral blood flow and are generally only effective when initiated within a timeframe of under 24h after stroke onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>]. Therefore, the lack of treatment strategies directed at neural tissue regeneration constitute an important unmet therapeutic need. Nevertheless, spontaneous, albeit typically incomplete, regain of function after stroke is common and already observable within the acute phase of recovery, ranging from approximately 1 to 7 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Numerous endogenous recovery mechanisms of the injured CNS have thus been postulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Cerebral ischemia triggers a breakdown of neurovascular unit (NVU) integrity, inflammation, neuronal cell death and white matter injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>]. This tissue damage is met with pronounced transcriptional, biochemical and morphological changes in glial cells, including reactive astrogliosis and early remyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref>]. However, current knowledge on the phenotypic heterogeneity within each reactive cell type and their precise interactions during the acute recovery from cerebral ischemic injury is still limited. Single-cell sequencing technologies have proven to be highly effective in addressing the challenges posed by the complex cellular heterogeneity of the CNS, in health and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>]. Arguably, most efforts in dissecting single cell transcriptomes after cerebral ischemia have been directed at immune and vascular cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">105</xref>]. Thus far, particularly few studies have captured sufficient oligodendrocyte linage cells to identify robust subtype specific transcriptional changes following stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Moreover, extensive transcriptional comparisons between reactivate astrocytes and oligodendrocyte lineage cells in response to cerebral ischemia are still lacking.</p><p id="P5">Here we generated a large-scale single nucleus transcriptome dataset of the brain’s acute response to ischemic stroke. We dissected subtype specific transcriptional signatures of stroke reactive neuroglia, compared subtype specific astrocyte and oligodendrocyte lineage cell responses and contrasted these changes with gene expressional profiles found in other CNS injuries. Our study highlights common immuno-glial molecular crosstalk events between myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) and reactive astrocytes, which might shape the cellular composition and microenvironment during early post ischemic neural regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Study approval/ Ethics statement</title><p id="P6">All <italic>in vivo</italic> animal experiments were performed in accordance with the French ethical law (Decree 2013-118) and the European Union directive (2010/63/EU).

Throughout the experiments, animals were maintained in standard husbandry conditions (temperature: 22 ± 2°C; hygrometry: 50 ± 20%), under reversed light-dark cycle (light from 08:00 to 20:00), with ad libitum access to water and food. Animals were housed at two per cage in the presence of enrichment.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Permanent Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model</title><p id="P8">Cerebral ischemia was induced by intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2-2.5%) in a mixture of O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>O (30%/70%). During surgery, animal temperature was monitored with a rectal probe and was maintained at 37.5 °C with a heating pad. To induce permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) a silicone rubber-coated monofilament (size 5-0, diameter 0.15mm, length 30 mm; diameter with coating 0.38 +/- 0.02 mm; Doccol, Sharon, MA, USA) was introduced into the lumen of the right external carotid, advanced through the internal carotid, and gently pushed up to the origin of the MCA. After wound stitching, the rats were returned to their home cage after receiving analgesics (buprenorphine, 0.05 mg/kg, subcutaneously). In Sham operated animals all experimental procedures were performed except for the filament insertion.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</title><p id="P9">To confirm successful induction of ischemic stroke and determine the anatomical localization of the stroke lesion MRI was carried out 48h after stroke onset, on a Pharmascan 7T MRI system, using surface coils (Bruker, Germany), following a previously described approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. For lesion volume evaluation, T2-weighted images were acquired using a multislice multiecho sequence: TE/TR 33 ms/2500 ms. Lesion sizes were quantified on these images using ImageJ software.

For single nucleus RNA sequencing studies whole brains were extracted and swiftly cut into standardized coronal sections using an adult rat brain slicer matrix (BSRAS003-1, with 3mm coronal section intervals, Zivic Instruments, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and hemispheres were separated. Coronal slices, separated by hemisphere were then immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further transport on dry ice.</p><p id="P11">For Immunofluorescence assays anesthetized animals were transcardially perfused with DPBS, followed by perfusion with 4%PFA in DPBS, brains were harvested whole, further post fixed overnight in 4%PFA in DPBS, and washed three times in DPBS. Brains were then stored in DPBS with 0.05% Sodium Azide at 4°C until further processing. To match the anatomical regions used for snRNAseq assays, brains where cut into standardized coronal sections using the same adult rat brain slicer matrix (BSRAS003-1), described above. After cutting, brain tissue was dehydrated and embedded in paraffin.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Single nuclei preparation</title><p id="P12">Single nuclei suspensions were prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].

Suspensions were then strained into 15 ml polypropylene tubes (cat#: 430766, Corning, Corning, NY, USA) over 70 μm strainers (cat#: 542070, Greiner Bio-One International GmbH, Kremsmünster, Austria), 4 ml of ice cold nuclei extraction buffer were added, followed by centrifugation at 500 g, 4°C, for 5 min on a swing bucket centrifuge (Allegra X-12R, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Supernatant was decanted and the pellet was resuspended in 0.25% (vol/vol) Glycerol (cat#: G5516, Sigma Aldrich) and 5% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA) (cat#A-9647, Sigma Aldrich) in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (cat# 14190-94, Gibco, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)) (=nucleus wash buffer (NWB1), buffer composition derived from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]. Suspensions were then strained through 40 μm strainers (cat#: 352340, Falcon®, Corning) and centrifuged at a swing bucket centrifuge at 500 g, 4°C for 5 min. The pellet containing nuclei and debris was resuspended in a Tricin-KOH buffered (pH 7.8), 10% Iodixanol solution (10% Iodixanol (OptiPrep™, cat#: 7820, STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada), 25 mM KCl (cat#: 60142), 5 mM MgCl2 (cat#: M1028), 20 mM Tricin (cat#: T0377) KOH (cat#: 484016), 200 mM Sucrose (cat#: S0389), all from Sigma Aldrich) and gently layered on top of a 20% Iodixanol gradient cushion (20% Iodixanol, 150mM Sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tricine-KOH, pH 7.8) in 14x89 mm thin wall polypropylene centrifuge tubes (cat#: 344059, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). An Optima L-80 Ultracentrifuge (serial#: Col94H18, Beckman Coulter), with swing bucket SW41 Ti cartridges, precooled to 4°C was used for gradient centrifugation at 10000g, for 30 min, with maximal acceleration and no brake. Following centrifugation, debris fractions were discarded and the purified nuclei pellet was resuspended in ice cold NWB1 and strained over 30 μm strainers (cat#: 130-098-458, Miltenyi). The suspension was centrifuged at a swing bucket centrifuge at 500g, 4°C, for 5 min, supernatant was discarded and nuclei were resuspended in a solution of 3% BSA, 0.125% Glycerol, in DPBS (=NWB2). This washing step was repeated once. Finally, nuclei were resuspended in a solution of 1.5% BSA in DPBS on ice. To obtain nuclei counts, nuclei were stained using the Acridine Orange/Propidium Iodide (AO/PI) Cell Viability Kit (cat#: F23001, Logos Biosystems, Anyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea). Nuclei were counted as PI positive events using a LUNA-FL™ Dual Fluorescence Cell Counter (cat#: L20001 Logos Biosystems). The fraction of non lysed Acridine Orange + cells was &lt;5% in all samples.

In brief, for Gel Beads-in-Emulsion (GEMs) generation we loaded nuclei onto Chromium™ Next GEM Chips K (PN-1000286, 10 × Genomics), aiming at a recovery of 10-12x10<sup>3</sup> nuclei per lane, followed by GEM reverse transcription (GEM-RT) and clean up. GEM-RT products were subjected to 14 cycle of cDNA amplification using 10X poly(dT) primers, followed by 10X 5’ gene expression library construction. The Single Index Kit TT Set A (PN 1000215, 10X Genomics) was used for sample indexing during library construction. SPRIselect Reagent Kit (cat#: B23318, Beckman Coulter) beads were used for clean-up procedures, as per 10X protocols instructions. The quality of the obtained libraries was assessed using a DNA screen tape D5000 on a TapeStation 4150 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and cDNA was quantified using a Qubit 1xdsDNA HS assay kit (cat#: Q33231) on a QuBit 4.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific).

Major quality control metrics for all individual datasets are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Fig.2a</xref>. Following unbiased clustering analysis, we first grouped all nuclei into 6 non-neuronal and 23 neuronal (12 glutamatergic, 1 cholinergic, 10 GABAergic) major cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b</xref>), using well established marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c</xref>).

Glutamatergic neurons were broadly split into <italic>Satb2</italic> expressing (GLU_Satb2+), thus predominantly isocortical and <italic>Satb2</italic> negative, thus predominantly allocortical, and deep grey matter glutamatergic neurons (GLU_Satb2-). As previously described GLU_Satb2+ neurons could be well segregated using cortical layer specific markers. We identified one cholinergic interneuron cluster (CHOL_IN). GABAergic neurons grouped into various interneuron (GABA_IN) and medium spiny neuron populations (GABA_MSN). GABA_IN were moreover separated into various <italic>Adarb2</italic> positive (GABA_IN_Adarb2+), thus likely caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) derived and <italic>Adarb2</italic> negative (GABA_IN_Adarb2-), thus likely medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) derived inhibitory interneuron clusters. One GABAergic cluster could not be characterized using known inhibitory subset specific markers and was thus termed ambiguous GABAergic neuronal cluster (GABA_Amb).

Notably, the expression of SAMC signature genes was well conserved across MG_1 and MΦe_1 to 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Fig.3d</xref>), suggesting that microglia and macrophages converge onto a common phenotype within infarcted brain parenchyma, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. We then systematically assessed overlaps between the gene signatures of the stroke enriched myeloid cells in our datasets and previously described microglia and macrophage gene expression profiles in normal development and various neuropathologies. MG_1 and MΦe_1 to 3 exhibited robust enrichment for Axon Tract-Associated Microglia (ATM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] and disease-associated microglia (DAM) but not disease inflammatory macrophage (DIM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>] associated transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Fig.3d,e</xref>). Furthermore, these clusters overlapped clearly with the transcriptional phenotype of “foamy” microglia enriched in multiple sclerosis (MS) chronic active lesion edges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], while the profile of iron associated, activated MS microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>] was more restricted to MΦe clusters and less prominently represented in our dataset.

Other MS associated myeloid cell profiles (for example associated to chronic lesions, antigen presentation and phagocytosis) mapped more diffusely over all myeloid cell clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Fig.3e</xref>).

MΦe cluster markers also indicated the production of and reaction to reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Fig.3f</xref>).

This signature mapped to a discrete subset of this cluster, which upon unsupervised subclustering analysis was revealed to be carried exclusively by misclustered oligodendrocytes but not neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Fig.5c,d</xref>). Hence, this cluster did not disclose a set of neurons with particular vulnerability to ischemia, but rather underpinned the responsiveness of neuroglia to ischemic injury.

Therefore, we interrogated these cell populations in more detail. We first jointly sub clustered OLIGO_1 and OLIGO_2. After manual removal of two clusters with evident neuronal transcript contamination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Fig.6a-d</xref>), 10 sub clusters remained, which could be largely grouped according to canonical developmental stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage trajectory. Specifically, we identified two oligodendrocyte precursor cell clusters (OPC_0, OPC_1), one committed oligodendrocyte precursor cell cluster (COP), one newly formed oligodendrocyte cluster (NFOLIGO), two myelin forming oligodendrocyte clusters (MFOLIGO_1 and MFOLIGO_2) and three mature oligodendrocyte clusters (MOLIGO_1 to MOLIGO_3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2a</xref>). Lastly, one sub cluster faintly expressed markers of oligodendrocytes and immune cell associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2a</xref>). Strikingly, the majority of immune cell transcripts, within this sub cluster was derived from the MCAO ipsi datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Fig.6e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary notes</xref>).

Pseudotime trajectory analysis indicated that the stroke specific sub cluster OPC_1 branched directly from the conserved sub cluster OPC_0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2b</xref>). As expected, the mature oligodendrocyte clusters were associated to the highest pseudo time values. We identified a prominent trajectory bifurcation within MOLIGO_0, with one stroke specific branch encompassing MOLIGO_1 and one branch extending to MOLIGO_2, which was conserved across all groups.

Remarkably, the gene expression profiles of the conserved clusters differed little between the infarcted and contralateral hemisphere, with the exception of MC_OLIGO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Fig.7a</xref>), which was enriched in immune process and myeloid cell associated genes in MCAO ipsi as described above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Fig.6e</xref>). Likewise, the gene expression profiles of most conserved clusters were similar in the MCAO ipsi and Sham datasets, with the notable exception of OPC_0 (Total DEG: 50), MOLIGO_0 (Total DEG: 185) and MC_OLIGO (Total DEG: 98) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Fig.7b</xref>). Interestingly, MOLIGO_0 emerged as the only cluster with notable transcriptional perturbation from the comparison of the MCAO contra to the Sham datasets (Total DEG: 119) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Fig.7c</xref>). Importantly, 102 [96,23%] of the downregulated DEGs in the MOLIGO_0 subcluster in MCAO contra relative to Sham, were also identified in the comparison of MCAO ipsi to Sham (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Fig.7d</xref>) and contained neurexins and neuregulins (e.g. <italic>Nrxn1, Nrxn3, Nrg1, Nrg3</italic>), as well as genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels and ion channel interacting proteins (e.g. <italic>Kcnip4, Grm5, Kcnq5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Fig.7e</xref>). Of note, the downregulation of many of these genes was subtle in terms of gene expression, as they were a priori expressed at low levels in the Sham dataset within the oligodendrocyte lineage clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Fig.7e</xref>).

Notably, the OPC_1 and MOLIGO_1 DEG signature was identified in both mMCAO ipsi and sMCAO ipsi datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Fig.6h,i</xref>). To gain insight into how the stroke specific OPC_1 and MOLIGO_1 gene expression signatures might relate to changes in biological function we performed enrichment analyses (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl.data.file.5</xref>). We also systematically compared the signatures of OPC_1 and MOLIGO_1 to each other and to gene expression profiles of diseases associated oligodendrocytes (DAO), derived from various rodent models of neurodegeneration and demyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Fig.8</xref>, Supp.data.file.1). Transcriptional overlaps between stroke specific oligodendrocyte lineage sub clusters with DAO profiles were generally limited (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Fig.8</xref>). The vast majority of OPC_1 enriched genes mapped to cell cycle progression and proliferation associated terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl.data.file.5</xref>). Enrichment analyses further highlighted, the upregulation of several intracellular scaffold proteins and protein-kinases involved in OPC cell adhesion, migration, survival and differentiation, such as <italic>Iqgap1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>], <italic>Met</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], <italic>Fyn</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>], or <italic>Axl</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>] and indicated extensive interactions of OPC_1 with the extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>).

Notably, several growth factors, such as <italic>Ccnf, Vgf</italic> and <italic>Fgf2</italic> were also upregulated in OPC_1. Conversely, we observed a downregulation of synaptic transmission associated transcripts, particularly concerning potassium and glutamate homeostasis in OPC_1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>).</p><p id="P43">Interestingly, multiple biological processes associated to MOLIGO_1 enriched DEGs, for example Axonogenesis (GO:0007409), or Axon Guidance (R-HSA-422475) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl.data.file.5</xref>), relate to the modulation of neuritogenesis. Several genes encompassed by these gene sets, such as multiple upregulated sempahorines, have more extensive pleiotropic roles in physiological CNS development and pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Similar to OPC_1 several MOLIGO_1 enriched DEGs were associated to ECM interactions and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>). Many of the MOLIGO_1 enriched DEGs (e.g. <italic>Dlg1, Lamc1, Psem4, Sema5b</italic>, or <italic>Cadm1</italic>) were also expressed in less mature oligodendrocyte sub clusters, but absent in the mature oligodendrocyte populations MOLIGO_0 and MOLIGO_2, in the Sham and MCAO contra datasets. Congruently, the expression of the canonical COP and NFOLIGO marker <italic>Bcas1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] was markedly higher in MOLIGO_1 as compared to MOLIGO_0 and MOLIGO_2. Thus, several markers of more immature oligodendrocyte developmental stages were uniquely upregulated in MOLIGO_1, but not other mature oligodendrocyte clusters. Several MOLIGO_1 enriched DEGs were related to Notch, TGF-β and IGF-1 signalling, but also included more elusive signalling molecules, like the TIR-domain-containing adaptor (TRIF) recruiter <italic>Wdfy1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).

Remarkably, 5 modules mapped uniquely to stroke specific sub clusters and mainly consisted of genes which were also identified as OPC_1 or MOLIGO_1 enriched DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Suppl.data.file.6</xref>). Interestingly, the OPC_1 associated modules 4 and 11 consisted mainly of proliferation related genes and mapped over the entire OPC_1 cluster. By contrast, module 5, which contained ECM-interaction, migration, survival and immunomodulatory process associated genes appeared further down on the pseudo temporal trajectory. The aggregate rank score of module 9 increased with incremental distance to the trajectory bifurcation within MOLIGO_0, indicating a dynamic progression from MOLIGO_0 towards MOLIGO_2 specifically within infarcted tissue. This module was permeated by abundant ECM and cell-cell interaction associated genes (e.g. <italic>Adamts1, Cadm1, Cldn14, Col12a1</italic>), as well as other genes previously identified as MOLIGO_1 markers during DEG analysis, as described above (e.g. <italic>Stat3, Wdfy1</italic>).</p><p id="P46">Additionally, we inferred transcription factor (TF) activities using a molecular foot print based approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].

Further details on marker gene curation are given in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">supplementary notes</xref>. Of note reactive astrocytes were more abundant in the datasets derived from severe, compared to moderate infarctions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Fig9f</xref>). To characterize these reactive astrocyte populations in more detail, we compared each reactive astrocyte cluster to the homeostatic subclusters (AC_1 and AC_2) using DEG analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Suppl.data.file.8</xref>).

Inference of functional characteristics from the DEGs of the reactive astrocyte subclusters (AC_3 to AC_5), using enrichment analyses highlighted notable communalities, particularly between the gene signatures of AC_3 and AC_4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Suppl.data.file.9</xref>). For instance, tight (e.g. <italic>Tjp1, Tjp2</italic>) and adherence (e.g. <italic>Vcl</italic>) junction components related to blood brain barrier maintenance were upregulated in both AC_3 and AC_4. Furthermore, several upregulated DEGs in AC_3 and AC_4 related to various ECM interaction, wound healing and cell motility and migration related terms to varying degrees. For example, some cadherin binding related genes (e.g. <italic>Cald1, Cdh2</italic>) were more enriched in AC_3, matrix metalloprotease coding genes (e.g. <italic>Adamts1, Adamts9</italic>) were upregulated in both, as was <italic>Cd44</italic>, and various Integrin family member (e.g. <italic>Itga1, Itga5</italic>).

Overall the transcriptional signature of AC_3 and AC_4 suggest a complex injury response, marked by ECM reorganization, increased migration and involvement in bidirectional communication with other brain parenchymal and infiltrating cell types. AC_5 lacked several of the aforementioned transcriptional features of AC_3 and AC_4, but shared the upregulation of several pan reactive astrocyte markers such as <italic>Gfap, Cp</italic>, or <italic>Vim</italic> with the other reactive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Fig10a</xref>).

Intriguingly, we inferred 129 LR pairs specific to infarcted brain tissue and grouped them into immuno-glial (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Fig.11a-e</xref>) and intra-glial (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Fig.12a-e</xref>) interactions. These interactions corroborated multiple recently inferred stroke response signalling axes, for example between microglia and oligodendrocyte lineage subsets (e.g. Igf1-&gt;Igf1r, Thbs1-&gt;Cd47, Psap-&gt;Gpr37) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Interestingly, within infarcted tissue specifically, macrophage enriched myeloid cell clusters (MΦe) were predicted to signal abundantly via Fibronectin (<italic>Fn1</italic>) onto both myeloid and neuroglia subsets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Fig.11b-d</xref>). Cell surface glycoproteins, such as myelin associated glycoprotein (<italic>Mag</italic>), various integrin and syndecan family members and CD44 were the most commonly predicted Fibronectin receptors on myeloid and neuroglial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Figs.11-12</xref>). Notably, astrocytes were also predicted to signal via fibronectin -&gt; glycoprotein receptor signalling onto various myeloid and neuroglial subsets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Figs.11e-12d,e</xref>). Glycoprotein receptors indeed emerged as signalling hubs on various myeloid and neuroglial subsets. For instance, Cd44 was inferred to be targeted by various ECM associated ligands such as fibronectin (<italic>Fn1</italic>), various collagens (e.g. <italic>Col4a1, Col6a3</italic>), <italic>Spp1</italic> encoding osteopontin, but also growth factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor (<italic>Hgf</italic>) or heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (<italic>Hbegf</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Suppl.Figs.11-12</xref>).

Comparatively, the response of oligodendrocyte lineage cells to ischemic stroke has been less extensively interrogated. Moreover, the phenotypic heterogeneity within each neuroglial subpopulation and their molecular cross talk upon ischemic injury are insufficiently understood, impeding a holistic perspective on the pathobiology of ischemic stroke. Here we addressed these challenges by generating a large scale single cell resolution transcriptomic dataset of the mammalian brain’s acute response to ischemic stroke.</p><p id="P63">Overall, neuroglial clusters emerged as the most transcriptionally perturbed cell populations within our dataset. Within the oligodendrocyte lineage we detected two transcriptional cell states which were almost uniquely detected within infarcted hemispheres. In line with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], we found proliferating OPCs at the perilesional zone of the infarcted hemisphere. However, beyond cell cycle progression the transcriptome of these cells indicated the activation of multiple survival, migration, ECM interaction and growth factor related pathways. This observation suggests pleiotropic roles of OPCs during the brains wound healing response to ischemic injury. Indeed, although oligodendrogenesis and hence contribution to myelination are historically the most prominently described features of OPCs, they are increasingly realized to have more multifaceted roles, particularly in response to injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref>].</p><p id="P64">The second infarction associated oligodendrocyte cell state occupied a unique branch at the opposite edge of the oligodendrocyte developmental trajectory. Remarkably, these oligodendrocytes also upregulated the immature oligodendrocyte marker BCAS- and expressed several cell-cell and cell-ECM interaction associated genes, typically enriched in immature oligodendrocytes. This observation might indicate an incomplete ischemic injury induced reacquisition of immature oligodendrocytes features in a subset of mature oligodendrocytes, a speculation necessitating further investigation. Interestingly, we did not detect a clear myelination associated gene signature within these cells. On the contrary, several myelin genes (e.g. <italic>Mobp, Mbp</italic>) were subtly downregulated and the inferred activity of several myelination and differentiation associated TFs was decreased in these cells, as compared to homeostatic mature oligodendrocytes. This observation suggests either that these oligodendrocytes are not yet fully devoted to remyelination at this early post ischemic time point, or that they assume alternative functions during the ischemic wound healing progression. As we have only sampled brain tissue 48h post injury, our study is not suited to answer this question conclusively, inviting further investigations. Importantly, recent research has demonstrated a limited and aberrant remyelination capacity of oligodendrocytes surviving demyelination compared to newly formed, progenitor derived oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>]. We therefore propose that future work elucidating the potentially divergent fates and remyelination capacities of OPCs and <italic>a priori</italic> mature oligodendrocytes, following ischemic injury will be crucial.</p><p id="P65">The transcriptional overlap between the stroke associated oligodendrocyte lineage clusters within our dataset with previously described DAO signatures was overall limited, possibly indicating a fine tuned ischemia specific injury response. However, the DAO signature reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Pandey et al. (2022)</xref> are derived from rodent models of neurodegeneration and de-/remyelination with disease courses ranging from multiple weeks to months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that the 48h post injury sampling time point in our study was too early to observe the emergence of a more prominent DAO-like signature. Moreover, other diverging neurodegeneration associated DAO signatures have been reported and contain further partial overlaps to the stroke associated oligodendrocyte lineage cells in our dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>], for example regarding the upregulation of interleukin 33 (<italic>Il33)</italic>. However, within our sample <italic>Il33</italic> was not upregulated in mature stroke associated oligodendrocyte but robustly delineated stroke associated OPC in our snRNAseq dataset, as well as <italic>in situ</italic>. Importantly, Il33 was shown to exert neuroprotective effects during cerebral ischemia via ST2 mediated immunomodulatory signalling onto microglia and regulatory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>]. Moreover, Il33 was implicated in the physiological progression of OPCs to mature oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>]. The upregulation of Il33 in OPCs during cerebral ischemia might hence be involved in multiple neuroprotective pathways.</p><p id="P66">The majority of reactive astrocytes within our dataset upregulated gene sets associated to BBB maintenance, migration, cell-cell and ECM interaction, in line with previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>]. This transcriptional profile corresponds well to the canonical roles of astrocytes in ECM scaffold formation and spatial containment of the neurotoxic core lesions microenvironment following CNS injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>]. As expected, the reactive astrocyte signatures within our dataset overlapped with the canonical ischemia associated A2-signature, but not with the inflammation induced A1-signature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref>]. Interestingly, the stroke reactive astrocyte transcriptomes in our dataset overlapped partially with MS “reactive/stressed astrocytes” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] and neurodegeneration associated DAA signatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], highlighting common astrocyte responses to diverse neuronal injuries. Notably, we identified a small, predominantly severe infarction derived, subset of reactive astrocytes (AC_5), characterized by an upregulation of primary cilium associated genes. Intriguingly, a similar enrichment of primary cilium associated genes was previously identified in reactive astrocyte subsets in MS and Parkinson’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>]. Furthermore, Wei et al. have recently characterized a population of astrocyte-ependymal cells in spinal cord tissue which expanded after acute injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>]. This population shared several transcriptional similarities with the reactive AC_5 subcluster in our dataset such as the upregulation of <italic>Rfx3</italic> and Dnah encoding genes and increased Foxj1 TF activity. The precise origin and function of cilia gene enriched or astrocyte-ependymal cell states in response to CNS injuries are still largely unknown. Astrocytes and ependymal cells are developmentally closely related and they form a common transcriptional taxon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">104</xref>]. Limited by the low number of captured AC_5 nuclei and the single sampling time point in our study, we can thus far not conclude whether the expansion of the AC_5 cluster upon MCAO was caused by the acquisition of ependymal cell features by astrocytes, upregulation of reactive astrocytes genes in ependymal cells, or both. Further studies will be necessary to unveil the elusive role of these cells in ischemic stroke and other neuropathologies.</p><p id="P67">Under physiological conditions astrocytes are crucially involved in the regulation of ion and neurotransmitter signalling, as well as synapse assembly and maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>]. Our findings indicate a possible loss of these homeostatic functions in stroke reactive astrocytes. Likewise, oligodendrocyte lineage cells are increasingly recognized to be coupled to neuronal neurotransmitter signalling via bidirectional cross talk, at OPC and axo-myelinic synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref>]. Interestingly, similarly to astrocytes, multiple neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels and ion channel interacting proteins were downregulated in oligodendrocyte lineage cells upon cerebral ischemia. Some of these genes were also downregulated subtly in the hemisphere contralateral to infarction. Further studies will be necessary to assess whether these changes functionally relate to possible disruptions of homeostatic oligodendroglia-neuronal crosstalk.</p><p id="P68">While comparing the cerebral ischemia induced transcriptional perturbations in oligodendrocyte lineage cells and astrocytes we noticed further, more prominent similarities between infarction restricted oligodendrocyte lineage and astrocyte populations. Similar to reactive astrocytes, infarction restricted OPCs upregulated migration, cell-cell and ECM-interaction genes (e.g. <italic>Met, Cdh2, Tnc, Adamts1, Adamts9, Vim, Cd44</italic>) and colocalized with reactive astrocytes at the perilesional zone. It is thus possible that the perilesional microenvironment instructs a shared phenotype onto these populations. The partial acquisition of reactive astrocyte associated genes in oligodendrocytes after injury has also been noted in previous studies. Importantly, Kirdajova et al. have documented the emergence of a stroke specific, transient, proliferating “Astrocyte-like NG2 glia” population seven days after focal cerebral ischemia and speculated that this population might contribute to early glial scar formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Although, a subset of OPCs progresses to myelinating oligodendrocytes following ischemic stroke particularly in young animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], a substantial amount of OPCs remains undifferentiated for up to eight weeks post injury, suggesting potential alternative cell fates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p id="P69">More recently it was also shown that <italic>bona fide</italic> mature oligodendrocytes can dedifferentiate via a hybrid “AO cell” state into astrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>, in the days to weeks following traumatic and ischemic brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. This phenotypic switch was causally linked to IL6 signalling. Interestingly, the infarction enriched mature oligodendrocytes in our dataset would be primed to respond to this cytokine due to the prominent upregulation of canonical downstream targets of IL6, such as <italic>Il6st</italic> and <italic>Stat3</italic>. However, the transcriptional similarities between reactive OPCs, oligodendrocytes and astrocyte cluster within our datasets do not necessarily indicate that they harbour the progeny of hybrid cell states. Moreover, overlaps in gene and TF signatures do not unequivocally dictate shared functions during neural regeneration. For example, traumatic injury induced STAT3 activation in astrocytes is involved in GFAP upregulation, induction of cellular hypertrophy and glial scar formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], while in oligodendrocytes STAT3 signalling was implicated in maturation and remyelination after focal demyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>]. Further studies will be necessary to decipher the precise functional consequences of the herein described gene expressional changes in oligodendroglia and astrocytes.</p><p id="P70">The recruitment of reactive neuroglia and immune cells to the injury site is a crucial step during the acute ischemic injury response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Our data indicate that myeloid cells might be involved in orchestrating this process. We confirmed the emergence of SAMC specifically within infarcted brain tissue. The sparsity of myeloid cells within non-lesioned brain tissue is a previously elaborated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] limitation of our nuclei isolation approach and impeded a direct comparison of SAMC to homeostatic microglia within this study, which has already been conducted elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Although the herein used method of nuclei isolation is prone to exclude immune cells, they were robustly captured within infarcted tissue, highlighting their drastically increased abundance in the infarct lesion. The clearance of lipid-rich tissue debris has been established as a primary function of SAMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], although alternative functions, such as the reduction of ROS stress, have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Here we observed that myeloid cells expressing the canonical SAMC marker osteopontin accumulate in close proximity to reactive astrocytes and proliferating OPCs which robustly expressed the osteopontin receptor CD44 in the perilesional zone. Furthermore, we were able to show that osteopontin increased the migratory capacity of OPCs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Indeed, osteopontin is a well-established inductor of cellular migration in numerous cell types and has been implicated to act as a chemotactic cue via CD44 mediated signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>]. In addition, CD44 was shown to be indispensable for the migration of transplanted rat OPC-like CG4 cells towards focal demyelinated lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>], and macrophage derived osteopontin was shown to induce the extension of astrocyte processes towards the infarct perilesional zone following focal cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. The accumulation of CD44 positive astrocytes and immune cells in the peri-infarct zone was previously shown and associated to a homing towards the CD44 ligand hyaluronic acid, which also accumulates at the peri-infarct border [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>]. Importantly, our CCC analysis inferred that CD44 is indeed targeted by multiple ligands in infarcted tissue specifically. Likewise, osteopontin was predicted to signal onto multiple other receptors, such as integrins which was previously also associated to increased migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">106</xref>]. As the recruitment of neuroglia and immune cells to the site of injury is a prerequisite for further regenerative mechanisms, it is highly plausible that multiple redundant mechanisms have evolved to achieve this. Moreover, the role of osteopontin in ischemic stroke likely exceeds the regulation of cellular migration, although its precise contribution to post ischemic regeneration is still controversial. For example, osteopontin has been shown to acutely aggravate ischemia-induced BBB disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>], but augment white matter integrity via immunomodulatory mechanisms, in the subacute to chronic stages of stroke recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>]. A further complicating factor is the age dependency of many molecular cross talk events during the response to cerebral ischemia. For example, osteopontin to CD44 signaling was largely restricted to young animals in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. The fact that our results are based on a homogenous cohort of young, male rats is an evident limitation that has to be taken into account when extrapolating translational considerations from this dataset.</p><p id="P71">In summary, our study captured the emergence of cell type and cerebral infarction specific transcriptional signatures in neuroglia. Although, reactive oligodendrocyte lineage cells and astrocytes exhibited distinct responses their transcriptional signatures overlapped substantially, indicating a shared molecular ischemia response repertoire and possibly shared functions during regeneration. Moreover, we uncovered a shared immuno-glial molecular cross talk, which implicated myeloid cells as contributors to OPC and reactive astrocyte recruitment to the injury site via the osteopontin CD44 signaling axis. Beyond the diverse transcriptional response patterns highlighted in our analysis, the large scale dataset generated within this study will provide an instrumental resource for the interrogation of acute cell type specific responses to ischemic stroke. We propose, that this approach will contribute to untangle the complex mechanisms governing post ischemic neural regeneration, ultimately aiding in the discovery of novel treatment strategies to alleviate the devastating consequences of ischemic stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Suppl.data.file.1</label><media xlink:href="EMS193135-supplement-Suppl_data_file_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d155aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Suppl.data.file.2</label><media xlink:href="EMS193135-supplement-Suppl_data_file_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d155aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Suppl.data.file.3</label><media xlink:href="EMS193135-supplement-Suppl_data_file_3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d155aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Suppl.data.file.4</label><media xlink:href="EMS193135-supplement-Suppl_data_file_4.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d155aAdEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Suppl.data.file.5</label><media xlink:href="EMS193135-supplement-Suppl_data_file_5.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d155aAdEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Suppl.data.file.6</label><media xlink:href="EMS193135-supplement-Suppl_data_file_6.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d155aAdEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Suppl.data.file.7</label><media xlink:href="EMS193135-supplement-Suppl_data_file_7.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d155aAdEhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Suppl.data.file.8</label><media xlink:href="EMS193135-supplement-Suppl_data_file_8.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d155aAdEiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD9"><label>Suppl.data.file.9</label><media xlink:href="EMS193135-supplement-Suppl_data_file_9.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d155aAdEjB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD10"><label>Suppl.data.file.10</label><media xlink:href="EMS193135-supplement-Suppl_data_file_10.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d155aAdEkB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD11"><label>Supplementary information</label><media xlink:href="EMS193135-supplement-Supplementary_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d155aAdElB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S36"><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We would like to thank Hans Peter Haselsteiner and the CRISCAR Familienstiftung for their ongoing support of the Medical University/Aposcience AG public private partnership aiming to augment basic and translational clinical research in Austria/Europe.

Cells were seeded in 2 well culture inserts, creating defined 500 μm gaps. NG2 positive cells which migrated into the 500 μm gap were quantified after 48 h of treatment. Representative images of OPC cell cultures 48 h after incubation without (upper panel: untreated control = UC), or with 1 μg/ml OPN (lower panel), stained for DAPI (nuclei) = blue, Ki67 = magenta and NG2 = cyan, split by channel. Scale bars denote 500 μm gaps. Box plots on the right show the number of NG2 positive cells, which migrated into 500 μm gaps, for each condition, p-values derived from unpaired student’s t-test (t=3,097, df=14, n=8 replicates per group, from 2 independent experiments). In n = 4 replicates per group from 2 independent experiments Ki67 was visualized. Lower Boxplot depicts the percentages of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells within the 500 μm gap, for each condition, p values derived from unpaired student’s t-test (t=0,7150, df=6). <bold>(b)</bold> BrdU incorporation assay. BrdU incorporation was visualized 24h after incubation without (UC) (upper panel) or with 1 μg/ml OPN (lower panel). Representative 20x magnification images are shown, stained for DAPI (Nuclei) = blue, BrdU = magenta and NG2 = cyan, split by channel. Scale bars = 100 μm. Boxplot depicts the percentages of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells, for each group, p values derived from unpaired student’s t-test (t=0,8219, df=6, n=4 replicates per group, from 1 independent experiment).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS193135-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
