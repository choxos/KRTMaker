However, when sequences emerge during neurodevelopment remains unknown. We demonstrate that structured firing sequences are present in spontaneous activity of human and murine brain organoids and <italic>ex vivo</italic> neonatal brain slices from the murine somatosensory cortex. We observed a balance between temporally rigid and flexible firing patterns that are emergent phenomena in human and murine brain organoids and early postnatal murine somatosensory cortex, but not in primary dissociated cortical cultures. Our findings suggest that temporal sequences do not arise in an experience-dependent manner, but are rather constrained by an innate preconfigured architecture established during neurogenesis. These findings highlight the potential for brain organoids to further explore how exogenous inputs can be used to refine neuronal circuits and enable new studies into the genetic mechanisms that govern assembly of functional circuitry during early human brain development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In the last decades, a growing body of experimental evidence has begun to support the notion that intrinsic activity plays a central role in brain function, challenging the traditional Jamesian view that higher order function is an emergent product of sensory input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. More recently, analysis of the mesoscale wiring of the cortex has revealed a connectome dominated by recurrent cortical networks that follow lognormal scaling rules that are conserved across species, where only a minor portion of those connections are devoted to direct transfer of sensory input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Within cortical circuitry, both spatial and functional properties of neurons follow lognormal distributions, which include synaptic strengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, size of dendritic spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, diameter of axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and neuronal firing rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, which together establish the functional architecture of the large-scale brain connectome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The skewed distribution of these parameters is thought to serve as a substrate of neuronal assemblies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, where groups of strongly interconnected neurons can generate temporally structured spiking activity, which organize into sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Sequential activity patterns represent discrete and temporally consolidated packets of neuronal activity proposed as the basic building blocks of neural coding and information broadcasting within the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In mature brain circuits, spiking sequences are predictive indicators for spatial navigation tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and memory formation within the murine hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and through a phenomena called âpreplayâ are used to encode novel experience through a pre-existing repertoire of sequence motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Such sequences emerge prior to explicit experience-dependent navigational representations (e.g. before exploration beyond the nest)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Similarly, in the murine visual cortex, evoked responses closely mirror spontaneous sequential patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Similar phenomena have also been reported in the human cortex, where the replay of sequences underlies episodic memory formation and retrieval<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, spiking sequences in the human anterior temporal lobe organize into a temporal backbone. This backbone consists of both rigid and flexible sequence elements that are stable over time and cognitive states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, support visual categorization tasks in the human visual cortex and were shown to encode non-redundant information beyond latency and rate encoding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Reliable activation of sequences are also present in the reptilian cortex that share a common primordial ancestral origin with mammals, which suggests a conserved function across phylogeny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, the emergence of spiking sequences during development is not yet well understood. During the third postnatal week, the murine hippocampus generates spiking sequences that resemble those that will later be produced during navigation in a linear environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Importantly, these sequences emerge in an experience-independent manner and do not improve upon additional experience in the same postnatal week. Whether similar spiking sequences, potentially representing other forms of experience, exist in other brain areas or at earlier developmental stages remains an open question. The existence of such sequences would provide strong evidence in support of the notion that the brain is in a preconfigured state, where spiking sequences are not experience-dependent but are instead constrained by an innate architecture that is established during neurogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. To address this open question, we investigated large scale single-unit activity datasets recorded from different models of brain development: (1) human-derived brain organoids generated by two independent laboratories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, (2) murine-derived brain organoids of dorsal forebrain identity grown from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), (3) <italic>ex vivo</italic> murine brain slices from the somatosensory cortex and, (4) dissociated two-dimensional primary murine cortical cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> that lack developmental organization.</p><p id="P3">Brain organoids are three-dimensional human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived models of the human brain that recapitulate key facets of the anatomical organization and cellular composition found in the developing brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Neurons within brain organoids form functional synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and establish spontaneous network activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. These self-organized neuronal systems contain cellular diversity and cytoarchitecture necessary to sustain complex network dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> as evidenced by expression of layer specific excitatory pyramidal neurons and generation and incorporation of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Brain organoids also generate local field potential oscillations (LFP) that mirror preterm EEG patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, and have been used to model network dynamics associated with rare genetic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Brain organoids can be readily interfaced with state-of-the-art high-resolution CMOS microelectrode arrays to record neuronal activity and LFP oscillations across 26,400 recording sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Furthermore, brain organoids are not âconnectedâ to any sensory system, and thus represent an ideal model for studying the emergence of spiking sequences as a truly experience-independent phenomenon.</p><p id="P4">The <italic>ex vivo</italic> rodent dataset consists of acute neonatal slice recordings from the murine somatosensory cortex. At this developmental stage, the somatosensory cortex is characterized by discontinuous activity, displaying an alternation of activity bursts with periods of electrical quiescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, and highly correlated activity between spike trains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Both traits are shared with several other cortical areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Importantly, at this stage, with the exception of the olfaction that controls cognitive maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, sensory systems are still underdeveloped<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Accordingly, whisker-elicited sensory responses are mainly the result of passive stimulations by the dam and the littermates in the first postnatal week, while active whisking only emerges around P10-12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Along the same lines, analogously to neural activity in brain organoids, a large portion of neural activity in the developing brain is âspontaneousâ, that is, internally generated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Here, we investigate the spontaneous firing patterns across these different developmental brain models. In all four models, we observed bursting dynamics on the order of 10<sup>2</sup> milliseconds. These bursts reflect the biophysical time constants for the integration of inputs in neural circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, which last longer than single-neuron refractoriness and burstiness alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. We identified a subpopulation of neurons within organoids and neonatal brain slices capable of generating and sustaining non-random sequential firing patterns, referred to as backbone sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. In contrast, two-dimensional primary cultures did not exhibit backbone sequences. Backbone sequence generating neurons populate the tails of right-skewed, lognormal firing rate and functional connectivity distributions. We also reveal that, at a population level, neural activity exhibits a distinct low and high-dimensional neuronal subspace that establishes a partition between sequence generating units and their non-rigid counterparts. In an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting, such firing patterning temporally segregate neuronal populations into strongly correlated, âtemporally rigidâ components, obedient to population dynamics that reside in a low-dimensional subspace, and weakly correlated, âtemporally flexibleâ, firing patterns that are less sensitive to population events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Finally, for stable and flexible computation, theory suggests that neural systems must exist at or near a regime called <italic>criticality</italic>, which is characterized by scale-invariant dynamics across multiple timescales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. At criticality, complex patterns of activity emerge that neither decay rapidly nor saturate the network, maximizing the system's computational capacity. Using temporal renormalization group theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, we quantified the distance of each preparation from criticality (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub>). This approach revealed that brain organoids, <italic>ex vivo</italic> brain slices, and two-dimensional primary cultures can generate near-critical dynamics. A subset of each type of preparation exhibited temporal correlations that spanned multiple timescales. In contrast, shuffled data failed to capture scale free features of activity. Given that neuronal circuits within brain organoids establish non-random, sequence generating dynamics that emerge in a truly experience-independent manner and maintain near-critical dynamics, these findings have important implications for understanding organizational principles that govern network preconfiguration and activity patterns that support a neural code<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Neuronal firing patterns in human brain organoids generate repetitive and variable burst sequences</title><p id="P6">We investigated the temporal dynamics of spontaneous neuronal activity generated by brain organoids of prominent forebrain identity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> using high-density CMOS-based microelectrode arrays. These arrays contain 26,400 recording sites (electrode pitch of 17.5 Âµm) of which 1,024 can be selected and recorded simultaneously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. Single-unit spike events, visualized as a raster plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) reveal the temporal evolution of spontaneous spiking dynamics in an 8-month old organoid slice positioned on the array. Population level burst events are highlighted by sharp increases in the population rate (red line <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>) and persist for several hundred milliseconds, followed by longer periods of relative quiescence lasting up to several seconds. Moreover, we observed that the distribution of single-unit firing rates follows a heavy-tailed and right-skewed distribution, well described by a lognormal function, a feature consistent across multiple brain organoids (<italic>n</italic> = 8 organoids, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.97 Â± 0.04, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1A-C</xref>).

Reordering units in time, based on their peak firing rate over the burst width, revealed the presence of sequential activation patterns during individual burst events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, bottom).

Next, we asked if single-unit firing rates were temporally structured in time during burst events at the population level. To perform this analysis, we calculated the cosine similarity between instantaneous firing rates across bursts (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). This analysis revealed a peak in the cosine similarity coinciding with the firing rate increase of the backbone units. Subsequently, after a brief plateau, cosine similarity decayed and bottomed out after the burst ended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-B</xref>). The variance of the similarity between bursts displayed an almost opposite trend: it was high during non-bursting periods, rapidly decreased when the similarity peaked, and remained low until burst termination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To further dissect the composition of firing rate vectors and their contribution to spontaneous burst patterns, we split the population into backbone and non-rigid units. Here, we observed that the backbone ensembles exhibited significantly higher cosine similarity scores (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, blue line) compared to non-rigid units (yellow line), and shuffled data (black line). To illustrate this trend, we showed that the top 20<sup>th</sup> percentile of units (based on their average correlation from the matrix shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) are sufficient to generate a significantly higher average burst similarity than when considering all units and this difference gradually decreases when a larger percentile of the most correlated units are included (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 19A,C</xref>).

When a larger percentile of the least correlated units is included, this difference gradually decreases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 19B,C</xref>). Overall, we observed an increase in average burst similarity during the onset of the backbone units that subsequently plateaus for the remainder of their activation period across several organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 19D</xref> for results across <italic>n</italic> = 8 organoids).

When dividing the populations into backbone and non-rigid groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref> middle and right panel respectively), we observed that backbone units captured a larger variance for the first two PCs (73%) when compared to the non-rigid sub-population (25%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 20-21</xref>). These results highlight that a lower-dimensional subspace is occupied by neurons that fire in backbone ensembles, whereas the non-rigid population exhibit more irregular and, thus, higher-dimensional firing patterns and require more PCs to explain their variance. Of note, the lower-dimensional space is abolished after data randomization preserving both the mean neuron firing rate as well as the population firing rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>).

To further investigate this rich repertoire of spontaneous neuronal firing patterns, we applied a hidden Markov model (HMM).</p><p id="P16">We trained an HMM to cluster single-unit spiking activity, generated by each brain organoid, into discrete states with shared firing patterns. The data was binned into 30 millisecond intervals (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>), reflecting timescales of fast electrophysiological dynamics in the cortex that span ~10-50 milliseconds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. We found varying the HMM time bins over this range did not significantly impact the performance of the model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 22</xref>). The identified HMM states, shaded by different colors and superimposed on spike raster plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), highlight their trajectories in relation to burst peak events. Here, each colored state represents a distinct linear combination of single-unit firing patterns that are coincident across the recorded ensemble. The first fifty firing rate realizations (across all units for a given state) are plotted as heatmap visualizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, left panels). Each representative state plot is accompanied by a histogram of the average firing rate per unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, right panels). These visualizations reveal the presence of distinct manifolds of firing patterns delineated by both differential gain and attenuation of single-unit firing rates associated with each state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, red lines). Here a model with 20 hidden states was used for visualization purposes, but we observe similar-performing models across a range of hidden state counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 23</xref>). To further validate that the transition between states was not a result of trivial differences in the mean rate, we ran our HMM analysis after data randomization, preserving both the neuronâs mean firing rate and population rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>, and observed that the log likelihood was significantly larger for real data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 24</xref>). These results demonstrate the presence of distinct combinations of firing patterns, regularly activated during burst events, captured by the HMM. The average change in firing rate (across all units) between the three states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>) further revealed that these discrete transitions represent both increases and decreases in relative firing rate across different sets of units and states. We next utilized the HMM to model transition probability between observed states in our brain organoids. Lower probability states were observed prior to the burst peak with a larger number of states sampled per unit time. However, during and immediately following the burst peak we observed a narrowing of states available per unit time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). This narrowing effect might establish a sequential arrow of time in state space, where initial states preserve more precise timing relative to following states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 25</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Subsequently, as the burst fades, state observations return to a lower probability. The number of realized states observed during burst events remains similar over the variable range of hidden states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 26</xref>), indicating the model's robustness to discrete patterns of spiking activity and their evolution in time. Next, we show that the more temporally rigid units that reside within backbone sequences also distribute across a larger pool of HMM states compared to non-rigid units, which span a smaller range of states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>), a result consistent across organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 27</xref>). These differences are further visualized by performing PCA on state vs. unit realizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>), which suggests that backbone and nonrigid units may be linearly separable by hidden state structure. We quantified this by training linear support vector machine (SVM) classifiers (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>) to distinguish backbone units from non-rigid units by their state structure representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>), and found an accuracy of 83.9% Â± 12.0%, significantly higher than the 63.2% Â± 10.4% achieved when classifying by firing rate alone. Together these results highlight spontaneous population burst events in brain organoids consisting of ensembles that link together in time to establish neuronal manifolds, which exhibit more complex hidden state dynamics in real than in shuffled data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 28</xref>). These manifolds represent a latent multidimensional space that is composed of a temporally rigid and flexible subsets of units. These units form a subspace of states that follow probabilistic trajectories that are Markovian in time, namely future states depend on the systemâs current state.

In an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting, it has been well established that Poisson randomness is not a universal feature of spiking patterns in the cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, where architectonically defined brain regions generate homologous firing patterns that differ systematically across brain regions and less across species, a feature consistent from mice to cats and monkeys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>. To further quantify the complexity across the different neuronal model systems we calculated their dimensionality, which we defined as the number of principal components of the HMM observations required to explain a variable fraction, <italic>Î¸</italic>, of the total variance. Here, the hidden states range from 10-30 and <italic>Î¸</italic> spans the range from 0.5 to 1, (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 32</xref>). At <italic>Î¸</italic> = 0.75, human organoids are separable from slice data (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04 according to a linear mixed-effects model with Poisson observations); however, two-dimensional primary cultures exhibit substantially lower-dimensional HMM observations than both human (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and murine (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003) brain organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7F</xref>), with similar trends existing for a range of values of <italic>Î¸</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 32</xref>). Importantly, we observed that within organoids, hidden states correspond to clusters of population activity patterns which are distinguished across multiple dimensions, whereas after randomization, the HMM captures only a one-dimensional space which scales with the population rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 28</xref>). Furthermore, the number of realized states does not strongly depend on the number of hidden states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 26</xref>). However, the rate at which states are traversed per unit time differs significantly across models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 34</xref>), with the three-dimensional models exhibiting a lower state traversal rate than the two-dimensional primary cultures.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Firing pattern stability</title><p id="P23">Despite the similarities in neuronal firing patterns and the establishment of stable sequences observed in both organoids and neonatal slices, two-dimensional counterparts are dominated by Poisson-like irregularity, which precludes the generation of sustained temporal patterns and confines their state transitions, as defined by a HMM, to a lower-dimensional space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7F</xref>). However, all models can generate complex neuronal firing patterns. Many complex systems, including brains across phylogeny, show signs of criticality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Criticality is a dynamical state that comprises internally-generated multi-scale, marginally-stable dynamics that maximize general features of information processing, such as dynamic range, information transmission, susceptibility, and robustness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>. Criticality directly accounts for a systemâs capacity for complex function, and is a homeostatic endpoint in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup> that is, in the intact brain, maintained by sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>. While measurement of criticality traditionally requires extended sampling of a systemâs activity, recent progress solves this problem by applying renormalization group theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup> - to the temporal features of neural data. We assessed each system's proximity to criticality using temporal renormalization group theory to quantify how close neural dynamics are to exhibiting perfect temporal scale-invariance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. At criticality, general features beneficial to complex computation are simultaneously optimized, including information transmission, information storage, dynamic range, entropy, and susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>. The distance metric <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> measures how far a system's dynamics are from criticality, with values between 0.0-0.1 indicating near-critical dynamics that span many timescales without a characteristic scale, while larger values indicate deviation from criticality. We found that a subset of each preparation type generated activity well-described by the autoregressive model framework and exhibited near-critical dynamics (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 35</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref> for additional details). Shuffling spike times consistently abolished temporal criticality across all preparations, producing significantly larger <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> values (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup> compared to intact data). Murine organoid preparations showed particularly good agreement between empirical measurements and model predictions. Taken together, these data suggest that all preparations are capable of generating near-critical dynamics when properly captured by the autoregressive framework. This indicates that the capacity for scale-invariant dynamics may be a fundamental property of neural circuits that emerges during development, independent of precise circuit architecture or environmental context.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">The advent of high-density extracellular recordings has facilitated the detection of non-random firing patterns that assemble into temporally precise sequences that are believed to form a basis for broadcasting and computing information in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Whether such sequences are emergent features, present during early brain development, a stage that is dominated by spontaneous activity with the potential to encode informational content, remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that sequences are âpreconfiguredâ and represent an innate architecture independent of external experience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. However, experimental evidence in support of this notion is still sparse, largely due to experimental inaccessibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">To address this open question, we leveraged state-of-the-art high density extracellular recordings from three-dimensional stem cell derived models of the human brain, known as brain organoids, which represent an intrinsically self-organized neuronal system that recapitulates key facets of early brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> and the establishment of functional circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Crucially, brain organoids are not exposed to sensory information, and are thus an ideal model to study whether the emergence of sequences is truly experience-independent. Here, our analysis of single-unit firing patterns within human and murine brain organoids revealed the presence of a subset of high-firing rate neurons capable of generating firing patterns that assemble into temporally precise spiking sequences. A larger subpopulation conversely exhibits lower firing rates and less regular firing patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), where temporally rigid sequences project back onto a minority of strong functional connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), which we previously reported are emergent properties of brain organoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In a seminal paper, Hopfield demonstrated that emergent computational properties from simple properties of many cells, rather than complex circuits, are capable of generalization, time sequence retention, error correction and time-evolution of the state of the system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>. Therefore, itâs not surprising that the temporal structure of spontaneous and evoked patterns of cortical circuits are similar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup>, since such representations are drawn from a functionally connected neuronal pool with right-skewed, lognormal scaling rules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">Units that fire within the recurrent neuronal firing sequences exhibit varying degrees of temporal precision. The subpopulation of neurons that fire at the beginning of the population bursts are the most constrained, whereas units firing later in the sequences are more temporally flexible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F,G</xref>). An analogous organization of spiking activity is present also in the somatosensory and auditory cortex of adult rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, and in the three-layered turtle cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In the hippocampus, experience-dependent replay has been shown to emerge from spontaneous, experience-independent preconfigured sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The balance between temporally correlated and irregular spiking neuronal populations is an important feature of information processing in the brain. For example, large-scale extracellular field recordings from neurons in the mouse visual cortex and monkey brain have revealed a low-dimensional subspace of neurons that are entrained to population firing dynamics and represent a fixed attribute insensitive to external stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Consistent with this observation, also in brain organoids, we observe a low-dimensional subspace, consisting of backbone units, that resides within a higher dimensional space spanned by more weakly correlated and irregularly firing units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Moreover, we show that the stochastic firing patterns of randomized organoid data closely mirror the firing patterns of two-dimensional dissociated cortical cultures, which exhibit culture-wide synchronization events that cannot sustain sequential activity patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13,16</xref>). Such an effect is likely the result of highly redundant and interconnected two-dimensional network configurations commonly observed <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. Together, these findings highlight that the self-organized generative process of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis within brain organoids may serve as a faithful <italic>in vitro</italic> model of the human brain, and do not simply generate random networks. Our results support the hypothesis that construction of complex networks capable of recapitulating <italic>in vivo</italic> neural dynamics requires morphogenesis in three-dimensions. In fact, recent experiments have demonstrated that functional circuits in human brain organoids, when interfaced with a machine, can function as a reservoir for computing, capable of speech recognition and nonlinear equation prediction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">In an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting, a minority pool of strongly correlated neurons have been proposed to serve as a fast-acting system that resides within a more weakly coupled background, believed to function as a pre-configured and optimally tuned brain state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref></sup>. The delicate balance between rigid and flexible spiking components and the establishment of sequential spiking patterns are an emergent feature of the three-dimensional cytoarchitecture, which is further supported by our analysis of spontaneous activity from neonatal slices of the mouse somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Recent work has further established that a neurophysiological backbone is likely organized during neurogenesis where common pyramidal neuronal progenitors establish high firing rate subnetworks, which are functionally connected and co-activated across brain states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The presented organoid data shows that highly correlated backbone units increase in burst-to-burst correlation from earlier organoid developmental time points relative to later time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), a feature conserved across human and murine brain organoids. This transition also coincides with the functional incorporation of inhibitory interneurons in our brain organoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref></sup>, and reflects an excitatory-inhibitory balance shifting towards inhibition that is observed in <italic>in vivo</italic> cortical circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, while preserving right-skewed functional organizational rules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref></sup>. Further, we demonstrate that the temporal rigidity of neuronal sequences is strongly modulated by inhibition of GABAergic input (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>), which leads to a sharp increase in burst synchronization - an effect consistent with the inhibitory role of GABA. This finding highlights the critical role of interneuron signaling in maintaining network homeostasis and microcircuit function observed in mature brain circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref></sup>, suggesting that it may also play a key role in shaping early neural dynamics prior to sensory input. While previous studies have suggested that GABA exerts a paradoxical excitatory effect during early brain development, with a transition to inhibition occurring after postnatal week two in the murine neocortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref></sup>, a growing body of evidence points to inhibitory effects of GABAergic signaling occurring much earlier in development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref></sup>. Our findings align with this emerging perspective, indicating that interneurons and their inhibitory effects are key contributors to the temporal structure of neuronal sequences during the initial stages of brain development. The brain organoid model thus provides a unique platform for future research to investigate how interactions between brain regions and specific cell types drive the assembly of functional microcircuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">Brain organoids represent a self-organized neurodevelopmental system that operates as a truly closed system devoid of external input, and yet is capable of generating a rich repertoire of activity patterns that resemble the temporal dynamics of the early developing brain. Embedded within these firing patterns we observed an overlap between the pool of non-Poisson-like firing patterns generated by brain organoids and neonatal brain slices. However, within primary cortical cultures, with an inherently randomized cytoarchitecture, we observed a shift to lower dimensional state transitions as captured by a hidden Markov model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7F</xref>). In an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting, brain regions are defined by a balance between a repertoire of firing patterns that span irregular Poisson dynamics to clock-like regularity, which depend on local circuit architectures and are believed to be critical components underlying higher order brain function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. In fact, the âbackboneâ of consistently firing neurons, which form a minority pool within strongly connected networks, can predict as much as 80% accuracy during motor control in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">102</xref></sup>. Backbone units have been proposed to function as an âansatzâ, or initial estimate for matching behavior to external environmental inputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. We posit that the highly correlated, non-Poisson neuronal components may serve as basis for the emergence of temporal sequences in early brain development. Early sequences might function as an internal reference frame for larger scale population dynamics found in mature circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, which will later be calibrated through interplay between sensory input and motor output<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. In fact, recent work in the postnatal murine brain has revealed that preconfigured sequence motifs (spontaneously generated in sleep and rest states) emerge before explicit sequential experience and are not improved by sequential experience during the third postnatal week after navigational beyond the nest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. We further demonstrate that neuronal firing patterns within brain organoids and neonatal brain slices generate strong non-random pairwise correlations with varying degrees of temporal jitter (relative to population events) with non-zero phase lags. These ensembles link together to establish a manifold of trajectories that are identifiable using a hidden Markov model, with a core of these probabilistic state transitions consisting of units with strong pairwise interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C,D</xref>). These subsets of units may function as an âirreversibleâ set of ânoisy logic elementsâ that define a local arrow of time, which has recently shown to emerge in retinal circuits, where neuronal activity remains irreversible even when their inputs are not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">In summary, our analysis of spontaneous activity generated by stem cell derived human and murine brain organoids, demonstrates that structured spiking sequences can emerge when completely devoid of sensory experience and motor output, supporting the pre-configured brain hypothesis. These results are in line with recent work showing how pharmacologically abolishing all central nervous system activity during the development of the larval zebrafish did not alter an oculomotor behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref></sup>, suggesting that complex sensory-motor systems are hard-wired by activity-independent mechanisms.

More recently, this approach has been utilized to characterize the firing patterns of neuronal ensembles of specific brain states during motor function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R143">143</xref></sup>, deciphering neural codes of sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R144">144</xref></sup> and uncovering temporal structure in hippocampal outputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R145">145</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P73">A hidden Markov model is a statistical characterization of a discrete-time random process in terms of a discrete âhiddenâ state, which cannot be directly observed, but which changes the probability distribution of the observations. At each time step, the value of the hidden state depends only on the previous hidden state. The observation distribution and transition probabilities together make up the parametrization of the HMM. These parameters are fitted using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to assign the parameters of the observation distribution and transition probabilities in order to co-optimize the posterior likelihood of the observations and the sequence of hidden states.</p><p id="P74">For neuronal spiking data, HMMs are typically applied to time-binned spike matrices, where at each time step, the observation is a population activity vector consisting of the number of spikes produced by each unit within that time bin. If the bin size is significantly larger than the refractory period of the neuron, the resulting observation distribution is per-neuron independent Poisson with a parameter Î», such that the probability that the unit fires <italic>n</italic> times in a given time bin is given by <italic>p</italic>(<italic>n</italic>) = Î»<sup><italic>k</italic></sup>e<sup>-Î»</sup>/<italic>k</italic>! Our analysis is carried out in the Python programming language, version 3.11, using the implementation of an HMM with Poisson observations provided by the package SSM.</p><p id="P75">We validated that HMMs capture information from the spiking data via 5-fold cross-validation by comparing the posterior log likelihood of a held-out validation set to that of the randomized surrogate data for the held-out region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R145">145</xref></sup>. Each âfoldâ consists of fitting the model parameters to a random 80% subset of the data and evaluating the fitted model on the remaining 20%. Log likelihood is always greater for the real than the surrogate data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 24</xref>), indicating that the HMM is modeling transitions using information present in the real data but not the surrogate.</p></sec><sec id="S40"><title>Hidden Markov Model Hyperparameters</title><p id="P76">Although the parameters of the observation and state transition distributions are selected by EM, there are two hyperparameters as well: the bin size <italic>T</italic> for converting spiking data into a discrete-time observation vector, and the number of states <italic>K</italic> for the HMM itself. Both must be chosen independently of the EM fitting process, so we treat them as hyperparameters and evaluate performance for a range of values using the 5-fold cross-validation method described above. We performed this validation across all 8 human brain organoid recordings. We first chose a default bin size of 30 ms based on the characteristic time scale of bursts. Under this condition, fit performance is insensitive to the number of hidden states above 10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 23</xref>), so all further analysis is conducted across models with the number of hidden states ranging from 10 to 30. We next evaluated performance across bin sizes of 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, and 100 ms, for numbers of hidden states ranging from 10 to 50 (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig 22</xref>). Performance is also relatively insensitive to bin size near 30 ms, but significantly larger or smaller bin sizes do exhibit somewhat worse performance. The analysis reported on in the main paper uses a fixed bin size of 30 ms, but the number of hidden states ranges from 10 to 30.</p></sec><sec id="S41"><title>Hidden State Trajectories</title><p id="P77">The ability of a HMM to capture the stereotyped dynamics of bursts in human brain organoids is explored in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-C</xref>. Given a fitted HMM, we estimate the most probable sequence of hidden states for a given time-binned spike matrix using the forward-backward algorithm, a standard technique for maximum likelihood estimation of hidden state. Then, this sequence of hidden states is registered relative to the peaks of all the bursts in the recording, and trimmed into fixed-length subsequences corresponding to a fixed time window surrounding each peak. For visualization purposes, the parameters were set to 300 ms before and 600 ms after. We then computed the empirical probability distribution over hidden states as a function of time relative to the burst peak by counting how many times each state appears at each position across all subsequences, divided by the total number of subsequences. Results are shown for one representative HMM (with 20 hidden states) in the first organoid we analyzed (with 30ms time bins).</p><p id="P78">We also measured the rate of hidden state traversal during the burst backbone time period (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>: <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S30">firing rate sequences and burst backbones</xref>). We split the maximum-likelihood state sequence into subsequences corresponding to one backbone period around each burst peak, and calculated the total number of hidden states divided by the duration of the burst backbone period. The distribution of these state traversal rates was significantly different for all three biological models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 34</xref>), but much more similar between murine slices and human brain organoids than between either model and murine primary cultures.</p></sec><sec id="S42"><title>Consistency of units within a Hidden State</title><p id="P79">We refer to each time bin of the spike matrix in which a given hidden state is most probable as a ârealizationâ of that state. We then computed the consistency of each unit in each hidden state as the fraction of realizations of that hidden state in which the unit fires at least once. This procedure yielded an array of consistency scores with one row for each of the modelâs <italic>K</italic> hidden states, and one column for each unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 27</xref>).</p><p id="P80">We view the columns of this array as vectors in a <italic>K</italic>-dimensional space; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref> visualizes a concrete example of this space, using PCA dimensionality reduction to demonstrate that backbone and non-rigid units are almost linearly separable. We measured the degree of this approximate linear separability by determining an optimal decision boundary within the original space using a linear support vector machine (SVM).</p><p id="P81">Linear separability was quantified as the accuracy of the linear classifier according to leave-one-out cross-validation: for each unit, the model was fitted to all other units, and its accuracy was evaluated on the single held out unit. The single-unit accuracy (always either 0 or 1) was then averaged across all units. Then, as a null hypothesis to control for the fact that backbone units fire more overall than non-rigid units, we calculated the linear separability of backbone and non-rigid units based solely on their overall firing rate. This does not depend on the fitted HMM, so the null hypothesis has only one score per organoid (the linear separability across all units), rather than the distribution across models produced by the SVM-based linear separability metric.</p></sec><sec id="S43"><title>Dimensionality of a Fitted HMM</title><p id="P82">To evaluate the ability of HMMs to represent non-trivial activity manifolds beyond simple variations in population firing rate, we estimated the dimensionality of the observation model in each fitted HMM. The population observation matrix is an array of shape [number of hidden states] Ã [number of units], where each entry represents the parameter Î» of the Poisson distribution estimated for the firing of that unit in that state. We performed a singular value decomposition (SVD) on this matrix so that a principal component analysis with any desired number of dimensions <italic>d</italic> could be acquired by projecting only the first <italic>d</italic> components of the SVD. Furthermore, this same transformation can be applied to the time-binned spike matrix itself in order to yield a dimension-reduced version for visualization purposes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 28</xref>).</p><p id="P83">We defined the âdimensionalityâ of the trained HMM for a given dataset to be the number of principal components required to meet a given threshold <italic>Î¸</italic> in the percent explained variance on the HMM states themselves. The statistical significance of this finding was calculated using a generalized linear mixed-effects model (<italic>glmer</italic> from the lme4 R package) with Poisson-family observations and a logarithmic linkage function. This differs from other results using a standard linear mixed-effects model due to the dimension being a discrete quantity, which cannot reasonably be approximated as Gaussian. For the same reason, normalization against the randomized baseline was not performed in this analysis; the original integer dimensionality values were modeled.</p></sec><sec id="S44"><title>Non-Poisson Units</title><p id="P84">Under the null hypothesis, which was originally assumed in fitting HMMs to our data in the first place, each unit produces Poisson firing at a rate which depends on the hidden state. For a Poisson unit, for each hidden state of each fitted HMM, the number of firings of the unit in each realization of the hidden state should follow a Poisson distribution. This distribution has mean and variance both equal to its single parameter Î», so we calculated the mean number of firings of a unit across all realizations of a hidden state, and performed a one-sided chi-square test to identify whether the variance in firings for that unit was less than under the Poisson null hypothesis at the <italic>P</italic> = 1% significance level. This value was then averaged across all hidden states (weighted by the number of realizations of each state) to yield an overall measurement of the conditional deviation from Poisson statistics given the hidden state information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 33D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S45"><title><italic>d<sub>2</sub></italic> calculation</title><p id="P85">To assess temporal scale-invariance in network dynamics, we calculated the distance metric <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> following methods developed by Sooter <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. For each recording, we first created a population activity time series by counting all spikes across all neurons in 30 ms time bins. This time series was z-scored (mean subtracted and normalized by standard deviation). We then fit an order-20 autoregressive (AR) model to the z-scored time series using the Yule-Walker method. The AR model describes how current activity depends on past activity through a history kernel that spans 20 time steps, capturing temporal correlations across multiple timescales. For time-shuffled controls, we randomly shuffled the spike times of each neuron independently while maintaining their firing rates, then performed the same binning, z-scoring, and AR model fitting procedures.</p><p id="P86">The AR model coefficients were used to calculate <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub>, which quantifies the Euclidean distance from the model parameters to the Î²=2 critical fixed point in the temporal renormalization group framework. This fixed point represents a type of criticality characterized by power-law temporal correlations with exponent Î²=2. Values of <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> near zero indicate dynamics close to criticality, characterized by scale-invariant temporal fluctuations that persist across a broad range of timescales. In contrast, larger values of <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> indicate deviation from criticality, reflecting dynamics dominated by a characteristic timescale or lacking long-range temporal correlations. Time-shuffled controls, which destroy temporal correlations while preserving basic firing statistics, typically yield <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> values greater than 0.2. The geometric interpretation of <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> is the minimum distance between the AR model coefficients and a hyperplane in coefficient space that contains all models that flow to the Î²=2 fixed point under the temporal renormalization group transformation.</p><p id="P87">Not all neural activity patterns are well-described by autoregressive models. For example, highly bursty dynamics with long silent periods punctuated by brief population-wide activation can violate the AR model's assumptions about temporal continuity. Therefore, before calculating <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub>, we assessed the quality of the AR model fit for each preparation. We compared the avalanche size distributions, avalanche duration distributions, and power spectra of the original data with those generated by simulating the best-fit AR model. Preparations were excluded from <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> analysis if the AR model failed to capture these key statistical features of the empirical data, specifically if the model-generated distributions deviated from the empirical distributions by more than one order of magnitude. This approach excluded 5/8 human organoid preparations, 2/9 mouse organoid preparations, 2/6 acute slice preparations, and 0/7 2D culture preparations from <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> analysis, ensuring that our assessment of criticality was based only on preparations whose temporal structure was accurately captured by the AR framework.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS193139-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d29aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S46"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank members of the <italic>Braingeneers</italic> consortium for helpful discussions and David Haussler for insightful comments.

The population firing rate is shown by the red solid line. Population bursts are marked by sharp increases in the population rate. Burst peak events are denoted by local maxima that exceed 4x-RMS fluctuations in the population rate. The shaded gray regions denote the burst duration window as defined by the time interval in which the population rate remains above 10% of its peak value in the burst.

Bottom, zoomed in view of the trajectory of neuronal firing during population bursts reveals temporal segregation and contiguous tiling of the peak firing rate of single-unit activity.

Note the similarity in the low-dimensional manifold representations between the middle and the left, indicating the strong contribution of the backbone units to the low-dimensional activity of the whole population. Right, same as left but only including the non-rigid units. The low-dimensional manifold is not present anymore and the variance explained by the first to principal components is notably lower, reflecting the higher dimensional activity of the non-rigid units. The inset shows the burst peak centered average population rate colored in the same way as the PCA trajectories to indicate which parts of the burst correspond to the different coloring. (<bold>G</bold>) The difference between the cumulative sum of the variance explained by the selection of the first principal components of the manifold constructed based on only backbone units (blue) or only non-rigid units (yellow) relative to the manifold constructed based on all units. For the comparison, the cumulative sum of the explained variance is interpolated to account for the difference in the total number of principal components possible between the manifold constructed of all units compared to the subsets. The interpolated values are normalized to range from 0 (only first component) to 1 (all components). Positive values indicate that the first principal components of the manifold constructed of the subset of units explains a higher percentage of the variance than the comparable selection of principal components of the manifold constructed of all units while negative values indicate a lower percentage of explained variance. Note that for all organoids, indicated with different markers, the explained variance by the first principal components of the manifold constructed from the backbone units explain a larger amount of the total variance than the manifold constructed for all units while the opposite is true for the non-rigid. This reflects the low-dimensional backbone activity related to their heightened correlations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS193139-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) explore stable trajectories and population motifs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Repeated sequence of discrete hidden states during three example bursts.

Also shown is the difference between these plots for adjacent states, ÎFR, in red. (<bold>C</bold>) The sequence of hidden states follows a stereotyped trajectory across each burst. The probability of each hidden state as a function of time relative to the burst peak is displayed as a heatmap. Note in particular that for the first 0.3 seconds from the burst peak, there is very little variation in the pattern of hidden states, whereas later in the bursts (as well as before the burst begins), the variability is significantly higher.

The human brain organoid group consists of 8 different organoids (4 whole organoids, 4 sliced organoids) with a total of 1048 units, 275 backbone and 773 non-rigid, the murine organoid group (dorsal forebrain identity) consists of 9 different whole organoid with a total of 1179 units, 603 backbone and 576 non-rigid, the murine neonatal slice group consists of 6 different slices from a total of 3 animals (2 unique slices per animal) with a total of 786 units, 296 backbone and 490 non-rigid, the murine primary group consists of 8 different cultures with a total of 1048 units, 277 backbone and 771 non-rigid. Statistical differences between the different model types and between backbone and non-rigid units for the different model types are computed using a linear mixed effects model. The model considers interactions between backbone and non-rigid units and between different model types. The specific recordings within each model type are included as grouping factors in the model. Each model is significantly different from each other (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup>) and within each model the backbone and non-rigid units are significantly different from each other (*** = <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.001, ** = <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, * = <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).

(<bold>C</bold>) The normalized pairwise cross-correlation per unit pair is grouped into backbone-to-backbone (blue), backbone to non-rigid (gray) and non-rigid to non-rigid (yellow) for each model type individually. Normalization was performed by subtracting the average pairwise correlation per unit pair after shuffling from the original value and then dividing the outcome by the sum of both values (Original-Shuffled)/(Original+Shuffled). A linear mixed effects model was used to assess which of the distributions were significantly larger than 0, indicating above random correlation strengths (*** = <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.001, ** = <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, * = <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).

These long latency correlations result from consistent backbone sequences. (<bold>E</bold>) The normalized fraction of the variance explained summed over the first three principal components for the PCA manifolds per model type.

This value is computed for the original data and the shuffled data after which the shuffled result is subtracted from the original result to get the final value. The dots within the violins represent each individual recording. A linear mixed-effects model was used to assess differences between model types (*** = <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.001, ** = <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, * = <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).

For each fitted HMM, the dimensionality of representation was estimated by counting the number of principal components of the HMM observations that were required to explain at least 75% of variance. A linear-mixed effects model was used to assess differences between model types (*** = <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.001, ** = <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, * = <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). No normalization with shuffled data was applied since shuffled models always required only 1 principal component.
