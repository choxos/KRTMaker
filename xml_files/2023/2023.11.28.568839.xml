Although a controlled inflammatory response is beneficial for restoring homeostasis, it can become unfavorable if dysregulated. In recent years, major progress has been made in characterizing acute and chronic inflammation in specific diseases. However, a global, holistic understanding of inflammation is still elusive. This is particularly intriguing, considering the crucial function of inflammation for human health and its potential for modern medicine if fully deciphered. Here, we leverage advances in the field of single-cell genomics to delineate the full spectrum of circulating immune cell activation underlying inflammatory processes during infection, immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and cancer. Our single-cell atlas of &gt;6.5 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 1047 patients and 19 diseases allowed us to learn a comprehensive model of inflammation in circulating immune cells. The atlas expanded our current knowledge of the biology of inflammation of immune-mediated diseases, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, infection and solid tumors, and laid the foundation to develop a precision medicine framework using unsupervised as well as explainable machine learning. Beyond a disease-centered analysis, we charted altered activity of inflammatory molecules in peripheral blood cells, depicting discriminative inflammation-related genes to further understand mechanisms of inflammation. Finally, we have laid the groundwork for developing precision medicine diagnostic tools for patients experiencing pathologic inflammation by learning a classifier for inflammatory diseases, presenting cells in circulation as a powerful resource for patient diagnosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Inflammation is a biological response or state of the immune system that serves to protect the human body from environmental challenges, thereby preserving homeostasis and structural integrity of tissues and organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Inflammatory processes are activated in response to various triggers, such as infection or injury, and involve a multistep defensive mechanism aimed at eliminating the source of perturbation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, inflammation represents an altered state within the immune system, which can manifest as either a protective or pathological response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The cellular and molecular mediators of inflammation play pivotal roles in nearly every human disease, encompassing a wide array of biological processes, including the complex interplay of cytokines, myeloid and lymphoid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The initiation of inflammatory processes is driven by cellular stimulation, triggered by the release of proinflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. These cytokines exert autocrine and paracrine effects, activating endothelial cells, subsequently increasing vascular permeability. This allows immune cells to infiltrate tissues at the site of infection, facilitated by chemokines. Chemokines are essential for recruiting additional immune cells, playing a crucial role in phagocytosis and pathogen eradication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In the bloodstream, activated immune cells release cytokines and travel to various tissues.

Remarkably, SLE showed a uniquely strong upregulation of the IFN-induced signature in all immune cell types, accompanied by an upregulation of chemokines and chemokine receptors. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) showed a decreased IFN-induced signature and increased chemokine receptor activity, in line with the migratory capacity of blood cells to infiltrate the brain during the course of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. As previously reported, we captured the upregulation of the TNF receptor/ligand signature mainly in Non-Naive CD8 T cells for Sepsis (together with an increase in IFNG response in Monocytes), with a decrease in the other inflammatory signals (adhesion molecules and cytokines)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. In contrast, all chronic inflammatory diseases upregulated the activity of antigen presenting molecules and increased IFN-induced signaling. This IFN-induced signature was also increased in viral infections, such as Flu and COVID-19, while we found a decreased activity in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV). Finally, within solid tumors, Colorectal Cancer (CRC) and Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) presented a strong upregulation of TNF via NFkB signaling. Intriguingly, only RA, Psoriatic Arthritis (PSA), Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohnˈs Disease (CD) showed an enrichment in the T follicular helper (Tfh) signature in Non-Naive CD4 T cells, highlighting the role of circulating Tfh cells in these diseases. In IMIDs more generally, both Naive and Non-Naive CD4 T cell populations were enriched in T helper signatures, pointing to an early priming of Naive T towards helper T cell-driven inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.

To elucidate the regulatory mechanisms and, specifically, transcription factors (TF) driving the IFN activity, we conducted a GRN analysis of IFN-related factors (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). This identified STAT1 and SP1 as the primary regulators of the IFN-induced signature, each TF with distinct cell type specificities, suggesting distinct GRNs to regulate the IFN activity in a cell type-specific manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Monocytes and Non-Naive CD8 T cells showed enrichment for both STAT1 and SP1.

STAT1 activity increased during flares, most notably in CD8 T cell populations, while SP1 activity increased mostly in myeloid populations in the absence of flares.

However, it remains elusive which immune subpopulations contribute to these signatures to guide the selection of specific therapeutic interventions. Observing an enriched IFN type 1 and 2 activity in Non-Naive CD8 T cells in IMIDs, we next seeked to discover subpopulations as the signature driver. Here, we observed a significant upregulation across almost all CD8 T cell populations, however, with a differential pattern across diseases.

Therefore, we next applied a supervised classification approach, together with a post-hoc interpretability method, to allow the inference of the gene-wise importance, stratified by disease and cell type (<italic>Level1)</italic>. We based our strategy on Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs), a state-of-the-art machine learning technique proven to be effective in complex tasks with noisy data and non-linear feature dependencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.

We executed the analysis considering each cell type (<italic>Level 1</italic>) independently, mitigating the impact of cell-specific expression profiles. We applied the pipeline on the corrected gene expression profiles after scANVI integration, but also tested uncorrected log-normalized data as an input. Overall, we achieved high performance to assign each cell to the correct disease label with a Balanced Accuracy Score (BAS) of 0.87 and a Weighted F1 score (WF1) of 0.90, computed on a test set of 20% cells, when starting from scANVI-corrected data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).

Performances were consistent among cell types, with less abundant cell populations obtaining generally lower scores (e.g., Plasma cells, BAS = 0.78, WF1 = 0.80; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Noteworthy, Flu obtained the lowest recall (0.03), mainly being classified as COVID-19 (74% of cells), likely due to the low cell numbers (Flu accounts for ~0.004% of total cells).</p><p id="P14">As GBDTs require post-hoc interpretability tools in order to infer explanations, we computed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, shown to provide attributions that are locally consistent and that can be aggregated into global explanations. SHAP values explained the output of the classifier, in our case the predicted conditions, as a sum of contributions of each feature, that is, the gene expression profiles, while also considering its interactions with other genes. By combining the two approaches, we obtained a rich resource of gene rankings based on their ability to discriminate inflammatory conditions across different cell types. When validating the top-ranked genes by predicting the inflammatory disease label of unseen studies, we confirmed that the SHAP gene rankings provide a better feature selection for disease-discrimination than random gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).

By considering each patient as an ensemble of expression profiles across all circulating immune cells, we learned a generative model while integrating the single-cell reference as a basis to project new patients from a query dataset into the same embedding space.

In concordance with our previous results for scANVI, all newly introduced methods achieve high performance in the dataset with unseen patients (Scenario 2); indeed scANVI, scPoli and scGen achieved similar high BAS (&gt;0.94) and WF1 (&gt;0.97), followed by Harmony (BAS: 0.92 and WF1: 0.94), considering the best performing configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">11</xref>). While all the approaches lost predictive power on the unseen studies datasets (Scenario 3), Harmony performed best with a BAS of 0.24 and a WF1 of 0.47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9a,c</xref>). Interestingly, scPoli obtained the best result on unseen studies when the learned patient-wise embedding was used to classify patients (BAS: 0.24 and WF1: 0.46), but the same model underperforms on unseen patients (BAS: 0.37 and WF1: 0.60). Since we evaluated different hyperparameters for each approach, we were able to estimate a method’s sensitivity to the chosen configuration. Here, Harmony excels as the best performing and tunable method on samples from unseen studies, with a BAS of 0.22±0.03 and a WF1 of 0.41±0.06, among the considered hyperparameters. In conclusion, all tools showed limited generalization in the most challenging task to classify unseen studies’ patients (Scenario 3), even after hyperparameter adjustments. While linear approaches have less representation power than VAEs, they are also less prone to overfitting and more robust to the hyperparameter choice. Hence, in settings where hyperparameter tuning and validation is not possible due to the lack of condition labels, as in clinical diagnostics, tools like Harmony/Symphony might be preferable to more complex VAEs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">Mapping the plasticity of the immune cells in circulation is now possible by using sequencing technologies that allow an unbiased immuno-phenotyping of single cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. Recent technologies enable the sampling of thousands of cells per sample and hundred-thousands per patient cohort, pushing the resolution towards fine-grained cellular maps and increasing the power to identify disease-specific states and programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. To date, single-cell sequencing has been applied to a multitude of inflammatory diseases to determine alterations in cell type composition and to pinpoint disease-driving mechanisms as potential therapeutic targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. However, a complete map of immune cell states across diseases, holistically charting immune plasticity in inflammatory diseases, has been elusive. We reasoned that integrating single-cell transcriptome maps of cells in circulation across a variety of diseases and millions of cells would allow us to extract the full spectrum of features representing inflammatory processes and to generate a comprehensive model of inflammation in circulating immune cells. Our strategy split the analysis into three phases, starting with the supervised extraction of inflammation-related patterns, followed by the discovery of discriminative inflammation-related genes and, finally, a patient classification framework.</p><p id="P24">Our analysis used complex immune inflammatory signals, such as cytokines, chemokines, activation and antigen presenting signals, that are expressed by immune cells during inflammation, generating gene signatures capturing the intricate inflammatory processes associated with specific diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. We demonstrated that these inflammatory signatures frequently align with established disease pathways, showing consistency across studies and reinforcing recognized disease mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. For instance, we confirmed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α as a hallmark of RA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>, whereas Type I IFN signature genes were highly active in SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. We acknowledge though that cell types not captured in this work could further complement the discovery of disease-defining signatures. Here, neutrophils, the most abundant white blood cells in circulation, play important roles in inflammatory diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>. However, the here applied single-cell profiling technologies did not capture neutrophils, presenting a limitation of this work.</p><p id="P25">The concept of using immune cells as a sensor for diseases is highly intriguing and opens the door for the development of future universal diagnostic tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. For some of the tested diseases, current biomarker strategies may already provide sufficient sensitivity considering the pathology and clinical manifestation of the disease (i.e. lymphopenia as a hallmark of sepsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, or CD4 T lymphocyte count in HIV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>). Nevertheless, for diseases such as in rheumatology and IBD, many patients are undiagnosed or diagnosed as false positive, and more accurate universal tools are needed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>. Our approach using GBDT, together with SHAP-based interpretability, and a tailored list of functional immune cell molecules, provided explainable outcomes and serves as a rich resource for identifying disease-discriminative genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. High absolute SHAP values highlight genes that are important to characterize the inflammatory landscape, and top ranked genes have a high discriminative power between diseases. Additional analysis showed that the top-ranked genes generalize better than a random selection, even when applied on data from unseen studies, confirming the value of SHAP-based ranking. However, given that SHAP values rank genes based on non-linear interactions with other genes, disease- and gene-specific validation in large, independent patient cohorts is required to confirm genes also as biomarkers for clinical diagnostic applications.</p><p id="P26">We further tested the utility of an Inflammation Atlas as a diagnostic tool by developing a patient classifier based on the latent embeddings after integration. Our approach aimed at leveraging circulating immune cells as a liquid biopsy for diagnostics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>, by learning to discriminate inflammatory conditions before classifying patients from query datasets. To test such a classification framework, we simulated three scenarios with different degrees of separation of the query patients from the reference cohort. The results obtained for Scenarios 1 and 2 demonstrated that our computational framework can effectively classify patients, indicating that the latent embeddings carry signals associated with inflammatory diseases. To the best of our knowledge, existing patient classifiers have evaluated settings similar to Scenario 1 and 2 (scPoli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>; MultiMIL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>). In Scenario 3, we then queried patients belonging to studies excluded from our reference atlas, simulating the application of the Inflammation Atlas as a diagnostic tool. Here, our approach initially failed to generalize to unseen patients, indicating that further optimization was needed to build a generalizable model for more accurate disease diagnostics. To explore the reasons for limited generalization, we performed additional analyses on a centralized dataset, for which all samples were processed at the same center with the same assay chemistry. Here, the improved performance compared to Scenario 3 highlighted the impact of batch effects introduced through differing assay chemistries and centers. We concluded that towards the development of diagnostic tools with regulatory approval, such variability has to be controlled through rigorous standardization efforts during product design and application.</p><p id="P27">Another important aspect for the classification tasks is the selection of the data integration and reference-to-query mapping tools. While existing atlas-level integration benchmarks guided our selection of scANVI, the tools’ performance for query-to-reference mapping tasks may differ significantly. However, such benchmarking efforts still remained elusive, as they require large datasets to allow cross-validation of both study- and disease-level stratified data. To fill this gap and to facilitate decision-making for building classification pipelines in disease diagnostics, we next provided an evaluation of query-to-reference mapping tools (i.e., scANVI, scGen, scPoli, and Harmony/Symphony) with multiple hyperparameter configurations. Although none of the tools achieved high classification performance in Scenario 3, likely related to uncorrected batch effects between chemistries and studies, our results pointed to Harmony/Symphony as the most robust method. Our evaluation further pointed at the importance of a comprehensive comparison of integration methods for patient classification, since the results are different from existing benchmarks focusing on cell-type annotation, batch correction and biological conservation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. While we considered covariates such as gender and age, including additional variables (e.g., treated status and type, comorbidities, disease subtype and duration) could further improve classification performance. Moreover, expanding the feature space to additional data modalities, like cell composition or epigenetic states, could also improve patient classification.</p><p id="P28">Bringing reference atlases into the clinics remains a complex task, particularly without clear implementation strategies. We contributed to this roadmap by generating a comprehensive landscape of circulating immune cells across inflammatory diseases and healthy controls. Using advanced machine learning pipelines, we demonstrated the usability of interpretable models for discriminating gene importance by cell type and disease, which can be further validated for stand-alone or combinatorial diagnostic tests. Additionally, by classifying patients through generative models that learned the full inflammatory feature space across cell types and diseases, we have laid the groundwork for a universal diagnostic tool for inflammatory diseases. Towards leveraging single-cell technologies in diagnostics, we call for the definition of best practices and quality control standards to reduce batch effects, alongside generating large, controlled training datasets. To allow data integration methods to fully generalize, we need to reduce the confounding factors, as demonstrated by our centralized approach, or largely increase training data size and variability. For the former, diagnostic approval guidelines require the use of predefined, controlled assay chemistries and standard operating procedures, rendering the sequencing pools the main source of batch effects. Alternatively, a reference training data set is generated by multiple centers and diverse chemistries to define a large, heterogeneous atlas, enabling the definition of a foundation model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup> to pave the way to a universal disease classifier, robust to batch effects.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Atlas of Circulating Immune Cells</title><p id="P29">The Inflammation Landscape of Circulating Immune Cells atlas has been conceived as a comprehensive resource to expand the current knowledge of physiological and pathological inflammation through the study of circulating immune cells.

Metric distributions were visualized grouping cells by library (10X Genomics) and by considering their chemistry (3’ or 5’ prime, and their version). Consequently, we removed low quality observation using permissive thresholds, while the robust cleaning process was performed during cell annotation tasks. In particular, we initially excluded the low quality libraries across datasets (&lt;500 cells or &lt;500 median genes recovered). Next, we removed low quality cells with a very low number of UMIs (&lt;500) and genes (&lt;250), or with a high percentage of mitochondrial expression (&gt;20% for 3’ V3 and 25% for 5’ and 3’ V2), as it is indicative of lysed cells.

After cell QC, we also removed low quality libraries (&lt;250 cells), low quality samples (&lt;500 cells or &lt;500 median genes recovered) as well as cells from a library if this patient recovered a low total number of cells (&lt;50 cells). In addition, we eliminated genes that were detected in less than 20 cells in less than 5 patients, keeping a total of 22838 genes.

Subsequently, each compartment was processed aiming to detect potential doublets, low quality cells and cells resembling platelets or erythrocytes (cells with high expression of hemoglobin genes). Additionally, we also placed back some clusters of cells into their corresponding cell lineages, when wrongly clustered due to similar profiles (e.g. T cells found into the NK cell group, or vice versa).

Lastly, we excluded Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes. In order to reduce the influence of a study’s specific composition, and prevent biases in the gene selection task, we preferred genes that are highly variable in as many studies as possible. Therefore, similarly to Sikkema et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R114">114</xref></sup>, we first considered each study independently and computed the HVGs using the Seurat implementation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R115">115</xref></sup> (<italic>scanpy</italic>.<italic>pp</italic>.<italic>highly_variable_genes(min_disp=0</italic>.<italic>3, min_mean=0</italic>.<italic>01, max_mean=4)</italic>).

Applying this strategy, we selected a total of 3236 genes being highly variable in at least 6 studies. In the following steps, we requested more than 2000 HVGs; the minimum number of studies required and the total of selected genes depends on Step and the cells under study. In order to identify Red Blood Cell (RBC) and Platelets, we kept genes associated with erythrocytes, such as hemoglobin subunits, and PPBP (platelet related) in the HVG list.

First, we generated pseudobulks stratified by cell type (annotations <italic>Level1</italic> or <italic>Level2</italic>) and patients, discarding groups with less than 10 cells. We averaged the scANVI corrected gene expression matrix of each cell belonging to a given pseudobulk, and then log-transformed and scaled the expression values to zero mean and unit variance, to reduce the impact of highly expressed genes. We fitted decoupleR’s ULM by considering pseudobulk expression profiles as the response variable and the gene coefficient returned by Spectra as the explanatory one. We assessed the scores for the 119 cell-type-specific factors only in their corresponding cell-type. The output of the model is a t-student statistic for each combination of pseudobulk and factor, which is used as a proxy for the corresponding biological function activity: positive values are associated with more active functions in a given sample, and vice-versa. To identify the up- or down- regulated biological functions across inflammatory conditions, we compared the activation score between <italic>healthy</italic> and each disease, considering only comparisons that include at least 3 observations in both conditions.

Similarly to commonly employed VAEs, scGen approximates the posterior through a variational distribution, modeled by the encoder and defined as a multivariate Gaussian. When the scGen’s VAE has been fitted on the reference dataset, latent space arithmetic is employed to correct for the batch effect induced by the chemistry protocol used.

Next, Symphony computes soft-cluster assignments for the query cells based on their proximity to the reference cluster centroids.
