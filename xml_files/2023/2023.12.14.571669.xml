In addition, they constitute the principal target of neutralizing antibody responses, making them important antigens in vaccine development. Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) encoding foreign glycoproteins can provide a convenient and safe surrogate system to interrogate the function, evolution, and antigenicity of viral glycoproteins from viruses that are difficult to manipulate or those requiring high biosafety levels containment. However, the production of recombinant VSV can be technically challenging. In this work, we present an efficient and robust plasmid-based system for the production of recombinant VSV encoding foreign glycoproteins. We validate the system using glycoproteins from different viral families, including arenaviruses, coronaviruses, and hantaviruses, as well as highlight their utility for studying the effects of mutations on viral fitness. Overall, the methods described herein can facilitate the study of both native and recombinant VSV encoding foreign glycoproteins and can serve as the basis for the production of VSV-based vaccines.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The membranes of all enveloped viruses are decorated with one or more viral glycoproteins (GPs), whose principal task is to bind host receptors to facilitate viral entry into cells. As such, GPs dictate host and cellular tropism, providing a direct link to viral emergence and pathogenesis. Viral GPs are also highly visible to the immune system and comprise the principal targets of neutralizing antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Consequently, these show high rates of evolution due to pressures of escaping host immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Vaccines inducing immunity to viral GPs have proven effective in reducing disease burden for multiple viruses, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Hence, methods that facilitate the study of viral GP function can help illuminate basic processes of viral infection, evolution, or immunity and facilitate the development of novel therapies.</p><p id="P3">Studying the GPs of high biosafety level viruses or those that lack efficient infectious clone systems is challenging and costly. Pseudotyped viral systems, where a virus lacking its native GP is produced in cells expressing a GP of interest, can be used to generate viral particles decorated with foreign GPs. Such particles can perform a single round of infection utilizing the foreign GP for entry and have been shown to faithfully mimic viral entry processes for numerous viruses (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., arenaviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses, or paramyxoviruses) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. As such, these pseudotyped viral systems are useful for measuring neutralizing antibody titers and deciphering entry mechanisms. The most common viruses for pseudotyping have been lentiviruses and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) due to their ability to non-specifically acquire foreign GPs expressed on the plasma membrane during their budding process. However, as the viral GP is not encoded in the genome of these pseudotyped virus systems, they are not suitable for evaluating viral fitness. Similarly, they do not allow for harnessing the high mutation rates of the pseudotyped virus to interrogate mechanisms of adaptation, drug resistance, or escape from antibody neutralization. To overcome these limitations, experimental systems have been developed in which the GP of interest is encoded within the genome of the pseudotyped virus. As lentivirus genomes can integrate into the host genome, posing an unacceptable biosafety risk, replication-competent pseudotyped virus systems have focused on VSV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, a biosafety level 2 virus that causes only mild infection in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Moreover, the VSV GP (VSV G) shows an extremely broad tropism in cell culture, making its replacement with a foreign GP unlikely to expand tropism. Indeed, recombinant VSV-based vaccines have been evaluated in clinical trials <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, leading to the approval of a VSV-based vaccine against Ebola virus, proving the safety of VSV-based vectors in humans. In addition, recombinant VSV encoding foreign proteins have been evaluated for oncolytic therapy with good safety profiles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">VSV is a bullet-shaped, negative-strand rhabdovirus with a genome of ∼11 kb. It encodes only five genes (in 3’ to 5’ order): the nucleocapsid (N), which packages the viral genome, protecting it from degradation and host antiviral effectors; a phosphoprotein (P) that is an essential cofactor of the replication complex; the matrix protein (M), which coordinates the packing of viral nucleoproteins into viral particles and blocks cellular antiviral mechanisms; the viral GP (G), which mediates receptor binding and the fusion of the viral membrane with that of the host cell to facilitate entry; and the large (L) polymerase protein that carries out viral genome transcription and replication. Each of these genes is flanked by defined gene start and end sequences that form individual transcription units. As transcription always initiates at the 3’ of the genome, a gradient of gene expression is generated in infected cells due to the reduced probability of successful reinitiation at each downstream transcription unit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Of significant advantage for the production of recombinant viruses, VSV can tolerate insertions that increase its genome size by up to 40% <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> as well as the introduction of additional transcription units. Moreover, as negative-strand RNA viruses do not recombine frequently, inserts are stably maintained during multiple rounds of replication <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The generation of recombinant VSV has been shown to require the co-expression of the viral antigenome together with helper plasmids encoding the minimal replication components: the N, P, and L genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Early systems relied on the antigenomic RNA and helper genes being driven by a T7 promoter, which was supplied by coinfection with a vaccinia virus encoding the T7 polymerase (VV-T7) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Using this system, recombinant VSV in which the GP has been replaced by a foreign GP from multiple viruses have been recovered, including arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses, and paramyxoviruses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. However, the additional biosafety risk posed by VV, the need to isolate the recombinant VSV away from VV, and potential interference between the two viruses constitute important disadvantages of this system. Additionally, the multiplicity of infection and the purity of VV can strongly affect recovery efficiency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Finally, despite extensive experience in recovery of recombinant VSV in our laboratory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, we found this system to be inefficient for generating recombinant VSV encoding GPs which do not efficiently mediate infection in the context of VSV (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins). Alternative methods employing a cell line that encodes the T7 polymerase together with either T7-driven helper plasmids or cytomegalovirus (CMV)-driven helper plasmids have been reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> but their efficiency relative to the VV-based system is unclear.</p><p id="P6">In this work, we developed and optimized a system for the recovery of recombinant VSV encoding foreign GPs. The system is efficient, resulting in up to 100% recovery for some recombinant viruses, does not rely on the use of VV, can be carried out in small-scale formats, and even enables the recovery of VSV pseudotyped with GPs that are inefficient in mediating infection. In addition, we highlight the utility of these recombinant VSVs to study the effects of GP on viral fitness using two in vitro assays. The plasmids developed herein have been deposited in the European Virus Archive for their distribution to the scientific community.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="P7">Our initial goal was to recover recombinant VSV encoding foreign GPs from different viral families to study their evolution and adaptation to different cell types. For this, we employed a plasmid encoding the VSV antigenome of the Indiana serotype that has been previously modified to encode GFP from an additional transcription unit between the G and L genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. This plasmid is flanked by a T7 promoter and a T7 terminator to produce the viral antigenome in cells expressing the T7 polymerase (pVSV-GFP). We further modified this plasmid by replacing the coding region of the VSV G gene with a short linker flanked by two restriction enzymes to facilitate cloning of foreign GPs (pVSVΔG-GFP-linker) and also generated a similar plasmid encoding mCherry (pVSVΔG-mCherry-linker). To recover recombinant VSV, we utilized a previously published system that has been used to successfully recover recombinant VSV by multiple groups, including ours <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. In this system, the T7 polymerase is expressed in BHK21 cells by infection with a vaccinia virus encoding the T7 polymerase (VV-T7) under the immediate-early promoter. Subsequently, plasmids encoding the native N, P, and L genes of VSV flanked by T7 promoter and terminator sequences are cotransfected with the VSV antigenome plasmid. Finally, an inhibitor of DNA-dependent transcription is added to block additional replication of VV-T7 after sufficient T7 polymerase has been expressed (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">Material and Methods</xref>). Rather than employing standard BHK21 cells, we used a BHK21 cell line that can be induced to express VSV G (BHK21-G43) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> in order to increase the titers of VSV encoding a foreign GPs and to enable the recovery of VSV lacking any GP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Despite multiple attempts to optimize the recovery of recombinant VSV carrying different GPs, recovery rates remained low (success rate of 0.11±0.16), were inconsistent, and some recombinant VSVs were not successfully recovered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The inability to obtain recombinant VSV encoding different GPs led us to seek an alternative recovery method that is safe, efficient, and robust. For this, we chose to modify a plasmid-based approach used for the recovery of paramyxoviruses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and respiratory syncytial virus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Specifically, the need for VV-T7 was bypassed by using a plasmid encoding a codon-optimized version of the T7 polymerase (pT7-opt), which was shown to improve the recovery of negative strand viruses compared to the wildtype T7 sequence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Secondly, we designed new helper plasmids to increase the expression level of the N, P, and L proteins by codon-optimizing their sequence to more closely match that of mammalian cells, which has been shown to facilitate the recovery of an unrelated negative-strand RNA virus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. The new sequences increased the codon-adaptation index <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> of the helper genes from &lt; 0.69 to &gt; 0.87 relative to BHK21 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). These codon-optimized sequences were then introduced into a mammalian expression plasmid between a CMV promoter and an SV40 polyadenylation signal (pCMV-Nopt, pCMV-Popt, and pCMV-Lopt) to enable VV-T7 independent expression. Finally, a synthetic intron sequence was maintained in the plasmids, which has been shown to increase protein expression in mammalian cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">To evaluate this system, we chose to use an antigenomic VSV plasmid encoding the Spike (S) gene of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA4.5. variant (pVSVΔG-GFP-S2<sub>BA4.5.</sub>). The antigenomic and helper plasmids were transfected together with the pT7-opt plasmid into BHK-G43 cells. Experiments were performed in either 24-well or 12-well plate formats to enable the testing of multiple conditions in the same experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and BHK-G43 cells were induced to express VSV G at the time of transfection to improve recovery.</p><p id="P10">Overall, two different transfection reagents (Lipofectamine 2000 and Lipofectamine 3000), four ratios of the helper plasmids, and three temperature conditions (33 °C, 33 °C for 40 h followed by incubation at 37 °C, or 37 °C) were evaluated to identify the best conditions for recovery. The number of successful events was monitored in a live cell microscope by examining GFP expression in each condition until ∼4 days post-infection. Recombinant virus was obtained in 11 of the 12 conditions evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Overall, Lipofectamine 3000 resulted in improved recovery compared to Lipofectamine 2000 in all but one of the conditions (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002 by logistic regression), reaching 100% recovery in three of the conditions (range 17%–100%, mean 65.2%) versus a maximal success rate of 75% for Lipofectamine 2000 (range 0%–75%, mean 36.1%). Similarly, different plasmid ratios significantly altered recovery rates, with N:P:L:T7:VSVΔG-S2<sub>BA4.5.</sub> ratios of 3:1:1:2:1 and 2:1:1:2:1 yielding the best results (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005 for both by logistic regression). No significant differences were observed between the different incubation temperatures overall (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 by logistic regression), although the temperature showing the largest fraction of conditions with &gt; 90% recovery (three of the four conditions) was observed when cells were first incubated at 33 °C for 40 h followed by incubation at 37 °C for 36 h, suggesting higher robustness for this condition.</p><p id="P11">To validate the effect of codon optimization on the recovery of recombinant VSV, we compared the recovery rate of the antigenomic plasmid pVSVΔG-GFP-S2<sub>BA4.5.</sub> obtained using the codon-optimized helpers versus helpers encoding native VSV genes expressed from a standard mammalian expression plasmid (pCMV-N, pCMV-P, pCMV-L). Using the optimized conditions identified above, the recovery rate was 62.5% (5/8) using the codon-optimized helper plasmids versus 0% (0/8) for the helper plasmids encoding the native VSV sequences (<italic>p</italic> = 0.026 by Fisher’s exact test). Hence, codon optimization was associated with a significant increase in the recovery of recombinant VSV. Of note, a T7 promoter sequence that is commonly present in mammalian expression plasmids and could compete with the T7-mediated expression of the antigenome is present only in the helper plasmids encoding the native VSV genes and could reduce the efficiency of recovery.</p><p id="P12">Having established the conditions necessary to mediate efficient recovery of recombinant VSV, we next examined compatibility with different GPs. For this, we cloned the GPs of different arenaviruses, coronaviruses, and hantaviruses (<italic>n</italic> = 28), and evaluated the ability to recover recombinant VSV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>). All viruses were successfully recovered, with several showing recovery rates &gt; 75%, highlighting the robustness of this system to function in the context of divergent GPs. Of note, particles emerging from this first amplification in this system are decorated with VSV G and must be grown in cells that do not express VSV G to ensure entry via the foreign GP encoded in the viral genome.</p><p id="P13">As BHK-G43 cells are not available in all laboratories, we tested whether standard BHK21 cells can be utilized to recover recombinant VSV by supplying an additional plasmid encoding the VSV G gene. Using VSV-ΔG-GFP-S2<sub>BA4.5.</sub> as the antigenomic vector and a molar ratio of 2:1:1:2:1:2 for N:P:L:T7:VSVΔG-S2<sub>BA4.5.</sub>:VSV-G plasmids, we performed four independent experiments, each comprised of four technical replicates (16 wells in total). Recombinant virus was successfully recovered in one or more wells of each replicate, with an average success rate of 37.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Similarly, when using the pVSVΔG-GFP-linker antigenomic plasmid, which does not encode a GP, recombinant virus was recovered in a single well in three of the four replicates, yielding an average recovery rate of 18.8% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Hence, the described protocol can be successfully implemented in standard BHK21 cells by the inclusion of a VSV G expression plasmid albeit at reduced efficiency. Additional optimization of plasmid ratios and/or the utilization of alternative cell lines that show higher transfection efficiency (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., HEK293T cells) could potentially increase recovery rates.</p><p id="P14">Finally, to illustrate the utility of these recombinant VSVs for investigating the biology of viral GPs, we assessed the effect of VSV encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S sequences of Wuhan-Hu-1, Alpha, Delta, and Mu variants using two in vitro assays for measuring viral fitness. First, we directly competed each of these recombinant VSVs, which also encode eGFP, against a common reference VSV encoding the Wuhan-Hu-1 S gene and mCherry in lieu of eGFP. Each virus was competed against the reference virus for two sequential rounds of infection in VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells and the amount of each virus produced at the end of the competition was compared to its relative frequency in the inoculum. Compared to VSV encoding the Wuhan-Hu-1 S, VSV encoding the Alpha S produced significantly higher viral titers (1.19 ± 0.08 fold; <italic>p</italic> = 0.008 by two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test), VSV encoding the Delta S showed a moderate, non-significant increase (1.07 ± 0.05 fold; <italic>p</italic> = 0.11 by two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test), while VSV encoding the Mu S produced significantly lower viral titers (0.43 ± 0.28 fold; <italic>p</italic> = 0.02 by two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). As an alternative assay for viral fitness, we assessed the ability of recombinant VSV encoding the different S genes to spread over time. For this, VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells were infected with a single recombinant VSV encoding the different S sequences, and viral spread was monitored by measuring virus-driven GFP expression over time using a live-cell microscope. The GFP signal was integrated using area under the curve analysis to quantify the spread of each virus over time and standardized to that of the VSV encoding the Wuhan-Hu-1 S gene in each experiment. Relative spread measurements showed good consistency between experimental replicates (<italic>n</italic> = 3, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.88 – 0.97). As observed in the direct competition assay, Alpha S showed significantly increased viral spread compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 (1.66 ± 0.24 fold; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0009 by two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test), the spread of Delta S was improved but did not reach statistical significance (1.59 ± 0.39 fold; <italic>p</italic> = 0.07 by two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test), and Mu S showed significantly decreased spread (0.82 ± 0.58 fold; <italic>p</italic> = 0.008 by two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Hence, both assays provided similar results, revealing significantly increased fitness of the Alpha variant relative to Wuhan-Hu-1, a more modest improvement in fitness of the Delta variant, and reduced fitness of the Mu variant. These results are in line with findings obtained using the full infectious SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants, where improved fitness was observed over the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, although Delta was shown to have higher fitness than Alpha <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Hence, the recombinant VSV system described herein provides a convenient method for assessing the effect of different GPs on viral fitness.</p><p id="P15">In sum, we describe an efficient, safe, and economical approach to generate recombinant VSV encoding foreign glycoproteins. We demonstrate the utility of the method by recovering a large number of recombinant VSVs encoding different GPs from multiple viral families, as well as VSV lacking a GP, which can be used for pseudotyping experiments where the GP is provided in <italic>trans</italic>. The recovered viruses encode a fluorescent reporter gene to facilitate the detection of successful recovery of recombinant viruses as well as their titration and can be used to interrogate adaptation to cellular environments, the identification of drug or neutralizing antibody escape mutations, fitness assessment, or the production of vaccine candidates.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S4"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P16">All commercial cell lines were obtained from ATCC.

Finally, cells were transfected with the T7-driven helper plasmids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> using 2 μL Lipofectamine 2000 and the indicated DNA ratios. Following 5 h, 0.25 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS, 20 nM mifepristone, and 100 μg/mL Ara-C (to block VV replication) were added and the cells were further incubated for 2-4 days at 37 °C.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Plasmid-based recovery of recombinant VSV</title><p id="P19">For transfection, 1 μg total of DNA plasmids containing the helper and antigenomic plasmids at the indicated ratios were diluted into a final volume of 50 μL of Opti-MEM (GIBCO) together with 2 μL of the P3000 reagent when Lipofectamine 3000 was used. In a separate tube, 2 μL of the indicated lipofectamine reagent was diluted in Opti-MEM to a final volume of 50 μL per well. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, both tubes were mixed gently and further incubated for 15 min at room temperature. BHK-G43 cells that were plated 24 h earlier at a density of 150,000 cells per well of a 12-well plate in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS without antibiotics were washed with PBS and 200 μL of Opti-MEM added, followed by the addition of 100 μL of the transfection reagent. The cells were then incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, after which 1 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 nM of mifepristone (Acros Organics) were added to induce VSV G expression. The cells were then incubated at the indicated temperature and recovery was monitored by examination of GFP expression on a live-cell microscope (Incucyte SX5; Sartorius). The optimized protocol is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Analysis of viral competition and spread</title><p id="P20">All viral stocks used in these experiments were amplified in VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells and treated with a neutralizing antibody targeting G prior to infection to clear any VSV G from viral population resulting from their recovery in induced BHK-G43 cells which express VSV G. For direct competition, VeroE6-TMPRSS2 grown overnight in 24-well plates so as to reach 50% confluence were infected with 400 focus forming units (FFU) containing a 1:1 mixture of a reference VSV (encoding mCherry and the Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 S sequence) and the test recombinant VSV encoding eGFP and the S sequence of interest. Following 2.5 h of infection at 37 ºC, the virus mixture was removed from the wells, the cells were washed with PBS, and 0.5 mL of DMEM containing 2% FBS was added. After 24 h, virus-containing supernatant was collected and the relative amount of each virus was quantified by plaque assay. Briefly, VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells were infected with different dilutions of virus-containing supernatant, overlayed with DMEM containing 0.5% Agar (Sigma-Aldrich catalog A1296) to restrict viral spread, and imaged on a live-cell microscope (Incucyte SX5) after 24 h. Viral titers were then obtained by counting green or red foci. A second round of infection was similarly performed with 400 FFU/well of the viruses emerging from the first infection and quantified. The fitness, W, of each variant was calculated using the formula <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> with R(0) and R(t) representing the ratio of the counts of virus production of the test virus versus the reference virus in the initial inoculation mixture or the supernatant recovered from the second round of infection. All values were standardized by the average fitness of the recombinant VSV encoding the Wuhan-Hu-1 S. For viral spread, VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells in 12-well or 24-well well plates were infected at an MOI of 0.004 for 1.5 h. Subsequently, the media was replaced with DMEM containing 2% FBS and GFP fluorescence was monitored using a live-cell microscope starting at 9 h every 3 h for 48 h or until saturation was observed in the Wuhan-Hu-1 infected condition. The area under the curve of the log-transformed total integrated GFP fluorescence versus time was obtained using the DescTools package (version 0.99.50) in R (version 4.3.1). All values were standardized by dividing their value by the average AUC obtained for the Wuhan-Hu-1 S sequence in each experiment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Analysis of codon adaptation</title><p id="P21">The original and codon-optimized sequences were analyzed using the Codon Adaptation Index tool <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genomes.urv.es/CAIcal/">http://genomes.urv.es/CAIcal/</ext-link>) using the codon usage table of <italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic> obtained from the Codon Usage Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/cgi-bin/showcodon.cgi?species=10036">https://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/cgi-bin/showcodon.cgi?species=10036</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Data_S1_plasmid sequences</label><media xlink:href="EMS192865-supplement-Data_S1_plasmid_sequences.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d20aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Data_S2_recovery protocol</label><media xlink:href="EMS192865-supplement-Data_S2_recovery_protocol.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d20aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary tables S1, S2, S3</label><media xlink:href="EMS192865-supplement-Supplementary_tables_S1__S2__S3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d20aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S10"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Gert Zimmer for sharing the BHK-G43 cells.</p><sec id="S11"><title>Funding</title><p>Funding for this project was provided by grants SGL2021-03-009 and SGL2021-03-052 from European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR through the CSIC Global Health Platform established by EU Council Regulation 2020/2094, to RG, SFE, and RS.
