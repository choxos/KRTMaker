CTPS is the rate-limiting enzyme to catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of UTP to CTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Notably, CTPS has been observed to form filamentous structures termed cytoophidia in a wide range of organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Cytoophidia have been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> since 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], with subsequent studies confirming their presence in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], fission yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], archaea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], and mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. These findings highlight the highly conserved nature of cytoophidia among different organisms and suggest that they possess significant yet undiscovered biological functions.</p><p id="P3">The role of cytoophidia remains enigmatic, despite proposed physiological functions in various organisms. Multiple studies have demonstrated that cytoophidia regulate cell metabolism by adopting different conformations to control CTPS enzymatic activity across different organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. In <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, cytoophidia cooperated with the intermediate filament to maintain cellular shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, cytoophidia are involved in optic lobe development and oogenesis; recent studies showed that cytoophidia take part in adipose architecture and metabolism, and loss of cytoophidia reduced adipocyte expansion and inhibition of lipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. In human cells, cytoophidia stabilize the CTPS protein by extending its half-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Cytoophidia participate in ovarian stress response in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], as well as respond to changes in nutrition, pH, temperature, and osmolality for stress adaptation in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, cytoophidia contributed to rapid cell proliferation, they have been observed in neuroblasts of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] and highly proliferated T cells within the murine thymus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Additionally, elevated CTPS activity has been found in various cancers such as hepatoma and lymphoma; moreover, cytoophidia have been identified within human cancers like hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], suggesting an important role for cytoophidia in cell proliferation.</p><p id="P4">The cytoophidia are believed to play a crucial role in coupling cell proliferation, particularly in fast-growing cells like cancer cells and activated T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Notably, studies have shown that mouse embryonic stem cells possess abundant cytoophidia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. In the context of cancer, the formation of cytoophidia may indicate an abnormal capacity for rapid proliferation. However, none of these studies explicitly elucidate the specific function that cytoophidia undertake in cell proliferation. The absence of CTPS redundancy provides <italic>S. pombe</italic> with a distinct advantage as a model organism for investigating the function of cytoophidia. In comparison to humans and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, which possess two CTPS isoforms (CTPS1 and CTPS2 in humans; URA7 and URA8 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), <italic>S. pombe</italic> only harbors one CTPS isoform encoded by a single locus <italic>cts1</italic> on chromosome I.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we utilize <italic>S. pombe</italic> as a model system to investigate the role of CTPS cytoophidia in cellular proliferation. Our results demonstrate that the absence of cytoophidia leads to a delay in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and an increase in cell size. Interestingly, there exists a mutual dependence between cytoophidia and CTPS protein levels; specifically, loss of cytoophidia decreases protein levels while protein levels influence cytoophidia formation. The expression levels of multiple genes associated with cell growth and proliferation are reduced in strains lacking cytoophidia. Overexpression of SLM9, a histone transcription regulator involved in regulating CDC2 via WEE1, mitigates the prolongation of the cell cycle and enlargement of cell size caused by loss-filament mutant of CTPS. These findings provide valuable insights into the regulatory roles played by cytoophidia during cellular proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Cytoophidia are observed exclusively during the log phase of <italic>S. pombe</italic></title><p id="P6">The growth of <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells can be divided into four distinct stages: lag phase, exponential phase, stationary phase, and death phase, and each characterized by unique metabolic conditions. We previously reported that cytoophidia regulated by the metabolic conditions within <italic>S. pombe</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Utilizing the CTPS-YFP tagged strain (CTPS-YFP) previously established in our laboratory, we observed a high abundance of cytoophidia during the logarithmic phase, present in over 90% of fission yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A and C</xref>), which subsequently disappeared during the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B and C</xref>). Furthermore, compared with the exponential phase, there was a decrease in CTPS protein levels during the stationary phase while CTPS RNA levels remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D, E, and F</xref>). These findings indicate that cytoophidia are exclusively present during the logarithmic growth stage of fission yeast and suggest their potential importance in cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>Loss-filament mutant of CTPS impacts the cell cycle and size of <italic>S. pombe</italic></title><p id="P7">To investigate the role of cytoophidia in fission yeast, we specifically disrupted the polymerization of CTPS to form cytoophidia without affecting their enzymatic functions. Previous studies have demonstrated that the histidine amino acid at position 355 (His<sup>355</sup>) in human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as well as His<sup>360</sup> in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, is crucial for CTPS polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. By aligning the amino-acid sequences of both <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> CTPS proteins, we observed a similarity between His<sup>359</sup> in <italic>S. pombe</italic> CTPS and His<sup>360</sup> in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the replacement of His<sup>359</sup> with Ala<sup>359</sup>, an uncharged and smaller amino acid compared with histidine, would disrupt the polymerization ability of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> CTPS protein like that observed in humans, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p id="P8">Consequently, we generated a point mutant where His<sup>359</sup> was replaced by Ala<sup>359</sup> (refered to as H359A) within the endogenous CTPS protein of <italic>S. pombe.</italic> Additionally, we fused YFP at the C-terminus of the mutant CTPS for easy detection (CTPS<sup>H359A</sup>-YFP). By extracting genomic DNA from the H359A mutant fission yeast, we confirmed successful introduction of the intended point mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>). The CTPS H359A mutant fission yeast was viable, but did not form cytoophidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>’).</p><p id="P9">Furthermore, measurement via the OD<sub>600</sub> value showed that the CTPS H359A mutant strain exhibited a slower growth rate compared with the CTPS-YFP tagged strain, which served as the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Live cell imaging data showed that the CTPS H359A mutant strain had an extended cell cycle and increased cell length in comparison to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-E”’, G and H</xref>). Interestingly, western blotting analysis indicated reduced levels of CTPS protein in the H359A mutant strain when compared with the control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I and J</xref>), while real-time PCR showed similar levels of CTPS RNA between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Combined with the data of our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], these findings suggest that cytoophidia formation is crucial for maintaining adequate levels of CTPS protein in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, potentially through polymerization to ensure protein stability; they also indicate that failure to form CTPS cytoophidia leads to elongated cell cycles and influences cell size.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.3</label><title>Both CTPS protein levels and cytoophidia affect the cell cycle and size of <italic>S. pombe</italic></title><p id="P11">To understand whether the cytoophidia and the CTPS protein levels influenced the cell cycle and size. First, we disrupted filament formation without reducing its protein expression levels. We created a CTPS <sup>H359A-OE</sup> strain that overexpressed a mutant form of CTPS (H359A) tagged with mCherry at its C-terminus. we also generated a CTPS<sup>WT-OE</sup> strain that overexpressed wild-type CTPS tagged with mCherry, as well as a strain expressing only mCherry as the wild-type control. The strains were confirmed by real-time PCR and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D and E</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In both the log and stationary phases, the presence of cytoophidia was not observed in either the CTPS <sup>H359A-OE</sup> or the CTPS <sup>H359A</sup> strain, suggesting that the H359A mutation can act dominantly to inhibit cytoophidia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-C</xref>” and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 3C-C</xref>”). Surprisingly, even in the presence of overexpressed wild-type CTPS in the CTPS<sup>WT-OE</sup> strain, cytoophidia did not appear during both log phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>”) and stationary phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 2A-B</xref>”). Additionally, based on OD<sub>600</sub> measurements from growth curves, both the CTPS<sup>WT-OE</sup> and CTS<sup>H359A-OE</sup> strains exhibited slower growth rates compared with the wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Live cell imaging data revealed that both these strains had longer cell cycles and increased cell length compared with the wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G-H</xref>). These observations were consistent with those seen in the CTS<sup>H359A</sup> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I-G-H</xref>), indicating an influence of both cytoophidia formation and CTPS protein levels on cell proliferation rate.</p><p id="P14">Second, to investigate whether the decreasing CTPS protein levels influenced the formation of cytoophidia and cell proliferation. We knock down the CTPS using the CRISPRi method based on the CRISPR-dCas9 system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. The expression of dCas9 protein was regulated by the nmt1-41 promoter, which induced transcription upon thiamine removal from the medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 3A</xref>). Five sgRNAs were designed to target the <italic>cts1</italic> gene encoding CTPS protein in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 3B</xref>). Each of these sgRNAs was transformed into a CTPS-YFP tagged fission yeast strain, while a non-homologous served as a control group. Western blotting analysis confirmed the expression of dCas9 protein in all strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and C</xref>), and showed that CTPS protein levels were reduced in strains containing sgRNA2, sgRNA4, and sgRNA5 compared with the control group after thiamine removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). However, no significant changes in CTPS protein levels were observed in cells containing sgRNA1 and sgRNA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Knocking down CTPS resulted in decreased proportions of cytoophidia-forming cells with shorter cytoophidia lengths observed in cells targeted by sgRNA2, sgRNA4, and sgRNA5 compared with the control group; whereas no changes were seen for cells containing sgRNA1 or sgRNA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 3C-H</xref>). Measurement via OD<sub>600</sub> values revealed slower cell growth rates for CTPS knockdown strains (sgRNA2, sgRNA4, and sgrNA5) compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). The growth rate of sgRNA targeted strains was sgRNA5&gt;sgRNA4&gt;sgRNA2, which the CTPS protein knockdown levels increased sequentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>), and the cell length of these strains was also longer than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Furthermore, growth curve data indicated an extended cell cycle duration for CTPS knockdown cells relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The findings demonstrate that the modulation of CTPS protein levels has an impact on cytoophidia formation and cellular proliferation.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate which specific phase of the cell cycle (S, M, G1, or G2) was affected by this mutation. In fission yeast, the nuclear cell cycle is divided into distinct phases: G1, S, G2, and M. Following mitosis, newly replicated nuclei enter the subsequent cell cycle and undergo G1 and S phases before completing cytokinesis from the previous cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. This differs from mitosis in mammals and budding yeast.</p><p id="P18">First, we used hydroxyurea (HU) to induce cell cycle synchronization at the beginning of the S phase, the fission yeast was treated with HU for 4 hours followed by a release period of 3 hours.

In this study, we have identified that cytoophidia exert an influence on cell proliferation by modulating the G2 phase, with slm9 also implicated and a potential regulatory relationship between slm9 and cytoophidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). However, the precise mechanism through which cytoophidia regulate cell proliferation remains elusive. Our investigation may provide valuable insights into unraveling this mechanism.

Briefly, forward and reverse primers were designed to be complementary to a 20-bp region on each side of the knock-in cassette. Additionally, flanking sequences of 60 bp that were complementary to the immediate 5’-upstream and 3’-downstream endogenous regions of the cts1 gene were included in each primer (total length of 80-90 bp for each primer). These primers were then used in a PCR reaction with the <italic>cts1</italic>-H359A-YFP containing plasmid as template to amplify the cassette.

The plasmid pAH237, generously provided by Prof. Tomoyasu Sugiyama, harbors the coding sequence of Cas9 along with a cloning site for the sgRNA and a leucine genetic screening marker. Subsequently, modifications were made to this plasmid to enable the expression of catalytically inactive dCas9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Briefly, dCas9 eliminates DNA endonuclease activity through mutations D10A and H840A of cas9. The resulting plasmid, which expresses sgRNA and dCas9, is named pdCas9.

The constructed sgRNA-pdCas9 plasmids were transferred into fission yeast using the lithium acetate method. Transcription of the dCas9 gene is controlled by an inducible promoter, nmt1-41p, whose transcription is inhibited by 15 µM thiamine in the culture medium. Therefore, fission yeast cells carrying pdCas9 plasmid were grown on the EMM2 plates supplemented with 20 µM thiamine and necessary amino acid for yeast survival. To induce expression of dCas9 in fission yeast, thiamine was removed by washing the cells with sterilized water twice.
