It is widely acknowledged that neuropathological changes in the brain due to Alzheimer's disease begin approximately 20 years before any clinical symptoms manifest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Therefore, gaining an understanding of the cognitive, phenomenological, and underlying neuropathological changes occurring in the prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease is of great importance for predicting progression to dementia and enabling early management. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) presents an opportunity for studying these pre-Alzheimer's changes. MCI is a syndrome characterised by objective cognitive decline beyond what is expected for an individual's age and educational level, without notably affecting daily life activities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. MCI is common, with estimates suggesting a prevalence of 6.7% in 65–69 year olds which increases to 25% for people aged 80–84 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Importantly, not everyone with MCI progresses to AD; some remain stable or even improve <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. This reflects the range of underlying causes of MCI, and heterogeneity of how MCI is characterised and monitored. Neuroimaging and neurophysiological biomarkers can improve the accuracy of diagnosing the underlying aetiology of MCI. Biomarkers of brain function may also help explain the subjective and objective neuropsychological symptoms seen in MCI and predict those who will progress to developing AD or other neurodegenerative conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Large datasets of neuroimaging and neurophysiological biomarkers in people with MCI and prodromal dementia are therefore extremely valuable in identifying brain changes that occur in these populations. One such dataset is BioFIND, a multi-site magnetoencephalography (MEG) resting state dataset including people with MCI and healthy older controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. This MEG dataset provides an opportunity to examine neurophysiological differences in people with MCI, and specifically to examine markers of arousal and consciousness.</p><p id="P7">Electroencephalography (EEG) has long served as a neurophysiological marker in the study of AD, for diagnosis and progression tracking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and to characterise changes in neurophysiological function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. MEG provides some advantages over EEG due to the higher number of channels and better spatial resolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Due to their excellent temporal resolution, both MEG and EEG are well suited to studying dynamic brain changes. M/EEG signatures in AD patients include a shift in their power spectrum, transitioning from higher-frequency oscillations (such as alpha, beta, and gamma) to lower-frequency oscillations (delta and theta) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The use of ratios of different frequencies in M/EEG analysis is particularly advantageous <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. For example, lower alpha-theta ratio, indicating decreased alpha activity and increased theta activity, has been reported in early to moderate stages of AD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and has been shown to correctly discriminate AD patients from normal controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. These M/EEG features have also been seen in MCI patients and their potential to predict AD has been explored <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. A relatively open question is the physiological mechanism of this spectral shift, and its cognitive implications. To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the M/EEG signal, advanced analytical techniques have been developed, including those based on information theory, which capture the diversity of the signal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Among these techniques is the Lempel Ziv (LZ) algorithm, a non-linear measure that quantifies the complexity in time series data, such as M/EEG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and has been used in many clinical conditions such as depression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, epilepsy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, and to study various aspects of anaesthesia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Previous studies consistently demonstrate that individuals with AD exhibit significantly lower LZ complexity values compared to healthy controls, indicating less complex electrophysiological behaviour. This reduction in complexity has also been reported in people with MCI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, and has been attributed to neurodegeneration and the subsequent loss of connectivity in local neural networks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Whilst this evidence for reduced dynamical complexity in MCI and AD has also been demonstrated using other analytic approaches such as sample entropy and chaos analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, inferring a decreased capability to process information, what has not yet adequately been explored in the literature is how reduced dynamical complexity relates to the clinical features or phenomenology of MCI and AD. More specifically, markers of dynamical complexity have been used as objective measures of consciousness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, and these measures provide an opportunity to examine changes in consciousness in AD and MCI, and how these may relate to cognitive functioning. Consciousness research has shown that LZ reflects changes in levels of consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness versus healthy controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, normal wakefulness versus different sleep stages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, and in altered states of consciousness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, among other conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The correlation between dynamical complexity and consciousness is based on theories of consciousness, including integrated information theory (IIT) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, which provide a mathematical model for consciousness. Whilst there remains significant debate and ongoing research into the neural correlates of consciousness and the validity of theories of consciousness including IIT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, measures of complexity, including LZ, have been demonstrated to have clinical validity in differentiating between states of consciousness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> and could be used to investigate changes in consciousness in MCI and dementia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Central features of AD include changes in the level and content of consciousness, and these are apparent from the earliest stages of the disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Early AD is often accompanied by changes in awareness, including anosognosia, metacognition and self-awareness, and changes in arousal and sleep disturbance are also common and distressing symptoms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. These changes in level and content of consciousness are associated with neurodegenerative changes and disruption of functional connectivity and become increasingly apparent with progression of AD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Biomarkers of arousal and awareness are essential to monitor how consciousness may change with progression of cognitive impairment, particularly as dementia progresses and patients become unable to report their experiences. However, it remains unclear how early changes in neurophysiological signatures of consciousness occur and whether they are already apparent and correlate with cognitive impairment in people with MCI. This study therefore aims to assess LZ complexity and arousal in MCI and how these markers relate to cognitive impairment. We hypothesize that lower LZ complexity will be associated with MCI compared to healthy individuals and will decrease with increasing cognitive impairment. Additionally, we expect a concurrent decline in arousal levels with MCI, measured by the theta-alpha ratio (TAR), and that both TAR and LZ will relate to cognitive deterioration associated with MCI. By investigating the interplay between neural complexity, arousal, and cognition in MCI, this study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the neurophysiological underpinnings of consciousness in cognitive decline and prodromal dementia.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P10">Participants were recruited to a study of biomarkers in dementia, the BioFIND study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.

The HPI coils were energized at frequencies above 150 Hz in CTB and above 300 Hz in CBU. Prior to the scan, a Fastrak digitizer from Polhemus Inc.

This involved the following steps: (i) fitting a sphere to the digitised head points, excluding those on the nose, and using the centre of this sphere along with the sensor positions to establish a spherical harmonic basis set for Signal Space Separation (SSS). This was done to eliminate environmental noise using the default number of basis functions. (ii) Head position was calculated every 1 second, although no motion correction was applied. (iii) Bad channels were interpolated.

Lempel Ziv can be understood to associate signal complexity with the richness of content, A signal is deemed complex if it cannot be succinctly represented or compressed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. In this study we adhere to the original procedure commonly known as LZ76, following the simplified algorithm described by Kaspar and Schuster <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. LZ was evaluated using a temporal compression within a channel, averaged across channels (LZsum) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.

Epochs where alpha power was reduced, and theta power was increased correspond to drowsier segments. The TAR data, but not the LZsum data, exhibited non-normal distribution, therefore a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was also performed for the group comparisons of the TAR data.

Therefore, the significant relationship between LZsum and group was not explained by changes in arousal alone. This is further demonstrated by a non-significant regression model for TAR and LZsum including all participants (F(1,164) =0.072, r = 0.021, p = 0.789) and in only the MCI patients (F(1,81) = 1.107, r = 0.116, p = 0.296).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Complexity and Arousal Measurements Correlate with Cognitive Impairment Across All Participants</title><p id="P25">Across all participants, linear regressions were used to test if MMSE significantly predicted LZsum and TAR.

We found that consciousness, as measured by the neural complexity measure LZsum, was reduced in MCI patients, and in line with this, arousal as measured by the theta-alpha ratio (TAR), was also reduced in MCI patients versus controls. Additionally, cognitive impairment, as measured by the MMSE, was found to correlate with both LZsum and TAR, both overall, and within MCI patients alone.</p><p id="P28">These findings are in line with, and significantly extend, the hypothesis that even in the early stages of cognitive decline, such as MCI, there can be disruptions to consciousness. There is increasing evidence that changes in arousal and awareness can occur early in the course of dementia and may be evident in MCI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. For instance, several studies have demonstrated that people with MCI have reduced awareness of their memory deficits and may underestimate or overestimate their cognitive difficulties <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Similarly, there is evidence for changes in arousal and wakefulness in MCI, with around 60% of MCI patients subjectively reporting sleep disturbance, which is related to the extent of cognitive impairment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Behavioural measures of insight and awareness have also generally been found to correlate with MMSE in MCI. Here we extend this overall picture of a relationship between severity of cognitive impairment and subjective and behavioural changes in arousal and awareness in MCI, by adding the neural domain. Specifically, we show that LZsum and TAR markers of consciousness and arousal significantly correlate with MMSE. The demonstration that Lzsum and TAR markers can not only differentiate people with MCI from age-matched controls but are sensitive to the extent of cognitive decline supports the use of these metrics to investigate and monitor consciousness in MCI and AD, and provides further evidence that disruptions to consciousness can start in the preclinical stages of dementia. In early AD, impaired awareness of deficits is associated with a range of negative outcomes including impaired decision-making capacity, psychiatric distress, heightened caregiver stress, and diminished perceived relationship quality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, and this may also extend to people with MCI. Therefore, an understanding of subtle changes in arousal and awareness in MCI is important for ensuring person-centred management and support.</p><p id="P29">Although the present study does not have data on individual patterns of neurodegeneration or amyloid pathology in the MCI patients, previous studies have demonstrated that individuals with amnestic MCI and evidence of amyloid pathology demonstrate greater impairments of awareness of memory deficits, suggesting deficits in awareness may be more common in MCI due to underlying AD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. In early AD, impaired awareness of deficits is associated with neurodegeneration and disruption of neural networks and functional connectivity between regions, including the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, and medial temporal lobe <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. This may also be the case in MCI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, reflecting neurodegenerative changes in prodromal or preclinical AD. The finding of reduced LZsum values in MCI patients in our study aligns with previous research indicating a disruption of global brain network connectivity and reduced complexity in the brain activity of individuals with AD and MCI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">It is important to acknowledge some limitations of this study. One limitation is the potential effect of site differences, as participants were recruited from distinct locations. Site differences could introduce variability in data collection and analysis. Variations in imaging techniques, equipment, and procedural protocols across different recruitment sites may influence the LZ and MMSE measures. Additionally, age is an important consideration in dementia research. Advanced age is a known risk factor for MCI and AD, and age-related changes in brain structure and function may confound the results. Future studies should carefully control for age and explore potential interactions between age, LZ complexity, and consciousness in MCI and AD populations. However, of note, analyses here revealed the main results remained significant when site and age were included as co-variants.</p><p id="P31">There are also limitations of the BioFIND dataset in investigating consciousness, as there are no specific behavioural or subjective measures of awareness or arousal to directly correlate with the MEG biomarkers. Whilst LZsum and TAR are recognised as reliable markers of consciousness and arousal in the literature, establishing a clear connection between changes in these metrics and the subjective experience of people with MCI remains crucial. The literature on changes in the level and content of conscious experience in MCI remains limited, and future research could combine self-reports and behavioural measures of self-awareness, metacognition, anosognosia and arousal with these biomarkers of awareness to map changes more accurately in awareness to neurophysiological states.</p><p id="P32">In summary, the findings of this study shed light on the alterations in consciousness and arousal in MCI. The LZsum measure provides valuable insights into the complexity of brain activity, which is closely related to consciousness. By identifying changes in LZ complexity and its correlation with cognitive impairment in MCI, we gain a better understanding of the subtle impairments in consciousness that can occur even in the early stages of cognitive decline. These results also highlight the involvement of the alpha and theta frequency bands in modulating arousal states and provide further evidence for the disruption of arousal regulation in cognitive decline. However, more research is needed to explore the potential clinical and phenomenological implications of altered alpha-theta ratios and changes in dynamical complexity in MCI and AD. These biomarkers of awareness and arousal can also be used to assess consciousness in more advanced dementia, where subjective reports become unreliable due to impairment in communication. Understanding the relationship between arousal, awareness, disease progression, and cognitive decline could contribute to the development of targeted interventions and treatment strategies to mitigate the impact of impaired consciousness on AD patients' daily functioning and quality of life.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the participants for taking part in the research and the BioFIND research team for providing access to the data.
