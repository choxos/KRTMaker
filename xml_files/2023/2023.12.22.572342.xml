Associated karyotypes include 45,X monosomy, 45,X mosaicism (45,X/46,XX or 45,X/46XY), isochromosome Xq (e.g., 46,X,i(Xq) or 45,X/46,X,i(Xq)), and ring X (e.g. 45,X/46,X,r(X)). Most women with TS have POI, although karyotypes with a greater X chromosome gene dosage (e.g,.45,X/46,XX) confer less of a POI risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cameron-Pimblett et al., 2017</xref>). However, even for women with 45,X monosomy, there is variability in the degree of ovarian function: while over 85% have disrupted pubertal progression and primary amenorrhoea, 15% present with secondary amenorrhoea or, occasionally, spontaneous pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cameron-Pimblett et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Although TS is relatively common, occurring in 1/2000 female live births, and despite the high prevalence of POI in this condition, surprisingly few studies have investigated the pathogenesis and variability of ovarian dysfunction in TS. It is suggested that germ cell development follows a normal trajectory for the first trimester, followed by accelerated oocyte apoptosis and ovarian degeneration prior to birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Singh &amp; Carr, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hsueh et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sperling, 2008</xref>). Mouse studies from the 1980s demonstrated that 45,X ovaries are smaller and have fewer oocytes than 46,XX ovaries and proposed faulty sex chromosome pairing as the key driver of meiotic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Burgoyne &amp; Baker, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Burgoyne &amp; Baker, 1981</xref>). More recently, morphological analyses of human fetal 45,X ovaries demonstrated massive oocyte apoptosis by 15-20wpc; marked granulosa cell apoptosis; few or no viable follicles; and fewer oocytes compared to control samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lundgaard Riis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Modi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Reynaud et al., 2004</xref>). These data correlate with the clinical phenotype of POI in TS, but do not demonstrate mechanistically why POI develops in the first instance.</p><p id="P12">Considering the especial role sex chromosome genes play in mammalian gonadal development, and the importance of X-inactivation and reactivation to germ cell maturation, a reduction in X chromosome gene dosage due to X chromosome haploinsufficiency has been reasonably proposed to be central to the pathogenesis of ovarian insufficiency in TS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Afkhami et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Heard &amp; Turner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Severino et al., 2022</xref>). However, X chromosome gene dosage effects as the only contributing factor to ovarian dysfunction does not explain why some women with 45,X TS have relatively preserved reproductive function. Other possible explanations for the ovarian insufficiency phenotype include a reduction in dosage of genes escaping X chromosome inactivation (XCI escape genes); epigenetic abnormalities; downstream autosomal genetic disruption; and telomere length abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Trolle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jackson-Cook, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Rizzolio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gravholt et al., 2022</xref>).

For example, ovarian cryopreservation in young children with TS is being trialled in some countries as part of research studies (e.g., The Danish TURNER Cryopreservation Study, NCT05740579; NIH Gonadal Tissue Freezing for Fertility Preservation in Individuals at Risk for Ovarian Dysfunction, NCT04948658). Particularly, establishing the degree to which ovarian insufficiency in TS is established by the time of birth is a key consideration when planning therapeutic interventions.</p><p id="P28">Single-cell-omics technologies have been used to generate large tissue-specific “atlases”, such as a recent atlas of human fetal ovary development, which are very useful in understanding mechanisms of normal organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Vento-Tormo et al., 2018</xref>). However, by comparing unaffected control tissue with tissue affected by a condition, single-cell sequencing can also be used to discern the genetic drivers underlying pathogenic mechanisms. This work demonstrates the value of single-nuclei/single-cellRNA-sequencing technologies when applied to a developmental phenotype – in this case, TS. Specifically, we advance our understanding of X chromosome gene expression in human fetal ovary development, describe important transcriptomic differences between 46,XX ovaries and 45,X fetal ovaries at a critical peri-meiotic timepoint, and provide insight into novel potential mechanisms of ovarian insufficiency in TS.</p><p id="P29">Previous work has demonstrated that fetal ovaries in TS are smaller, have fewer follicles, and undergo marked cellular apoptosis during fetal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lundgaard Riis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Modi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Reynaud et al., 2004</xref>). These studies relied on 2D histological analysis of fetal ovary tissue in TS and used specific cell markers (e.g., OCT3/4) to estimate numbers of cells within the tissue overall. Here, we also demonstrate that 45,X fetal ovaries are macroscopically smaller with fewer follicles on histological analysis. However, for the first time to our knowledge, we use single-nucleus sequencing to accurately quantify cell counts within defined subpopulations of cells within TS ovaries compared to 46,XX ovaries. This unequivocally demonstrates that the 45,X ovary has fewer germ cells compared to 46,XX ovaries from the earliest point in primordial germ cell development.</p><p id="P30">We propose that the 46,XX-specific synaptic oogonia population identified on snRNA-seq analysis likely represents biological activity that does not occur in 45,X oogonia. An explanation is that asynapsis and broader peri-synapsis cytoskeleton dysfunction independently contribute to ovarian insufficiency in TS. This may be due to haploinsufficiency of key X-chromosome genes required for synapsis; for example, <italic>HNRNPA3,</italic> highly expressed in synaptic oogonia, interacts with XCI escape and synaptonemal complex gene <italic>SMC1A;</italic> and <italic>HTATSF1,</italic> another highly expressed gene within synaptic oogonia, itself escapes X-inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Trolle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Severino et al., 2022</xref>). However, peri-meiotic X chromosome haploinsufficiency as the only mechanism underlying ovarian insufficiency in TS does not explain why there are fewer total germ cells in Turner syndrome <italic>prior</italic> to the point of meiotic synapsis; why there are markers of apoptosis from very early on in 45,X ovaries; why there is a dysregulated transcriptome throughout 45,X fetal ovary development rather than specifically at meiosis; and why some women with 45,X TS have a relatively preserved germ cell pool. Therefore, it is possible that some mechanisms underlying ovarian insufficiency in TS are established prior to sex chromosome synapsis, and the 46,XX-specific synaptic oogonia population arises because 45,X oogonia fail to progress to that developmental stage given preceding aberrations in germ cell maturation.</p><p id="P31">Combining bulk RNAseq and snRNA-seq demonstrates that both X chromosome gene expression and X chromosome gene dosage play important roles in the typical developing ovary and may contribute to ovarian insufficiency in TS due to roles X chromosome genes have both before and during sex chromosome synapsis. For example, several X chromosome and XCI escape genes (e.g., <italic>BEND2, FAM9C, TEX11</italic>) with functions related to the meiotic cytoskeleton are expressed in the mature meiotic oogonia stage in 46,XX ovaries but less expressed in the 45,X ovaries. However, 45,X ovaries have globally disrupted X-inactivation patterns that may contribute to ovarian insufficiency beyond meiotic synapsis. The scRNAseq data recapitulated X-inactivation patterns expected in normal 46,XX germ cells, but showed that these patterns are disrupted in the 45,X ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Severino et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Heard &amp; Turner, 2011</xref>). The lack of <italic>XIST</italic> expression in somatic cells of 45,X ovaries is unsurprising: <italic>XIST</italic> equalizes X chromosome gene expression with that of a 46,XY male, and, with only one X chromosome, this is not required in 45,X cells. The expression of <italic>XIST</italic> from 45,X germ cells, albeit in fewer than expected, may relate to the especial role that <italic>XIST</italic> plays in germ cell development: PGCs that have never been X-inactivated, or have been reactivated too quickly, do not progress through meiosis normally and display an abnormal mitotic profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Severino et al., 2022</xref>). Possibly, some 45,X PGCs express <italic>XIST</italic> in an effort to inactivate their single X chromosome. <italic>XACT</italic> expression in 45,X FGCs at comparable expression to 46,XX FGCs further suggests that 45,X germ cells potentially follow the X-inactivation followed by X-reactivation pattern required for a normal meiotic programme. The X chromosome contains genes required for fundamental mitochondrial processes and complete X-inactivation in the setting of X chromosome haploinsufficiency likely would result in cell death. The fate of 45,X germ cells expressing <italic>XIST</italic> is therefore unclear – perhaps <italic>XIST</italic> expression in scattered 45,X cells is a mechanism of germ cell apoptosis in itself; or perhaps <italic>XIST</italic> expression is transient, localized to only a segment of the X chromosome, or downregulated before germ cell viability is threatened.</p><p id="P32">Beyond X-chromosome haploinsufficiency, and the impact of abnormal X-inactivation patterns on this, our data suggest additional possible drivers of ovarian dysfunction in TS. This includes an apparent dysregulated methylation programme in 45,X ovaries. Histone demethylases <italic>KDM6A, KDM3A,</italic> and <italic>KDM1A</italic> were differentially expressed in both 46,XX somatic and germ cell populations compared to 45,X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cui et al., 2018</xref>).

The enrichment of H2A histone modifiers <italic>HIST1H2AC, HIST1H2AA,</italic> and <italic>HIST1H4C</italic> across 46,XX cell populations is further evidence for a dysregulated methylome.

Genes within the synaptic oogonia cluster had roles in molecular chaperone systems required for proteostasis, including the CCT complex and heat shock protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Protein production results in the release of three-dimensional protein structures into the cellular environment which are at risk of aberrant folding and toxic aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hartl et al., 2011</xref>). The CCT is ATP-dependent and folds proteins important for microtubule integrity. The heat shock proteins also facilitate efficient protein folding and suppress apoptosis from toxic protein aggregates, again often requiring ATP. The synaptic oogonia cluster also contained several genes interacting as part of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, including <italic>EIF5</italic> and <italic>EIF2S2</italic>, two translation initiating factors specifically governing 40S ribosomal activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Llácer et al., 2018</xref>) and which have established roles in translational regulation during oogenesis in mice and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Villaescusa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Nakamura et al., 2004</xref>). Genes with antagonistic roles in neddylation, SUMOylation, ISGylation, and ubiquitination were also represented with the synaptic cluster. These post-translational protein modifications regulate the balance between protein production and degradation. Genes with roles in proteostasis were positively differentially expressed in 46,XX ovaries from the earliest germ cell stages, including <italic>HUWE1</italic> (ubiquitination), <italic>EEF2</italic> (translation), heat shock genes (<italic>HSP90AB1, HSP90AA1, HSPA1A)</italic>; and genes relating to ribosomal biogenesis (<italic>RPS3, RPS4X).</italic> Particularly, the role of <italic>RPS4X</italic> haploinsufficiency in the TS phenotype has been considered previously and we suggest that <italic>RPS4X</italic> haploinsufficiency in the 45,X fetal ovary results in impaired ribosomal assembly and reduced protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Peeters et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fisher et al., 1990</xref>). Protein synthesis demands high intracellular energy needs and several genes with proteostasis roles specifically require ATP to function. Indeed, there was an apparent deficiency in the expression of energy mitochondrial genes, such as <italic>COX6C, ATP11C, ATP5F1</italic>, in 45,X oogonia. Possibly, the apparent predominance of genes related to proteostasis within 46,XX oogonia reflects the inherent role of carefully controlled protein production during the energy-demanding processes of meiosis and sex chromosome synapsis which are impaired in 45,X ovaries due to issues arising earlier in germ cell development. However, an alternative explanation is that oogenesis, and particularly synapsis, involves high intracellular protein and energy production demands which 45,X oocytes cannot efficiently meet, possibly due to haploinsufficiency of genes required for proteostasis or even a primary energy deficiency in 45,X oogonia.</p><p id="P34">Limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size included in the snRNA-seq analysis (four in total) and the focus on a fixed timepoint in meiosis which may overlook a dynamic process over time and therefore miss important events occurring either pre-meiosis or once meiosis has been fully established. However, for the first time to our knowledge, we examine 45,X fetal tissue at single-cell resolution and offer insights into novel pathogenic mechanisms underlying ovarian insufficiency in TS. Taken together, our data suggest that, while X chromosome haploinsufficiency likely plays a significant role, a single, “all-or-nothing” event in the developing 45,X germ cell is unlikely to be solely responsible for meiotic failure and ovarian insufficiency in TS. Rather, we propose it may be a combinatorial process starting early in 45,X germ cell development characterised by periods of vulnerability throughout germ cell development.</p></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S19"><title>Tissue samples</title><p id="P35">Human embryonic and fetal samples used for these studies were obtained from the Human Developmental Biology Resource (HDBR, a Medical Research Council (MRC) and Wellcome Trust-funded tissue bank regulated by the Human Tissue Authority (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hdbr.org/">www.hdbr.org</ext-link>)).
