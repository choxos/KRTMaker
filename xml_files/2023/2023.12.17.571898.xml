However, the mechanisms underlying estradiol’s regulation of synaptic protein expression, and whether if they occur in a sex specific manner, is not well understood. In this study, using sex-specific hippocampal slice cultures and mixed-sex primary hippocampal neurons, we investigated whether local protein synthesis is required for estradiol-induced synaptic protein expression. Estradiol rapidly increased the rate of protein synthesis and the number of actively translating ribosomes along dendrites and near synapses in both male and female hippocampal neurons. Importantly, these effects occurred independently of gene transcription. Moreover, estradiol also increased the abundance of nascent proteins localised to synapses, independently of gene transcription. Specifically, estradiol increased the synaptic expression of GluN2B-containing <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and PSD-95 in male and female hippocampus. Mechanistically, mTOR signalling was required for estradiol-induced increases in overall local protein synthesis only in male but not female hippocampus. Consistent with this, mTOR signalling mediated estradiol increases in GluN2B in male, but not female, hippocampus. Conversely, mTOR inhibition, blocked estradiol-induced increased PSD-95 expression in both male and female hippocampus. Collectively, these data suggest that the rapid modulation of local protein synthesis by estradiol is required for changes in the synaptic proteome in male and female hippocampus, and that the requirement of the mTOR signalling pathway in these effects occur in both a sex-specific and protein-dependent manner, with this signalling pathway have a greater role in male compared to female hippocampus.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Estrogens, in particular the biologically active form 17β-estradiol (estradiol; E2), have widely been reported to have an enhancing effect on cognition in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Taxier <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). A single administration of estradiol is sufficient to improve performance on a range of cognitive tasks in both male and female rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fortress <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Phan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jacome <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>).

For example, estradiol increases the synaptic expression of GluN2B-containing <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), PSD-95 and GluA1-containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid receptors (AMPARs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jelks <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Liu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Avila <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Sheppard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). These changes in dendritic spine density and synaptic proteome are thought to underlie estradiol’s ability to modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity, and thus, its effects on cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Srivastava <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Vedder <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Luine <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Sheppard <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>). Indeed, estradiol rapidly potentiates excitatory synaptic transmission the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wong &amp; Moss, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Oberlander &amp; Woolley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Jain &amp; Woolley, 2023</xref>), and enhances <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Smith &amp; McMahon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Liu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kramar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Vedder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, while these effects occur in both male and female hippocampus, the mechanisms underlying estradiol’s effects on synaptic transmission differ in a sex-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Oberlander &amp; Woolley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Jain &amp; Woolley, 2023</xref>). However, the mechanism underlying estradiol’s effect on the synaptic proteome, and whether they also occur in a sex-specific manner is not well understood.</p><p id="P4">Mechanistically, the effects of estradiol on the synaptic proteome, dendritic spines and synaptic function are thought to be mediated via a ‘non-classical’ membrane-initiated mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Srivastava <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Taxier <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). Estradiol-mediated membrane-initiated signalling is characterised by activation of signalling kinase pathways, such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, as well as the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, and moreover, is thought to be independent of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sellers <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Taxier <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). Consistent with this, activation of kinases pathways, as well as effects on dendritic spines, synaptic proteome and function have typically been described to occur within minutes of estradiol treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Woolley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Phan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sellers <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Luine <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Taxier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Sheppard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). However, the effects of estradiol on the synaptic proteome, dendritic spines and synaptic function have also been described to last for hours or days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Woolley &amp; McEwen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Smith &amp; McMahon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Tuscher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). As such, it is currently not fully understood how estradiol treatment can result in long-lasting changes in the synaptic proteome and synaptic function.</p><p id="P5">The changes in the synaptic proteome that drive synaptic plasticity can be achieved by the local synthesis of specific proteins along dendrites and at synapses. Consistent with, the machinery required for local synthesis of protein as well as mRNA encoding for synaptic proteins have been found to be located along dendrites and near synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Shrestha &amp; Klann, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bourke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). Moreover, neurons have been shown to increase the expression of synaptic proteins via a local protein synthesis mechanism, in response to different stimuli, including synaptic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Huber <italic>et al.,</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Schanzenbacher <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hafner <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>) and neuromodulatory signals including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hafner <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Jung <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>) and dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Smith <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">David <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). Therefore, local protein synthesis provides neurons with a mechanism to rapidly refine the synaptic proteome independently of gene transcription. A signalling pathway that has received particular attention in mediating local protein synthesis is the mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Costa-Mattioli <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hoeffer &amp; Klann, 2010</xref>). mTOR has well described roles in memory enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bekinschtein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and has also been shown to be critical for estradiol-dependent enhancement in the object recognition memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fortress <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>). Furthermore, estradiol rapidly activates mTOR <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fortress <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Sarkar <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Briz &amp; Baudry, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Sellers <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015b</xref>) and is required for the maintenance of estradiol-induced increased spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Tuscher <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>), but not formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Sellers <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015b</xref>). This has led to the suggestion that estradiol may influence local protein synthesis. In line with this, estradiol regulates the activity of mTOR downstream targets, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (4EBP1), p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) and ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Akama &amp; McEwen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Sarkar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fortress <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), which regulate local protein synthesis in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hoeffer &amp; Klann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Rangaraju <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). Consistent with these observations, estradiol has been shown to rapidly increase dendritic mRNA translation through the use of a fluorescent reporter based on the fusion of GFP with the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Sarkar <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010</xref>). Importantly, inhibition of protein synthesis, but not gene transcription, has been shown to be required for estradiol-facilitation of cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sheppard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). However, it is currently unclear whether estradiol modulation of synaptic proteome and dendritic spine density could occur via a local protein synthesis mechanism in male and female hippocampus, and if so, whether this requires signalling via the mTOR pathway.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we directly tested if estradiol could rapidly increase protein synthesis independently of gene transcription using a combination of acute hippocampal slice preparations from male and female mice, as well as mixed sex primary neuronal cultures. We further explored whether the rapid changes in dendritic spine density and synaptic proteome induced by estradiol were dependent on a local protein synthesis mechanism. Additionally, we investigated the role of the mTOR pathway in regulating local protein translation and changes in the synaptic proteome in male and female hippocampus. Data from our study suggests that the rapid modulation of local protein synthesis by estradiol is required for changes in the synaptic proteome in male and female hippocampus, but that the underlying signalling pathways that mediate these effects occur in a sex-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Estradiol increases local protein synthesis in the male and OVX female hippocampus</title><p id="P7">Estradiol has previously been demonstrated to rapidly engage protein translation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Akama &amp; McEwen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Sarkar <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fortress <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>). However, whether estradiol regulates protein synthesis in a rapid time frame, either in male or female hippocampus, has not been directly tested. Therefore, we first assessed the rate of global protein synthesis following treatment with estradiol using the surface sensing of translation (SUnSET) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Schmidt <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A-C</xref>). Using mixed sex primary neuronal culture, we treated neurons with 10 nM estradiol for 15, 30, 60 or 120 minutes; the concentration of 10 nM has previously been shown to have significant effects on dendritic spine density and activate multiple kinase pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Erli <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). Puromycin (10 μg/mL) was added for the last 10 minutes of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A+B</xref>). Estradiol increased the rate of protein synthesis which was significant after 120 minutes treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). This time-point was used in subsequent experiments.</p><p id="P8">We next generated acute hippocampal slices from 10-12 week old male and ovariectomized (OVX) female mice, and treated them with estradiol (10 nM) for 2 hours; puromycin (5 μg/mL) was added for the final 30 minutes of the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Up to 4 hippocampal slices were cut from each brain. Slices were divided and used in two experimental designs: (1) vehicle (DMSO) vs. estradiol (E2); or (2) vehicle (DMSO) vs. estradiol (E2) vs. vehicle (DMSO) + inhibitor vs. estradiol (E2) + inhibitor. This experimental design allowed for a direct comparison of treatment to control conditions within the same hippocampal preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with what we observed in primary cultures, estradiol treatment resulted in a significant increase in global protein synthesis in both male and OVX female hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-F</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Next, we determined whether estradiol-induced increase in global protein synthesis was a consequence of local protein synthesis. To this end, hippocampal slices were pre-treated with either the protein translation inhibitor, anisomycin or the RNA polymerase (transcriptional) inhibitor, actinomycin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Anisomycin blocked estradiol-mediated protein synthesis in both male and OVX female hippocampal slices (p=&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G-J</xref>). Conversely, estradiol was still able to increase the rate of protein synthesis in the presence of actinomycin D in both male and OVX female hippocampal slices (p=&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1K-N</xref>). This indicates that estradiol was increasing the rate of hippocampal protein synthesis in a gene transcription independent manner in both sexes.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Estradiol-induced protein translation localises to dendrites and dendritic spines</title><p id="P10">As estradiol treatment increased protein synthesis in a gene transcription-independent manner, we reasoned that it may be engaging translation machinery located along dendrites and within dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Steward &amp; Schuman, 2001</xref>). To test this, we first used primary hippocampal neurons and assessed where protein translation was occurring in neurons using SUnSET. Neurons were treated with estradiol (10 nM) or a vehicle for 2 hours; puromycin (10 ug/mL) was added for the last 10 minutes of treatment. Cell lysates were then fractionated to extra-nuclear and crude synaptic fractions. Estradiol treated neurons exhibited an increase in puromycylated polypeptide chains (proteins<sup>PURO</sup>) in the extra-nuclear fraction (p=0.0221; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A+B</xref>), but also in crude synaptic fractions (p=0.0009; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-D</xref>), suggesting an increase in protein translation near synapses.</p><p id="P11">To ascertain a more precise location of protein translation within neurons, instant Structured Illumination Microscopy (iSIM) super-resolution imaging was coupled with SUnSET-ICC. Elevated levels of proteins<sup>PURO</sup> were detected in estradiol treated neurons along MAP2-positive dendrites (p=0.0017; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E+F</xref>) and areas juxtaposed to dendrites, which likely include synaptic regions (p=0.0002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E+G</xref>). Examination of the distribution of the ribosomal protein S10 (RPS10), a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, revealed that estradiol treatment increased RPS10 expression along and juxtaposed to dendrites (puncta per 10μm; dendrites: p=0.0159; crude synaptic regions: p=0.0238; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H-J</xref>). In addition, RPS10 puncta were larger in estradiol treated neurons compared to vehicle treated neurons (puncta area μm<sup>2</sup>; dendrites: p=0.0211; crude synaptic regions: p=0.0258; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H-L</xref>). Moreover, we observed an increase in the number of RPS10 puncta that co-localised with proteins<sup>PURO</sup>, indicating actively translating ribosomes, along and juxtaposed to dendrites in estradiol treated neurons (puncta per 10μm; dendrites: p=0.0205; crude synaptic regions: p=0.0393; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2M-O</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that estradiol increases the number of actively translating ribosomes along dendrites and near synapses, as indicated by an increase in the number of puromycylated polypeptides and increased ribosomal protein number and size.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Estradiol increases dendritic spine density and nascent protein expression at synapses in a protein translation-dependent manner</title><p id="P12">Estradiol has been shown to induce rapid and long-lasting increases in dendritic spine density in male and female (OVX) hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mukai <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Phan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jacome <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Tuscher <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Luine <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>). We thus, investigated whether this increase was protein synthesis dependent. Similar to what has been previously reported, estradiol treatment increased spine density after 2 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A+B</xref>). Although estradiol did not have an effect on the average size of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), there was a shift in the number of spines that had a larger spine area in neurons treated with estradiol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, in neurons pre-treated with anisomycin, no difference in spine density was seen between vehicle and estradiol treated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B+C</xref>) suggesting that protein synthesis is required either for estadiol-induced spine formation or maintenance of nascently formed spines.</p><p id="P13">As we had detected an increase in actively translating ribosomes along dendrites and near synapses, we reasoned that this would be also reflected by an increase in the presence of nascent protein in dendritic spines. To investigate this, fluorescent non-canonical amino acid tagging (FUNCAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dieterich <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010</xref>) was employed to metabolically tag and visualise newly synthesised proteins. Primary hippocampal neurons treated with estradiol for 2 hours exhibited an increase in the presence of azidohomoalanine (AHA)-tagged newly synthesised proteins (proteins<sup>AHA</sup>) along dendrites and within dendritic spines (dendrites: p=0.0002; spines: p=&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-C</xref>). The increase in proteins<sup>AHA</sup> expression was attenuated by anisomycin in both dendrites (p=0.9999) and dendritic spines (p=0.9568; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We further examined if a sub-set of spines were enriched for nascent proteins following treatment. Estradiol treated neurons showed no significant difference in the number of AHA-positive spines compared to vehicle treated neurons (p=0.2572; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D+E</xref>). However, analysis of spine morphology revealed that in estradiol treated neurons, spines containing proteins<sup>AHA</sup> were on average larger compared to those in vehicle treated cells (p=0.0400; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D+F</xref>). Consistent with this observation, categorising AHA-positive spines by spine area revealed that spines containing proteins<sup>AHA</sup> following estradiol treatment were shifted towards those with larger spine areas. Estradiol increased AHA intensity in larger spines, with an area larger than 0.8μm<sup>2</sup>, where more AHA could be observed in smaller spines, areas smaller than 0.8μm<sup>2</sup>, in vehicle treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4.D+G</xref>). This suggests an accumulation of new proteins in larger spines following estradiol treatment. Taken together, these data provide supporting evidence that estradiol-mediated increases in local protein synthesis promotes an elevation in newly formed dendritic spines as well as newly synthesised proteins along dendrites and within dendritic spines.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Estradiol regulates the expression of the synaptic proteome in male and female hippocampus</title><p id="P15">Given that estradiol rapidly increases protein synthesis in both male and OVX female hippocampus, we were interested in establishing how estradiol was affecting the synaptic proteome.

However, the mechanism by which estradiol increases the expression of synaptic proteins remains unclear. In this study, we have directly tested whether estradiol regulates the rate of protein synthesis in hippocampal neurons, and if estradiol-mediated increases in synaptic proteins occurs via a local protein synthesis manner. We further have tested the requirement of the mTOR pathway in mediating this mechanism, and overall, have assessed whether any of estradiol’s effects on protein translation occur in a sex specific manner. We find that: <bold>(i)</bold> estradiol increases global protein synthesis in a gene-transcription independent manner in both male and female hippocampus within 2 hours; <bold>(ii)</bold> estradiol-modulation of protein synthesis is accompanied by an increase in the number of actively translating ribosomes and newly synthesised proteins along dendrites and at synapses; <bold>(iii)</bold> estradiol increases the expression of specific excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic proteins in a sex-specific and local protein synthesis manner, and decreases the expression of specific pre-synaptic proteins in a sex-specific manner implicating a more general role for estradiol in regulating proteostasis; <bold>(iv)</bold> and that the requirement of the mTOR pathway for estradiol-modulation of local protein synthesis and regulation of synaptic protein expression also occurs in a sex-specific manner, with a more pronounced effect in the male hippocampus compared to the female.</p><p id="P27">The finding that estradiol can modulate protein synthesis in male and female hippocampal slices within a rapid time frame (2 hours) is consistent with observation from previous studies. Estradiol has previously been shown to regulate the activity of kinases involved in regulating protein translation, such as 4EBP1, p70S6K and RPS6 within a similar time frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Akama &amp; McEwen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Sarkar <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fortress <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Briz &amp; Baudry, 2014</xref>). While these studies have suggested that estradiol can regulate protein synthesis in neurons, they have not directly assessed protein synthesis or investigated whether the effects occur independently of gene transcription. Using the SUnSET approach to tag elongating polypeptide chains, we have been able to demonstrate that estradiol causes a time-dependent increase in the rate of protein synthesis in both male and female hippocampal slices. Moreover, we find that estradiol-induced increase in protein synthesis occurs even in the presence of transcription inhibition, and can be observed in crude synaptic preparations, indicating that estradiol is regulating a local protein synthesis mechanism in both male and female hippocampal slices.</p><p id="P28">Owing to the nature of hippocampal slice preparations, it is not possible to determine whether estradiol-mediated increases in protein synthesis are occurring in neurons, glia cells or both. Indeed, whilst SUnSET provides information about the rate (SUnSET-WB) of translation, SUnSET-ICC gives information of where actively translating ribosomes are located. In addition, FUNCAT shows newly synthesised proteins. Thus, combining both techniques provides information about the amount of translation and where nascent proteins are targeted following a pharmacological treatment. Using this combination of approaches, we observed an increase in proteins<sup>PURO</sup> along and juxtaposed to MAP2-positive dendrites of primary hippocampal neurons. As we designed SUnSET-ICC with short puromycin incubation times, this suggests that estradiol regulates local protein synthesis in neurons, and moreover near synaptic sites. This is consistent with the findings by Sarkar et al., who reported that estradiol rapidly induced dendritic translation, assessed by examining CAMKIIα 3’-UTR driven GFP expression in primary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Sarkar <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010</xref>). Interestingly, fluctuations of estradiol levels during the rat estrous cycle has also been shown to trigger polyribosome accumulation at dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">McCarthy &amp; Milner, 2003</xref>). In line with this observation, we found an increase in the number and size of RPS10 along dendrites in response to estradiol treatment. This was accompanied by an increased number of colocalised RPS10 and proteins<sup>PURO</sup> puncta along dendrites. As increased RPS10 puncta was also observed near putative synaptic regions, it raised the possibility that estradiol was engaging translational machinery along dendrites to promote the synthesis of new proteins within the vicinity of synapses. Consistent with this idea, we observed an increase in nascently synthesised proteins (proteins<sup>AHA</sup>) along dendrites and specifically in dendritic spines. Interestingly, we also found that estradiol increased dendritic spine density and a shift towards larger spines after 2 hours, which is in line with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Phan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jacome <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Tuscher <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Avila <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). Concurrent with this, an increase in the amount of proteins<sup>AHA</sup> within dendritic spines was observed and blocking protein synthesis attenuated estradiol’s effects on dendritic spine density. However, it is not possible to determine whether the synthesis of nascent proteins is required for estradiol-induced spine formation or the maintenance of remodelled spines. Of note, BDNF-mediated spine enlargement has been shown to be dependent on protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Tanaka <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>). Conversely, estradiol-induced spine formation in hippocampal neurons is not dependent on protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sheppard <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). Thus, it is possible that in our experiments, synthesis of nascent protein is required for the maintenance, but not the formation, of estradiol-induced nascent spines. Taken together, these data illustrate that by regulating local protein synthesis along dendrites, estradiol can rapidly and locally synthesis and target new proteins to synapses.</p><p id="P29">Multiple studies have shown that estradiol can modulate the expression of synaptic proteins within a rapid time frame in both male and female hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Akama &amp; McEwen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Smith &amp; McMahon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jelks <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Liu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Avila <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). We assessed the impact of estradiol on the expression of a range of pre- and post-synaptic proteins, predominately found at either excitatory or inhibitory synapses, in male and female hippocampi. This has revealed a sex-specific regulation of both excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic protein expression by estradiol. Further, it illustrated that estradiol was able to regulate pre-synaptic protein expression, also in a sex-specific manner. Overall, estradiol was seen to increase the expression of all excitatory post-synaptic proteins examined in both sexes, aside from GluN1, which was only seen to show increased expression in female hippocampal slices following treatment. Of the inhibitory post-synaptic proteins examined, only Gephyrin showed an increase in synaptic protein expression, and only in male hippocampal slices. Interestingly, when pre-synaptic proteins were examined, a sex-specific decrease in protein expression was observed. In male hippocampal slices Snap25 and GAD65/67 showed decreased expression, whereas Synapsin1 and VGAT1 were decreased in female hippocampal slices following treatment with estradiol. Not only do these results show that estradiol has a sex-specific effect on the examined pre-synaptic proteins, but further indicates that estradiol can also induce protein degradation. Interestingly, behavioural training has recently been shown to induce sex-specific changes in the ubiquitin proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Beamish <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>). Moreover, estradiol has also been posited to also engage with the ubiquitin proteasome system to regulate protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Erli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Beamish &amp; Frick, 2021</xref>). Overall, our observations that estradiol can regulate the expression of specific pre- and post-synaptic proteins within a rapid time frame are consistent with the effects of this steroid on synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Liu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kramar <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Vedder <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Jain &amp; Woolley, 2023</xref>). Critically, these data highlight the importance of considering sex when assessing synaptic phenotypes. Indeed, a recent study examining the induction of LTP pre or post adolescent male or female rats revealed a sex-specific mechanism that was driven in part by the estrogen alpha receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Le <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>). Whether the observed effects shown in this study contribute to these differences could be investigated in the future.</p><p id="P30">We focused on the impact of estradiol-induced increased expression of GluN2B and PSD-95, as both proteins have been implicated in mediating the effects of this steroid on synaptic plasticity and behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Akama &amp; McEwen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Smith &amp; McMahon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Liu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Avila <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>).

Multiple studies have also reported that GluN2B-containing NMDARs are critical for estradiol-induced enhancement in LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Smith &amp; McMahon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Snyder <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Vedder <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Smith <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>). Potier et al. recently reported that estradiol transiently decreased GluN2B surface diffusion and contribute to estradiol-mediated increase in dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Potier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Consistent with such studies, and the observed increase in proteins<sup>AHA</sup> at dendritic spines in this study, we observed an increase of both GluN2B and PSD-95 at excitatory synapses. Importantly, estradiol-driven increased expression of both proteins was not dependent on gene transcription, and thus consistent with a local protein synthesis mechanism. Perhaps one of the most striking findings we have observed in this study is the sex-specific contribution of mTOR to the observed phenotypes. mTOR was shown to be required to induce estradiol-dependent global protein synthesis in the male but not female hippocampus. Furthermore, mTOR was also required for estradiol-induced increase in PSD-95 and GluN2B expression levels in the male hippocampus and interestingly, only PSD-95 in OVX female hippocampus. As SUnSET is a measure of global protein synthesis, it is not possible to differentiate between potential contribution of multiple signalling pathways involved in mediating estradiol-mediated protein synthesis. Therefore, mTOR may be required for mediating a proportion of estradiol-mediated protein synthesis, which cannot be detected using the SUnSET assay. Consistent with this idea, we found that while inhibition of mTOR signalling was able to block estradiol-induced increased expression of GluN2B in male but not female hippocampus, it was sufficient to block the effect of estradiol on the expression of PSD-95 in both male and female hippocampal slices. This suggests that mTOR has a greater role in mediating the effects of estradiol on mediating local protein synthesis of synaptic proteins in male hippocampal slices, this pathway play a more subtle contribution to these effects in female hippocampal neurons.</p><p id="P31">In summary, this study supports the idea that estradiol rapidly regulates the expression of synaptic proteins through local protein synthesis. The rapid increase in expression of synaptic proteins could lead to lasting alterations in synaptic function and contribute to estradiol-induced changes in cognitive function. At synapses, proteins are continually synthesized and degraded to modulate cellular function in response to various stimuli, such as action potentials, hormones, or external factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alvarez-Castelao &amp; Schuman, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, we find that estradiol has a bidirectional influence on the expression of specific synaptic proteins, suggesting a broader role in regulating proteostasis. Notably, estradiol utilizes the mTOR signaling pathway in a sex-specific manner to control local protein synthesis of synaptic proteins. This finding contributes to our understanding of how estradiol impacts synaptic plasticity, and is consistent with the concept of latent (or hidden) effects, as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Oberlander and Woolley (2016</xref>), where different molecular mechanisms may lead to similar outcomes in both sexes. It also emphasizes the importance of accounting for sex when investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular processes. Moreover, given the presence of sex differences in various psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, incorporating sex as a variable is crucial for tailoring treatments to each gender. Indeed, as there is mounting evidence of the therapeutic potential of estrogens or estrogen-based compounds, future studies exploring their therapeutic applications should carefully consider sex as a variable.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Animals</title><p id="P32">Mixed sex hippocampal cultures were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rat E18 embryos (Charles River Laboratories, U.K.) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Srivastava <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>). The experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the Home Office Animals (Scientific procedures) Act, United Kingdom, 1986. All acute cortical and hippocampal slices were prepared from intact male and ovariectomised (OVX) female C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Maine, U.S.A) between the ages of 10-12 weeks. The female mice were OVX-ed by the vendor at 10 weeks and transported after 1 week of recovery; intact male mice were transported at 10 weeks. All mice were habituated for 3 days before experimental procedures were carried out. Age of ovariectomy and time of experiment post ovariectomy and transportation of the female mice was kept constant to minimise any confounding effects.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Acute slice preparation</title><p id="P33">Mice were anaesthetised with isoflurane, followed by decapitation.

Neurons were pre-treated in aCSF and slices were recovered in for 1 hour prior to application of the drug compounds. If inhibitors were relevant to the experiment, neurons were in aCSF for 30 minutes after which the inhibitors would be added for 30 minutes followed by pharmacological treatment; the inhibitors were added after 1 hour recovery for 30 minutes for acute slices. All compounds were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

An antibody against puromycin was used for western blotting (Kerafast: EQ0001; SUnSET-WB) or immunocytochemistry (Milipore: MABE343; SUnSET-ICC) to visualise puromycin labelled proteins. Primary neurons were pre-treated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) for 1 hour followed by a 2 hour estradiol (10 nM) treatment.

Images were acquired using a 100x oil-immersion objective (N.A. 1.49TIRF) with 51 z-steps (z-step= 0.12 μm). Raw images were acquired and deconvolved using a 3D blind algorithm specific to the iSIM to increase resolution using the NIS-Elements Advanced Research software (Nikon, version 5.01.00). All images were exported to Fiji where maximum projections were generated and subsequently analysed for puncta size, area and co-localisation, detailed below.

Briefly, dendrite and spine regions were identified based on GFP expression, and placed into the AHA channel and used to measure average intensity of AHA.</p><p id="P39">For the analysis of co-localisaed puncta, images stained for neuronal marker MAP2, puromycin (SUnSET-ICC) and ribosomal proteins S10 (RPS10) acquired from SIM and processed through deconvolution were measured for co-localisation in Fiji. For each cell, 50 μm in length was traced along two or more separate pieces of dendrites within the MAP2 channel. As dendritic spines cannot be visualised with MAP2 staining, 2.5 μm either side of the dendrite was traced to create ‘crude spine regions’ that would encompass all the dendritic spines along that portion of that dendrite. Specifically 2.5 μm either side of the dendrite was selected, as dendritic spine lengths have typically been reported to average between 1-1.5 μm in length in 2-3 week old cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boyer <italic>et al.,</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Srivastava <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011</xref>). Capturing 2.5 μm either side of the dendrite allows for any variability within dendritic spine lengths ensuring some spines are not cut off within the analysis. Thus, the ‘dendrite region’ and the ‘crude spine region’ were all assessed for puncta co-localisation. Images in the RPS10 staining channels were thresholded and particle analysis was performed on the regions of interest (ROI) within the puromycin channel to determine how many puromycin puncta would co-localise with RPS10 puncta. Expression within a region of interest was determined by whether staining intensity was greater than 25% of the maximum staining intensity.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Statistics</title><p id="P40">All statistical analysis was performed on GraphPad Prism 6.
