In January 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a global outbreak in mpox cases with a high incidence of human-to-human transmission. A frequent prodromal symptom of monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection is fever, with a febrile temperature range of 38.3 to 40.5 °C. However, the outcome of temperature elevation on MPXV infection remains poorly defined. Here, we isolated a circulating strain of MPXV from a patient who presented with fever (38.5 °C) and rash from the 2022 outbreak. Genomic sequencing identified this isolate to belong to the epidemic Clade IIb.B1. Transcriptomic analysis of infected cells demonstrated this virus to induce a strong IL6 pro-inflammatory immune response, consistent with a role for this pyrogen in the regulation of fever. We identify host-cell temperature at both physiological skin (33 °C) and clinical febrile temperatures (38.5 and 40 °C) to be a key determinant in the outcome of infection through the differential regulation of MPXV transcription and associated amplitude of host cytokine response to infection. Incubation of infected cells at 38.5 or 40 °C led to a restriction or ablation in MPXV replication, respectively. Importantly, this thermal inhibition was reversible upon temperature downshift to 37 °C without detriment to viral replication fitness. Co-stimulation of the type-I interferon (IFN) response led to a dose- and temperature-dependent inhibition in MPXV replication that restricted the re-establishment of infection upon temperature downshift and withdrawal of IFN as an immune stimulus. Our data identify febrile temperatures associated with mpox disease to be a critical component of the host pro-inflammatory immune response to infection which can synergise with the type-I IFN response to enhance the host-cell mediated restriction of MPXV.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">MPXV belongs to the Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) genus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, which includes variola virus (VARV, the causative agent of smallpox) and vaccinia virus (VACV, the foundation virus of the smallpox vaccine). Since January 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a global rise in the number of confirmed mpox cases across all six WHO regions (&gt; 90,000 confirmed cases and ≥ 150 deaths; September 2023), including previous non-endemic regions of Europe and the Americas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/">https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/</ext-link>). While the natural zoonotic reservoir of MPXV is likely to be in small rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, increased human-to-human transmission has been widely reported during the 2022/23 outbreak and linked to the emergence of novel Clade IIb variants since 2016<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. This has raised concern that MPXV may establish a global foothold in the human population due to waning levels of cross-protecting immunity conferred previously through smallpox vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Human-to-human transmission of MPXV occurs through close contact with infectious skin lesions, bodily fluids, or large respiratory droplets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The spectrum of mpox disease is often variable and ranges from self-limiting disease in healthy immunocompetent adults to fatality in 1 to 10 % of affected individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Common prodrome symptoms include fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, headache, and myalgia, followed by rash and skin lesions on the body, face, and genitals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. More than 70 % of confirmed cases report fever, with a febrile temperature range of 38.3 to 40.5 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Fever is an evolutionary conserved host response to infection and inflammation that can influence multiple cellular processes, including host immunological responses to infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Body temperature varies throughout the day, with age, sex, and ethnic origin being contributing factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Unlike heat stroke or hyperthermia, fever represents a controlled shift in body temperature activated in response to exogenous (microbial) and endogenous (host) pyrogenic factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Clinical febrile temperatures can vary (ΔT of 1 to 4 °C above baseline); with low (38 to 39 °C), moderate (39.1 to 40 °C), high (40.1 to 41 °C), and hyperpyrexia (&gt; 41.1 °C) temperature ranges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Experimental evidence has shown tissue temperature to play a key role during viral infection and the induction of interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral innate immune defences to infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Notably, antipyretic treatment of intensive care patients infected with influenza A virus (IAV) has been linked to increased patient mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, suggesting a beneficial role of the fever response to protect against infection in a clinical setting.</p><p id="P4">While small animal and non-human primate (NHP) models have shown MPXV infection to induce fever<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, few studies have directly examined the influence of temperature on the outcome of infection. Historical evidence (circa 1960s) has shown divergent OPXVs to have variable ceiling temperatures of pox formation in chick embryos, with mpox restriction observed at temperatures ≥ 39.5 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that tissue temperature is likely to play a key determinant in the replication and/or immunopathology of MPXV. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have focused on laboratory-adapted strains of VACV, which are known to carry strain-specific mutations that can influence their thermal- and/or immuno-regulatory properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Thus, the influence of temperature elevation to control the outcome of OPXV infection remains poorly defined, specifically in circulating Clades or strains of human origin. We therefore set out to investigate the net effect of temperature elevation on the replication of MPXV using a clinical isolate derived from the 2022/23 outbreak.</p><p id="P5">We isolated a circulating strain of MPXV from a febrile hospitalised patient during the 2022 outbreak, who was recruited to the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium Comprehensive Clinical Characterisation Collaboration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://isaric4c.net/">ISARIC4C</ext-link>) study (ISRCTN66726260). Genomic sequencing demonstrated this isolate belonged to the Clade IIb.B1 epidemic strain. We demonstrate basal tissue and host-cell temperature to be a key determinant in the outcome of MPXV infection at both physiological skin temperature (33 °C) and clinical febrile (38.5 and 40 °C) temperatures relative to core body temperature (37 °C). Incubation of infected cells at 40 °C led to an ablation in MPXV replication. We show this thermal restriction to occur via a genome wide suppression in viral transcription, with multiple viral open reading frames (ORFs) displaying temperature-dependent profiles of differential gene expression (DEG). Importantly, we show that the thermal restriction of MPXV is reversible upon temperature downshift to 37 °C without impairment to viral replication fitness. Co-stimulation of the type-I IFN response led to a dose- and temperature-dependent IFN-mediated restriction in MPXV replication that attenuated the re-establishment of infection upon thermal downshift. Our data identify a cooperative and synergistic role for temperature elevation to enhance the type-I IFN-mediated restriction of MPXV.

Illumina sequencing of inactivated clinical swabs (CVR_MPXV1a) and infectious cell culture supernatant derived from primary amplification (MPXV CVR_S1) identified an identical MPXV genome (accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/ON808413.1/">ON808413</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis identified this virus to belong to the MPXV Clade IIb.B1 lineage and to contain 67 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) relative to the MPXV Clade II reference strain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_063383">NC_063383</ext-link>). SNPs were located across the genome and present in both core and accessory ORFs. Consistent with previous MPXV Clade IIb genomic analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, 91% of the SNPs (61 out of 67 nucleotides) were consistent with APOBEC deamination (G to A or C to T substitutions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">As MPXV CVR_S1 (here after referred to as MPXV) was isolated from a patient with fever, we next investigated the influence of tissue temperature on MPXV replication in skin epithelium. Human keratinocytes were differentiated into a pseudostratified epithelium under air liquid interface (ALI). Tissues were mock treated or infected with MPXV (10<sup>2</sup> or 10<sup>3</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU)/tissue) at 37 °C for 1 h prior to continued incubation at 33, 37, or 40 °C (representative of skin, core, and maximum clinical febrile temperature range, respectively) for 72 h. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of mock treated tissue sections demonstrated no significant difference in skin epithelium thickness, morphology, or integrity over the temperature range of analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>). As expected, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of tissue sections identified MPXV virion antigen expression to increase in a multiplicity of infection (MOI) dependent manner at 33 and 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>). Notably, discrete foci of infection could be observed at both temperatures, indicative of MPXV intraepithelial propagation and spread at 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>; 10<sup>2</sup> PFU/tissue). Quantitation of IHC stained tissue sections demonstrated the relative levels of MPXV infection to be dependent on incubation temperature, with the highest levels of replication observed at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C, D</xref>). Importantly, a significant reduction in MPXV antigen staining could be observed at both physiological skin (37 <italic>vs</italic>. 33 °C) and febrile (37 <italic>vs</italic>. 40 °C) incubation temperatures, with MPXV staining at 40 °C close to background levels observed in mock treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A, C, D</xref>). Together, these data identify tissue temperature to play a key determinant in the outcome of MPXV replication at both physiological and febrile temperature ranges associated with clinical infection.</p><p id="P8">To examine the influence of temperature on the replication kinetics of MPXV in more detail, we next compared the thermal sensitivity of MPXV to that of VACV (strain WR; internal positive control)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Human foreskin fibroblast (HFt) cells were infected at 37 °C for 1 h prior to incubation at 33, 37, 38.5 or 40 °C (representative of skin, core, and low to moderate grade febrile temperature ranges, respectively). Infected monolayers were fixed at 48 h and analysed for viral plaque formation by Coomassie staining. Consistent with previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, VACV demonstrated a significant decrease in plaque number, plaque size, and titre of cell-released virus (CRV) at incubation temperatures &gt; 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A to D</xref>). Notably, plaque formation could still be observed at 40 °C, demonstrating the inhibitory ceiling temperature for VACV had yet to be reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A, B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. A significant reduction in plaque size and CRV titre could also be observed upon incubation at 33 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C, D</xref>), demonstrating physiological temperatures below 37 °C to be inhibitory to optimal VACV replication. qPCR analysis of intracellular viral DNA (vDNA) levels harvested at 2 h post-infection (hpi; 1 h post-temperature shift) demonstrated the thermal restriction of VACV to occur independently of a block to virus entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3E</xref>). Moreover, no significant difference in cell number, cell viability, or puromycin-induced cell death (positive control) was detected in mock treated cells at 40 °C relative to incubation at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2A, B</xref>), confirming cell monolayer health and responsiveness to stimuli at temperatures &gt; 37 °C. These data validate our model system and corroborate VACV to be sensitive to thermal restriction at temperatures ≥ 38.5 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Analogous infections demonstrated MPXV plaque formation and plaque size to be highly sensitive to alterations in incubation temperature, with reduced numbers of plaques observed at 33 °C, reduced plaque size at 38.5 °C, and a complete inhibition in viral plaque formation at 40 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3F to H</xref>). Significantly lower titres of CRV were also detected at 33, 38.5, and 40 °C relative to incubation at 37 °C independently of a block to virus entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3I, J</xref>). To establish whether the temperature-dependent restriction observed in OPXV replication was a consequence of a failure of HFt cells to support DNA virus replication, we examined the plaque formation of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1, strain 17syn+) over an equivalent temperature range. Only a modest restriction in plaque count was observed at 40 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2C</xref>), demonstrating HFt cells to support viral DNA replication over a wide range of incubation temperatures. Thus, we identify a low-passage MPXV clinical isolate to be highly sensitive to thermal restriction at both physiological (33 °C) and febrile (38.5 or 40 °C) temperatures relative to incubation at core body temperature (37 °C).</p><p id="P9">As MPXV is known to infect a wide variety of cell types <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, we investigated if the thermal sensitivity of either VACV or MPXV occurred in a cell-type dependent manner. Infection of human normal oral keratinocytes (NOK) and retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells with VACV demonstrated an equivalent trend in thermal restriction to that observed in HFt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2D</xref>). Notably, infection of <italic>Chlorocebus sabaeus</italic> or <italic>Chlorocebus aethiops</italic> (African green monkey) kidney-derived epithelial or fibroblast cells (Vero E6 and CV-1 cells, respectively) demonstrated significantly higher levels of VACV plaque formation at 33 °C relative to incubation at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2D</xref>). These data demonstrate that the thermal permissivity of cells to support VACV replication to be cell-type dependent. Analogous infection with MPXV demonstrated distinct cell-type dependent profiles of thermal restriction at 33 °C (HFt, RPE, and CV-1 cells) and 38.5 °C (NOK, Vero E6, and CV-1 cells) relative to incubation at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2E</xref>). All cell lines demonstrated a complete, or near complete (CV-1 cells), restriction in MPXV plaque formation at 40 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C, D</xref>). We conclude the basal and ceiling temperatures that support or restrict MPXV replication to be cell-type dependent and distinct from laboratory-adapted VACV.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Basal host-cell temperature differentially regulates the outcome of MPXV transcription</title><p id="P10">To determine where the block in MPXV replication might occur, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on mock-treated or MPXV-infected HFt cells incubated at 33, 37, 38.5 or 40 °C (MOI 0.01 PFU/cell, 48 h). Transcriptome analysis of 28 reference genes known to be expressed across a wide range of tissues and cell-types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> demonstrated no significant difference in their relative profile of expression in mock treated cells across the temperature range of analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3A</xref>). Moreover, no significant difference was observed in the total number of host mapped read (MR) counts derived from mock treated samples across the temperature range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3B</xref>, grey bars). These data indicate host-cell transcription to remain largely unperturbed in mock-treated cells up to 40 °C. In contrast, a significant difference in host MR counts was observed in MPXV-infected cells incubated at 33, 37, and 38.5 °C relative to mock treatment at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3B</xref>, green bars). No significant difference in host MR count was observed between MPXV-infected cells incubated at 40 °C and mock treatment at 37 °C. These data indicate MPXV infection to significantly influence the outcome of host transcription at incubation temperatures permissive to MPXV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3F to I</xref>). Investigating further, principal component analysis (PCA) of 178 MPXV ORFs identified significant variance in viral transcript expression (counts per million; CPM) levels at both physiological (33 °C) and febrile (38.5 and 40 °C) temperatures relative to incubation at core body temperature (37 °C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3C</xref>). Expression profile analysis identified infected cells incubated at 40 °C to have significantly lower levels of MPXV transcription relative to all other incubation temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3C</xref>). Notably, the overall profile of transcription remained proportionate to that observed at 37 °C, with an approximate 100-fold reduction in transcript expression per ORF at 40 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B, C</xref>). 29 ORFs were identified to have counts below one CPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>, purple circles and text). Of these, 10 ORFs encode proteins involved in intracellular virus maturation, two ORFs that encode virus toll-like receptor (vTLR) antagonists, and three ORFs that encode subunits of the viral RNA (vRNA) polymerase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>, purple text). Thus, we attribute the ablation of MPXV replication at 40 °C to suppressed levels of viral transcription that bottleneck or restrict the progress of infection. As we had also observed differences in MPXV transcription at lower incubation temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>), we next compared the transcription profiles from MPXV infected cells incubated at 33 and 38.5 °C. Relative to 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>, solid grey line), distinct profiles of MPXV transcription could be observed between these two incubation temperatures. Notably, many ORFs displayed opposing profiles of transcription expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>, dotted grey ellipses). Five functionally unrelated ORFs were identified to be downregulated at 33 °C (≥ 1.5 log2 FC) relative to incubation at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>, orange circles and text). We conclude host-cell temperature to play a key determinant in the differential regulation of MPXV transcription at both physiological skin (33 °C) and febrile (38.5 or 40 °C) temperatures relative to core body temperature (37 °C). Collectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), these data identify the optimal temperature for MPXV Clade IIb.B1 replication to be 37 °C.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Basal temperature differentially regulates the host-cell response to MPXV infection</title><p id="P11">As we had identified temperature to differentially regulate MPXV transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>), we next investigated the influence of temperature on the host-cell response to infection. We performed RNA-Seq analysis on mock-treated or MPXV-infected HFt cells incubated at 33, 37, 38.5 or 40 °C (MOI 0.01 PFU/cell, 48 h). Pairwise comparisons identified unique and shared clusters of DEGs (FDR &lt; 0.05, ≥ 1.5 log2 FC) across the temperature range of analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A, B</xref>). Relatively few DEGs were identified between mock-treated and infected samples incubated at 40 °C, suggesting MPXV infection at this temperature to induce a minimal host-cell response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A, B</xref>; yellow ellipses and lines). This was surprising, as we had observed equal levels of MPXV genome entry into infected cells across the temperature range of analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3J</xref>). These data identify the onset of MPXV replication to be a key determinant in the host-cell response to infection. Pathway analysis identified distinct profiles of DEG enrichment dependent on incubation temperature, with 33 and 38.5 °C sharing the highest degree of similarity in their respective host-cell responses to infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>, grey lines). Notably, many pathways were only significantly enriched in response to infection at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>), even though cells incubated at 33 and 38.5 °C were observed to be productively infected and to be releasing infectious virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These data demonstrate basal host-cell temperature to play a key role in the outcome and/or amplitude of host-cell response to MPXV infection. Consistent with this finding, we observed multiple cytokine-related pathways to be differentially regulated in response to MPXV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>, black arrows). Analysis of these DEGs (71 genes in total) revealed distinct profiles of immune gene expression that were dependent on both infection and incubation temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D to F</xref>). Importantly, this host-cell immune signature to infection occurred independently of the robust induction of the type-I IFN response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4A, B</xref>).

These data demonstrate Clade IIb.B1 MPXV infection to effectively suppress the induction of IFN-mediated antiviral immune defences.

Thus, viral genome entry into host-cells alone is not sufficient to trigger the activation of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) necessary for the induction of cytokine-mediated pro-inflammatory immune responses to infection.

In contrast to IFN signalling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4A to D</xref>), analysis of the IL signalling pathway (R-HAS-449147; 459 genes in total) identified this pathway to be significantly upregulated during MPXV infection in a temperature-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7D</xref> green dots; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4F</xref>).

HFt cells were stimulated with IFN-β and incubated at 33, 37, 38.5 or 40 °C for 16 h prior to MPXV infection (MOI 0.001 PFU/cell) and continued incubation in the presence of IFN for 48 h at their respective temperatures. Quantitation of plaque counts demonstrated MPXV restriction to occur in an IFN-β dose- and temperature-dependent manner, with heightened levels of restriction observed at 38.5 °C relative to incubation at 33 or 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8A to D</xref>). Consistent with our previous analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), MPXV plaque formation was abrogated at 40 °C irrespective of IFN stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8A, B</xref> grey dotted lines and circles).

As temperature elevation alone led to suppressed levels of MPXV transcription independently of the robust induction of the type-I IFN response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A to D</xref>), we next investigated the synergistic nature of temperature elevation and IFN co-stimulation on the outcome of MPXV infection. Naïve HFt cells were infected with MPXV (MOI 0.01 PFU/cell) for 1 h at 37 °C prior to stimulation with IFN-β and incubation at 33, 37, 38.5 or 40 °C. Infected and treated cell monolayers were fixed at 24 hpi and the number of MPXV virion antigen positive cells quantified by immunostaining. Consistent with our IHC analysis of infected tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>), incubation temperature dramatically reduced the number of MPXV virion antigen positive cells detected at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8E, F</xref>; 0 IU/ml IFN-β, 37°C &gt; 33 ≈ 38.5 °C &gt; 40 °C). Notably, a substantial number of MPXV antigen positive cells could still be detected at 40 °C, indicating that a proportion of MPXV genomes were able to circumvent complete thermal restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8E, F</xref>; 0 IU/ml IFN). Co-stimulation with IFN-β led to a dose- and temperature-dependent reduction in the number of antigen positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8E, F</xref> plus IFN). These data identify temperature elevation to cooperate and synergise with the type-I IFN response to mediate the host-cell restriction of MPXV. As neither temperature elevation nor IFN stimulation was sufficient to eliminate MPXV gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8E, F</xref>), we hypothesised MPXV replication may recover following temperature downshift to 37 °C and/or withdrawal of IFN as an immune stimulus. Downshift of infected cells from 40 (no IFN treatment) to 37 °C led to a complete recovery in MPXV plaque formation to equivalent levels observed at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8G</xref>). These data demonstrate MPXV thermal restriction to only stall the progress of infection, as opposed to eliminate or induce the establishment of viral genome quiescence. Surprisingly, IFN washout from infected and IFN-treated cells incubated at 37 °C also led to an equivalent recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8H</xref>). Analogous to temperature restriction, these data demonstrate the type-I IFN response to suppress, but not eliminate, MPXV infection. Importantly, IFN washout and thermal downshift of MPXV-infected and IFN-stimulated cells from 40 to 37 °C led to significantly lower recovery in the re-establishment of MPXV infection in an IFN dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8J</xref>). Equivalent trends in the re-establishment of infection were also observed following IFN washout and temperature downshift of VACV infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5G to J</xref>).

Here, we isolated a clinical Clade IIb.B.1 MPXV strain (MPXV CVR_S1) from a hospitalised patient admitted with fever (38.5 °C) to determine the influence of temperature elevation on the outcome of MPXV infection.</p><p id="P15">Previous studies (circa 1960s) have shown OPXVs to have divergent ceiling temperatures of pox formation in the chorioallantoic membrane of infected embryonic chicken eggs, ranging from 38 °C to ≥ 40.5 °C (VARV minor to VACV, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.

This temperature-dependent restriction was observed across a variety of infection models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), including pseudostratified skin epithelium, and is consistent with the reported ceiling temperature of MPXV pox formation in embryonic chicken eggs of 39.5 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Collectively, these data demonstrate that febrile temperatures associated with mpox disease in humans are likely to be a key determinant in the outcome of infection. Importantly, we show that the thermal restriction of MPXV to occur independently of a block to virus entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3J</xref>) and to be reversible upon temperature downshift without impairment to viral replication fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8G</xref>). These findings are consistent with the re-establishment of VARV replication in embryonic chicken eggs upon thermal downshift from its inhibitory ceiling temperature of 38.5 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. As OPXVs with alternate ceiling temperatures have been shown to complement quiescent infections leading to hybrid pox formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, variance in MPXV Clade and strain ceiling temperatures might contribute to genetic reassortment during mixed co-infection and/or changes in viral pathogenesis. Thus, the thermoregulatory mechanisms surrounding MPXV genome stability, longevity, and retention of replication fitness at febrile temperatures warrants further investigation. Importantly, we demonstrate lower physiological temperatures associated with skin tropism to also impact on MPXV replication. We observed a significant reduction in MPXV intraepithelial propagation, plaque formation, and virus yield following incubation at 33 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). We posit the fever response to both positively and negatively influence the outcome of OPXV infection dependent on the baseline temperature of the tissue at the point of infection. For example, a general two to four °C rise in skin temperature from 33 to 37 °C would be expected to promote MPXV replication, whereas a similar rise in tissue temperature from 37 °C we show to be progressively inhibitory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Thus, inherent differences in species body/tissue temperature and/or capacity to mount a febrile immune response could impact on the zoonotic potential of MPXV to be maintained within an animal reservoir or to undergo inter-species host transmission. Indeed, available evidence suggests small rodent models to have variable febrile responses to OPXV infection, potentially in an MPXV Clade dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Thus, the influence of tissue temperature on MPXV species tropism and onward transmission also warrants additional investigation.</p><p id="P16">Our transcriptomic analysis demonstrates host-cell temperature to have a significant impact on the differential regulation of viral transcription and associated host-cell responses to MPXV infection, both at physiological (33 °C) and febrile (38.5 and 40 °C) temperatures relative to core body temperature (37 °C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). MPXV incubation at 40 °C led to a substantial decrease in viral transcription (≈ 100-fold reduction per ORF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B, C</xref>). However, the overall profile of transcription remained proportionate to that observed at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>), indicative of a genome-wide suppression in transcription, as opposed to a specific block in the expression of any individual viral ORF. Notably, we identify multiple viral ORFs that encode proteins associated with virion maturation to show substantially decreased transcript levels (&lt; 1 CPM per ORF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B, D</xref>). Consistent with this observation, significantly lower levels of virion antigen expression were also observed within MPXV-infected tissues or cells incubated at 40 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref>). Thus, temperature elevation is likely to cause a bottleneck in the expression of critical viral gene products required for virion maturation that suppress the onward propagation and spread of MPXV. Notably, differential patterns of MPXV transcription and replication fitness were also observed at lower temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Incubation at 33 °C led to a 50 % decrease in viral plaque formation, whereas incubation at 38.5 °C resulted in a 50 % decrease in viral plaque size relative to incubation at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3G, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Together, these data highlight the importance of basal host-cell temperature to the outcome of MPXV infection. We posit that the differential patterns of viral transcription observed between 33 and 38.5 °C to account for the phenotypic differences identified between these two incubation temperatures. Of the five viral ORFs identified to be significantly downregulated at 33 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>, orange circles), experimental evidence has shown the VACV orthologues of gp148 (VACV A43R), gp007 (VACV D6L), and gp146 (VACV A41L) to impact on viral replication fitness and lesion formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Thus, the differential patterns of viral transcription observed at both physiological and febrile temperatures are likely to affect multiple viral and cellular processes that govern the overall outcome of infection.</p><p id="P17">Our host-cell transcriptome analysis of mock-treated or MPXV-infected cells incubated at 40 °C identified relatively few DEGs at this incubation temperature (13 in total; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A, B</xref>). This minimal host-cell response correlates with the limited levels of MPXV transcription and replication observed at 40 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Thus, viral genome entry into host-cells alone is not sufficient to activate PRRs sufficient to induce a robust pro-inflammatory immune response to infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>). In contrast, we identify a significant induction of pro-inflammatory interleukin gene expression at both physiological skin, core, and febrile temperatures (33, 37 and 38.5 °C, respectively) permissive to MPXV replication. These differential patterns of interleukin and chemokine expression correlate well with the levels of MPXV replication observed at these incubation temperatures. For example, IL-6 induction (a key pyrogen in the regulation of the fever response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>) demonstrated peak induction at 37 °C, with lower levels of induction observed at 33 or 38.5 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7E</xref>), consistent with decreased levels of replication observed at these incubation temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Thus, we identify basal host-cell temperature to be a key determinant in the amplitude of cytokine response to MPXV infection. These data are consistent with cytokine profiling experiments of serum samples derived from experimentally infected NHPs or hospitalised patients that have shown pro-inflammatory interleukin expression levels to correlate with the kinetics of MPXV replication and disease severity, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. While MPXV encodes immune antagonists to IL-1 (gp014, gp152, gp167), IL-18 (gp007), TNF-α (gp002, gp178), IFN-γ/β (gp169), and IFN-g (gp163), among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, it does not encode a direct IL-6 antagonist. This raises the possibility that specific profiles of pro-inflammatory cytokine or chemokine expression may be beneficial to MPXV replication prior to temperature elevation, potentially through the recruitment and infection of bystander and/or circulating immune cells to promote virus dissemination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">The type-I IFN response is a critical component of the host’s antiviral immune defence, which acts to restrict viral propagation and to prime adaptive immune responses to clear MPXV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.

We demonstrate a circulating clinical MPXV IIb.B.1 strain to be sensitive to exogenous IFN-β stimulation in a dose- and temperature-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8</xref>).

Importantly, we demonstrate this IFN-mediated restriction to be reversible and not to effectively eliminate infection, with significantly lower levels of MPXV recovery observed at febrile temperatures associated with clinical infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8H, J</xref>). Thus, we identify functional cooperativity and synergism between pro-inflammatory immune responses (fever plus IFN) that mediate the accumulative host-cell restriction of MPXV.

Library preparation was conducted with the KAPA Hyper kit (Roche, 07962347001) with end repair and universal adapter ligation. Unique Dual Index Primer pairs (NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina) were used to index the samples, followed by 10 cycles of PCR amplification. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq500 platform with paired ends for 2 x 150-base pair reads using a Mid-output cartridge Kit v2.5 (Illumina, 20024905). bcl2fastq software was used to demultiplex and compress bcl files into fastq (gz) files. Short and low-quality sequence reads (length &lt; 75 nucleotides, Phred score &lt; 30) were filtered from the fastq files using Trim Galore (version 0.6.6). BWA-MEM (version 0.7.17-r1188) was used to map filtered reads to the reference sequence. Ivar (version 1.3.1) program generated consensus sequences (minimum depth 10 reads and consensus frequency threshold 0.6) from the aligned BAM files.
