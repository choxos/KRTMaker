Despite the advance and success of effective lipid lowering-therapies and hypertensive agents, the residual risk of an atherosclerotic event remains high and improving disease understanding and development of novel therapeutic strategies has proven to be challenging. This is largely due to the complexity of atherosclerosis with a spatial interplay of multiple cell types within the vascular wall. Here, we generated an integrative high-resolution map of human atherosclerotic plaques by combining single-cell RNA-seq from multiple studies and novel spatial transcriptomics data from 12 human specimens to gain insights into disease mechanisms. Comparative analyses revealed cell-type and atherosclerosis-specific expression changes and associated alterations in cell-cell communication. We highlight the possible recruitment of lymphocytes via different endothelial cells of the vasa vasorum, the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells towards the lumen to become fibromyocytes, and cell-cell communication in the plaque, indicating an intricate cellular interplay within the adventitia and the subendothelial space in human atherosclerosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Atherosclerosis, a complex disease with many clinical manifestations, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Atherosclerosis refers to the accumulation of fatty and/or fibrous material in the intima of the arterial wall. With time, the atherosclerotic plaque can become more fibrous and accumulate calcium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The accumulation of these substances results in a complex pathophysiology with various cellular interactions and modulations involved that can result in vascular occlusion and/or plaque rupture or erosion that clinically manifests as myocardial infarction and stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Importantly, there is accumulating evidence supporting a high degree of diversity of mechanisms underlying atherosclerotic disease and related thrombotic events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Recent single-cell sequencing studies have revealed cellular resolution insights into atherosclerotic tissue in mice and humans, shedding light on cellular heterogeneity, cellular plasticity, and the contribution of different cell types to atherogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">However, despite intensive preclinical research on atherosclerosis, a firm understanding of human pathogenesis is still lacking, and the current scRNA-seq studies are limited in patient diversity due to low sample numbers. In addition, independent studies might have technical batch effects that limit the comparability of the results. To overcome the challenges associated with a limited number of samples per study and technical batch-effects, we have created a comprehensive technical batch-effect corrected unified human atherosclerosis atlas. Furthermore, to account for spatial patterns and their association with progressive disease states, we generated a novel spatially resolved transcriptomics dataset with 12 human samples. Our integrated atlas with single-cell and spatial transcriptomics presents insights into structural and collective functions of cell types in their spatial niche of the human artery.</p><p id="P5">Integrative analyses of our novel atlas indicate the importance of pericytes and phenotypically distinct endothelial cell clusters in human atherosclerosis. Analysis of the spatially resolved human artery data led to the identification of lymphocyte accumulation in the adventitia and possible cell-cell-interaction with endothelial cells and pericytes of the microvasculature.</p><p id="P6">A pivotal characteristic in atherosclerosis lies in the intricate orchestration of lipoprotein uptake and efflux within the atherosclerotic plaque, primarily instigated by scavenger receptors predominantly found on macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. With the spatial transcriptomics data we highlight major interactions of this process and highlight a possible lipoprotein affiniation of pericytes in the adventitia.</p><p id="P7">Furthermore, using computational pseudo-time trajectories, we found a potential transition of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) into fibromyocytes from the outer medial layer towards the lumen and progression of phenotypical foamy cells into SPP1 positive macrophages, accompanied by reorganization of the extracellular matrix in the subendothelial layer. Finally, using a database of existing drugs, we showcase the potential of our atlas in aiding the identification of novel drug targets that are specific to relevant cell states and spatial niches. Overall, our findings point toward a collateral or initiating adventitis in atherogenesis and highlights avenues for further research.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Functional analysis of the integrated human single-cell atherosclerosis atlas</title><p id="P8">To attain a better understanding of the cellular heterogeneity, and interactions between diverse cell types within human atherosclerotic plaques, we integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets encompassing coronary and carotid human arteries. Our data integration approach encompassed 4 studies involving 10 atherosclerotic donors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and 3 control donors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, culminating in 130,000 high-quality single cells after a rigorous quality filtering process including doublet removal, and technical batch-effect correction. The integrated and manually annotated atlas revealed new insights into atherosclerosis and might serve as a valuable reference for forthcoming atherosclerosis studies and novel drug target identification. Furthermore, our atlas contains novel spatial transcriptomics data from different atherosclerosis stages of human coronary arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P9">For the construction of our human single-cell atlas for atherosclerosis, we curated and harmonized the data of diverse scRNA-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1a-b</xref>) by conducting a comparative evaluation of different scRNA-seq integration technologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). Here, Harmony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and scVI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> emerged as particularly proficient integration tools for the single-cell human atherosclerosis atlas, with high donor mixtures and comparable cell type and disease compositions for both methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1d-e</xref>). With the scVI-based embedding, we identified 16 main cell type clusters through marker gene expression profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1f</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>). Among these clusters, we found a cluster of pericytes (e.g. COX4I2, HIGD1B) and osteoblastic cells (e.g. DLX5/6). Particularly intriguing, we found two distinct endothelial cell clusters, with specific and elevated expression of DKK2 and ACKR1 expression, respectively, but shared comparable expression of endothelial markers (e.g. VWF, PECAM1). Notably, cellular compositions of non-immune cell-types such as VSMCs and pericytes were balanced between control and atherosclerosis, while immune-related clusters such as B cells and T cells had more cells from atherosclerotic donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Having defined the main cell types, we analyzed the differential expression between control and atherosclerosis states in each cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>). Based on these differentially expressed genes, we performed pathway enrichment analysis for each cell type to identify any systematic patterns in gene dysregulation. Interleukin-10 signaling was enriched in the control cells of macrophages, consistent with its athero-protective influence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, while immune responses were enriched in atherosclerotic macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Surprisingly, we identified a broad dysfunction in pericytes, which include a plethora of pathway changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM), IGFBP transport and immune cell-related responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1g</xref>). The comprehensive transcriptome alterations of periycytes was somewhat surprising as their role in Atherosclerosis is understudied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. However, the relatively diminished gene expression profile observed in pericytes compared to other cellular counterparts, coupled with their transcriptional resemblance to vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), potentially masked the distinctive impact of pericytes. Consequently, the revelation of perturbed genes and pathways specific to pericytes within our single-cell atlas underscores the significance of employing single-cell studies to discern cell-type-specific associations with diseases.</p><p id="P11">Notably, the transcriptional changes were impacted differently in the two different endothelial cell clusters which differed significantly in ECM remodeling. Differential expression analysis of the two endothelial cells showed that among other ECM components, COL15A1 (higher expressed in Endothelial_1) or COL8A1 (higher expressed in Endothelial_2) differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1h</xref>). Furthermore, the two types of endothelial cells showed different potential gene interactions: Endothelial_1 gene interactions are associated with ITGA6 and EMCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), while the Endothelial_2 cluster showed expression of mesenchymal related transcription factors (FOXC2, TBX1). Taking into account the differential expression of the two types of endothelial cell clusters and their disease state, we revealed common (LRRC75A, PLCG2) and endothelial cluster specific atherosclerotic genes, such as COL4A1 and VWA1 for Endothelial_1 and the aforementioned mesenchymal transcription factors as well as SCX or KCNK15 for Endothelial_2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Finally, we analyzed the cell-cell communication of all cell types of the human atherosclerosis atlas with <italic>CellPhoneDB</italic><sup><italic>16</italic></sup> and <italic>CrossTalkerR</italic><sup><italic>17</italic></sup> to identify ligand-receptor pairs enriched in atherosclerosis compared to the controls. Among the 1,500 interactions analyzed from the LIANA database, we found an interactive network between pericytes, endothelial cells and VSMC as well as macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>). Taken together, we integrated available single-cell RNA-seq data from human atherosclerosis and controls, identified two different endothelial cell clusters, transcriptional changes especially in the ECM, and an altered cell-cell communication network involving multiple cell-types in atherosclerosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Spatial transcriptomics of human atherosclerosis</title><p id="P13">Given the new insights from the human atherosclerosis atlas, we next wanted to investigate their spatial distribution in human arteries and performed spatial transcriptomics of 12 human coronary arteries of different disease stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In total we captured 16593 spots with 1563 genes per spot on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). With an estimation of 5 cells per spot, we leveraged <italic>cell2location</italic><sup><italic>18</italic></sup> to deconvolute the intricate cellular composition of the tissue slides with our scRNA-seq atlas as reference. Cell type abundances were well distributed across the arteries and the correlation of the reference signatures was low between different cell types, indicating a commendable capacity to deconvolute the spatial location of the cell types throughout the complete artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2b-c</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Interestingly, we observed that the majority of cell types exhibited a distinct and consistent positioning within the artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). This was especially evident for most immune cells in the plaque, fibroblasts in the adventitia and VSMC in the media as expected. However, the two endothelial cell clusters were found to be located mutually exclusively in the luminal endothelium or adventitia, respectively. EC markers, which were expressed in both endothelial cell types (e.g. VWF) correlated with the abundance of luminal and peripheral endothelial cells, while cluster-specific markers obtained from differential expression analysis of the two EC types were located with the corresponding endothelial location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Next, we applied the Multiview Intercellular SpaTial modeling framework (MISTy)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> to analyze the neighborhood of each major cell type by predicting their colocalization to other major cell types within the same spot and the adjacent spots. By comparing the slides with control tissue and the slides with the atherosclerosis tissue, we found that VSMC and pericytes showed a general colocalization, but macrophages changed their association with fibroblasts to other immune cells in the atheroma slides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). On the other hand, Endothelial_1 could predict the localization of fibroblasts, and intriguingly to some extent even Lymphocytes. This was particularly interesting, as with the progression of atherosclerosis, T cells and macrophages were identified with high abundance in the plaque region of all atheroma slides, while Endothelial_1 were highly abundant in the adventitia.</p><p id="P16">To systematically evaluate the regionality of the deconvoluted cell types in our spatial coordinates, we defined a gradient from the most inner spot (tunica intima) of all arteries towards the adventitia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). This approach showed that the spatial separation of the endothelial cell types was observed in all slides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Further, fibroblasts were mostly located in the periphery, in agreement with their association with the adventitia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In contrast, immune cells followed a bimodal distribution and were located in the inner arterial wall as well as in the adventitia. The accumulation of the immune cells in both areas was more evident with the progression of atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Peripheral endothelial and pericytes are linked to lymphocyte adhesion</title><p id="P17">Given the identification of two different endothelial cells in the intima and the adventitia and a bimodal distribution of immune cells, we next asked if this would reveal a difference in immune cell adhesion and recruitment. When we compared the atherosclerosis associated Ligand-Receptor interaction scores of immune cells with the different endothelial cells, we found an increased cell-cell communication between peripheral ECs and pericytes with lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This was observed irrespective of whether the immune cells act as ligand or receptor expressing cells. In particular, we found that Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC II) genes were more abundantly expressed in peripheral endothelial cells, which could interact with immune cells by presenting antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In addition, the counterparts of other ligands and receptors that were expressed in peripheral endothelial cells showed elevated expression levels in T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Notably, the lymphocyte interaction partners on peripheral endothelial cells did not show elevated expression on lymphatic endothelial cells. Next, we performed spatial cell-cell-communication analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> for the ligand-receptor pairs defined between peripheral endothelial cells and T-cells in the spatial transcriptomics data, which showed potential interactions of the MHC II gene HLA-DBP1 and CD4 in peripheral endothelial sites as well as in the plaque region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The potential interaction in the plaque is consistent with high expression of MHC II in macrophage/cDC1 in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). Furthermore, receptor expression in peripheral endothelial cells were more specific to these endothelial cells and hence cell-cell interactions were mainly observed in the adventitia at sites with high endothelial cell abundance. This is exemplarily shown for the interaction between CCL5 and ACKR1. In contrast, the immune cell related interactions of CCL5 with CCR1 were dominating the plaque core region.</p><p id="P18">In summary, the ligand receptor analysis indicates potential adhesion and recruitment of lymphocytes via peripheral endothelial cells of the vasa vasorum that might be supported by pericytes which are known to have intricate connections with the endothelium of the vasa vasorum.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Subclustering reveals cell type changes in the arterial microenvironment</title><p id="P19">To gain a deeper understanding of the human atherosclerosis atlas and our spatial transcriptomics data, we next performed subclustering of the single-cell RNA-seq data. Our sub-clustering revealed 32 cell states across all major cell-types. Specifically, we could differentiate fibromyocytes and myofibroblasts from VSMCs and two different pericyte clusters (APOE+ and MYH11+) as well as different macrophage and T-cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Within the T-cell cluster, we identified different T-cells and two types of natural killer cells, with one possibly being cytotoxic (GZMB, GNLY) and enriched for MHC II antigen presentation and interferon gamma and the other (XCR1, CD56/NCAM1, FCGR3A/CD16) expressing parts of the Toll-like receptor cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4a-b</xref>). For the macrophages, subclusters of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (CDC1 and FCER1A), Resident macrophages (LYVE1), inflammatory macrophages (IL1B and TNF), M4 macrophages (S1008/9), foamy macrophages (TREM2) and SPP1+ macrophages were annotated, whereby foamy macrophages showed enrichment in GPCR pathways and SPP1+ macrophage in ECM and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4c-d</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Based on the identified clusters, and accounting for study-size and disease status, we showed that osteoblastic and neuronal cell abundance increased in carotid and coronary artery atherosclerosis, respectively. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Beside these artery specific alterations, we found a general higher presence of leukocytes in both arteries as expected, but also observed an increased cell abundance in luminal EC and pericytes (APOE+).</p><p id="P21">Next, to investigate the spatial distribution of the defined cell types and their spatial association with atherosclerosis, we first clustered the spatial spots into microenvironments and termed these according to their location within the artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c-d</xref>). The plaque and fibrous microenvironment clusters were mostly composed of spots from atherosclerotic specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4e-f</xref>) and within the plaque cluster, foamy macrophages were observed in the intermediate lesions with enrichment of SPP1+ macrophages with disease progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4g</xref>). Starting with the intermediate lesions, the fibrous cluster was enriched for fibromyocytes and in the adventitia, the proportion of fibroblasts was skewed towards an increased proportion of peripheral EC, pericytes (APOE+) and resident macrophages, which might indicate microvascular angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the media clusters were dominated by a high abundance of VSMC, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4h</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Finally, we analyzed the colocalization of the subclusters revealing complex interactions of the deconvoluted cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>), whereby APOE pericytes were found to be adjacent to cell types of the adventitia and MYH11 pericytes were close to media related cell types. Additionally, fibromyocytes were related to media and plaque cell clusters and lymphocytes were distinct from the plaque, indicating their bimodal role. Next, our aim was to study cell-cell communication leveraging spatial transcriptomic information to validate ligand-receptor interactions by proximity. Because the colocalization favors the interaction of highly expressed genes from the same cell type, the most relevant interactions of the atheroma slides were identified in the plaque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data 5a</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Table 4</bold>). However, we linked each ligand receptor pair to cell type expression and specificity of the scRNA-seq atlas, which revealed the spatial proximity of cell-cell interactions across different cell types that will be highlighted in the following sections.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Lipid uptake, efflux and interplay of the macrophages in the human plaque</title><p id="P23">Before investigating the spatial relationships within the plaque, we first analyzed the spatial distribution of the different macrophages in the intermediate disease and atheroma slides. As expected, Foamy macrophages and SPP1 macrophages were highly accumulated towards the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data 5b</xref>). M4 macrophages were located in the adventitia and plaque, consistent with reports from other human coronary arteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, while resident macrophages dominated the adventitia.</p><p id="P24">Subsequent spatial analysis of macrophage cell-cell communication unveiled a notable co-localization of lipoprotein APOE with ABCA1 and others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data 5c</xref>), facilitating cholesterol efflux from macrophages by reverse cholesterol transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Besides, interactions involving myeloid cells (e.g. CD33 -&gt; C1QB) and interactions with other cell types (e.g. CCL2 -&gt; CCR1) were depicted. Interestingly, lipid uptake driven by scavenger receptor CD36 and the interaction with COL1A1/2 were dominated by SPP1 macrophage in the plaque, but APOE pericytes in the adventitia specifically expressed CD36 resulting in COL1A2 and CD36 interaction in the plaque and adventitia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data 5d</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Notably, not all cell-cell interactions observed were uniquely associated with atherosclerosis, some were present in control samples. S100A9, which is specifically expressed in M4 macrophages (and Neutrophils) exhibited interaction with ITGB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data 5e</xref>), which is expressed by leukocytes associated with cytotoxicity and phagocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. While S100A9 expression was noted in both plaque and adventitia, in atheroma slides, the interaction was predominantly localized within the plaque, contrasting with the communication observed in the control region, which was, albeit in lower presence, more inclined towards the adventitia.</p><p id="P26">In agreement with this observation, cytotoxic lymphocytes were enriched towards the lumen and the plaque peripheral border, while other lymphocytes showed a profound bimodal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f-g</xref>). B cells and plasma cells showed some tendency for an adventitial localization and local interaction (SDC1 -&gt; COL6A3) with fibroblasts and fibromyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of different immunoglobulin isotypes (IgA/M/G) were located proximal to the co-localizations in the plaque and adventitia, which could indicate an <italic>in-situ</italic> activation and plasmablast differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">Overall, the cholesterol efflux, phagocytic and cytotoxic response occur mainly in the plaque but a bimodal distribution of certain leukocytes like M4 macrophages and adaptive immune response by activated B cells and Plasma cells on the periphery might indicate an acute adventitis.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>VSMC transdifferentiation and ECM remodeling by fibromyocytes</title><p id="P28">Because of differences observed in the spatial distribution for the different pericyte subclusters and fibromyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), we next aimed to investigate it in more detail. Intriguingly, we found that pericytes (APOE+) and fibroblasts were located mainly in the adventitia, while the other pericyte cluster (MYH11+) colocalized with VSMC in the media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). Furthermore, we found that moving towards the lumen, the VSMC signature changed towards myofibroblasts and then fibromyocytes. Notably, fibromyocytes were detected in all different stages of atherosclerosis, including all control samples with no acute immune cell infiltration. This could indicate a general presence of fibromyocytes in human coronary arteries or them being involved in the early progression of atherosclerosis.</p><p id="P29">However, these findings together with previous studies, raised the question about appropriate markers for each cell type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Historically, VSMC were defined by different markers like ACTA2, MYH11 or TAGLN and revealed the trans-differentiation diversity of VSMC, but it has been noted that MYH11 is expressed in a subset of pericytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Similarly, the analysis of the scRNA-seq atlas demonstrated expression of MYH11 for MYH11+ pericytes and all VSMC subclusters and for ACTA2 and TAGLN broadly in VSMC and pericyte subclusters. Hence, we re-analyzed the subcluster of VSMCs, pericytes and fibroblasts and suggested state specific markers for the different cell types, which alone or in combination might help to mark specific cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Notably, some of the pericyte markers were confirmed in a recent multi-organ study of pericyte markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">Next, to understand their spatial relationships, we analyzed spatial cell-cell-communication of VSMC and fibroblasts subtypes. TIMP3 and KDR/VEGFR2 colocalized highly in the adventitia of atheroma slides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>) and is associated with angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Besides, PDGFA interactions from VSMC were observed in different directions with PDGFRA expressed in fibroblasts and fibromyocytes. Other interactions involved cell-cell communication between fibromyocytes themselves (e.g. FN1 -&gt; TNFRSF11B) and macrophages located in the plaque (e.g. BGN -&gt; TLR2) located in the plaque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Furthermore, the migration and transition from VMSC towards fibromyocytes has been reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Hence, we reasoned that the migration could occur with a cellular transition and analyzed the VSMC cluster for a potential trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). The trajectory from VSMCs via myofibroblasts and fibromyocytes occurred with expression changes from VSMC marker towards elevated expression of fibroblast markers in the end stadium (C5: DCN, COL6A3, PCOLCE), which was enriched atherosclerotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6d-e</xref>). Interestingly, ECM remodeling (BGN, COL3A1, LTBP1) and antigen processing and presenting occurred along the trajectory. Finally, the defined genes from the scRNA-seq atlas displayed an increasing gradient from the media to the lumen, indicating the migration and transition of VSMC to luminal fibromyoctes. Notably, fibromyocytes in the control samples did not progress towards the later fibrous stage of fibromyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6f</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Taken together, signaling from the adventitia and the plaque might regulate the communication and migration from the periphery to the lumen and fibromyocytes occur in control samples but change to a more fibroblast character upon atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Cell type and niche-specific microenvironments for drug targets</title><p id="P33">Finally, we identified bioactive compounds of the cardiovascular system according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical categories with cell2drug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. We observed that some drugs for cardiac therapies and peripheral vasodilators (e.g. pentoxifylline) addressed different cell types of atherosclerosis, while antihypertensives (e.g. bosentan) and vasoprotectives (dexamethasone acetate) acted mostly in pericytes and macrophages respectively, and beta blockers or calcium channel blockers had a high association with Mast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data 7a</xref>). Drugs of the renin-angiotensin system acted broadly on atherosclerotic cells (e.g. lisinopril) or in a more cell-type specific manner (e.g. losartan on pericytes) in agreement with their different mechanisms, while lipid lowering agents such a statins (e.g. lovastatin, simvastatin) were targeted towards macrophages. Interestingly, the observed cell-type specificity or broadness of the drugs could be recapitulated on the spatial transcriptomic slides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). And while statins showed the expected action in the core plaque region, Losartan acts on the periphery and thus highlights the relevance of the microvasculature for atherosclerosis treatment.</p><p id="P34">Next, we analyzed the human atherosclerosis atlas for cell-type specific drug targets. We observed differences for potential drug targets in the two endothelial cell clusters, where adventitial endothelial might be the potential target of Rapamycin-like targets (e.g. Sirolimus) which could inhibit broadly cell proliferation of endothelial and immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, while Crizanlizumab/Caplacizumab might be specific drugs for targeting luminal endothelial and immune cell interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data 7b</xref>).
