While the factors that control the chromatin association of MYC proteins are well understood, much less is known about how interacting proteins mediate MYC’s effects on transcription. Here we show that TFIIIC, an architectural protein complex that controls the three-dimensional chromatin organization at its target sites, binds directly to the amino-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain of MYCN. Surprisingly, TFIIIC has no discernible role in MYCN-dependent gene expression and transcription elongation. Instead, MYCN and TFIIIC preferentially bind to promoters with paused RNAPII and globally limit the accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNAPII at promoters. Consistent with its ubiquitous role in transcription, MYCN broadly participates in hubs of active promoters. Depletion of TFIIIC further increases MYCN localization to these hubs. This increase correlates with a failure of the nuclear exosome and BRCA1, both of which are involved in nascent RNA degradation, to localize to active promoters. Our data suggest that MYCN and TFIIIC exert an censoring function in early transcription that limits promoter accumulation of inactive RNAPII and facilitates promoter-proximal degradation of nascent RNA.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>MYCN</kwd><kwd>TFIIIC</kwd><kwd>neuroblastoma</kwd><kwd>promoter hub</kwd><kwd>nuclear exosome</kwd><kwd>BRCA1</kwd><kwd>MYC</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The MYC family of proto-oncogenes is at the epicenter of cellular regulatory networks that govern cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dang, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kress, Sabo et al., 2015</xref>).

One consequence of these changes are alterations in expression of a broad range of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dhanasekaran, Hansen et al., 2023</xref>). Unrelated to those changes in gene expression, MYC and MYCN also control RNAPII function to limit the accumulation of R-loops, to facilitate promoter-proximal double-strand break repair and to co-ordinate transcription elongation with DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Papadopoulos, Uhl et al., 2023</xref>). Which of these effects are critical for the oncogenic functions of MYC is an open question and consequently the partner proteins via which MYC proteins alter RNAPII dynamics are under intense investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Baluapuri, Hofstetter et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baluapuri, Wolf et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buchel, Carstensen et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Das, Lewis et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Heidelberger, Voigt et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kalkat, Resetca et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Lourenco, Resetca et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Oksuz, Henninger et al., 2023</xref>).

MYC-dependent effects on RNAPII elongation involves the transfer of elongation factors SPT5 and PAF1c from MYC onto RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Baluapuri et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Endres, Solvie et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Jaenicke, von Eyss et al., 2016</xref>). Both MYC and MYCN also interact with and activate topoisomerases I and II, suggesting that MYC/N-dependent pause release also involves the relieve of torsional stress that builds up during early transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Das, Kuzin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Intriguingly, both MYC and MYCN form prominent complexes with TFIIIC and mapping experiments for MYCN show that the amino terminal transcription-regulatory domain is required for the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Heidelberger et al., 2018</xref>). TFIIIC was first identified as a general transcription factor for RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Orioli, Pascali et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, TFIIIC also binds to thousands of genomic sites that are not shared with RNAPIII and are called <underline>e</underline>xtra <underline>T</underline>FIII<underline>C</underline> (ETC) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Noma, Cam et al., 2006</xref>). Many ETC sites localize to RNAPII-transcribed promoters and such sites are often juxtaposed to MYCN binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Moqtaderi, Wang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Noma et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Oler, Alla et al., 2010</xref>). TFIIIC is an architectural protein that can affect the three-dimensional chromatin organization at its binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Noma et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Van Bortle &amp; Corces, 2013</xref>). Functionally TFIIIC can act as insulator that blocks the spread of chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Raab, Chiu et al., 2012</xref>), affect cohesin loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>), and bind at the borders of topologically <underline>a</underline>ssociating <underline>d</underline>omains (TADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Van Bortle, Nichols et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Intriguingly, TFIIIC compartmentalizes RNAPII promoters and gene expression. Specifically, the effects of TFIIIC on the expression of E2F-dependent and neuronal genes correlate with its effects on the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. In the case of neuronal genes, TFIIIC prevents the localization of activity-dependent genes to sites of active transcription before stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Crepaldi, Policarpi et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ferrari, de Llobet Cucalon et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Policarpi, Crepaldi et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, TFIIIC together with the <underline>a</underline>ctivity-<underline>d</underline>ependent <underline>n</underline>euro<underline>p</underline>rotector homeobox protein (ADNP) controls the three-dimensional architecture of cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ferrari et al., 2020</xref>). Our previous experiments had suggested that TFIIIC may have a role in MYCN-dependent control of RNAPII function and we here show that MYCN and TFIIIC together have an unexpected censoring function that excludes non-functional RNAPII from hubs of active promoters.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>TFIIIC interacts directly with the amino-terminus of MYCN</title><p id="P6">TFIIIC is present in MYCN immunoprecipitates and the amino terminal region of recombinant MYCN binds to TFIIIC in pull-down experiments performed with cell lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>). To test whether MYCN and TFIIIC interact directly, we expressed the six subunits of TFIIIC together with a FLAG-tagged MYCN construct comprising amino acids 2-137 using a recombinant baculovirus to infect insect cells. Performing pulldown experiments with cell lysates and immobilized FLAG-tagged MYCN, we recovered all six subunits of the TFIIIC complex in the eluate along with the FLAG-tagged MYCN construct, demonstrating that TFIIIC can bind to the amino terminal region of MYCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). TFIIIC is composed of two subcomplexes, designated TauA (τA) and TauB (τB), each comprising three of the six subunits. We first attempted co-expression of FLAG-MYCN with individual subcomplexes, but the τB complex was too unstable to be isolated, and so we focused on the stable τA complex. To test whether MYCN binds directly to τA, we purified MYCN and the τA complex separately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A, B</xref>) and then mixed the purified preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-D</xref>). In gel filtration experiments, the isolated MYCN protein eluted with a molecular weight of around 50 kDa, whereas a fraction of MYCN eluted with a much larger molecular weight together with the τA complex when both were mixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-D</xref>). Native-mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Tamara, den Boer et al., 2022</xref>) showed the molecular weight of this complex to be 204.7 kDa, very close to the sum of the molecular weights of a 1:1:1:1 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C, D</xref>). We concluded that the MYCN amino terminal region and the τA subcomplex of TFIIIC form a stable complex with each other in solution.</p><p id="P7">As described in the introduction, TFIIIC is both a general transcription factor for RNAPIII and has been implicated in regulation of RNAPII-dependent transcription. To test whether TFIIIC is required for the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells, we individually depleted three of its subunits, TFIIIC2, TFIIIC3 and TFIIIC5, by stable expression of doxycycline-inducible shRNAs. Controls confirmed that each shRNA efficiently depleted its target protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). To test both for a general requirement of each subunit in neuroblastoma cell proliferation and for MYCN-specific effects, we expressed each shRNA in SH-EP-MYCN-ER cell. SH-EP cells express endogenous MYC and are engineered to stably express a MYCN-ER chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Herold et al., 2019</xref>). Activation of the MYCN-ER by addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) suppresses the expression of endogenous MYC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F</xref>), in effect causing a switch from MYC to MYCN expression. Under control conditions, depletion of TFIIIC2 or TFIIIC3 attenuated proliferation, whereas depletion of the small TFIIIC5 subunit had little effect. Addition of 4-OHT had little effect by itself, but greatly enhanced the inhibitory effect of depletion of each subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that TFIIIC has both general and MYCN-specific roles in neuroblastoma cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>TFIIIC limits promoter binding of non-phosphorylated RNAPII in MYCN-expressing cells</title><p id="P8">The proximity of TFIIIC binding sites to MYCN binding sites at many promoters transcribed by RNAPII prompted us to explore the role of TFIIIC in MYCN-driven transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>). Using an antibody that detects total RNAPII, we had previously shown that activation of MYCN in SH-EP-MYCN-ER cells impacts RNAPII in two ways: First, MYCN promotes pause release and MYCN´s effect on elongation correlates with its effects on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Herold et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Rahl, Lin et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Walz et al., 2014</xref>). At the same time, activation of MYCN uniformly reduces RNAPII occupancy at all active promoters; this correlates with a reduced accumulation of promoter-proximal R-loops, suggesting that MYCN limits the accumulation of RNAPII at promoters that is impaired in productive elongation and/or splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Herold et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Previous experiments using antibodies directed against total RNAPII had yielded results that varied among different antibodies ( (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>) and RV, unpublished). To directly compare the effects of MYCN and TFIIIC on promoter-bound RNAPII with those on elongating RNAPII in a side-by-side manner, we conducted parallel ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses using antibodies that specifically recognize non-phosphorylated and Ser2-phosphorylated (pSer2) RNAPII, respectively. Visual inspection of multiple individual genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and global analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A,B</xref>) showed that activation of MYCN caused a global decrease in promoter association of non-phosphorylated RNAPII. A control ChIP-seq experiment established that addition of 4-OHT had no such effect in SH-EP cells that do not express a MYCN-ER chimera, demonstrating that the reduction is due to activation of MYCN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). At the same time, MYCN promoted an increase in transcription elongation as best documented by pSer2-RNAPII occupancy at the transcription end site (TES) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A, C</xref>). This increase was most pronounced on MYCN-activated genes. Comparison with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data showed that it correlated closely with MYCN-dependent changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Depletion of TFIIIC5 abrogated the MYCN-dependent decrease in chromatin association of non-phosphorylated RNAPII but had no effect on MYCN-dependent changes in transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). In many experimental systems, MYC and MYCN effects on elongation parallel closely with the corresponding changes in gene expression. Consistent with these observations, RNA-seq showed that neither depletion of TFIIIC3 nor of TFIIIC5 had significant effects on either basal gene expression or MYCN-dependent changes in steady-state mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). Finally, we aimed to understand whether the localization of TFIIIC and MYCN at promoters is linked to the dynamics of RNAPII at promoters and performed ChIP-seq of TFIIIC5 in SH-EP-MYCN-ER cells in the presence of 5,6-Dichlorobenzimidazole-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (DRB), which stabilizes paused RNAPII and prevents pause-release of RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Mancebo, Lee et al., 1997</xref>). Inspection of individual genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>) and average density plots of all active promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>) showed that activation of MYCN globally enhanced TFIIIC5 association with regions surrounding active transcription start sites, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>). Addition of DRB increased TFIIIC5 association with active promoters and the combination of MYCN activation and DRB had a strong additive effect, arguing that MYCN preferentially recruits TFIIIC5 to promoters with paused RNAPII.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>MYCN takes part in three-dimensional networks of active promoters</title><p id="P10">The effects of TFIIIC on the expression of E2F-dependent and neuronal genes correlate with its effects on the three-dimensional chromatin architecture (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Introduction</xref>). This raised the possibility that complex formation of TFIIIC similarly affects three-dimensional chromatin interactions of MYCN. To test this hypothesis, we used <underline>p</underline>hosphorylated linker HiChIP (pLHiChIP), a modification of the HiChIP protocol, which identifies pairs of DNA loci that are brought into close spatial proximity to a specific protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Mumbach, Rubin et al., 2016</xref>). We initially performed pLHiChIP for MYCN in SH-EP-MYCN-ER neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). ChIP experiments measuring the occupancy of multiple promoters bound by both MYCN and MYC showed that the chromatin association of MYCN is much greater than that of MYC, allowing analysis of MYCN function on chromatin with little interference from MYC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). Visual inspection of the MYCN pLHiChIP showed that thousands of pairs of MYCN binding sites are in close spatial proximity with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Appropriate quality controls established the validity of these results: For example, the Hi-C module of pLHiChIP protocol yielded a high percentage of valid interactions pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C, D</xref>). Relative to the Hi-C input, the MYCN HiChIP is strongly enriched for interactions that connected two MYCN-binding sites with each other, confirming the specificity of the signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The pLHiChIP data analysis revealed a total of 4,591 distinct binary interactions involving MYCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). To facilitate a comprehensive functional analysis of MYCN anchor sites, we performed ChIP-seq for RNAPII from SH-EP-MYCN-ER cells and integrated the HiChIP data with these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), along with other relevant annotations, such as SINE elements. Remarkably, our analysis revealed that 1,277 out of the 4,591 MYCN anchors (28%) were positioned on RNAPII promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, 864 out of the 4,591 MYCN interactions (19%) exhibited connections between promoters and either exonic or intronic sequences, consistent with previous observations showing that MYCN binding sites are often located within transcribed regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, MYCN interactions were observed between promoters and SINE repetitive elements (647/4,591; 14%) including interactions with tRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3F</xref>). These connections are likely shared with TFIIIC (see below). We also observed interactions between promoters or gene bodies and enhancers, accounting for 453 out of the 4,591 interactions (10%).</p><p id="P12">We used the RNAPII and published MYCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Herold et al., 2019</xref>) ChIP-seq data as well as sequencing datasets of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>) and nascent (4sU-labeled) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Papadopoulos, Solvie et al., 2022</xref>) RNA to identify the specific properties of promoters within three-dimensional MYCN interactions. This showed that significantly more MYCN and RNAPII bound to promoters that participated in such interactions and that these promoters were more active than MYCN-bound promoters without such interactions, although the latter difference was small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). We next used the binary interactions as a starting point to reconstruct interaction networks. This showed that MYCN participated in three-dimensional promoter hubs of different sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), with the largest connecting up to 34 promoters and 10 enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). This number of promoters is consistent with published estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Palacio &amp; Taatjes, 2022</xref>). Functional annotation of the promoters that are contained in these large hubs showed that they are highly enriched in genes encoding ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis genes transcribed by RNAPII (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3G</xref>).

Specifically, these analyses identified a total of 3,499 binary non-contiguous interactions for TFIIIC. Comparison to RNAPII ChIP-seq data showed that 31% of these interactions connected a promoter or the gene body of an RNAPII-transcribed gene to a SINE repetitive element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, 1,107 out of 4,591 MYCN interactions shared one (1,075) or both (32) anchors with TFIIIC-containing interactions arguing that both proteins participate in common hubs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). This is consistent with our previous data, which showed that many promoters contain a TFIIIC-bound site close to a MYCN-bound E-box element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>). A significant percentage of the interactions that are shared between MYCN and TFIIIC contained an E-box in one anchor and A- or B-boxes, which are bound by TFIIIC, in the other anchor sequence, arguing that MYCN and TFIIIC can participate in the same interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). Most interactions that are shared by MYCN and TFIIIC connected promoters to other promoters, to gene bodies or to SINE elements. Conversely, TFIIIC5 anchors without overlapping MYCN loops (“TFIIIC5 only”) did not show an enrichment for promoter interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). We concluded that both MYCN and TFIIIC5 are present in promoter hubs.

Activation of MYCN and depletion of TFIIIC5 had only weak effects on the proximity of RNAPII with NELFE, which associates with pausing RNAPII.

We have previously shown that MYCN can recruit the nuclear exosome to its target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Papadopoulos et al., 2022</xref>). MYCN can also recruit BRCA1, which in turn stimulates binding of the mRNA decapping enzyme DCP1 that initiates RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Herold et al., 2019</xref>). No significant effects were observed in the proximity between RNAPII with the XRN2 exonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, CUT&amp;RUN experiments using antibodies directed EXOSC5, a core structural subunit of the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kilchert, Wittmann et al., 2016</xref>), showed that depletion of TFIIIC5 strongly decreased the association of EXOSC5 with regions around the TSS, both in control and in MYCN-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). To test whether MYCN-dependent recruitment of BRCA1 depends on TFIIIC, we performed ChIP experiments at multiple MYCN-bound promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5E</xref>). Consistent with our previous observations, only low amount of BRCA1 were found at core promoter in SH-EP cells and that induction of MYCN recruited BRCA1 to all tested promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Herold et al., 2019</xref>).

Collectively, the data show that TFIIIC is required for association of the nuclear exosome and of BRCA1 with active promoters and that these effects are enhanced in cells expressing MYCN, arguing that they can account for the enhanced dependence of MYCN expressing cells on TFIIIC.

Most MYC/N binding sites on chromatin do not appear to be functional with respect to gene expression and transcriptional elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kress et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Sabo, Kress et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Walz et al., 2014</xref>). This raises the possibility that such binding sites are indeed non-functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Pellanda, Dalsass et al., 2021</xref>). Alternatively, MYCN has functions in transcription that go beyond gene regulation. In support of the later model, we and others have uncovered critical roles of MYC and MYCN in maintaining the genomic stability of tumor cells, for example, by coordinating transcription with DNA replication and by enabling promoter-proximal double-strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baluapuri et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Papadopoulos et al., 2023</xref>). This raises the question of which direct interaction partners of MYC and MYCN mediate these effects and what the underlying mechanisms are. Here we show that TFIIIC binds directly to the amino-terminus of MYCN, and that a MYCN/TFIIIC complex globally limits the accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNAPII at promoters.</p><p id="P18">Several mechanisms can account for these observations: First, the amino-terminus of MYC proteins is a transcription-activating domain that can interact with cyclin T1 and CDK8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Eberhardy &amp; Farnham, 2002</xref>) and potentially other co-activators, hence TFIIIC may block MYCN interaction with co-activators that recruit RNAPII to promoters. Since MYCN/TFIIIC also restricts RNAPII accumulation at promoters that are not activated by MYCN, this is unlikely to be the sole mode of action. Second, MYCN and TFIIIC binding sites are often downstream of the transcription start sites and the three-dimensional structures formed by MYCN and TFIIIC may sterically restrict elongation and favour termination of non-phosphorylated RNAPII. Third, TFIIIC is an architectural protein complex and re-localization of promoters may be central to the mechanism of MYCN/TFIIIC action. Active promoters coalesce at a discrete number of sites in the eucaryotic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lim &amp; Levine, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Palacio &amp; Taatjes, 2022</xref>). Many of the factors involved in basal transcription undergo liquid-liquid phase separation, arguing that transcription initiation takes place in condensate-like structures established by transcription-regulatory domains and by RNAPII itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hnisz, Shrinivas et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Lewis, Das et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lu, Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with their ubiquitous role in transcription, MYC proteins form condensates by themselves and enter condensates formed by the RNAPII-associated mediator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Boija, Klein et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Solvie, Baluapuri et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Yang, Chung et al., 2022</xref>). As described in the introduction, TFIIIC can restrict the localization of genes to sites of active transcription. We show here that MYCN/TFIIIC complexes, in contrast to MYCN, are not part of hubs of active promoters, leading us to propose that TFIIIC antagonizes MYCN participation in promoter hubs and limits the accumulation of paused or stalled RNAPII at promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Since TFIIIC competes with the Aurora-A kinase for binding of MYCN and Aurora-A in turn promotes elongation by RNAPII, we propose that the competition between both complexes enables transcriptional elongation on promoters that are activated by MYCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Roeschert, Poon et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P19">As described above, depletion of TFIIIC has no discernible role in elongation and changes in polyA+ mRNA levels, raising the question of what the function of the association might be. The fate of nascent RNA is controlled by several interrelated processes leading to splicing and polyadenylation of the full-length transcript on the one hand, and mis-splicing, premature termination and RNA degradation on the other and MYCN has been implicated in both processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Noe Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Papadopoulos et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Schmid &amp; Jensen, 2019</xref>). Depletion of TFIIIC strongly decreased the association of the nuclear exosome, an RNA exonuclease complex that degrades multiple forms of aberrant nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Schmid &amp; Jensen, 2019</xref>), and of BRCA1, which in turn recruits the mRNA decapping enzyme DCP1 at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Herold et al., 2019</xref>). The association of both the exosome and BRCA1 with promoters were enhanced in MYCN expressing cells, arguing that they are likely to reflect - at least in part - the activity of the TFIIIC/MYCN complex. At the same time, TFIIIC3 depletion caused splicing errors, which occurred predominantly in downstream exons and were independent of MYCN, arguing that the effect on splicing may reflect an activity of TFIIIC that is independent of its function at promoters. We propose that the TFIIIC/MYCN complex formation exerts a censoring and quality control function for RNAPII at promoters that have not received a full complement of activating signals and hypothesize that this contributes to focus the transcription machinery and metabolic resources on the genes that drive the growth of MYCN-driven tumors.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P20">Cell line derived from human neuroblastoma (SH-EP; CVCL_RR78) was verified by STR profiling and grown in RPMI-1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The fold average for 3 independent biological replicates was calculated on treatment to control as showed in the correspondent figure and legend. The result was averaged in 100 or 150 bins for a total of 14,085 genes and displayed as dot plot. Alternative splicing events were identified using rMATS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Shen et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p id="P46">pLHi-C, pLHiChIP and spLHiChIP sequencing reads were processed in two steps. In the first step they were all processed in the same way, HiC-Pro v 2.11.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Servant, Varoquaux et al., 2015</xref>) trims the reads for the linker sequence, aligns it to hg19 and filters it by DpnII restriction fragments of the same genome assembly. The default parameters were used for the alignment steps, except for the length of the seed (-L) parameter that was set to 25 for the global options and 15 for the local one, and mismatch (-N) that was set to 1. Read trimming was performed by inserting combinations of the linker sequence (GATCAGATTTGGGGATC, GATCCCCAAATCTGATC) in the ligation site parameter. Reads considered as duplicates were accepted and multi-mapped reads were only removed for pLHiChIP and spLHiChIP. Quality control for all steps until all valid pairs (<underline>p</underline>aired <underline>e</underline>nd tags; PETs) output was also performed thru HiC-Pro. We compared HiC-Pro’s standard quality controls example (IMR90 replicate 1 sample; GSM862724), according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Servant <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Servant et al., 2015</xref>), to the base of our methods variation, pLHi-C.</p><p id="P47">In the second step, spLHiChIP samples undergo the same workflow described for the first step replacing hg19 for mm10 assembly. PETs from mm10 were removed from hg19 PETs and a spike-in normalization was applied to hg19 PETs in the same way explained for ChIP-Rx hg19 aligned reads. DNA loop calling was performed on spLHiChIP and pLHiChIP PETs using hichipper v0.7.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Lareau &amp; Aryee, 2018</xref>). ChIP-seq peak calling sites were used as pre-determined peaks. All the default parameters with a loop maximum distance (--max-dist) of 5,000,000 were used for all proteins. We compared the DNA loops calling quality control for Oct4 HiChIP (GSM2238510) from the original method description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Mumbach et al., 2016</xref>) to our method variation for MYCN and TFIIIC5. An extra quality control to show enrichment and specificity was performed by plotting MYCN pLHiChIP, its input pLHi-C and its ChIP-seq with pLHiChIP and pLHi-C normalized to the same number of PETs. DNA loops calling results were refined and confirmed by visual inspection. The mango output files from the loop calling were then loaded in R, filter by a q-value equal or smaller than 0.01 and used in all further plots and analyses. All examples showing DNA loops, ChIP-seq and annotation tracks in different genomic regions/locus were plotted using plotgardener package in R environment.</p><p id="P48">The different genome functional annotations were retrieved from UCSC table browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Karolchik, Hinrichs et al., 2004</xref>). Promoters, gene bodies and transcription end sites (TES) come from Reference Sequence (RefSeq) collection of genes for hg19 assembly and were adapted via R language. For RNAPII targets, promoters were defined as TSS ± 0.5 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>), gene bodies as the sum of exons and introns, TES as TES ± 0.3 kb. Enhancers were defined as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Walz <italic>et al</italic>. (2014)</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Walz et al., 2014</xref>): H3K3me1 and H3K27ac overlapping sites without H3K4me3. Overlapping and discontinuous regions were obtained by using peak calling outputs as inputs in intersectBed (BEDTools) with standard parameters.</p><p id="P49">Overlapping between different pLHiChIP was calculated by “bedtools pairtopair” function (BEDTools) using the options to prevent self-hits and ignore strands. The type of overlap was set to report when both anchors of the different pLHiChIP overlaps (-type either). This provided outputs of loops with and without overlapping that could be used for other analyses. For discrimination between the different types of overlaps, the type both was removed from the type either and the two types were then reported. Overlaps were called joint sites and adapted as Venn diagrams by centering the coordinates and numbers to MYCN anchors or MYCN-TFIIIC5 anchors. TADs overlap corresponds to common sites in at least eight out of nine cell lines reported in (GSE35156) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Rao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P50">The GenomicInteractions v1.28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Harmston, Ing-Simmons et al., 2015</xref>) package in R language was used to calculate and report the overlaps between the different pLHiChIP anchors and their functional annotations. Overlaps on different functional annotations were reported in the following order of priority: enhancer, promoter, TES, gene body, tRNA, rRNA, miRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, SINE, LINE, LTR, and satellite. The bar graphs reporting the functional annotation of each anchor are proportional to the total number of loops of each pLHiChIP, numbers were rounded and plotted by GenomicInteractions and ggplot2 v3.3.5 packages in R environment.</p><p id="P51">Motif analysis was performed by using the FIMO algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Grant, Bailey et al., 2011</xref>) of the MEME Suite software toolkit v5.3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bailey, Johnson et al., 2015</xref>). The function getfasta (BEDTools) extracted the hg19 FASTA sequence from each pLHiChIP anchor to be used independently as input for motif search. The background model was generated by the function fasta-get-markov (MEME Suite) using hg19 FASTA with standard parameters. Pre-defined motifs for MYCN (E-box) (MA0104.4: JASPAR 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Sandelin, Alkema et al., 2004</xref>)), B-box, and A-box were scanned using the options “--thresh 1.0 --text” with the default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chan, Lin et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Pavesi, Conterio et al., 1994</xref>). Resulting hits were then filtered by p-value &lt;= 1x10<sup>-4</sup>. In R environment, duplicated hits of the same motif in the same anchor were filtered by the one with the lowest p-value. Different motifs in the same anchor window were reported according to the decreasing priority: E-box, B-box, and A-box. The overlap between anchors and motifs was computed by GenomicInteractions package and the corresponding heatmap was plotted in R.</p><p id="P52">To visualize the influence of the MYCN interaction on gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>), MYCN bound genes (as defined by MACS2 on MYCN ChIP-seq data, above) were subdivided into genes that are bound by MYCN without loops (“no MYCN loops”) and genes bound by MYCN forming loops (above, “MYCN loops”). For both classes, RNA-sequencing reads between TSS &amp; TSS+2 kb were counted using “bedtools intersect” on spike-normalized ChIP-seq data for RNAPII (A10), MYCN (GSM3044606), TFIIIC5; processed transcript data were obtained from Büchel <italic>et al</italic>. 2017 (RNA-sequencing, GSE111905 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>)) and Papadopoulos et al. 2021 (4sU-sequencing, GSE164569 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Papadopoulos et al., 2022</xref>)), respectively. Plots were generated with “boxplot” and statistical significance calculated using Students’ t-test (unpaired, two-sided, unequal variance), both in R v3.6.3.</p><p id="P53">Over-representation analysis for Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Subramanian, Tamayo et al., 2005</xref>)) were calculated by clusterProfiler package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Wu, Hu et al., 2021</xref>) in R environment. Different functional classes of loops were retrieved from the overlaps and discontinuous loops by the GenomicInteractions package. Gene names were converted to HGNC symbol name using AnnotationDbi package and sorted by the number of PETs. Duplicated gene names were merged and the median of their number of PETs was used. A hypergeometric test was calculated on the sorted list for MSigDB collections H (hallmark gene sets) or C5 (ontology gene sets) using a 0.05 q-value threshold.</p><p id="P54">MYCN spLHiChIP treated sample was normalize by its control counterpart in each biological replicate before plotted as graph bar in R enviroment. The ratio of TFIIIC5 binding (ChIP-Rx) per number of interaction (spLHiChIP) was calculated in R environment v4.1.1. The number of ChIP-Rx reads was calculated to TSS ± 2 kb for all genes using bedtools intersect (BEDtools) with default parameters. The number of spLHiChIP interactions was calculated for the same region. The ratio was calculated on reads to number of interactions per each sample and plotted as bar graph.</p><p id="P55">Networks were reconstituted by using the R package igraph v1.2.11 and Cytoscape v3.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brockmann, Poon et al., 2013</xref>). The different classes of loops were retrieved via the GenomicInteractions package and converted to the simple interaction file format and to a node table. These files were used in Cytoscape for visualization, using the Edge-weighted Spring-Embedded Layout based on the number of PETs for each loop. The resulting MYCN network reports the nodes as functional annotations; explained before. In parallel, the sif file was used as input for the igraph package. This package was used to define the membership of each anchor to the different clusters and to quantify the number of nodes per cluster. The statistical significance comparing the number of nodes per cluster between two groups were calculated via Wilcoxon rank sum test.</p><p id="P56">Density plots for the different regions were performed using ngs.plot v2.41.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Shen, Shao et al., 2014a</xref>). Default parameters were used for samples normalized by reads number. For spike-in normalized samples, we used a custom variation of ngs.plot that allows the spike-in normalization by skipping the internal normalization step. All densities plots and metaplots were based on gene expression for SH-EP-MYCN-ER cells ± MYCN induction (4-OHT treatment) – evaluated by RNA-sequencing (GSE111905; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Herold <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Based on this, all expressed genes gene set consists of 14,704 genes, down- and up- regulated gene sets are represented by 613 and 921 genes, respectively. MYCN-down and -up regulated genes are defined by negative and positive fold change upon ±4-OHT treatment of genes with q-values less than 0.05 and expression filter by counts per million. In R v4.1.1., Wilcoxon rank sum test (unpaired, two-sided) was used to compare the different conditions on the plotted region per ChIP.</p><p id="P57">PLA’s p-values were calculated by comparing the signal of the pool of the cells in all replicates using Wilcoxon rank sum test (unpaired, two-sided) in R v4.1.1.</p></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Materials, data and code availability</title><p id="P58">All plasmids generated are available upon request.</p><p id="P59">The following published datasets were used: MYCN ChIP-seq and RNA-seq: GSE111905; 4sU-seq: GSE164569.

We propose that complex formation with the TFIIIC complex antagonize the localization of MYCN in promoter hubs and that this enables access of the nuclear exosome and BRCA1 to promoters with paused or stalled RNAPII. Both the exosome and BRCA1 have been implicated in fostering the degradation of nascent RNA at promoters. The precise mechanisms by which MYCN and TFIIIC limit accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNAPII at promoters remain to be determined.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS191469-f006"/></fig></floats-group></article>
