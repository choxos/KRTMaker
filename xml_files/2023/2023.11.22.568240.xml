Therefore, we investigated the rifampicin tolerance of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates, with or without pre-existing isoniazid-resistance. We determined the <italic>in-vitro</italic> rifampicin survival fraction by minimum duration of killing assay in isoniazid susceptible (IS, n=119) and resistant (IR, n=84) <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates. Then we correlated the rifampicin tolerance with bacterial growth, rifampicin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and isoniazid-resistant mutations. The longitudinal IR isolates collected from patients were analyzed for changes in rifampicin tolerance and associated emergence of genetic variants. The median duration of rifampicin exposure reducing the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> surviving fraction by 90% (minimum duration of killing-MDK90) increased from 1.23 (95%CI 1.11; 1.37) and 1.31 (95%CI 1.14; 1.48) to 2.55 (95%CI 2.04; 2.97) and 1.98 (95%CI 1.69; 2.56) days, for IS and IR respectively, during 15 to 60 days of incubation. This indicated the presence of fast and slow growing tolerant sub-populations. A range of 6 log10-fold survival fraction enabled classification of tolerance as low, medium or high and revealed IR association with increased tolerance with faster growth (OR=2.68 for low vs. medium, OR=4.42 for low vs. high, <italic>P</italic>-trend=0.0003). The high tolerance in IR isolates was specific to those collected during rifampicin treatment in patients and associated with bacterial genetic microvariants. Furthermore, the high rifampicin tolerant IR isolates have survival potential similar to multi-drug resistant isolates. These findings suggest that IR tuberculosis needs to be evaluated for high rifampicin tolerance to improve treatment regimen and prevent the risk of MDR-TB emergence.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2"><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> causes around 10 million cases of tuberculosis (TB) each year and 1.5 million deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Challenges to successful TB treatment include bacterial evolution and diversification under host stresses and antibiotics, leading to differential antibiotic susceptibility even among genetically-susceptible <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Based on killing dynamics, the differential susceptibility can be classified into two phenomena, 1) antibiotic tolerance observed as reduced rate of killing of the entire bacterial population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, and 2) antibiotic persistence observed as reduced rate of killing of sub-populations compared to more susceptible bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Clinically susceptible isolates exposed to host stresses and antibiotic selection can exhibit increased antibiotic tolerance and persistence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, as seen by the emergence of mutations increasing tolerance or persistence among clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Recent studies have also implicated the antibiotic tolerance in clinical isolates as a risk factor for hard-to treat infections and tolerance can also contribute to the emergence of resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> and relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Emergence of rifampicin tolerance or persistence, a key drug in TB treatment is a major concern considering the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR, resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin) tuberculosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Several mechanisms lead to rifampicin tolerance, heteroresistance or persistence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. These include efflux pump overexpression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, mistranslation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, overexpression of rifampicin target <italic>rpoB</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> , cell size heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and the redox heterogeneity in bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Rifampicin treatment can also result in differentially detectable sub-populations of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, which can grow only in liquid medium as compared to solid medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, in determining risk of post-treatment relapse, it is important to consider, alongside tolerance range, the degree of growth heterogeneity within tolerant subpopulations.</p><p id="P4">Apart from rifampicin susceptibility variation, another concern in standard TB treatment is the emergence of isoniazid resistance (IR). There is globally around 10% prevalence of IR among clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. IR is difficult to rapidly diagnose during drug susceptibility testing, and is associated with worse treatment outcomes compared to isoniazid-susceptible (IS) <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Importantly, IR is also associated with subsequent emergence of rifampicin resistance leading to MDR TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Despite its potential importance for the TB treatment, the distribution of rifampicin tolerance among clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates is unknown, and routine clinical microbiology diagnosis does not include any assays for tolerance. The growth fitness of rifampicin tolerant subpopulations, and the association of pre-existing IR with rifampicin tolerance is completely unknown.</p><p id="P6">To address this knowledge gap, we developed a most-probable number (MPN) based minimum duration of killing (MDK) assay to determine the rifampicin tolerance among clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates in a medium-throughput manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. In the current study, we investigated the rifampicin tolerance in a large set of IS (n=119) and IR (n=84) clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates and its correlation with bacterial growth rate, rifampicin MICs, IR-mutations and the rifampicin treatment selection in patients.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Study design</title><p id="P7">We investigated rifampicin tolerance and its association with isoniazid susceptibility among 242 clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates.

Higher survival fractions indicate higher rifampicin tolerance, and differences in survival fraction determined between 15 and 60 days of incubation indicated greater growth heterogeneity in rifampicin tolerant sub-populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1B</xref>). 23 of the isolates grew poorly in the absence of antibiotic, and a further 10 had low initial MPN, making accurate determination of survival fractions difficult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1 A</xref>), and these 33 isolates were removed from further analysis. Of the remaining 209 isolates, 119 IS, 84 IR and 6 resistant to both rifampicin and isoniazid, MDR.

We did not further analyse 30 days incubation result, as it was similar to 60 days incubation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1</xref>). Following 5 days of rifampicin treatment, the average survival fraction reduced by 90-99% of the starting bacterial population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). We calculated the time required for 90% survival fraction reduction (MDK<sub>90</sub>) for each isolate by determine the different length of X-axis (Days post rifampicin treatment) corresponding to 90% decline in survival fraction in Y-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2</xref>). Of note, the average time required for 90%survival fraction reduction (MDK<sub>90</sub>) was 1.23 (95%CI (Confidence interval) 1.11; 1.37) and 1.31 (95%CI 1.14; 1.48) days for IS and IR respectively when survivors were incubated for 15 days, but rose to 2.55 (95%CI 2.04; 2.97) and 1.98 (95%CI 1.69; 2.56) days for 60 days for IS and IR isolates respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). This shift in the MDK<sub>90</sub> indicated the presence of growth heterogeneity within the tolerant subpopulation – with both fast and slow-growing bacteria within tolerant subpopulations. For most of the isolates MDK<sub>90</sub> time could be calculated but other parameters of tolerance and persistence such as MDK<sub>99</sub> (at 15 day=81% (170/209), 60 day=41% (86/209)) and MDK<sub>99.99</sub> (at 15 day=11% (22/209), 60 day=8% (17/209)) could be calculated for only a fraction of 209 isolates and the rest were beyond the assay limits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2</xref>). Intriguingly, we observed a significant difference in rifampicin tolerance between IS and IR isolates at 5 days of treatment– but only in the 15 days post recovery. The difference had disappeared by 60 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). Therefore, we decided to consider survival fractions with 15 and 60 days recovery for further analysis, the earliest and latest time points for determining the fast- and slowly-growing rifampicin tolerant subpopulations.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Isoniazid resistance is associated with fast-growing rifampicin tolerant subpopulations</title><p id="P9">To further group rifampicin tolerance level, and correlate it with growth fitness and isoniazid susceptibility, we compared the distribution of survival fraction at 15 and 60 days recovery following 2 and 5 days of rifampicin treatment in IS (n=119) and IR (n=84) isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 3</xref>). There was no significant difference in rifampicin tolerance between IS and IR isolates at 2 days of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 3</xref>). At 5 days of rifampicin treatment and both early (15 days) and late (60 days) recovery time points, IS and IR isolates showed a broad distribution of fractional survival–spanning 1 million-times difference in rifampicin susceptibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3 A</xref>). At the 15 days recovery period, IR was significantly associated with higher survival to rifampicin treatment as compared to IS isolates (P=0.017, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>), whereas at 60 days, fractional survival increased in both groups with no difference according to isoniazid susceptibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>). These results suggest that the difference between IS and IR rifampicin tolerant subpopulations is within their fast-growing tolerant bacilli only.</p><p id="P10">To further refine distribution of rifampicin tolerance between isolates, first we combined the rifampicin survival fraction distribution of both IS and IR isolates, then the fractional rifampicin survival was parsed as low, medium or high as defined by falling within the 25<sup>th</sup>, 75<sup>th</sup> and 100<sup>th</sup> percentiles of survival fractions following rifampicin treatment and either 15 or 60 days recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3B</xref>). As expected, there was substantially lower tolerance to rifampicin in low and medium groups compared with MDR isolates. Surprisingly, tolerance to rifampicin between non-rifampicin resistant “high” tolerance strains and MDR strains was not significantly different (P=0.78, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3B</xref>), and these high tolerant strains were characterized in both IS and IR isolates. This suggests that within the IR, high tolerant subgroup, antibiotic susceptibility (to both rifampicin and isoniazid) may be similar to <italic>bona fide</italic> MDR strains.</p><p id="P11">Analyzing rifampicin tolerance subgroups between IS and IR strains, at the early, 15 day recovery time-point, the majority (79%, 26/33) of “low” rifampicin tolerant strains were isoniazid susceptible. By contrast, IR isolates were over-represented in the “medium” and “high” tolerant subgroups (OR of 2.7 and 4.4 respectively–<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>). These associations disappeared with longer (60 day) recovery post antibiotic treatment, confirming that IR isolates harbored fast-growing, high-level rifampicin-tolerant bacilli compared with IS isolates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Association between rifampicin tolerance and relative growth in absence of antibiotics, rifampicin MICs, isoniazid resistant mutations of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates</title><p id="P12">Clinical isolates of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> exhibit a large degree of lag time and growth heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, as well as differences in rifampicin MICs or isoniazid-resistant mutations. Prior studies showed that slow growth rate and non-replicating persistence were correlated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, therefore we wished to investigate the association between growth rates in the absence of antibiotic treatment, rifampicin MIC distribution, isoniazid-resistant mutations and rifampicin tolerance distribution in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates.</p><p id="P13">For correlating relative growth in absence of antibiotics, we removed 19 outliers which deviated from normal distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 4</xref> with 19 outliers), Intriguingly, slower growth before rifampicin treatment did not have significant correlation with higher growth fitness in rifampicin survival fraction at 15 days incubation in IS isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A</xref> regression coefficient -0.21, 95%CI [-0.44, 0.007], <italic>P</italic>=0.058). By contrast, correlation of slower growth with lower growth fitness in the long recovery period was observed in both IS and IR isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4B</xref>, regression coefficient for IS=0.38 [0.15, 0.61], <italic>P</italic>=0.0014, and IR=0.38 [0.12, 0.64], <italic>P</italic>=0.0041). Comparing IS and IR isolates, IR isolates had slower growth in the absence of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4C</xref>, P&lt;0.0001). Thus, slow growth before rifampicin treatment correlates with reduced growth fitness in certain rifampicin tolerant populations at 60 days incubation.</p><p id="P14">In case of IS isolates, higher rifampicin MICs correlated with lower rifampicin tolerance at long recovery period, 15 (-0.24 [-0.50, 0.022], <italic>P</italic>=0.073) and 60 days incubation (-0.31 [-0.53, -0.083], <italic>P</italic>=0.007, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 5A</xref>), whereas IR isolates did not show such a negative correlation of rifampicin tolerance with rifampicin MICs (0.14 [-0.14, 0.41], <italic>P</italic>=0.33 and 0.21 [-0.057, 0.48], <italic>P</italic>=0.12, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 5A</xref>). This latter observation might be due to increased growth fitness of IR rifampicin tolerant populations. In addition, there was no significant difference in rifampicin MICs distribution between IS and IR isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We next investigated the association between isoniazid-resistant mutations in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates and rifampicin tolerance distribution.

Due to low number of isolates with inhA and fabG1 mutations, it was not possible to identify the difference in rifampicin tolerance distribution between the isolates with different isoniazid-resistant mutations. Nevertheless, we observed wide distribution of rifampicin tolerance in isoniazid-resistant isolates with katG_S315X mutation itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 6</xref>), indicating the role of other genetic or epi-genetic determinants influencing rifampicin tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Higher rifampicin tolerance and growth fitness is associated with IR isolates from intensive phase of treatment with rifampicin</title><p id="P16">The IS isolates were collected only at baseline before treatment, whereas the IR isolates in our study were collected longitudinally from patients at different stages of treatment. Both patients with IS and IR isolates received the standard 8 months treatment regimen according to the Vietnamese National TB Program during the study period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, this included initial two months with four antibiotics (streptomycin or ethambutol, with rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide) followed by 6 months with isoniazid and ethambutol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The antibiotic treatment may select different <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genetic microvariants in the patients and lead to differences in rifampicin tolerance between longitudinal isolates. Therefore, we analyzed the rifampicin tolerance distribution in the IR isolates in three sub-groups, before treatment (IR-BL), initial two months of intensive phase of treatment with rifampicin in the regimen (IR-IP), continuous phase and relapse lacking rifampicin and any other antibiotics treatment selection respectively (IR-CP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). This grouping reflects TB-treatment regimen in Vietnam during the study period with rifampicin only in the initial two months of treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.

We observed three kinds of changes in rifampicin tolerance between the isolates collected from same patient, 1. decrease (one or more subsequent isolates with lower rifampicin tolerance as compared to the initial isolate), 2. unchanged (initial and subsequent isolates with similar level of rifampicin tolerance) and 3. Increase (one or more subsequent isolates with higher rifampicin tolerance as compared to the initial isolate) for 5 days or rifampicin treatment and 15 and 60 days recovery time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) and analyzed the difference in non-synonymous SNPs between the isolates from the same patients associated with differences in rifampicin tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary table 2</xref>). The SNPs difference between the longitudinally collected <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates from same patient were 0-3 except in one case (SNPs=11), indicating de-novo emergence or selection of genetic microvariants within the patient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary table 2</xref>). Next, we analyzed the non-synonymous SNPs associated with the changes in rifampicin tolerance both at 15 and 60 days incubation. This included both genetic variants emerging as more than 90% of WGS reads and less-than 90% threshold used as a cut-off for calling SNPs. Several genes Rv0792c, Rv1266c, Rv1696, Rv1758, Rv1997, Rv2043c, Rv2329c, Rv2394, Rv2398c, Rv2400c, Rv2488c, Rv2545, Rv2689c, Rv3138, Rv3680 and Rv3758c previously reported to be associated with persistence, tolerance and survival within host had non-synonymous SNPs associated with changes in rifampicin tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary table 3</xref> with references). This indicates mutations in multiple genes might affect rifampicin tolerance and growth fitness, since there was no one gene or genetic variant in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in multiple patients consistently associated with increased or decreased rifampicin tolerance, or that mutations may be epistatic with the genetic background of the strain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">We investigated rifampicin tolerance in a large number of clinical isolates of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.

We found that levels of rifampicin tolerance are widely distributed among isolates, with some genetically susceptible strains having similar susceptibility to rifampicin-mediated killing as <italic>bona fide</italic> rifampicin-resistant isolates, at least during the 5 days rifampicin exposure of our assay condition. Furthermore, IR isolates were more likely to harbor fast-growing subpopulations with high levels of rifampicin tolerance.</p><p id="P19">Heterogeneity in regrowth following stress has been linked to a tradeoff between growth fitness and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, and it is likely that in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> such diversification in growth rates among rifampicin-tolerant subpopulations represents such a balance between growth and persistence under antibiotic stress.</p><p id="P20">We also observed a variation in growth rate in the absence of antibiotic therapy. On average, IR isolates were slower growing than IS isolates, which likely represents a fitness cost due to isoniazid- resistance-causing mutations and strain genetic background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. As expected, IS isolates, with slower growth in the absence of drug had a weak association with high levels of rifampicin tolerance at the 15 day time point<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (representing rapidly growing recovered cells), whereas both IS and IR isolates with slower growth in the absence of drug were significantly associated with lesser rifampicin survival fraction levels at 60 days– representing slow growing rifampicin tolerant bacilli. These data suggest that slower growth (in absence of drug) in both isoniazid susceptible and resistant isolates, perhaps due to fitness cost of mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, may be associated with more persister-like tolerant subpopulations.</p><p id="P21">By contrast, the association between rifampicin MIC and rifampicin tolerance showed a contrasting trend with isoniazid susceptibility. IS isolates showed decreased tolerance with increase in rifampicin MIC, but IR isolates did not show this association. This may indicate higher growth fitness of IR with rifampicin tolerance. Another important finding from our study is the emergence of higher rifampicin tolerance and growth fitness in longitudinal IR isolates under rifampicin treatment selection. This further supports the findings that multiple genetic microvariants may co-exist in patient and rapidly change their proportion under selection from host stresses and antibiotic treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We also observed non-synonymous mutations in multiple genes, associated with persistence and host survival enriched with changes in rifampicin tolerance between the longitudinal isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary table 3</xref> with references). However, lack of convergent SNPs in the samples may be due to the relatively small sample size, interaction between SNPs and strain background or indication of a larger set of tolerance-related genes that independently affect bacterial growth and antibiotic tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">Our study also reveals novel aspects of rifampicin tolerance associated with isoniazid susceptibility. Rifampicin treatment itself led to the selection of IR <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genetic microvariants with high rifampicin tolerance and increased growth fitness in patients. The precise mechanisms underlying these phenotypes will require further investigation, but it is intriguing to note that different <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> lineages have varying liabilities for development of isoniazid resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, suggesting that clinical isolates may evolve diverse paths towards phenotypic drug resistance that impact fundamental bacterial physiology and tolerance to other antibiotics.</p><p id="P23">The wide range of observed rifampicin tolerance, spanning many orders of magnitude confirms findings of experimentally evolved drug tolerance to the laboratory isolate <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-H37Rv<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and extends our prior findings from a smaller-scale pilot study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Given that almost all rifampicin resistance is via mutations in <italic>rpoB</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, our findings suggest that first-line molecular testing for rifampicin susceptibility, which is replacing phenotypic drug susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, may not fully capture response to therapy. It needs to be further validated if these strains that are ‘hyper-tolerant’ to rifampicin are risk factors for poor clinical outcomes in IR-TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P24">Given the association of IR with the emergence of rifampicin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, our findings suggest a plausible mechanism by which isoniazid resistance, via rifampicin tolerance, acts as a ‘stepping stone’ to rifampicin resistance. The association between IR and rifampicin tolerance only held for fast-growing recovered bacteria. Given the observation that ‘growing’ rifampicin tolerant bacteria are over-represented after initiation of drug therapy in humans due to the specific regulation of <italic>rpoB</italic> in mycobacteria in response to rifampicin exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, this may represent a divergence between growing and non-replicating persister forms of antibiotic tolerance. A better understanding of which forms of tolerance contribute to clinically relevant response to therapy will be critical for tailoring individualized regimens for TB or improving treatment regimen for IR-TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">Our study has some limitations. We only assayed rifampicin tolerance under one standard axenic culture condition. It is known that antibiotic tolerance phenotypes vary considerably according to culture conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, with some phenotypes only emerging <italic>in vitro</italic> with specialized media, e.g. containing odd-chained fatty acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Secondly, contributors to antibiotic tolerance can be genetic, epigenetic or transient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and there is considerable epistasis between genetic variation and antibiotic susceptibility. Our assay will not be able to capture drivers of tolerance that have been lost in the collection, banking, freezing and reviving of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates. Finally, the isolates were from a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, and during the study period the old 8-month TB treatment regimen lacked rifampicin in the continuation phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">This study also reveals interesting aspects like fast and slow growing sub-populations and possible variation in lag-time distribution among clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates.
