Many studies show these motors are co-dependent, whereby one requires the activity of the other, although the mechanism is unknown. Here, using in vitro motility assays, we show that the kinesin-3 KIF1C acts both as an activator and a processivity factor for dynein. Activation only requires a fragment of the non-motor tail of KIF1C (KIF1C-stalk) to bind the cargo adaptor HOOK3. Cryo-EM, crosslinking mass spectrometry and AlphaFold2 predictions reveal this binding site to be separate from that of two constitutive factors (FTS and FHIP), which link HOOK3 to small G-proteins on cargos. We provide a structural model for how the FTS-HOOK3-FHIP1B (FHF) complex is auto-inhibited and explain how the KIF1C-stalk relieves this inhibition. Collectively, our work provides a molecular explanation for co-dependency by revealing that the mutual activation of dynein and kinesin is mediated through their shared adaptor. Many adaptors bind both dynein and kinesins, suggesting this mechanism could be generalised to other bidirectional complexes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The organisation of a cell’s content is central to its function. Long-range transport of membrane organelles depends on the opposing microtubule-based motors dynein and kinesin. Almost all cellular cargos move back and forth due to the simultaneous presence of both types of motor, a concept known as bidirectional transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Such an arrangement requires coordination between kinesin and dynein to prevent unproductive stalling and tug-of-war. A large body of evidence shows that opposite polarity motors also depend on each other during motility; diminishing either dynein or kinesin-1 activity leads to predominantly static organelles, lipid droplets and mRNA-protein complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. This phenomenon, referred to as co-dependence of antagonistic motors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, also occurs between dynein and kinesin-3s. For example, depletion of KIF1C reduces transport of integrin-containing vesicles to the same extent in both directions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and the retrograde transport of dense core vesicles is perturbed when the <italic>C. elegans</italic> KIF1A homologue Unc-104 is mutated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Although it is well established that dynein and kinesin require each other on cargos, the molecular mechanism of co-dependence remains unclear.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Dynein and KIF1C form a co-dependent complex scaffolded by HOOK3</title><p id="P3">Human cytoplasmic dynein is a weakly processive motor on its own<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, requiring a co-factor dynactin and a coiled-coil cargo adaptor for full activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Many of dynein’s activating cargo adaptors can also bind kinesins, including BICD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, BICDR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, HOOK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, TRAK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and JIP3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. HOOK3 is of particular interest as it has been recently shown to simultaneously recruit dynein/dynactin and the kinesin-3 motor KIF1C <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. To determine whether these opposite polarity motors show co-dependence, we reconstituted purified dynein/dynactin-HOOK3-KIF1C (DDHK) and analysed their motile behaviour using single molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope assays.</p><p id="P4">In the presence of all components, complexes undertook processive minus end (dynein-driven, 80%) or plus end-directed transport (kinesin-driven, 16%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-b</xref>). The observation of predominant minus end runs agrees with a previous study on this co-complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, we observe occasional switches in direction during runs (2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-c</xref>), reminiscent of bidirectional cargo movement in the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. This suggests that coupling opposite polarity motors via their adaptors supports processive unidirectional transport and prevents tug-of-war. This differs from artificial, DNA-linked systems where the motors resist each other’s movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">We noticed a significant increase in the dynein landing rate in the presence of full-length KIF1C (K<sub>FL</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-e</xref>), an effect which has not been previously described. This is mediated through HOOK3 and dynactin as omitting either of these factors abolishes dynein motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). To dissect the mechanism of this activation, we focused on a KIF1C stalk construct (GST-KIF1C<sup>642-922</sup>-GFP, K<sub>S</sub>) that does not contain the motor domain but includes the region required to bind HOOK3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Strikingly, dynein microtubule recruitment increases 2.6-fold in the presence of the KIF1C stalk construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-e</xref>), indicating that this region is sufficient for binding HOOK3 and activating the co-complex. A similar activating effect was observed vice versa; KIF1C landing rate on microtubules increased two-fold in the presence of dynein and dynactin (DDHK) compared to HOOK3-KIF1C (HK<sub>FL</sub>), even if the motor domain was omitted by using a dynein tail construct (D<sub>T</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-g</xref>). Dynactin alone is also sufficient to increase the KIF1C-HOOK3 landing rate, although to a lesser extent (1.4-fold compared to KIF1C-HOOK3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-g</xref>). Collectively, our results show that KIF1C and dynein can facilitate each other’s microtubule binding activity using their non-motor domains.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>FHF is an auto-inhibited cargo adaptor</title><p id="P6">In order to understand how this mutual activation is mediated, we investigated the regulation of the cargo adaptor. Unlike other cargo adaptors, HOOKs form a stable assembly with two other accessory factors, FTS and FHIP (FHF complex) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. However, the proposed binding sites of KIF1C and FTS-FHIP1B to HOOK3 are currently unclear beyond the adaptor’s C-terminal 165 residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. To address its unknown molecular organisation, we determined the structure of FHF by cryo-EM. Our 3.2 Å reconstruction of full-length FTS and FHIP1B in complex with a C-terminal HOOK3 fragment (residues 571-718) allowed an atomic model to be built for each subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). The cryo-EM structure shows that HOOK3 is integral to the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), explaining why FTS and FHIP cannot form a subcomplex on their own over gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). The interactions involve the last of HOOK3’s four coiled-coil domains (CC4) and a C-terminal extension (CTE), consisting of a flexible region followed by a single alpha helix (residues 694-702) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3g</xref>). The first anchor point (site 1) involves one of the CTEs, with the helix latching onto a hydrophobic pocket within FHIP1B. Site 2 comprises a span of HOOK3 CC4 residues (653-688), packing tightly against the FTS catalytically dead ubiquitin ligase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3h</xref>). At site 3, the opposite side of HOOK3 CC4 (spanning residues 663-670) binds a C-terminal alpha-helix on FTS. This helix is in a long loop (FTS “belt”) that wraps around HOOK3 before docking into a pocket on FHIP1B (FHIP “latch”) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3h-i</xref>). Together, these interactions mean that the extreme C-terminus of HOOK3 is buried within FHIP1B and FTS and cannot interact with cargo directly. Instead, the opposing face of FHIP1B comprises a highly conserved patch of surface-exposed residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>) that AlphaFold2 suggests is a binding site for small G-protein Rab5, which has been shown to link FHF to early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The location of this site means the adaptor is positioned to be extended away from the cargo.</p><p id="P7">Factors that bind the C-terminus of other adaptors, such as BICD2 and Spindly, are thought to activate them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. To investigate the activity of the full-length FHF cargo adaptor, we tested its ability to facilitate processive dynein movement in single molecule motility assays. We found that processive dynein-dynactin-FHF (DDFHF) complexes were formed 11-fold less efficiently than DDH complexes made with a constitutively active truncated HOOK3 construct (DDH<sup>1–522</sup>) (0.065 vs 0.75 processive events/μm/s, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d-e</xref>). These data suggest that FHF is in an auto-inhibited conformation and that FTS-FHIP1B binding do not activate HOOK3. In contrast, adding KIF1C stalk led to a ~3.7-fold increase in processive events compared to a DDFHF control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d-e</xref>). This confirms that KIF1C stalk activates HOOK3 also in the context of FHF.</p><p id="P8">To understand the FHF auto-inhibition at the structural level, we used cross-linking mass spectrometry and mapped the interactions within the full-length molecule. We found numerous crosslinks between the HOOK3 coiled-coil domains, with CC2 being in close proximity to CC3 and CC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig 5a</xref>). We mapped these crosslinks onto a model of full-length FHF, constructed by combining our cryo-EM model with three different and partially overlapping AlphaFold2 predicted segments of HOOK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig 5b</xref>). The crosslinking is consistent with a folded-back conformation of HOOK3, in line with other adaptors such as BICD2 and Spindly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. This inhibited configuration clashes with dynactin/dynein tail binding to HOOK3, which is a pre-requisite for motor activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig 5b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>KIF1C stalk binds FHF at a key regulatory site on HOOK3 to open up the adaptor</title><p id="P9">Next, we addressed how KIF1C stalk binds HOOK3 and interplays with FTS and FHIP1B at the molecular level. KIF1C is a stable dimer consisting of an N-terminal motor domain and a C-terminal tail. To obtain a full-length predicted structure of KIF1C, we stitched seven AlphaFold2 models together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig 6a</xref>). Our structure suggests there are three coiled-coils (here called CC1-CC3) interspersed with two globular domains. The kinesin-3 specific forkhead-associated (FHA) domain sits between CC1 and CC2. The second region, between CC2 and CC3 was not previously known to be globular and we therefore refer to this whole folded region as the stalk globular domain (SGD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-b</xref>). The KIFC stalk we used in our experiments encompasses CC2, the SGD and CC3. Adding this KIF1C stalk to FHF in gel-filtration assays revealed that a stable complex can be reconstituted, indicating the binding sites for FTS-FHIP1B and KIF1C stalk do not overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). We used mass photometry to measure the molecular weight of the complex as ~434 kDa, which is close to the predicted molecular weight of one FHF and one dimeric KIF1C stalk (430 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To map the binding sites more precisely, we used cryo-EM on a shorter KIF1C-stalk construct (674-922) bound to an FHF containing HOOK3 residues 451-718 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7c</xref>). We observed extra density corresponding to the KIF1C stalk at the hinge between HOOK3 CC3 and CC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), although the resolution was low due to flexibility of this part of HOOK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8a-c</xref>). We therefore used AlphaFold2 to screen pairwise interactions of sequential dimeric KIF1C fragments (in 120-residue increments) against a dimer of HOOK3 encompassing CC3 and CC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8d</xref>). This identified part of KIF1C’s SGD and CC3 as the top hit (residues 722-840, hereafter HOOK3 binding domain [H3BD]). The resulting AlphaFold2 model showed it binding HOOK3 at a position which matches the extra density in our cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c, d</xref>). In further support of this assignment, deleting the H3BD from the KIF1C stalk abolished its interaction with HOOK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7d</xref>). The inverse is also true as FHF with a truncated HOOK3 (629-718), which lacks the kinesin binding site, no longer bound to the KIF1C stalk H3BD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7e</xref>). Furthermore, cross-linking mass spectrometry revealed numerous crosslinks from H3BD to the HOOK3 CC3-CC4 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8e</xref>). Overall our mapping studies showed that the KIF1C stalk H3BD mainly binds FHF within HOOK3 (residues 607-632), which is non-overlapping with the FTS and FHIP1B binding sites HOOK3 (residues 663-718).</p><p id="P11">We noted that KIF1C binding to HOOK3 is in close proximity to the inhibitory interaction between HOOK3’s CC2 and CC3-CC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8f</xref>). Therefore, KIF1C binding might disrupt the auto-inhibited form of FHF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). To test this directly, we used pull-down experiments using a Strep-tagged FHF containing a C-terminal HOOK3 fragment (FH<sup>C</sup>F). In the absence of KIF1C stalk, this bound an N-terminal fragment of HOOK3 (H<sup>N</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>), which further supports our model that FHF is inhibited by CC2 folding back to contact CC3-CC4. When we added KIF1C stalk, we found it reduced H<sup>N</sup> binding relative to background binding of H<sup>N</sup> control. In contrast, a KIF1C stalk lacking the H3BD was not able to bind FHF or displace H<sup>N</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). These data suggest that KIF1C stalk can shift the equilibrium towards an open configuration of HOOK3 and relieve FHF auto-inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>KIF1C acts as a processivity factor for dynein</title><p id="P12">Finally, we asked why it might be advantageous for KIF1C to bind dynein-dynactin-FHF. It could be a passive passenger using dynein to efficiently relocate to the cell centre, or alternatively could directly affect some aspect of dynein’s movement. To address this, we compared the motility parameters of complexes containing dynein, dynactin and HOOK3 to those co-assembled with either KIF1C stalk or full-length KIF1C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We found that the speed of minus-end directed runs is slightly decreased when the motor domain of KIF1C is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This suggests that KIF1C engages with the microtubule when dynein drives the motility of the complex. We found both the duration motor complexes stay on the microtubule (“dwell time”) and the run length of dynein-driven motility increase by about 50% when the KIF1C motor is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c-d</xref>). This suggests that KIF1C acts as a processivity factor for dynein and thereby stimulates the function of the opposite polarity motor.</p><p id="P13">Analysis of kinesin driven motility indicated that the duration of plus end-directed runs was unchanged, but both speed and run length decreased moderately when the dynein motor domain was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e-g</xref>). This suggests dynein is engaged with the microtubule during KIF1C-driven runs. However, despite interacting with the microtubules, neither KIF1C nor dynein cause stalling during opposite polarity runs when they are coupled via HOOK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). The increased processivity of dynein in the presence of KIF1C is another mechanism by which motor co-dependence occurs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S8"><title>A general mechanism for co-dependence?</title><p id="P14">Previously, several models were proposed to explain co-dependence of opposite polarity motors: mechanical activation, steric disinhibition and microtubule tethering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Our data provide evidence for two of those mechanisms occurring sequentially: Firstly, dynein and kinesin relieve the inhibited state of their opposing counterpart to increase landing rates on microtubules (steric disinhibition model). Once dynein-mediated transport is initiated, KIF1C remains in a weak microtubule binding state, preventing detachment of cargo from the microtubule (microtubule tethering model).</p><p id="P15">The initially proposed steric disinhibition model envisioned that both motors directly interact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, here we propose that disinhibition instead occurs through regulating the scaffolding adaptor HOOK3. This explains why the motor domains of KIF1C and dynein are dispensable for reciprocal activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d-e</xref>). Although not yet formally tested, our described mechanism of motor co-dependence may be applicable to other adaptor-scaffolded ensembles. For example, KIF1C has also been shown to bind dynein via BICDR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> or BICD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. These adaptors recruit dynein via their N-termini<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> and are thought to bind KIF1C at their C-termini<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, akin to HOOK3 co-complexes. More recently, studies in filamentous fungi suggest that auto-inhibited kinesin-1 facilitates HookA-mediated dynein transport of endosomal cargo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. It is compelling to compare these examples to adaptors where dynein and kinesin bind at overlapping sites, such as for TRAK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> or JIP3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In these cases, do motors still reciprocally activate through the adaptor?</p><p id="P16">We focused on KIF1C’s activation of dynein as the majority of the movement we observed was minus-end directed and because the network of interactions between KIF1C and FHF were previously elusive. However, we suggest activation of KIF1C movement by dynein may occur in the same way. Previous structural work showed that the HOOK3 N-terminus runs the length of dynactin and contacts the dynein light intermediate chains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. We also showed that the pointed end of dynactin alone can bind the adaptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. At sufficiently high local concentrations of dynein-dynactin, these contacts could alleviate HOOK3 inhibition to expose the C-terminus for KIF1C binding. Indeed, our structural modelling suggests that dynein-dynactin binding would disrupt the intramolecular interactions in FHF and we observed higher KIF1C-HOOK3 recruitment to microtubules both in the presence of the full and partial dynein machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-g</xref>).</p><p id="P17">What is the benefit of reciprocal motor activation? The pre-requisite of having kinesin activate dynein movement (and vice versa) ensures the presence of both motors on cargo before effective transport can occur. This also means that the non-driving motor, in its weak microtubule binding state, is available to act as a processivity factor. In addition, the non-driving motor could respond to cellular cues and obstacles to trigger a directional switch in a timely manner. Finally, ensuring both motors are present would also be an efficient mechanism for motor recycling so that they are available at their respective start points<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>FHF is an autoinhibited adaptor to ensure regulated dual-motor binding</title><p id="P18">Our cryo-EM structure of FHF revealed a complex that is held together by a small region of the HOOK3 C-terminus. While all HOOK family members (HOOK1-3) bind FTS, there is evidence they show preference for different FHIP isoforms (FHIP1A, 1B, 2A and 2B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. The universal nature of the FTS interaction is due to a highly conserved EEKxxxSAWYN motif found in all HOOK proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>). This motif is present on both sides of the coiled-coil and interacts with FTS at sites 2 and 3. Consistent with this motif being important, mutations in it abolish HOOK1 binding to FTS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">Site 1 forms the only point of contact between HOOK3 and FHIP1B. Surprisingly, the CTE helix, found at this site, is also highly conserved between HOOK family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>). This suggests that HOOK-FHIP specificity is either mediated by the preceding CTE loop, which varies in sequence and length among HOOKs, or by another mechanism such as specific co-translation of selected mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. To test the former model, we co-expressed HOOK2 or HOOK3 with different combinations of their preferred FHF partners (FTS+FHIP2A and FTS+FHIP1B respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. We found all combinations produced stable FHF complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10c-d</xref>) suggesting there can be only subtle specificity based on sequence alone. Thus, we favour the hypothesis that FHF specificity is driven by a cell-based mechanism.</p><p id="P20">Other adaptors use their C-terminus to directly bind small G-proteins which tether them to their membrane cargos and activate them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. HOOK3, in contrast, is likely to bind its small G-protein (Rab5) via a site on FHIP1B that is well separated from the coiled-coil. This suggests FHF is recruited to its endosome cargo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> in its inhibited conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>, step 1). Once bound to cargo, we propose FHF binds KIF1C’s stalk (step 2), leading to a partial opening of HOOK3 that allows dynein/dynactin recruitment (step 3). As the KIF1C stalk does not induce DDFHF motility to the same level as the truncated HOOK3 control, it is possible that other, as yet unidentified, factors are required for full adaptor opening and activation.</p><p id="P21">Our data suggest that KIF1C is partially engaged with the microtubules during dynein-driven movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>, step 3). This explains how the presence of KIF1C can reduce dynein’s velocity but not stall it as it would if it were fully engaged. Our previous optical trapping experiments showed that KIF1C tends to slip backwards under load rather than fully detach from the microtubule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. This would potentially allow KIF1C to act as a processivity factor. However, it is unlikely that the biophysical properties of the motor alone is sufficient to explain the absence of tug-of-war in DDHK complexes, because the related kinesin-3 KIF1A has an even higher propensity for backslipping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, but when truncated KIF1A was coupled to dynein using a DNA-based linker, the majority of complexes showed little net velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Comparing the plus end-directed movement of DDHK complexes containing full-length dynein with those assembled with the dynein tail (D<sub>T</sub>DHK), shows a moderate reduction in speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). This indicates that dynein is also in a conformation that causes resistance but does not stall plus-end movement. A fully engaged dynein-dynactin-HOOK3 complex has an average stall force of about 5 pN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, whereas only 1 pN resisting force is needed to reduce KIF1C velocity by half<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Therefore, during plus end-directed runs of DDHK complexes, dynein engages only weakly with microtubules to keep the resisting force below 1 pN, which is about half of the stall force of a dynein dimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">Several recent studies on adaptor-mediated dual-motor complexes also showed motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. This suggests that the linkage between dynein and the opposing kinesin is crucial for the synergy of the motors. Therefore, the compliance of the cargo-adaptor-mediated linkage, steric constraints through dynactin, additional interactions or conformational changes within the DDHK complex might enable the cooperation of KIF1C and dynein. Our reconstituted system and structural insights into the engagement of both motors with the adaptor will make it possible to start to reveal these mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cloning of protein expression constructs</title><p id="P23">Insect expression vector pFastBacM13-8xHis-ZZ-LTLT-HOOK3-SNAPf was made by amplifying HOOK3 from a human cDNA library by PCR using oligonucleotides AS689 (ACATAggcgcgccctATGTTCAGCGTAGAGTCGCT G) which encoded a 5’ AscI site and AS691 (ACAATaaccggtggatcCCTTGCTGTGGCCGGCTG), which introduced a 3’ AgeI/BamHI site.

A python analysis software package reads the saved tracks and classifies and summarised the motility parameters (run length, dwell times, run speeds, landing rates and directionality) at the single motor level, the per-microtubule level, the per-movie level and the per-experiment level. To do this, paths were segmented into runs. A run was defined as the distance covered before falling static (having an absolute speed of less than 25 nm/s), or the distance covered before changing direction (having a speed of more than 25 nm/s in one direction and then a speed of more than 25 nm/s in the opposite direction). For each segment of the path, it was determined whether this segment was going towards the plus- or minus-end of the microtubule, or whether the motor was paused, and the time spent in each mode of transport was tallied. The total time a motor spend on the microtubule was its dwell time. The total run length in the plus- or minus-end direction was also tallied for the individual runs within the track. The total run length was defined as the sum of the absolute values of all individual runs for one motor. The average speed of a particle was defined as the total run length divided by the total dwell time. The landing rate was calculated as the number of tracks per kymograph width (in nm) and length (in s) and converted to μm•min<sup>-1</sup> by multiplying with 60,000. The overall directionality of a track was defined in the following way. Firstly, any track with a total runlength of less than 1000 nm was classified as ”static”. Any remaining track that travelled only towards the plus-end was classified as ”plus end-directed”, while any track that travelled only towards the minus-end was classified as ”minus end-directed”. Any track that travelled more than 1,500 nm in the plus- and minus- end directions was classified as ”bidirectional”. After this classification, any remaining track that travelled more towards the plus- than the minus-end was labelled ”plus end-directed”, while the opposite was labelled ” minus end-directed”. Therefore a track that travelled 20,000 nm in the minus-end direction and 200 nm in the plus- end direction would still be classified as ”minus end-directed”.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Statistical analysis of motility of HOOK3-containing complexes</title><p id="P41">Statistical analyses were performed in Python with use of the following modules: scipy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> and scikit-posthocs.

These particles were extracted (bin2, giving a pixel size of 2.16-2.18 Å/pixel depending on the camera).

For datasets 1+2 (total: 2,507,930 particles), particles were subjected to unmasked 3D classification (5 classes) with alignment using an ab-initio generated initial model of FHF. The best class was selected (1,012,409 particles) and a global 3D refinement was performed, yielding an overall 4.8 Å resolution structure. This was Bayesian polished and re-refined, leading to an improved 4.5 Å resolution structure. At this point, particles were re-extracted unbinned and subjected to a round of masked 3D classification without alignment. This gave two good classes, which were selected (781,492) for subsequent merging with dataset 3 particles.</p><p id="P50">Dataset 3 was processed as follows. 2,368,723 extracted particles were used for cleaning steps using 2D classification. 1,232,461 particles were taken forward for unmasked 3D classification with alignment and the best class selected (723,461 particles) was subjected to 3D refinement (using global search parameters), giving a 4.4 Å structure. Dataset 3 particles were then re-rextracted to their unbinned parameters (256 box size, 1.09 Å/pix). The unbinned particles were used for a local 3D refinement, resulting in a 3.7 Å structure. Bayesian polishing was performed using this unbinned, consensus refinement, which improved the subsequent 3D refinement to 3.3 Å resolution. However, the structure was highly anisotropic at this point. To reduce anisotropy in the map, a combination of StarParser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/sami-chaaban/starparser">https://github.com/sami-chaaban/starparser</ext-link>) and RELION’s subset select tool was used to remove overrepresented views. StarParser was used to plot a histogram of the rlnAngleRot values from the 3D refinement particles.star file. Based on this visualisation, the rlnAngleRot values were split into different bins using RELION’s subset selection (metadata label: rlnAnglRot), e.g. angles that fill in within -140 to 100 and between 100 to 200. This generated two particles star files. The latter star file (100-200 rlnAngleRot) had the majority of overrepresented views and this was subjected to random extraction of ~50% of particles to reduce the overrepresentation. The output star file was then combined with the unmodified first star file (-140-100 rlnAngle) (Join star files in RELION) and duplicate particles were removed (Subset selection tool).</p><p id="P51">At this point, datasets 1+2 and dataset 3 particles were merged and a new consensus refinement was obtained of the merged dataset (total particles: 1,207,965) at 3.4 Å resolution.

The class with the highest resolution features and most complete density was selected, giving 377,595 particles. As the overall structure still showed anisotropy at this point, the reduce anisotropy procedure described above was employed at this point. 273,204 particles were subsequently taken forward to 3D refinement, CTF refinement (defocus and astigmatism), 3D refinement, Ctf refinement (magnification anisotropy) before a final 3D refinement.
