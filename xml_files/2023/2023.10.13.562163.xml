However, our current understanding of the complex transcriptional mechanisms that dictate their gene expression during infection is limited to a handful of model phages. Here, we applied ONT-cappable-seq to reveal the transcriptional architecture of six different clades of virulent phages infecting <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. This long-read microbial transcriptomics approach is tailored to globally map transcription start and termination sites, transcription units and putative RNA-based regulators on dense phage genomes. Specifically, the full-length transcriptomes of LUZ19, LUZ24, 14-1, YuA, PAK_P3 and giant phage phiKZ during early, middle and late infection were collectively charted. Beyond pinpointing traditional promoter and terminator elements and transcription units, these transcriptional profiles provide insights in transcriptional attenuation and splicing events and allow straightforward validation of Group I intron activity. In addition, ONT-cappable-seq data can guide genome-wide discovery of novel regulatory element candidates, including non-coding RNAs and riboswitches. This work substantially expands the number of annotated phage-encoded transcriptional elements identified to date, shedding light on the intricate and diverse gene expression regulation mechanisms in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> phages, which can ultimately be sourced as tools for biotechnological applications in phage and bacterial engineering.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>nanopore sequencing</kwd><kwd>bacteriophages</kwd><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></kwd><kwd>transcription regulation</kwd><kwd>regulatory RNAs</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, are the most abundant biological entities on our planet.

However, RNA-seq generally lacks the capacity to distinguish between primary and processed transcripts, which obscures the discovery of key transcriptional initiation and termination events at the original 5’ and 3’ boundaries of primary transcripts.

PAO1 was used to amplify phages LUZ19, YuA, 14-1 and phiKZ. Alternatively, phages PAK_P3 and LUZ24 were amplified on host strains PAK and Li010, respectively. For phage amplification, the bacterial host was grown to early exponential phase (optical density of OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.3) and infected with a high-titer lysate of the appropriate phage. Following overnight incubation at 37°C, the phage lysate was purified and concentrated using polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG8000) precipitation.

For this, High-molecular weight genomic DNA (gDNA) of Li010 was extracted using the DNeasy UltraClean Microbial Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Afterwards, the DNA sample was prepared using the Illumina DNA prep kit (Illumina, USA) and sequenced on an Illumina MiniSeq device.

Briefly, TSSs were identified by finding genomic positions with a local maxima of 5’ read ends using a peak calling algorithm. Afterwards, for each peak position, the enrichment ratio was calculated by dividing the read count per million mapped reads (RPM) in the enriched sample by the corresponding RPM in the control sample. Peak positions that surpassed the enrichment ratio threshold (T<sub>TSS</sub>) and had at least 30 reads starting at that position in the enriched sample, followed by manual curation, were annotated as a TSS.

RNAfold (v2.4.13) was used to predict and calculate the secondary structure and minimum free energy of the annotated terminator regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lorenz <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Finally, transcription units (TUs) for each phage were delineated by adjacent TSS and TTS annotated on the same strand, upon validating that at least one ONT-cappable-seq read spans the candidate TU.

As such, comparative transcriptomics between the enriched and control samples allows discrimination between transcription start sites (TSSs) and processed 5’ ends. In addition, full-length transcriptional profiling by ONT-cappable-seq can discover transcription termination sites (TTS), as primary transcripts are more likely to have their original 3’ end intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Yan <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Putzeys <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>). For each individual phage, cellular transcripts from multiple infection stages were pooled prior to library preparation, after which the resulting enriched and control samples (n = 12) were multiplexed and sequenced on a PromethION device, generating 0.7-22 million reads per sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Using this approach, we obtained comprehensive transcriptional maps of taxonomically distinct phages 14-1 (66.2 kb), LUZ19 (43.5 kb), LUZ24 (45.6 kb), PAK_P3 (88.1 kb), YuA (58.7 kb) and phiKZ (280.3 kb), shedding light on their distinct transcriptional patterns and architectures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).

Collectively, we identified a total of 320 TSS spread across the genomes of 14-1 (50), LUZ24 (16), LUZ19 (9), PAK_P3 (75), YuA (21), and phiKZ (149) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). To assess whether the promoters encoded on phages that rely exclusively on the host transcription apparatus are similar to canonical σ70 promoters, the -50 to +1 regions upstream the annotated TSSs were analysed using the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> promoter prediction tool SAPPHIRE.CNN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Coppens and Lavigne 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Coppens, Wicke and Lavigne 2022</xref>).

Based on ONT-cappable-seq data, we identified five strong promoters (LUZ19 P002-P006) near the leftmost region of the Watson strand of the LUZ19 genome, located upstream of gene <italic>gp0.1</italic>, consistent with the T7-archetypal transcriptional scheme. All but one of these promoters show significant sequence similarity to the characteristic bacterial promoter consensus, confirming the host-dependent transcription program of LUZ19 at the early infection stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lavigne <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). In addition, we identified four promoter sequences that share a highly conserved 20bp motif 5’-GgtTATGTCACacACAnnGG-3’ (lowercase letters represent lower level of conservation) (E-value = 3.4e-011), which is likely specifically recognised by the LUZ19 RNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Two of the phage-specific LUZ19 promoters (P007-P008) are positioned directly downstream of the RNAP gene, while another one is located in the structural region (P009), in agreement with the promoter locations reported in phiKMV-like phage KP34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Lu <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>). However, interestingly, one of the phage-specific LUZ19 promoters (P001) is located on the opposite orientation of the coding sequences of the phage, which are generally found exclusively on the Watson strand. The antisense transcripts that originate from this promoter extend all the way towards the rightmost end of the genome, overlapping with structural genes <italic>gp47-gp49</italic>. One may hypothesize that this antisense transcription from phage-specific promoter P001 in the middle/late infection stage could play a role in preventing transcription elongation to early genes on the circularised phage genome.</p><p id="P21">Based on the promoter motif found in LUZ19, we assessed whether we could pinpoint the phage-specific promoters of other <italic>Phikmvviru</italic>s phage relatives infecting <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, which have proven challenging to identify in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Ceyssens <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lavigne <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>).

Indeed, all phages contained almost identical 20 bp motifs at genomic positions that match the corresponding phage-specific promoters observed in LUZ19, including an antisense promoter in the early genomic region. This finding highlights a near perfect conservation of the sequence and genomic distribution of single-subunit RNAP promoters among the <italic>Phikmvviru</italic>s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Notably, compared to T7-like phages, these viruses seemingly harbour a relatively small number of phage-specific promoters that are spread across the genome, suggesting that phiKMV-like phage transcription might be sustained by long-range processivity of RNAPs.</p><p id="P22">Finally, the transcriptional program of the giant <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> phage phiKZ is host-independent and relies exclusively on two distinct phage-encoded RNAPs. Upon infection, the phage co-injects its DNA along with a virion RNAP, which initiates transcription from 32 early phage promoters with a AT-rich consensus element, as revealed by primer extensions and (differential) RNA-seq profiling of PAO1 cells infected with phiKZ [23], [26]. Among the 149 phiKZ TSS and promoters identified by ONT-cappable-seq data, we recovered 16 AT-rich early promoters that were described previously, and find two additional promoters that share the phiKZ early promoter motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). PhiKZ middle and late genes are transcribed by the non-virion-associated RNAP (nvRNAP), encoded among the phiKZ early genes.

Using ONT-cappable-seq, we identified numerous promoters of 14-1, PAK_P3, and LUZ19 predicted to be recognised by the host transcriptional apparatus. As an experimental validation, the activity of a subset of promoters from 14-1, PAK_P3 and LUZ19 was evaluated <italic>in vivo</italic> using a fluorescence expression assay. For this, phage promoters were cloned in front of a standardised ribosome binding site (RBS) and a green fluorescent reporter protein (monomeric superfolder green fluorescent protein, msfGFP) gene, after which the genetic constructs were transformed to both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, we created a construct without a promoter element (pEmpty) and a construct with the strong Pem7 constitutive promoter to serve as a negative and positive control, respectively. Interestingly, all σ70-like phage-encoded promoters (14-1 P001, P018, P036, P038; PAK_P3 P033, P034, P064, P067, P075; LUZ19 P002-P005), predicted by SAPPHIRE.CNN, are able to drive significant expression of the msfGFP reporter gene in <italic>E. coli</italic>, compared the negative control (Wilcoxon test, p&lt;0.05), even though the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of PAK_P3 promoters P067 and P075 is limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). These data further validate the accuracy and efficacy of the SAPPHIRE.CNN tool. In addition, in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the majority of the host-specific phage promoters outperform the Pem7 control promoter, which is routinely used in microbial synthetic biology applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Zobel <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). Unlike the phage-encoded promoters that resemble the canonical bacterial promoter consensus sequence, 14-1 promoters P011 and P032, and LUZ19 promoter P006 do not seem to drive transcription in <italic>E. coli</italic>, as no significant fluorescent signal could be observed. Instead, P011 and P032 contain the alternative promoter motif found in 14-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, lower motif) and no motif could be associated with LUZ19 P006. Our results suggest that additional phage-encoded transcriptional factors might be required for gene expression regulation from these promoters. Given that gp12 of 14-1 is thought to redirect the bacterial RNAP towards phage-specific promoters by interacting with the RNAP α-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bossche <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>), P011 and P032 might rely on gp12 for transcription initiation, although this requires further investigation (unpublished results). Alternatively, other host-encoded factors, which are only expressed at specific phage-induced conditions, might also be needed for the activity of 14-1 P011, 14-1 P032 and LUZ19 P006. Finally, the majority of the promoters included in this fluorescence assay behave similarly in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and in <italic>E. coli</italic>, displaying significant msfGFP expression exclusively for the σ70-like promoters (14-1 P001, P018, P036, P038; PAK_P3 P033, P064, P067; LUZ19 P005-P006) (Wilcoxon test, p&lt;0.05), although no <italic>in vivo</italic> data could be gathered for LUZ19 P002-P004, PAK_P3 P034 and P075 in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).

This way, we located a total of 268 distinct transcription termination regions across the six phage genomes (14-1 (14), LUZ19 (18), LUZ24 (26), YuA (34), PAK_P3 (43), phiKZ (133)), validating 54 terminators that were predicted previously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Analysis of the -60 to +40 regions flanking the TTSs revealed that most of the phage terminators are prone to form energetically stable secondary structures upon transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). In general, there are two main prokaryotic transcription termination mechanisms: intrinsic termination and factor-dependent termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Roberts 2019</xref>). Among the identified phage terminators, 84 were predicted by ARNold to be intrinsic, factor-independent transcription terminators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Naville <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>), characterised by a canonical GC-rich hairpin structure followed by a polyuridine stretch. Interestingly, the vast majority of predicted intrinsic terminator sequences are encoded by phiKZ (&gt;70%) and display a conserved nucleotide motif with a distinct stem-loop structure followed by a 5’-TTAT-3’ region (5’-B<underline>CCYCCCC</underline>HWWD<underline>GGGRRGG</underline>BYTTATKYYGT-3’, hairpin underlined, E-value = 1.7e-212), suggesting a shared mode of action at the RNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Most of the termination sites either reside in intergenic regions (63%) or in a neighbouring gene sequence downsteam (28%). The remaining phage terminators (9%) are located in antisense orientation relative to the genes encoded on the phage genome. We find that the distances between the transcription termination siginals and the stop codon of the preceding gene varies extensively among all phages, although the length of most 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTRs) does not exceed 100 nt (58.2%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). In addition, seven overlapping bidirectional transcriptional terminator regions were discovered in the genomes of phiKZ (6) and PAK_P3 (1).

Depending on the number of genes the TU encompasses, 134 (25.8%) and 257 (49.5%) TUs were classified as monocistronic or polycistronic, respectively. The remaining TUs (24.7%) did not fully span any genomic feature annotated on the phage genomes. On average, the TUs of LUZ19 and 14-1 are 0.8-1.2 kb and cover between one and two genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The TUs of YuA and LUZ24 are seemingly shorter (average TU length 483-722 bp), and do not encode more than two or three genes, respectively.

In addition, the gene content of the phage TUs shows significant overlap, sharing at least one or more genes between individual TUs. In the case of 14-1 (52%), phiKZ (67%) and PAK_P3 (77%), the majority of genes in the defined TUs are transcribed in at least two different transcriptional contexts, which represents the number of unique gene combinations encoded by the TUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Yan <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>).

For example, the sequence of the short RNA species identified upstream the PAK_P3 DNA primase/helicase gene (<italic>gp49</italic>) (fragment 31147-31308(+)), is also found upstream of the corresponding gene in other <italic>Nankokuvirus</italic> members, including KPP10 (NC_015272.2) and P3_CHA (KC862296.1) (BLASTN &gt;90% identity, E-value &lt; 2e-65) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Similarly, a ncRNA candidate of YuA (39396-39519(+)) is located in the 5’UTR of the phage major head protein gene (<italic>gp56</italic>) and shows sequence conservation to the upstream region of the equivalent gene in <italic>Yuavirus</italic> relatives, such as M6 and LKO4 (BLASTN &gt;97%, E-value &lt; 5e-57). In conclusion, our results indicate that this technique provides the means to identify novel ncRNA candidates at a genome-wide scale, as well as offering clues towards their biogenesis.</p><p id="P31">Previous standard RNA-sequencing experiments of PAK_P3 predicted two putative ncRNAs, named ncRNA1 (89 nt) and ncRNA2 (132 nt), which were highly expressed during the late infection stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Chevallereau <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). Using ONT-cappable-seq, we recovered both RNA species and refined their transcriptional boundaries with single nucleotide precision (ncRNA1: 85,248-85,458(+); ncRNA2: 86,307-86,426(+)). In addition, both RNA species lack an associated TSS, suggesting they are derived from extensive processing of the 3’UTR of the upstream gene. This also becomes apparent when comparing the PAK_P3 ONT-cappable-seq data tracks of the enriched and control datasets. These indicate that the small RNA species are predominantly present in the control dataset, which mainly contains processed transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S5-S6</xref>). These results are in agreement with northern blot probing of ncRNA1 and ncRNA2, displaying several processed intermediates and a highly abundant RNA species of ˜210 nt and ˜120 nt in length, respectively, of which the signal becomes stronger over the course of infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S5-S6</xref>). In addition to pointing out putative 5’UTR- and 3’UTR-derived ncRNAs, ONT-cappable-seq reveals twenty phage-encoded antisense RNA species of varying lengths with a defined TSS (LUZ19 (2), LUZ24 (2), YuA (4), PAK_P3 (8), phiKZ (4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Among these, seven can be associated with anti-sense transcripts discovered in PAK_P3 by previous RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Chevallereau <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). Collectively, these results illustrate the potential of ONT-cappable-seq to finetune transcript annotation and discern novel RNA species that were previously overlooked by classic RNA-seq experiments. We envision that further functional studies on this extensive set of antisense transcripts and putative ncRNAs can offer valuable insights in their regulatory role and importance during phage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bloch <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Full-length transcriptional profiling enables straightforward detection of splicing activity</title><p id="P32">Group I introns, intervening sequences capable of self-splicing, are widespread in the genomes of bacteria and phages, including <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> phage LUZ24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ceyssens <italic>et al</italic>. 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lavigne and Vandersteegen 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hausner, Hafez and Edgell 2014</xref>). The LUZ24 intron interrupts the coding sequence of the phage DNA polymerase, and restores the reading frame upon excision from the corresponding primary transcripts. The presence of bacteriophage group I introns is generally predicted from genomic surveys, and can be subsequently confirmed after PCR amplification of the cDNA. Given that ONT-cappable-seq allows full-length cDNA sequencing, we evaluated whether this intron can also be detected in our global transcriptome data of LUZ24. Indeed, visual inspection of the phage transcriptome data showed a considerable number of transcripts that lack the 669-bp fragment (19,143-19,811) which matches the Group I intron embedded in the DNA polymerase of LUZ24, confirming its <italic>in vivo</italic> splicing activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). In addition, the relative number of spliced cDNA read alignments in this region is significantly lower in the sample enriched for primary transcripts (0.03%) compared to the control sample which was predominantly composed of processed transcripts (0.9%), as expected. Previous studies demonstrated that environmental cues can impact group I intron splicing efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Sandegren and Sjöberg 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Belfort 2017</xref>). The observed occurrence of both spliced and unspliced cDNA is consistent with the experimental design in which multiple timepoints have been pooled, also hinting at condition-dependent splicing events. In addition, the full-length 669-bp fragment is relatively more abundant in the enriched dataset, representing 46.5% of the mapped reads in this region, compared to the control sample (1%). This suggests that its 5’ end holds a triphosphate group, which is enriched for during library preparation. Indeed, group I intron splicing is initiated through hydrophilic attack of the 5’ splice site by a free guanosine-5’-triphosphate, the latter of which is subsequently linked to the 5’ end of the intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cech 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hausner, Hafez and Edgell 2014</xref>). Based on these data, it should be noted that the 5’ and 3’ ends associated with this fragment most likely do not represent genuine TSS (LUZ24 P011) and TTS (LUZ4 T016), respectively (highlighted in red in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables S3-S5</xref>). Previous genomic analysis of phiKZ also predicted the presence of Group I intron-containing endonucleases in the genes encoding gp56, gp72 and gp179 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Mesyanzhinov <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>). However, careful surveillance of the phiKZ full-length transcriptional landscape did not provide evidence to support this hypothesized self-splicing activity under the growth conditions tested here.</p><p id="P33">In contrast, ONT-cappable-seq data revealed a considerable number of spliced cDNA reads in another LUZ24 gene, <italic>gp2</italic>. LUZ24 gp2 is a conserved hypothetical protein that was shown to be non-inhibitory in terms of host growth and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Wagemans <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). More specifically, a 34-bp fragment (1,659-1,692) appears to be removed near the 3’ end of 3.9% and 4.3% of the cDNA reads aligned to <italic>gp2</italic> in the enriched and control transcriptomic samples of LUZ24, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, we identified four ‘CAAGG’ repeats, paired two by two, at the boundaries of the spliced sequence. The pairs reside 16-bp from each other and the repeats in each pair lie seven base pairs apart. Moreover, the five nucleotides immediately downstream the intron sequence (AACTG) are identical to the 5’ sequence of the excised fragment. Manual inspection of individual reads indicated high mapping accuracy, which supports the hypothesis that the spliced cDNA reads are biologically relevant, and not the result of alignment errors due to error-prone nanopore reads. In addition, PCR of first-strand cDNA derived from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells infected with LUZ24, followed by gel electrophoresis, reveals the presence of a smaller, less intense fragment, suggesting that a short, intervening sequence is removed from a portion of the transcripts throughout infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). Although the molecular underpinnings of this short intervening sequence remain to be uncovered, these findings demonstrate that ONT-cappable-seq can be a valuable strategy to confirm, identify and elucidate splicing events in bacteriophages, and could readily be extended to their bacterial hosts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Conclusions &amp; perspectives</title><p id="P34">In the last decade, classic RNA sequencing has been the main method to profile the transcriptional landscape of phage-infected bacteria, providing insights in temporal gene expression levels and host responses. However, these short-read methods are generally not suited to gain in-depth knowledge of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms involved in phage infection, as they lack the ability to differentiate between primary and processed transcripts and information on transcript continuity is lost. By contrast, differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) performs differential treatment of the RNA sample with 5’P-dependent terminator exonuclease (TEX) to enrich primary transcripts prior to short-read sequencing, and is considered the golden standard for global prokaryotic TSS mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Sharma <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Sharma and Vogel 2014</xref>). Alternatively, Cappable-seq is based on targeted enrichment for the 5’-PPP end of primary transcripts, followed by Illumina sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ettwiller <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). Here, we applied ONT-cappable-seq to profile the full-length primary transcriptomes of a diverse set of lytic phages infecting <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Using this method, we pinpointed key regulatory elements that mark the start and end of transcription and delineated transcription units across the genomes of LUZ19, LUZ24, YuA, 14-1, PAK_P3 and phiKZ, significantly refining their transcriptional maps and highlighting the extensive diversity and complexity of transcriptional strategies across <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> phages. Compared to dRNA-seq, which has been applied to map early TSSs of phiKZ at single-nucleotide resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Wicke <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>), we demonstrated extensive overlap with the phiKZ TSSs defined by ONT-cappable-seq, with a positional difference limited to 2 nt. Furthermore, we find that individual phage TUs are highly interconnected, suggesting that alternative TU usage might be a widespread regulatory strategy in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> phages to balance and finetune gene expression levels in their densely coded genomes in response to different stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lee <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Putzeys <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">2023</xref>). In bacteria, 5’UTR conditional premature transcription is an important regulatory mechanism to modulate gene expression levels under different environmental stressors and conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Merino and Yanofsky 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adams <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Konikkat <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). ONT-cappable-seq data of the different phages also revealed numerous 5’UTR premature transcription termination events, pointing to 29 potential phage-encoded 5’UTR-derived ncRNA candidates, two of which were previously detected by phiKZ dRNA-seq and grad-seq experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Gerovac <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Wicke <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first study to source putative phage-encoded ncRNA at this scale. Finally, we find that ONT-cappable-seq offers a straightforward approach to study splicing events, as illustrated by the confirmed 669-bp Group I intron and the observed splicing activity in <italic>gp2</italic> in the LUZ24 genome. Collectively, this work highlights the wealth of information that can be gained from global ONT-cappable-seq experiments, uncovering transcript boundaries and transcriptome architectures, as well as introns and ncRNA candidates, all of which have remained largely understudied in phages to date.</p><p id="P35">However, while ONT-cappable-seq is a powerful standalone method to obtain a birds-eye view of phage transcriptomes and their regulatory features; classic, temporally-resolved RNA-seq experiments remain imperative for quantitative evaluations of gene expression in phage-infected cells. Notably, temporal gene expression information combined with global ONT-cappable-seq data could help infer preferential TSS and TTS usage of individual genes in specific infection stages, as well as reveal discrepancies that might point to interesting RNA processing events. Indeed, these methods collectively provide the means to globally examine gene expression and transcript boundaries, yet information on transcript modification, structure and interaction cannot be inferred and requires the adoption of other specialized transcriptomic methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hör, Gorski and Vogel 2018</xref>). We envision that the routine application of state-of-the-art transcriptomics approaches in the phage field, including but not limited to ONT-cappable-seq, will shed light on the RNA biology of non-model phages, to ultimately help bridge the existing knowledge gaps in the complex molecular mechanisms at play during phage infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures S1-S7, Supplementary Tables S1-S7</label><media xlink:href="EMS189647-supplement-Supplementary_Figures_S1_S7__Supplementary_Tables_S1_S7.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d99aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [819800].
