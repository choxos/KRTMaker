In agreement with previously reported structures, which were solved to a resolution of 4.4 Å, we found three types of filaments. However, our new structures, solved to a resolution of 2.4 Å resolution, revealed differences in the sequence assignment that redefine the fold of Aβ40 peptides and their interactions. Filaments are made of pairs of protofilaments, the ordered core of which comprises D1-G38. The different filament types comprise one, two or three protofilament pairs. In each pair, residues H14-G37 of both protofilaments adopt an extended conformation and pack against each other in an anti-parallel fashion, held together by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds between main chains and side chains. Residues D1-H13 fold back on the adjacent parts of their own chains through both polar and non-polar interactions. There are also several additional densities of unknown identity. Sarkosyl extraction and aqueous extraction gave the same structures. By cryo-EM, parenchymal deposits of Aβ42 and blood vessel deposits of Aβ40 have distinct structures, supporting the view that Alzheimer’s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are different Aβ proteinopathies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Leptomeninges</kwd><kwd>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy</kwd><kwd>Aβ40 filaments</kwd><kwd>Electron cryo-microscopy.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is defined neuropathologically by the presence of abundant filamentous plaques and tangles in the brain parenchyma, with the characteristics of amyloid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Plaques are made predominantly of Aβ42, whereas tangles consist of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau. In addition, many individuals with AD have deposits of Aβ40 in leptomeningeal and parenchymal blood vessels, chiefly small arterioles and capillaries, giving rise to Aβ cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. CAA is the accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins, most often Aβ40, in cerebral blood vessel walls. Nearly half of end-stage AD patients have moderate-to-severe CAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Even though they share Aβ deposition, AD and CAA can occur independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Aβ CAA is mostly sporadic, but it can also be inherited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] or acquired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. The most common clinical manifestations are lobar intracerebral haemorrhage and cognitive impairment.</p><p id="P3">In 2019, the cryo-EM structures of Aβ40 filaments from the leptomeninges of three individuals with AD and CAA were reported at a resolution of 4.4 Å [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. For each individual, three types of filaments were observed. In the smallest filament type, two identical protofilaments were in evidence, with the C-terminus being less well resolved than the rest of the molecule. Four cross-β strands were typical of each protofilament and the filament twist was right-handed. Filament types made of four and six protofilaments were also observed. Here we report the structures of Aβ40 filaments from the leptomeninges of three individuals with AD and CAA, with resolutions up to 2.4 Å. Compared to the previously reported structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], our higher resolution structures reveal a difference in the sequence assignment that redefines the filament fold of Aβ40 peptides and their interactions. Using either sarkosyl or water-based methods to extract leptomeningeal Aβ40 filaments led to identical folds.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cases of Alzheimer’s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy</title><p id="P4">Leptomeninges from three neuropathologically confirmed cases of AD and CAA were peeled off from the region overlying the thawed cerebral cortex, before being frozen a second time.

There were two main types of filaments, the minority type (type 1) comprising a pair of identical protofilaments and the majority type (type 2) comprising two protofilament pairs running side by side. All filaments had a right-handed twist, as established from the densities for backbone oxygen atoms in the cryo-EM maps. Structures from case 1 reached the highest resolution. The structure of filaments made of two pairs of protofilaments were determined at 2.4 Å resolution; the structure of filaments made of one pair of protofilaments was determined at 2.7 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>; Figure S1).</p><p id="P11">The ordered core of each protofilament consists of residues D1-G38 and comprises four β-strands (β1-β4) that extend from residues 2-8, 10-13, 15-22 and 34-36, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b-d</xref>). In type 1 filaments, the individual protofilaments pack against each other with 2-start (pseudo-2<sub>1</sub>) helical symmetry through a large interface, made of residues H14-G37 in an extended conformation. This interface is stabilised by hydrophobic interactions of L17, F19, A21, V24, I32 and M35 from both protofilaments and hydrogen bonds from the polar side chains of H14, Q15 and N27 to the main chain of the opposite molecules. The N-terminal segments β1 and β2 fold back on the opposite side of β3, enclosing a network of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds formed by the polar side chains of H6, S8, E11, H13 and K16, and capped by the interlocking aromatic side chains of F4 and F20. The N-terminal substructure formed by the β1-β3 region is similar to that derived from the low-resolution map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P12">Type 2 filaments comprise two pairs of protofilaments that pack against each other with C2 symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Pairs of leptomeningeal Aβ40 protofilaments interact through salt bridges between E3 from one dimer and R5 from the other dimer, and vice versa. A similar association of dimeric filaments into tetramers via electrostatic interactions of the surface residues K16 and E22 was observed in Aβ42 Type 1b filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P13">Besides the density for the ordered core of Aβ filaments, there were additional densities in the cryo-EM reconstruction that could not be explained by Aβ. There was a strong density in front of Y10, which was situated at a right angle turn between β1 and β2, which may correspond to a post-translational modification of this residue and/or an external cofactor. There was another strong density opposite a hydrophobic patch made of I31, L34 and V36 in the C-terminal region. In the previously reoported low-resolution maps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], there was a disconnected density in the equivalent location that was assigned to the C-terminal residues V39 and V40. The unambiguous sequence assignment of our higher-resolution structures renders such an assignment impossible. In principle, the C-terminal residues of Aβ42 or Aβ43 peptides could reach this disconnected density, but these peptides were uncommon in the cases studied here.</p><p id="P14">By mass spectrometry, Aβ1-40 showed the highest peak in all three cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that most filaments were made of Aβ1-40. In case 3, a comparable peak was observed for Aβ1-38, consistent with the ordered filament core extending from D1 to G38.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Structures of Aβ40 filaments from leptomeninges extracted using aqueous extraction</title><p id="P15">We also used aqueous extraction of Aβ filaments from the leptomeninges of case 1. Cryo-EM structures of type 1 and type 2 filaments, at 3.1 Å and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively, revealed the same Aβ40 fold as observed using sarkosyl extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a-c</xref>). Aqueous extraction also yielded a third type of filaments with three such pairs of protofilaments (type 3), which was solved at 4.0 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). The all-atom root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between protofilaments from type 1 filaments of sarkosyl and aqueous extractions was 1.1 Å. Minor differences were due to a distinct side chain orientation of Y10. The additional density next to this residue was less prominent and more diffuse than in the maps of sarkosyl-extracted filaments, suggesting that a putative cofactor associated with this residue was partially lost during aqueous extraction.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Comparison with previous structures</title><p id="P16">A comparison of our type 1 filament structure at 2.7 Å with the previously reported structure at 4.4 Å [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] revealed differences in the atomic models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a,b</xref>). The same differences were also present when comparing the previously reported structure of type 1 filaments with the pairs of protofilaments in our 2.4 Å structure of type 2 filaments (not shown). Compared to our model, the previously reported model has the same sequence assignment for the N-terminal 23 residues of Aβ40, but the rest of the sequence is misaligned by up to two residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b,c</xref>). Whereas the main-chain assignment is unambiguous in our high-resolution maps, the density in the 4.4 Å map was less clear. It is possible that the misalignment arose from an erroneous assignment of the C-terminal residues of Aβ40 into the disconnected density near the end of the contiguous segment. Fitting our model into the 4.4 Å map (EMD-10204) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] and comparing it with the deposited model (PDB:6SHS), shows that our model is as good a description of the 4.4 Å map as the deposited model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">We report the cryo-EM structures of Aβ filaments from the leptomeninges of three cases of sporadic AD and CAA with resolutions up to 2.4 Å. In agreement with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], we observed three types of right-handed Aβ40 filaments that consisted of one, two or three pairs of protofilaments. Each protofilament extended from D1-G38 and consisted of four β-strands. It follows that Aβ monomers in these filaments have an intact N-terminus and are truncated or disordered for the two C-terminal residues. This contrasts with the structures of Aβ42 filaments from the brains of individuals with AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], in which the N-terminal eight or ten residues are disordered and partially truncated, and the C-terminus is ordered. Aβ40 filaments also differ from Aβ42 filaments by the presence of a strong density associated with Y10.</p><p id="P18">Sarkosyl extraction and aqueous extraction gave nearly identical filament structures, demonstrating that sarkosyl did not influence the structure of Aβ40 filaments. The same was true of Aβ42 filaments and paired helical tau filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. When using sarkosyl extraction of AD brain tissues, we observed Aβ42 filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Only Aβ40 filaments were found when leptomeninges from cases of AD and CAA were extracted with sarkosyl. Both Aβ40 and Aβ42 filaments were found in the brain of a patient with mutation E22G in Aβ (Arctic mutation) following sarkosyl extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p><p id="P19">Our atomic models differ from those reported previously for Aβ40 filaments from the leptomeninges of three individuals with sporadic AD and CAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Our unambiguous sequence assignment differs from the assignment proposed previously for a low-resolution map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], thereby redefining the fold of Aβ40 peptides and their interactions. It has been recommended that <italic>de novo</italic> atomic modelling of amyloids should not be performed in RELION reconstructions, when the resolutions are worse than 4.0 Å [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P20">Seeded aggregation of amyloid filaments is often used, with the implicit assumption that these filaments have the same structures as the initial seeds. However, this is not necessarily the case, as was shown for seeded aggregation of recombinant <italic>α</italic>-synuclein with seeds from the putamen of individuals with multiple system atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. The cryo-EM structures of synthetic Aβ40 filaments seeded from vascular deposits of brain parenchyma of individuals with CAA have recently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. One of the two structures described in this preprint appears to be identical to the structure of the type 1 Aβ40 filaments that we report, including the new sequence assignment of the 15 C-terminal residues.</p><p id="P21">Without the results described here, this difference in sequence assignment of the seeded structure could have been attributed to a difference between Aβ40 filaments from CAA and CAA+AD, a difference between Aβ40 filaments from leptomeningeal and parenchymal blood vessels, or an artefact of seeded aggregation. However, the present results suggest that the seeds used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] contained the same type 1 Aβ40 filaments that we extracted and that their structures were replicated correctly during seeded aggregation.</p><p id="P22">The cryo-EM structures of Aβ42 filaments from plaques and Aβ40 filaments from blood vessels are different, consistent with the view that AD and CAA are the result of distinct pathogenic processes. For assembled tau and <italic>α</italic>-synuclein, it has also been shown that specific amyloid structures define different diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Medin has been reported to co-aggregate with Aβ40 in blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], but we did not observe mixed filaments.</p><p id="P23">The present findings may have consequences for the development of disease-modifying treatments for AD. Current immunotherapies suffer from common and sometimes serious side effects, also known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], which appear to be linked to the abundance of pre-existing CAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Existing antibodies seem to bind to both parenchymal and blood vessel deposits of Aβ. Based on the structural differences, it may be possible to produce conformational Aβ antibodies that bind specifically to either parenchymal or blood vessel deposits. It may also become possible to develop imaging agents that distinguish between parenchymal and blood vessel deposits of Aβ. Accurate knowledge of the atomic structures of the different amyloids will facilitate these developments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS189366-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d86aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S14"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the patients’ families for donating brain tissues.
