Understanding the factors involved in these stress responses is crucial for developing effective treatments. Here, we describe a previously unstudied long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), <italic>JUNI</italic> (<italic>JUN-DT</italic>, <italic>LINC01135</italic>), which is regulated by MAPK and responsive to stress. <italic>JUNI</italic> positively regulates the expression of its neighboring gene <italic>JUN</italic>, a key transducer of signals that regulate multiple transcriptional outputs. Our findings reveal that silencing <italic>JUNI</italic> sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs or UV radiation, and that its prolonged silencing leads to cell death regardless of stress exposure, highlighting the pro-survival importance of <italic>JUNI.</italic> We identified 57 proteins that interact with <italic>JUNI</italic> and found that the activity of one of them, the MAPK phosphatase and inhibitor DUSP14, is inhibited by <italic>JUNI</italic>. This effect results in c-Jun induction following exposure of cancer cells to UV radiation and promotes cellular survival. Although <italic>JUNI</italic> regulates c-Jun and its downstream targets, the pro-survival effects in cells not exposed to stress are only partially dependent on c-Jun regulation.</p><p id="P3"><italic>JUNI</italic> expression levels significantly correlate with patients survival across 11 different types of cancer. Interestingly, the correlation of DUSP14 expression levels with patients survival in nine of these tumors is coherently inverse, indicating contradicting effects that are relevant not only for c-Jun induction and cellular survival but also in human cancer. Notably, we observed particularly significant antagonistic correlations in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) (p=5.7E-05 for <italic>JUNI</italic> and p=2.9E-05 for Dusp14). In fact, the expression levels of 76% of <italic>JUNI</italic>-interacting proteins predict the prognosis of ccRCC patients significantly. Furthermore, a combined hazard ratio calculation demonstrates that this gene combination serves as a highly specific prognostic signature for ccRCC. Overall, our findings reveal a new important factor in stress signaling and cellular survival that is involved in ccRCC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important players in the neoplastic process due to changes in their expression and activity, as supported by functional experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bhan <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chi <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Spizzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Tan <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). LncRNAs have been shown to affect various cancer-related processes and can impact every stage of cancer development, including initiation, progression, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gutschner &amp; Diederichs, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">McCabe &amp; Rasmussen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Tan <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Specifically, the involvement of lncRNAs in stress responses, particularly the DNA damage response (DDR), allows cancer cells to regulate and overcome DNA damage and associated cellular responses, which can otherwise lead to cell death. As such, lncRNAs play a crucial role in promoting cancer cell survival and chemoresistance to therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Connerty <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Su <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Tehrani <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Rapid DNA damage responses (DDRs) are critical for the maintenance of organismal wellbeing and are often disrupted during cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jackson &amp; Bartek, 2009</xref>). Tumor suppressors such as ATM, p53, and BRCA proteins are potent participants in the sensing, transduction, and repair of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jackson &amp; Bartek, 2009</xref>). Conversely, some oncoproteins, including the AP-1 member c-Jun, are also responsive to stress signaling and are particularly sensitive to environmental DNA-damaging agents such as ultraviolet light (UV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Devary <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>). UV-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) leads to JNK-dependent c-Jun phosphorylation, protein stabilization, and elevated transcription due to autoregulation of its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Davis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fuchs <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Karin &amp; Gallagher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Stein <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>). The wide responsiveness of c-Jun to environmental stimuli and its consequential multiple roles in cellular homeostasis make it essential for cellular survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Shaulian &amp; Karin, 2002</xref>), development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hilberg <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>) and tumorigenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Eferl <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Moreover, the ability of c-Jun to antagonize proapoptotic signaling underlies its capacity to endow cancer cells with drug resistance. For example, its activation post-treatment of melanomas with BRAF inhibitors is a primary driver for phenotype switching, rendering the cells more mesenchymal and associated with elevated drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fallahi-Sichani <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ramsdale <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Titz <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In 2020, around 430,000 new cases of kidney cancer and 180,000 deaths were reported worldwide, with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) accounting for approximately 75% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hsieh <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sung <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). The first comprehensive characterization of ccRCC re-verified the loss of chromosome 3p encompassing VHL, PBRM1, SETD2 and BAP1. It also identified 19 significantly mutated genes, epigenetic alterations including methylation of specific promoters and widespread DNA hypomethylation associated with mutations in SETD2, recurrent mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and aberrations in the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2013</xref>). The array of genes, which are mutated, inactivated, or hyper-activated in renal tumorigenesis, are reported to be involved in the regulation of various metabolic events, such as glycolysis, TCA cycle, metabolism of glutamine, ATP production and modulation of pathways important for hypoxic condition and redox balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Rathmell <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Weiss, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wettersten, 2020</xref>). The essential genes involved in regulating metabolic reprogramming in renal cancer are VHL, PTEN, Akt, mTOR, TSC1/2 and Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Schmidt &amp; Linehan, 2016</xref>). Inactivation of VHL leads to the stabilization of two VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex targets, HIF1α and HIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Shen &amp; Kaelin, 2013</xref>). Under hypoxic state of cancer cells, HIF1α and HIF2α up-regulate the transcription of several hypoxia-responsive genes involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis, as well as genes associated with glucose transport and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kaelin, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">2004</xref>) In addition, altered fatty acid metabolism is observed in ccRCC.

<italic>JUNI</italic> is a stress-regulated lincRNA</title><p id="P20">To identify genes regulated by c-Jun, we analyzed ChIP-seq data from ENCODE for genes whose transcription start sites (TSSs) are located in the vicinity of c-Jun binding sites. One of the genes whose TSS is located only 1100 bp away from the <italic>JUN</italic> TSS is the long intergenic noncoding RNA <italic>JUN-DT</italic> or <italic>LINC01135</italic>, referred to hereafter as <italic>JUNI</italic> (for <italic>JUN</italic> inducer). According to ENCODE data, <italic>JUNI</italic> contains five main exons and has multiple isoforms. Twenty-seven different transcript isoforms were described according to LNCipedia ranging from 213 to 6213 bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Volders <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Importantly, ENCODE predicts that the first exon is shared by all, therefore, all primers to analyze JUNI’s expression as well as siRNAs to silence it, were targeted for this exon. <italic>JUNI</italic> is evolutionarily conserved within primates but not in rodents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). The fact that c-Jun is known to bind to its own promoter and to autoregulate its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Angel <italic>et al</italic>., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Stein <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>) supported the ChIP-seq results but did not confirm any functionality for <italic>JUNI</italic>. Therefore, we analyzed its expression to exclude promoter leakiness. UV-driven activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) results in JNK-dependent c-Jun phosphorylation, transcript elevation and protein stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Davis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fuchs <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Karin &amp; Gallagher, 2005</xref>). Hypothesizing that the expression of <italic>JUNI</italic> is regulated by c-Jun and given that UV radiation is a major inducer of c-Jun expression, we irradiated four different cell types with UV radiation and examined <italic>JUNI</italic> expression. In this study, we used a set of cell lines, including two melanoma cell lines (where UV is a major carcinogen), HMCB and CHL1, HeLa (cervical carcinoma cell line in which <italic>JUN</italic> expression was intensively studied) and MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer-TNBC; a cancer type in which <italic>JUN</italic> plays a significant role) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Vleugel <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Irradiation of these cell lines with 20-30 J/m<sup>2</sup> UVC resulted in three to five-fold induction of <italic>JUNI</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref> B). Similar to <italic>JUN</italic>, the induction was dose dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>), and the rapid response to stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>) as well as to serum stimulation of starved cells, identified by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bunch <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), qualifies it as an “immediate early” lncRNA. To determine how common is the correlation between <italic>JUNI</italic> and <italic>JUN</italic> induction following exposure to drug-induced stress, HeLa cells were exposed to chemotherapeutic drugs that induce <italic>JUN</italic> expression, and <italic>JUNI</italic> levels were monitored. Every DNA damaging treatment that induced <italic>JUN</italic> also induced <italic>JUNI</italic>, although to a lower extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>). Fractionation experiments demonstrated that <italic>JUNI</italic> resides mainly in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>) and quantitation of <italic>JUNI</italic>’s copy number in untreated HMCB and MBA-MD-231 cells revealed the presence of of about 8 copies per cell. HeLa cells express lower amounts of 1-2 copies in untreated cells. Overall, these results suggested that <italic>JUNI</italic> is a stress-induced gene whose expression pattern resembles that of <italic>JUN</italic>, therefore, we investigated the potential existence of regulatory effects between the two genes, especially post exposure of cells to stress.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>
<italic>JUNI</italic> expression is controlled by MAPKs but not by c-Jun</title><p id="P21">To define the pathways required for <italic>JUNI</italic> upregulation after stress exposure, we inhibited two UV-activated kinases that are known to phosphorylate/induce c-Jun, JNK and p38 using specific inhibitors SP600125 (JNK) or SB203580 (p38). Both inhibitors abolished <italic>JUNI</italic> induction by UV, similar to c-Jun expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref> A, B), suggesting that the expression of <italic>JUNI</italic> may be c-Jun-dependent. As the <italic>JUN</italic> promoter is the major regulatory element proximate to the first exon of <italic>JUNI,</italic> we tested whether it co-regulates <italic>JUNI</italic> expression. We transfected MDA-MB-231 and HeLa cells with a genomic element that contains the promoter of <italic>JUN</italic> flanked by 153 bases of the first exon of <italic>JUNI</italic> on one side and 750 bp of the 5’ UTR of <italic>JUN</italic> on the other side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Angel <italic>et al</italic>., 1988</xref>). Examination of RNA extracted after DNase treatment demonstrated eight- and 34-fold higher expression of <italic>JUNI</italic> relative to cells transfected with an empty vector in the different cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C and D</xref>). Thus, <italic>JUN</italic>’s promoter is bidirectional, driving the expression of <italic>JUN</italic> on one side and <italic>JUNI</italic> on the other, as previously described for other lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kopp &amp; Mendell, 2018</xref>). Two AP-1 binding sites in the <italic>JUN</italic> promoter mediate autoregulation of <italic>JUN</italic> expression. Surprisingly, although mutation in these sites reduced <italic>JUN</italic> expression relative to the promoter expressing wt AP-1 binding sites, <italic>JUNI</italic> expression levels did not change, suggesting that <italic>JUNI</italic> is not regulated by c-Jun (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>). To directly explore the dependence of <italic>JUNI</italic> expression on c-Jun, specific siRNA for <italic>JUN</italic> was transfected into HeLa cells, the cells were UV-treated or not, and the levels of c-Jun and <italic>JUNI</italic> were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>). Despite three-fold suppression of c-Jun protein expression<italic>, JUNI</italic> levels did not decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>). Reciprocal experiments supported the independence of <italic>JUNI</italic> from c-Jun expression. HeLa cells transfected with the <italic>JUN</italic> expression vector and expressing very high levels of <italic>JUN</italic> mRNA did not present any difference in <italic>JUNI</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>), and unlike the induction of <italic>CCND1,</italic> a known c-Jun target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wisdom <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>), <italic>JUNI</italic> levels were not changed in the <italic>JUN</italic>-transfected cells expressing high levels of c-Jun protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2G</xref>), thus proving that <italic>JUNI</italic> expression is c-Jun independent.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title><italic>JUNI</italic> regulates c-Jun expression and its downstream targets and is relevant for human cancer</title><p id="P22">Given that many lncRNAs modulate the expression of nearby genes in a <italic>cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gil &amp; Ulitsky, 2020</xref>), we examined the effects of <italic>JUNI</italic> on <italic>JUN</italic> expression. To this end, we attempted to knock out the first exon of <italic>JUNI</italic> using CRISPR gene editing targeting <italic>JUNI</italic> with two sgRNAs flanking its first exon. However, exon 1-deleted clones could not be generated, suggesting an essential role for this gene. As the first exon is common to all isoforms, we designed two siRNAs targeting it and used them to transiently silence <italic>JUNI</italic> expression. Both siRNAs silenced <italic>JUNI</italic> and consequently <italic>JUN</italic> mRNA expression to a lesser degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). It is worth mentioning that cell line-specific, consistent variations in the silencing capacities of the two siRNAs were observed. Importantly, all the phenotypic effects described in this study corresponded to the silencing efficiencies of each siRNA. HMCB and MDA-MB-231 cells express high levels of c-Jun protein, which can be detected even without stress exposure. A mild reduction in c-Jun protein levels after <italic>JUNI</italic> silencing was detected in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). In contrast, a clear effect of silencing was observed in all cell lines after exposure to UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>), suggesting that <italic>JUNI</italic> has special importance for c-Jun expression after exposure of cells to stress. Indeed, exogenous expression of the first exon of <italic>JUNI</italic> either transiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref> D) or stably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3E</xref>) was sufficient to elevate c-Jun levels in cells exposed to UV radiation. Combined, our data suggest that <italic>JUNI</italic> can regulate <italic>JUN</italic> expression in <italic>trans</italic> and is particularly important after stress exposure. Significant correlations between <italic>JUNI</italic> and <italic>JUN</italic> expression also occur <italic>in vivo</italic>. Examination of expression data of 32 types of tumors in the Pan-Cancer Co-Expression Analysis for the RNA-RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) revealed a 94% positive correlation between <italic>JUNI</italic> and <italic>JUN</italic> levels in all cancer types examined. Sixty-two percent of the positively correlated cases were statistically significant (Table S1).</p><p id="P23">Next, we examined whether <italic>JUNI</italic> has a regulatory impact on targets downstream of c-Jun. As c-Jun can modulate melanoma cells plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ramsdale <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), we examined the expression of a set of known c-Jun-regulated genes in CHL1 cells 24 h after silencing <italic>JUNI</italic>. Interestingly, c-Jun target genes known to be involved in EMT, such as ZEB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Graindorge <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) and SNAI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Thakur <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>), were downregulated by <italic>JUNI</italic> silencing, whereas CDH2, which is not a known target, was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref> F). The effect on these EMT-relevant <italic>JUN</italic> targets was also associated with reduced motility, as reflected by the capacity of cells to migrate in transwell migration assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref> and S1).</p><p id="P24">To investigate the potential relevance of <italic>JUNI</italic> in human cancer, given its regulatory impact on the neighboring <italic>JUN</italic> gene and its influence on motility, we analyzed the correlation between <italic>JUNI</italic> expression levels and patients survival in 21 different types of cancer with available RNA-seq data from the Pan-cancer Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Nagy <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Our analysis revealed significant correlations between <italic>JUNI</italic> expression and patient survival in 11 of the cancer types examined, either negatively or positively depending on the specific cancer type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Short-term silencing of <italic>JUNI</italic> sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, whereas prolonged <italic>JUNI</italic> silencing kills cancer cells regardless of challenge exposure</title><p id="P25">The induction of <italic>JUNI</italic> by DNA damaging agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>) suggested that it may play a role in the cellular response to DNA damage. To examine this possibility, <italic>JUNI</italic> was silenced in HMCB, CHL-1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and 36-40 h later, the cells were either UV irradiated or treated with the chemotherapeutic drugs etoposide or doxorubicin. Cell survival was determined microscopically and using XTT assays. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, B and Fig. S2, silencing of <italic>JUNI</italic> in all cell lines sensitized them to UV-induced stress and chemotherapeutic drugs. Apoptotic cells exhibiting blebbing membranes and nuclear fragmentation were clearly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). In addition, all treatments induced the levels of cleaved caspase 3 more significantly in <italic>JUNI</italic>-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The exposure to UV radiation and the drugs resulted in 30 to 65% reduction in the survival of <italic>JUNI</italic>-silenced cells relative to cells transfected with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> and S2). To determine the effects of <italic>JUNI</italic> silencing on sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutical drugs in another model, spheroids of CHL1 and HMCB cells were generated, exposed to doxorubicin and analyzed for survival 5-8 days later. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4</xref> D and E the survival of <italic>JUNI</italic>-silenced cells was reduced by 50%, thus supporting <italic>JUNI’s</italic> protective role in cells exposed to DNA damage.</p><p id="P26">More striking was the fact that <italic>JUNI</italic> silencing for a prolonged period of 96-120 h resulted in elevated cell death even without exposure to additional stress, in all four examined cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> F-H and S3). Unlike the cells exposed to DNA damaging agents the spontaneously dying cells did not exhibit clear apoptotic characteristics and entry of dye into the cells, caused by membrane rupturing, was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4G</xref>). The exact causes and mechanisms of cell death are currently under investigation (see discussion), nevertheless, quantification of cell survival using XTT at 120 h post <italic>JUNI</italic> silencing revealed 50-70% cell death in the different cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4H</xref> and S3). The survival rate was further reduced to 10-25% two weeks after silencing, as indicated by the number of colonies that developed in <italic>JUNI</italic>-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4I</xref> and S3). Consistent with these results, the silencing of <italic>JUNI</italic> in HMCB and HeLa cells resulted in reduced formation of colonies in soft agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4J</xref> and S3). The requirement of <italic>JUNI</italic> for survival under these conditions seemed to be specific for cancer cells as its silencing in the non-tumorigenic, spontaneously transformed human skin keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, did not result in significant cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4K</xref>). Reintroduction of a <italic>JUNI</italic> into <italic>JUNI</italic>-silenced HMCB and HeLa cells rescued them from cell death as reflected by the ability to form colonies in clonogenic assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4L</xref>). Overall, we suggest that JUNI is essential for the survival of stress -exposed but also in cancer cells not exposed to DNA damaging agents.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>
<italic>JUNI’s</italic> requirement for cellular survival is partially dependent on c-Jun</title><p id="P27">As c-Jun is a major cellular signaling molecule involved in many aspects of cellular wellbeing, cell death after <italic>JUNI</italic> silencing can potentially be caused indirectly by the decline in c-Jun levels. To address this possibility, we compared the effects inflicted on survival after <italic>JUNI</italic> silencing to those observed after <italic>JUN</italic> silencing. We used specific siRNAs to silence either <italic>JUNI</italic> or <italic>JUN</italic> in 3 different cell lines, MDA-MB-231, HeLa and HMCB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, although <italic>JUN</italic> mRNA levels in cells transfected with specific <italic>JUN</italic> siRNA were at least 20% lower than those in <italic>JUNI</italic> silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref> A-C, Expression), their survival 96 h after <italic>JUN</italic> silencing was five to 30% higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref> A-C, Survival XTT/short). This difference was extenuated two weeks later. A reduction of 45-60% in colonies formed after <italic>JUNI</italic> silencing relative to <italic>JUN</italic> silenced cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref> A-C, Survival colonies/long). These results demonstrate that in the examined cell lines, <italic>JUNI</italic> is more important for cellular survival than <italic>JUN</italic>. As demonstrated before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), <italic>JUN</italic> silencing had no significant effect on <italic>JUNI</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A-C, Expression).</p><p id="P28">To further test the contribution of c-Jun to <italic>JUNI</italic>’s pro-survival activity, we performed rescue experiments in which <italic>JUNI</italic> was silenced in HMCB cells and exogenous c-Jun was expressed to complement the repressed endogenous gene. <italic>JUNI</italic> silencing reduced cell survival by 50%, whereas <italic>JUN</italic> silencing reduced cell survival by 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Restoration of <italic>JUN</italic> expression improved the survival of <italic>JUNI</italic>-silenced cells. However, the rescue was partial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Mutant c-Jun that cannot bind DNA (272/273E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Yogev <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) or other <italic>JUN</italic> family members, <italic>JUNB</italic> or <italic>JUND</italic>, could not rescue cell death caused by <italic>JUNI</italic> silencing, thus, suggesting a specificity for transcriptional active c-Jun in the rescue. These results indicate that <italic>JUNI’</italic>s effects on cellular survival are partially dependent on c-Jun expression and predict that additional <italic>JUNI</italic>-regulated factors are essential for cellular survival.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Antagonistic interactions of <italic>JUNI</italic> with DUSP14 mediate c-Jun induction by UV and survival</title><p id="P29">To explore the identity of protein interactors that may affect the ability of <italic>JUNI</italic> to regulate c-Jun expression and affect cell death, we identified interacting protein partners of <italic>JUNI</italic> by applying the incPRINT screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Graindorge <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Using the shortest yet stable isoform of <italic>JUNI</italic> that contained the <italic>JUN</italic>-affecting sequences as RNA bait, we identified 57 <italic>JUNI</italic>-interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Analyses of their cellular functions revealed enrichment of proteins involved in various fundamental, basic aspects of cellular wellbeing, such as splicing, ribosome biosynthesis, and mitosis (Table S2). Interestingly, c-Jun itself does not interact with JUNI (Table S2, Normalized luciferase intensity MS2, RLU =0.44). By contrast, the dual specificity protein phosphatase 14 (DUSP14; also known as MKP6) was one of the highly rated interacting proteins with <italic>JUNI</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>, B). DUSP14 can directly dephosphorylate or indirectly limit the phosphorylation of MAPKs essential for c-Jun expression: JNK, p38 and ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Marti <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). We validated the interaction between DUSP14 and <italic>JUNI</italic> in HeLa cells by crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP). We examined the enrichment of endogenous <italic>JUNI</italic> following immunoprecipitation with transfected DUSP14 or GFP. Specificity was determined by comparison of <italic>JUNI</italic> enrichment to other unrelated nuclear lncRNAs <italic>MALAT1</italic> and <italic>PVT1</italic>. These experiments demonstrated a specific association of <italic>JUNI</italic> with DUSP14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). As <italic>JUNI</italic> is required for efficient c-Jun upregulation after UV exposure and DUSP14 inhibits JNK, a stress-activated, positive regulator of <italic>JUN</italic> transcription and protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Davis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Karin &amp; Gallagher, 2005</xref>), we hypothesized that <italic>JUNI</italic> antagonizes DUSP14 activity to enable full-scale c-Jun induction post-stress exposure and that the antagonism may have a role in other <italic>JUNI</italic>-dependent activities discovered in this study. The potential <italic>JUNI</italic>-DUSP14 antagonism was examined at 3 levels. Biochemically, we sought to test if <italic>JUNI</italic> enables efficient JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation, thus resulting in c-Jun induction post UV exposure. At the cellular level, we examined whether <italic>JUNI</italic>-DUSP14 antagonism is reflected by effects on cellular survival, and most importantly, we examined whether the expression of both inversely correlates with the survival of human patients suffering from cancer types in which <italic>JUNI</italic> levels correlate with survival (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P30">To explore the effects on c-Jun, we silenced DUSP14, <italic>JUNI</italic> or both in HMCB cells that were later exposed to UV radiation and JNK activation, c-Jun phosphorylation and its total level were determined. Indeed, silencing <italic>JUNI</italic> inhibited JNK phosphorylation (pThr183/pTyr185) in UV-treated cells to a nearly undetectable level, and consequently, Ser63 phosphorylation of c-Jun therefore, prevented its induction by UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). Co-silencing of DUSP14 together with <italic>JUNI</italic> restored JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation to levels silhgtly lower than those observed in non-silenced cells. To prove that the effect of <italic>JUNI</italic> on c-Jun induction is mediated by DUSP14 phosphatase activity we transfected HMCB cells with wt or phosphatase dead (C111S) DUSP14 together with <italic>JUNI</italic> expression vector or an empty one. Cells were irradiated 24h post transfection and the phosphorylation as well total levels of c-Jun were monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6E</xref>). As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6E</xref>, <italic>JUNI</italic> considerably elevated c-Jun phosphorylation and expression only in cells transfected with phosphatase active DUSP14.

DUSP14 silencing did not significantly improve the survival of irradiated cells expressing normal levels of <italic>JUNI</italic>. Remarkably, it improved the survival of <italic>JUNI</italic>-silenced cells by 29 and 33% in HMCB and HeLa cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref> and S4), suggesting that <italic>JUNI</italic>’S expression is important for antagonizing DUSP14 in order to improve the survival of stress-exposed cells. Nevertheless, the negative effect of <italic>JUNI</italic> silencing on the survival of stressed cells was not fully rescued by repression of DUSP14, suggesting the presence of additional targets. In contrast, the rescue from cell death caused by prolonged silencing of <italic>JUNI</italic> in non-irradiated cells was considerably lower, suggesting that the impact of antagonistic interactions between <italic>JUNI</italic> and DUSP14 is most significant in stress-exposed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref> and S4).</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Expression levels of <italic>JUNI</italic>-interacting proteins in tumors predict prognosis value in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)</title><p id="P32">To test the hypothesis that <italic>JUNI</italic>-DUSP14 antagonism has a potential role in human cancer, we analyzed the hazard ratios (HR) of <italic>JUNI</italic> and DUSP14 expression levels in the 11 types of cancer in which <italic>JUNI</italic> expression correlated significantly with disease prognosis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, a strict inverse relationship was observed in nine out of the eleven (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>). The inverse correlation was reflected not only in the effect on survival but also in magnitude of the effect, thus excluding randomness. In line with hazard ratios, the median survival associated with expression levels was also coherently inverse in eight out of these 11 cancers (Table S4). The association of <italic>JUNI</italic> with improved survival and DUSP14 with reduced one was particularly significant in ccRCC (p=5.7E-05 and p=2.9E-05 for <italic>JUNI</italic> and DUSP14 respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7A</xref>). In this cancer, high levels of <italic>JUNI</italic> were associated with 87% prolonged median survival, whereas high levels of DUSP14 were associated with a 55% reduction in the median survival of these patients (Table S3). Analysis of <italic>JUNI</italic> expression in ccRCC tumors revealed that in accordance with an assumed negative role in ccRCC tumorigenicity, it’s levels were significantly reduced in the tumors relative to the normal tissues (p=1.2E-11), whereas DUSP14 expression was increased in a very significant manner (p=1.0E-20) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>JUNI</italic> has a possible role in ccRCC pathogenesis and that, similar to cell lines, it antagonizes DUSP14 also in this cancer type.</p><p id="P33">Next, we examined whether the prognostic significance in ccRCC is unique to DUSP14 or shared with other <italic>JUNI</italic>-interacting proteins. To that end we determined the prognostic significance of each of the top 55 <italic>JUNI</italic>-interacting proteins by analyzing Pan-cancer RNAseq data for ccRCC with Kaplan-Meier plotter and comparing these values to the prognostic significance of the same protein array in bladder cancer (BLCA), another urinary-system cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Two important observations were found; the portion of proteins which are significantly linked with prognosis in ccRCC was about 76% compared with only 43% in bladder carcinoma and, moreover, the significance values were much higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>), thus suggesting specificity for ccRCC. To further address the specificity of the entire <italic>JUNI</italic>-interacting-proteins-array, identified using incPRINT, with ccRCC prognosis, a combined expression score was driven from all 55 proteins (see Methods), and analyzed for prognostic significance across 34 Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts (cancer types). As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref> the expression of genes coding for <italic>JUNI</italic>-interacting proteins provides a unique signature with an extremely high significance in the ccRCC cohort followed only by the pan-kidney cohort (KIPAN) and adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), both kidney-related. Minor but significant association of this gene set with prognosis was also observed in glioma patients (GBMLGG cohort) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7D</xref>). This gene combination was not significant for prognosis in neither of the other cancer types examined. Analysis of <italic>JUNI</italic>’s expression in tumors and normal samples from TCGA and the GTEx data bases using the GEPIA web server(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Tang <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>) revealed that <italic>JUNI</italic>’s levels are reduced in all kidney and kidney related cancers, most significantly in ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S25" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P34">Overall, we discovered a novel lncRNA that plays fundamental roles in cellular survival. The major concern that every cellular effect observed post-silencing of <italic>JUNI</italic> is derived from the regulation of c-Jun was ruled out, as <italic>JUNI</italic> seems to be more potent than c-Jun in maintaining the survival of the cancer cells examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Furthermore, exogenous c-Jun only partially rescued HMCB cells silenced for <italic>JUNI</italic>, demonstrating that cell death is partially independent of c-Jun. Therefore, we suggest that much of the biological effects attributed to <italic>JUN</italic>I are c-Jun independent and presumably occur by regulating the activity of interacting proteins such as DUSP14.</p><p id="P35">The nonspecific inhibition of transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Rockx <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Williamson <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>) observed after UV exposure suggests that <italic>JUNI</italic> induction under stress is specific. The strongest effects of <italic>JUNI</italic> on c-Jun regulation were observed after stress exposure. <italic>JUNI</italic> appears to respond in a very rapid manner to UV exposure, as required from an inducer of c-Jun, an “immediate early protein”. Its induction requires JNK and p38 activation, and in turn, it binds and antagonizes DUSP14, a negative regulator of these kinases, in a positive feedback loop. Although regulating the major JNK-c-Jun cellular pathway post DNA damage is supported by the ability of <italic>JUNI</italic> to induce c-Jun expression <italic>in trans</italic> and to enable efficient JNK phosphorylation after UV exposure, it does not necessarily exclude additional effects, <italic>in cis,</italic> of <italic>JUNI</italic> on c-Jun expression in untreated cells via association with other interacting proteins. Both the effects of <italic>JUNI</italic> on c-Jun induction and cellular survival were demonstrated using underexpression conditions by targeting the common, first exon, of <italic>JUNI.</italic> Moreover, this exon was also sufficient for c-Jun induction upon stress exposure, under conditions of overexpression.</p><p id="P36"><italic>JUNI</italic> is essential for cell survival in both chemotherapy-treated and untreated cells. We predict that the causes and mechanisms of death of cells exposed to stress are different from those in cells that are not. Sensitization of all cell types examined in this study to chemotherapeutic drugs occurs days prior to spontaneous cell death. The morphology of the spontaneous cell death is not apoptotic, and the <italic>JUNI</italic>-interacting protein DUSP14 inhibits more efficiently stress-dependent cell death in comparison to cell death observed after prolonged silencing of <italic>JUNI</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref> and S4). We predict that the cause of spontaneous cell death following <italic>JUNI</italic> silencing is not singular. Examination of the plethora of functions of the putatively interacting proteins may suggest that prolonged silencing leads to abnormalities in different cellular functions culminating in synthetic cell death.</p><p id="P37">As JNK activity usually elevates cell death post UV exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Tournier <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), the ability of DUSP14 silencing to rescue it upon JUNI silencing is surprising. Three potential mechanisms may account for the rescue. First, DUSP14 inhibition increases the activity of protective proteins that are negatively regulated by it. For example, NFκB is downstream of TAK1-TAB1 proteins which are negatively regulated by DUSP14(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Second, low constitutive JNK activation may induce autophagy which exerts protective activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Sample &amp; He, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Finally, the indirect suppression of genes involved in EMT may lead to a less mesenchymal phenotype reflected by reduced motility. Given that EMT is associated with increased drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Shibue &amp; Weinberg, 2017</xref>), it is possible that the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) process occurring in these cells after silencing <italic>JUNI</italic> sensitizes the cells to chemotherapeutic drugs post <italic>JUNI</italic> silencing.</p><p id="P38">We also examined the correlation between <italic>JUNI</italic> expression and the prognosis of ccRCC. Our results demonstrate that high levels of <italic>JUNI</italic> are associated with longer survival in ccRCC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, the high prognostic significance levels of 76% of its newly discovered interacting proteins suggest that <italic>JUNI</italic>’s activity may be mediated via the regulation of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref>). This finding suggests that the combined-expression-analysis of these proteins may provide a prognostic value that is more specific to ccRCC than any other cancer. This is the first observation connecting <italic>JUNI</italic> and its interacting genes to ccRCC. Its potential role in this disease opens a novel direction for the involvement of this lincRNA in ccRCC.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgments and funding sources</title><p>E.S. and V.K. are funded by the Israel Cancer Association, 20220102.
