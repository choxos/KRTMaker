facultative intracellular pathogens that are associated epidemiologically and experimentally with colon cancer development. Yet, the driving factors of <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced cell transformation are mostly unknown. We compared 30 (case) NTS clinical strains isolated from patients who were diagnosed with colon cancer &gt;1 year after NTS infection, versus 30 (control) strains from patients who did not develop colon cancer. While we observed diverse cell invasion and transformation efficiencies among the 60 NTS strains, case strains showed higher transformation efficiency than matching control strains. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses showed that transformation efficiency could not be attributed to specific genomic features, but was associated with gene expression, particularly metabolic genes and regulons. Moreover, high-transforming NTS strains display increased capacity to utilize various nutrient sources, including carbohydrates and amino acids, and grow significantly faster intracellularly than low-transforming NTS. Our results link NTS intracellular virulence to cancer promotion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P3"><fig id="F8" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS189964-f008"/></fig>

While many more bacterial species are added to the list of (potential) oncogenic agents, various mechanisms have been identified by which bacteria directly or indirectly manipulate their host cells promoting cell transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">van Elsland and Neefjes, 2018</xref>). <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> is a Gram-negative bacteria and a facultative intracellular pathogen. By colonizing a broad range of hosts, including humans, animals, and plants, the circa 2600 <italic>S. enterica</italic> subspecies <italic>enterica</italic> serovars can spread within many niches and are transmitted to humans through contaminated food and water, as well as direct contact with colonized animals, the environment, and via person-to-person transmission. As a result, <italic>Salmonella</italic> is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, impairing more than 21 million years of healthy life annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kirk et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P5"><italic>Salmonella</italic> serovars are divided between human-restricted typhoid fever-causing serovars (Typhi and Paratyphi), and non-typhoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> (NTS) serovars. The latter are zoonotic agents with a broader host range, causing mainly gastrointestinal illness in humans (Knodler and Elfenbein, 2019). Following ingestion, a small percentage of salmonellae survive through the gastrointestinal tract, colonize the gut, and invade several host cell types, including the intestinal epithelial cells, where the bacteria can survive and replicate (Galan, 2021). These infections can result in either self-limiting gastroenteritis or invasive diseases. Notably, life-threatening systemic infections associated with typhoid and paratyphoid fever affected 14 million people and led to 130,000 deaths in 2017, mostly in low and middle-income countries (GBD 2017 Typhoid and Paratyphoid Collaborators, 2019). In comparison, NTS serovars cause many more infections worldwide (around 93.8 million), in particular, due to their capacity to spread through the food chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Majowicz et al., 2010</xref>). In most cases, NTS colonization is restricted to the gut and generates mild symptoms allowing recovery without specific treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hohmann et al., 2001</xref>). However, life-threatening invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis is observed in immunocompromised individuals, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia (Stanaway et al., 2019).</p><p id="P6">In the last decade, evidence provided by us and others support that NTS infections increase the risk of colon cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Scanu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mughini-Gras et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Zha et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">van Elsland et al., 2022</xref>). To thrive within its host cell, <italic>Salmonella</italic> hijacks many intracellular signaling pathways (Galan, 2021), some of which may result in host cell transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Scanu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). We have previously shown that <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium invasion of host cells can induce cell transformation in tissue culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Scanu et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is unclear whether NTS strains differ in their transformation efficiency.</p><p id="P7">In an earlier epidemiological study, we have shown that colon cancer risk was significantly increased among patients with a severe – therefore reported - NTS infection diagnosed before 60 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mughini-Gras et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, infection with NTS serovar Enteritidis was associated with the highest increased risk of cancer in the ascending/transverse colon (a 3-fold increase compared to no infection), suggesting different transformation efficiency between NTS strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mughini-Gras et al., 2018</xref>). These epidemiological insights were the basis for the current study. Here, we show that tumors linked to NTS infections have a different pathological grading than colon tumors from patients without reported NTS infection. We further describe the NTS features associated with colon cancer performing a matched case-control study of clinical NTS strains either or not associated with colon cancer as identified in the nationwide epidemiological study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mughini-Gras et al., 2018</xref>). Using a combination of genomic, transcriptomic, metabolic, and phenotypic analyses of the clinical NTS strains, we report a surprisingly diverse efficiency of clinical NTS to transform host cell and describe how this attribute correlate with strain transcriptome, virulence, and intracellular fitness.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Tumors from patients with a history of reported <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection are associated with a better prognosis</title><p id="P8">Since 1991, a nationwide histopathology and cytopathology network and archive has been in operation in The Netherlands (PALGA), encompassing all sixty-four Dutch pathology laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Casparie et al., 2007</xref>). We coupled the data from our previous epidemiological study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mughini-Gras et al., 2018</xref>) to that of PALGA to retrieve tissue blocks corresponding to the patients with colon cancer that were registered at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) with a diagnosed NTS infection earlier in life (SL<sup>+</sup>) or not (SL<sup>-</sup>). Both groups were matched in age, gender, and tumor localization (proximal versus distal colon). Using PALGA registration, we localized and retrieved the corresponding tissue blocks through the network of pathology laboratories. We obtained 24 SL<sup>+</sup> and 67 SL<sup>-</sup> colon tumor blocks. The quality of the tissue blocks varied strongly, allowing only Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining and evaluation by an experienced pathologist at the Amsterdam University Medical Center (Amsterdam UMC). The evaluation was performed in a blinded manner. Tumor grading showed a tendency for the SL<sup>+</sup> tumors to be more differentiated – corresponding to a better prognosis - than SL<sup>-</sup> tumors (odds ratio 0.21, 95% CI 0.004-1.06; p-value 0.059; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These differences did not reach full statistical significance, likely due to the expected presence of background noise in both SL<sup>+</sup> and SL<sup>-</sup> groups. Indeed, the epidemiological definitions of the groups SL<sup>+</sup> and SL<sup>-</sup> are correlative but not causal, meaning that the SL<sup>+</sup> tumor also includes colon cancer development independent of NTS infection. Besides, the patients with SL<sup>-</sup> tumors may have been exposed to NTS while developing no or mild symptoms. Those most commonly mild and unreported infections are sufficient to promote colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">van Elsland et al., 2022</xref>) but are not registered as patients with an NTS infection. Despite these intrinsic limits, the outcomes of our pathology analyses are aligned with earlier research showing that colon tumors of patients with a history of NTS infection were mostly of low grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mughini-Gras et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest a different biology between tumors associated or not with NTS infection.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Transformation efficiency varies between clinical NTS strains</title><p id="P9">We aimed to identify potential features of clinical NTS strains that could promote tumor development. We retrieved clinical NTS strains associated with colon cancer utilizing previously linked data from the Dutch national surveillance system for <italic>Salmonella</italic> and the Netherlands Cancer Registry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mughini-Gras et al., 2018</xref>). Clinical NTS strains were sent from peripheral medical microbiological laboratories to the RIVM for further typing and storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Van Pelt, 2003</xref>). Using this collection, we defined as “case strains” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, red salmonellae) 30 clinical NTS strains isolated from patients with a reported NTS infection who developed proximal colon cancer at least one year after the reported salmonellosis in the period 2000-2015. In addition, we defined as “control strains” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, green salmonellae) 30 clinical NTS strains from the same <italic>Salmonella</italic> surveillance database, which were obtained from patients who did not develop colon cancer after infection (until at least the end of 2015). The control strains were selected to match (1:1 ratio) the case strains regarding serovar, type of infection (enteric, septicemic, etc.), year of infection, age at infection, and gender of the patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We previously reported that <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced cell transformation required at least two host pre-transforming steps before infection, in particular the inactivation of the p53 pathway (by knocking out Arf) and the overexpression of the proto-oncogene c-MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Scanu et al., 2015</xref>). We thus performed an <italic>in cellulo</italic> characterization of the 60 clinical strains in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) overexpressing c-MYC and <italic>Arf</italic>-deficient, a model cell line that allows monitoring transformation with classical anchorage-independent colony-forming assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Scanu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">van Elsland et al., 2022</xref>; Stévenin and Neefjes, 2023). We normalized the results to the transformation efficiency of the lab strain <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium SL1344 (later referred to as “reference strain”). We observed that 18 case strains (representing 60% of all case strains) and 10 control strains (representing 33% of all control strains) showed a higher transformation efficiency than the reference strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). On average, the case strains had a higher transformation efficiency compared to the control strains(1.66 vs. 1.15). The ratio between the paired values of the matching case-control strains was significantly different from 1.0 (ratio paired t-test, p=0.0123), meaning that case strains had a significantly higher transformation efficiency than their control strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that high transformation efficiency is a broadly spread feature of clinical NTS strains, also reflected by their clinical association with colon cancer.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Transformation efficiency correlates with invasion efficiency</title><p id="P11">We assessed the intrinsic capacity of the 60 clinical NTS strains to reach and invade their host cell. First, we used a 2-step <italic>in vitro</italic> gastrointestinal tract (GIT)-model to test the intrinsic capacity of the strains to survive during their passage through the GIT. For this, overnight cultures (ON) of NTS were diluted and incubated in a simulated gastric fluid (SGF) at 37 °C for 30 min, mimicking the gastric passage. Then, SGF cultures were diluted and incubated in a simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) at 37 °C for 2 h, mimicking the intestinal environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kuijpers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). We scored the SGF/ON, SIF/ON (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C-D</xref>) and SIF/SGF OD ratios for all strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). These ratios appeared independent from the strains’ <italic>in cellulo t</italic>ransformation efficiency based on a linear regression analysis suggesting that the GIT survival and transformation efficiency are intrinsic independent strain features. Besides, no statistically significant difference was observed between case and control strains based on conditional logistic regression analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). We then tested the capacity of the strains to attach to (ATT) and invade (INV) polarized enterocytes by performing gentamicin protection assays after infection of differentiated epithelial Caco2 cells. While there was again no significant difference between the case strains and control strains based on conditional logistic regression analysis, we found that INV/ON and INV/ATT ratios are correlated with the transformation efficiency (correlation coefficients: 0.41 and 0.32 respectively; orthogonal regression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In addition, we tested the invasion efficiency of the 60 clinical strains in the MEF model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), normalized by the invasion efficiency of the reference strain. Among the 60 clinical NTS strains, 24 had an invasion efficiency equivalent to or higher than the reference strain, 25 had an invasion efficiency at least 10 times lower than the reference strain, and 11 did not infect the MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). While the invasion efficiency of the control and case strains were not significantly different (t-test p&gt;0.05), the strains that could not invade the MEF mostly belonged to the control group (82%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Additionally, the transformation efficiency was significantly correlated to the invasion efficiency in MEFs (orthogonal regression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>; correlation coefficient: 0.67). These results are consistent with our previous observation that cell invasion is required for <italic>Salmonella-induced</italic> cell transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Scanu et al., 2015</xref>), and further link transformation efficiency and virulence.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Investigation of genomic features associated with transformation efficiency</title><p id="P13">To determine whether there were genetic markers that could explain the variability in transformation efficiency of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains, we performed several genome-wide association tests (GWAS) using all or a subset of the genomes of the 60 different clinical NTS. We observed that the presence or absence of plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) among the 60 NTS strains did not correlate with NTS transformation efficiency. We further analyzed the presence/absence of 233 <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence genes. 128 virulence genes were present in all NTS strains investigated, whereas 26 were found in none (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). This latter result concerned operons typical for <italic>S</italic>. Agona and <italic>S</italic>. Typhi, serotypes not included in the present study. Similarly to plasmids, variations in the presence/absence of virulence genes between the 60 strains did not correlate with NTS transformation efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">For more in-depth genetic comparison, we restricted the analysis to the combination of the two most abundant serovars: <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis and <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, corresponding to 22 and 18 clinical strains respectively (while other serovars had only 2-4 clinical strains each, limiting statistical power). Five genes appeared significantly associated with higher transformation efficiency in the <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium subset and four in the combined <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis/Typhimurium subset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). One of the significant genes of the <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium subset and three from the combined <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis/Typhimurium subset had unknown functions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). For the remaining genes, functional annotation revealed three proteins involved in UV protection and mutation of which two are part of the bacterial SOS response to DNA damage (UmuC and UmuD) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Eight out of nine of these genes are localized on plasmids. While the presence/absence of several genomic elements statistically correlates with clinical strain transformation efficiency, these elements were broadly present within high and low transformers, or only present in low transformers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), making their implication in bacterial-induced transformation doubtful.</p><p id="P15">Additionally, we compared the genome organization of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity islands (SPI) 1, 2, and 4 encoding the type 1 and 3 secretion systems (T1SS and T3SS) within 3 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium and 3 <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis clinical strains. We observed similar - if not almost identical - structures for both <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium and <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). Lower identity scores observed in SPI4, in an open reading frame (ORF) corresponding to an unknown protein, were due to low complexity genic regions that allow multiple matches between sequences. However, the protein sequences were heavily conserved for the majority of the clinical strains. Thus, we could not identify a convincing genetic feature associated with the transformation efficiency of clinical NTS strains.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Transcriptomic analyses link NTS transformation efficiency to high expression of particular metabolic genes</title><p id="P16">The lack of genetic features correlating with transformation efficiency raised the question of whether different gene expression levels could be associated with transformation efficiency. During its intracellular life, <italic>Salmonella</italic> regulates the transcription of specific genes necessary for the bacteria to enter, survive, and replicate in the eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Srikumar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Powers et al., 2021</xref>). To characterize the transcriptomic profile of NTS in association with their transformation efficiency, we selected eight NTS strains, corresponding to two high- and two low-transforming strains from both <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium and <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis with maximal genetic proximity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). The strains were grown under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions promoting the induction of SPI1 or SPI2, as previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kröger et al., 2013</xref>; Lober et al., 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Srikumar et al., 2015</xref>). The SPI1-inducing growth condition expectedly enables the induction of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> transcriptomic program as observed at the invasion and early stage of the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kröger et al., 2013</xref>). Once intracellular, <italic>Salmonella</italic> typically resides in a low pH <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (SCV) triggering SPI2 expression. While most SCV are turned into vacuolar replicative niches, about 10-20% of the SCV ruptures, leading to <italic>Salmonella</italic> release in the host cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gutierrez &amp; Enninga, 2022</xref>). The SPI2-inducing growth condition mimics the intravacuolar acidic low-phosphate environment and thus induces the <italic>Salmonella</italic> transcriptomic program as observed in the SCV from 1-2 h post-invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Löber et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, as similarities in gene expression in extracellular and cytosolic bacteria, in particular SPI1, have been reported, we suspect that the SPI1-inducing condition also partially summarizes cytosolic bacteria gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Powers et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Following RNA extraction and sequencing, the number of reads obtained varied extensively among and within the bacterial strains and experimental conditions, with the median number of reads mapping to coding DNA sequences (CDS) ranging between 6.2 and 7.8 million in the SPI1-inducing growth condition and between 9.2 and 17.6 million in the SPI2-inducing growth condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). We confirmed that the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth in SPI1- or SPI2-inducing conditions indeed led to the expression of SPI1 and SPI2, respectively, in the studied strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B-C</xref>). We then analyzed the differential gene expression between the strains with high and low transformation efficiencies and the corresponding pathway enrichment in each of the two experimental conditions. There was a low number of genes differentially expressed in the SPI1-inducing growth condition (n = 14 genes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>), and a significantly higher number in the SPI2-inducing growth condition (n = 387, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). This might indicate that the low- and high-transforming strains behave similarly under the SPI1-inducing condition and only show a different behavior under the SPI2-inducing condition. A vast majority of the genes overexpressed in the SPI2-inducing condition (n = 184) showed more than a log2-fold change (i.e. doubling; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). About half of the over-expressed genes (n = 201/401) were associated with a KEGG metabolic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). KEGG pathway enrichment analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>) indicated that numerous metabolism-associated genes were over-expressed in the SPI2-inducing growth condition, with carbohydrate, amino acid, and cofactors and vitamin metabolism highly active.

When the host cells survive such invasions, they are likely to keep a trace of these encounters. As a result, long-term side effects on the host can emerge after the acute infection phase and its recovery. Many “non-infectious” diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and very recently endometriosis, are now considered in light of previous infection events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">van Elsland and Neefjes, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Backhurst and Funk, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kivity et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Muraoka et al., 2023</xref>). Studying these long-term effects is technically challenging due to their low occurrence and long delay after infection. Here, we combined two nationwide patient registries to retrieve stored NTS strains isolated from patients &gt;1 year before colon cancer development. Pathology of colon tumors from patients either with a history of a severe NTS infection or not showed a different grading. This observation suggests that NTS infection may support a different colon cancer program than other tumor-inducing factors.</p><p id="P24">The clinical outcomes are dependent on host parameters (immune system, pre-existing colon mutations, etc.) that may counteract or synergize with the clinical NTS strain intrinsic transformation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lee-Six et al., 2019</xref>). To extract the potentially “dangerous” NTS strains from the many factors that may contribute to colon cancer formation, we measured the transformation efficiency of the clinical strains using an <italic>in cellulo</italic> assay, eliminating many variable host factors, and used these intrinsic transformation efficiency values for in-depth characterization of NTS features correlating with transformation. While we observed that cancer-associated NTS can transform cells <italic>in cellulo</italic>, we also noticed that a fraction of the control NTS strains isolated had a high transformation efficiency <italic>in cellulo</italic>, suggesting that cell transformation is a widely spread attribute of clinical NTS. Despite the multifactorial etiology of cancer with the cumulative influence of environmental and genetic carcinogenic factors, we could observe a correlation between <italic>in cellulo</italic> assessment of NTS strain transformation efficiency and clinical association as the case strains had higher transformation efficiency than their matching control strains.</p><p id="P25">Our study reveals that the strain attachment and invasion efficiency in polarized Caco2 cells, and invasion efficiency in MEF are positively correlated with the transformation efficiency, although they could not completely explain the variation herein. Therefore, the success of bacteria in transforming eukaryotic cells is partly dependent on their ability to attach and invade these cells. As <italic>Salmonella</italic> has to infect a pre-transformed cell in order to induce transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Scanu et al., 2015</xref>), an increased invasion capacity is likely to foster the chance for the bacteria to encounter pre-transformed cells in the gut and promote cancer.</p><p id="P26">We used the transformation efficiency measured for each strain to test for correlating genomic and transcriptomic features. While there were very few and inconclusive genetic features whose presence/absence was associated with transformation efficiency, the transcriptomic analysis identified several hundred genetic features with differential expression across the spectrum of transformation efficiency. These results suggest that the transformation efficiency of NTS is not necessarily defined by the genetic makeup of the bacteria but by the differential expression of particular genes. Previous research has also shown that even though related bacterial strains have similar gene contents, transcription factor binding sites can be easily gained or lost, with subsequent impact on the transcription patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Perez and Groisman, 2009</xref>). Although we could not identify a clear-cut separation of pathways enriched in the two categories of transformation efficiency, there appeared to be entire operons differentially expressed between them. Thus, in the SPI2-inducing condition, high-transforming strains seem to overexpress genes associated with flagellar assembly, chemotaxis, energy metabolism, and signal transduction, while the low-transforming strains, under the same experimental conditions, appear to overexpress genes related to quorum sensing. Flagellar assembly has been suggested to be coupled with the progression through the cellular cycle and the formation of a differentiated daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Mangan et al., 1999</xref>). This correlates with our finding that high NTS transformation efficiency is accompanied by high intracellular growth of the bacteria. Additionally, a high level of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis is consistent with the higher need for energy of an increasing bacterial population. One of the few pathways that appeared to be enriched only in low transformers – that of quorum sensing – contains genes that are also linked to signal transduction and that promote intramacrophage multiplication of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gannoun-Zaki et al., 2014</xref>); this set of signal transduction genes is smaller and different from the one in high transformers and possibly with lower efficiency in bacterial growth. This suggests that the bacterial strains with differential transformation efficiencies use preferentially alternative signaling pathways. Aligned to this, we found that in the SPI2-inducing condition, the high-transforming strains expressed more genes belonging to specific regulons than the low-transforming strains. This result indicates that the high transformers may be more sensitive to environmental cues present in the SPI2-inducing condition that are detected by regulatory proteins. This hypothesis is fostered by our microscopy observations of faster induction of SPI2 in the high-transforming strains.</p><p id="P27">Whether the differential expression of some bacterial genes is directly involved in promoting mammalian cell transformation is unclear. A technical difficulty behind this objective is that we did not identify a specific pathway that was activated, but rather many pathways associated with the observed phenotype of high metabolic flexibility and intracellular fitness. Based on our results, we can propose that <italic>Salmonella’s</italic> metabolic flexibility and intracellular fitness may induce host cell transformation, possibly due to the host metabolic shift generated by <italic>Salmonella</italic> growth.</p><p id="P28">Non-mutually exclusive models suggest the involvement of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> effectors SopB and AvrA, coinciding with activated host Akt and JNK pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Scanu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Of note, both Akt and JNK pathways are also involved in metabolic reprogramming and cancer metabolism (Papa et al., 2019; Hoxhaj and Manning, 2020), suggesting a cumulative effect of <italic>Salmonella</italic> hijacking mechanisms pushing for metabolic reprogramming and cell transformation. Besides, we previously showed that the overexpression of the proto-oncogene cMYC was required to observe fibroblast transformation after <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, using an anchorage-independent growth assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Scanu et al., 2015</xref>), and cMYC is also one of the key players regulating cancer cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dong et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, <italic>Salmonella</italic> tropism towards (pre-)transformed cells suggests a cumulative effect during repetitive exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Forbes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">van Elsland et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aganja et al., 2022</xref>).

Single-end or paired-end sequence reads were generated using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 or MiSeq system. The sequences generated with the MiSeq and NovaSeq 6000 sequencers were performed under accreditation according to the scope of BaseClear B.V. (L457; NEN-EN-ISO/IEC 17025). Fastq sequence files were generated using bcl2fastq version 2.20 (Illumina). The samples went through two steps of quality assessment. The initial quality assessment was based on data passing the Illumina Chastity filtering. Subsequently, reads containing the PhiX control signal were removed using an in-house filtering protocol. In addition, reads containing (partial) adapters were clipped (up to a minimum read length of 50 bp). The second quality assessment was based on the remaining reads using the FastQC quality control tool version 0.11.8.</p><p id="P43">Based on the pangenome (see section Genomic analyses) we have selected from NCBI a reference sequence with minimum distance to our bacterial strains of interest – <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium SL1344. The reference genome was annotated for the presence of pathogenicity islands (coined as “regulons” in Avital et al., 2017, and Westermann et al., 2016) using blast 2.10.1 against the PAIDB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Yoon et al., 2015</xref>; accessed 05 July 2021), and for putative operons using the Operon-mapper web server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Taboada et al., 2018</xref>). Mapping of the reads to the reference genome was performed with Kallisto v 0.46.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bray et al., 2016</xref>) and subsequent filtering of the reads mapping to various species of RNA (ribosomal, transfer, and transfer-messenger) was performed in R v&gt;4.1. The various bacterial strains showed differences in their genomes (see Genomic analyses) with some genomic loci being present in only a fraction of the strains. To reduce a possible bias in differential gene expression, we have filtered the genomic loci to include only the ones present in all bacterial strains. The differential gene expressions were analyzed in the R package <italic>DSeq2</italic> v 1.40 using three subsets of the RNAseq sequences: SPI2 vs SPI1, low transformers vs high transformers for each experimental condition (SPI1- and SPI2-induction).

Briefly, the quantification is based on redox technology, in which cell respiration is measured by the degree of irreversible reduction of a tetrazolium dye. Following Biolog instructions, a cell suspension of each individual cultured NTS strain and a defined medium (including a dye) were added to 96-well plates containing a single C-, N-, P-, or S-source in each well. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24h and color formation was measured every 15 min using an ELx808 Microplate Reader and Gen5 software (BioTek).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Intracellular growth analyses</title><p id="P45">Cells were grown in a 4-chamber Ibidi glass-bottom dish. The day before the infection, bacteria were grown overnight in 5 mL Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium at 37°C in an orbital shaker (220 rpm). Growth media was supplemented with 100 mg/mL ampicillin or 25 mg/mL kanamycin depending on the resistance cassette of the plasmids (pGG2 and pFPV25-cR-2iG, respectively). On the day of the infection, bacteria were subcultured at a 1:33 dilution in LB and incubated at 37°C for 3 h (i.e., until the late exponential phase). Bacteria were then washed once and resuspended in EM buffer (120 mM NaCl, 7 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.8 mM Mg Cl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM glucose, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.3). Bacterial concentration was determined using OD<sub>600</sub>, and bacteria were diluted to the desired multiplicity of infection (MOI) in warm EM buffer. Bacteria were added to the cells and incubated for 30 min at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cells were gently washed 2-3 times with EM buffer to eliminate extracellular bacteria. The cell medium was changed for EM buffer supplemented with 10% FBS and gentamicin at 20 mg/mL and the cells were placed in a microscope chamber at 37°C, 5% CO2. Confocal microscopy was performed on an Andor Dragonfly 200 spinning disk microscope equipped with 40x/1.30 oil HCX Plan Apo objective, 63x/1.40-0.60 oil Plan Apo objective, and an Andor Zyla 4.2 PLUS sCMOS Camera. 3 fields of view were selected per conditions and all conditions were acquired in parallel every 5 min for 12 h. Z-stacks of 5.5 μm with 0.3 μm steps were acquired in both the GFP (laser 488 nm) and dsRed (laser 561 nm) channels. Maximum z-projections were performed on all movies and the number of positive dsRed pixels (above noise threshold) was measured over time using ImageJ v1.5. The number of bacteria was estimated by dividing the number of positive pixels by the average pixel size of one bacterial cell (estimated over 100 bacteria). To quantify SPI2 induction, a binary image was created on ImageJ using the dsRed channel to detect the position of the bacteria at each time frame and the number of GFP-positive bacteria per field was divided by the number of dsRed-positive bacteria. The strains “SE low CO_SE_05” and “SE low CO_SE_07” were excluded from this analysis as the too-low number of bacteria per field generated a high variability and negative bias in the #bacteria GFP+ /#bacteria dsRed+ ratio.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Quantification And Statistical Analysis</title><sec id="S25"><title>Statistical analysis of NTS infection and transformation efficiency</title><p id="P46">Each strain infection efficiency and transformation efficiency were measured independently 2 times (biological replicate).

The ratio of the integrals of each C-, N-, P-, and S-source and a negative control (i.e. the PM1, PM3, and PM4 plates contain a negative control well without substrate for each source type), was used as the outcome for further analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were performed on the scaled data for each of the three plates to compare the metabolic phenotypes of NTS strains obtained from cases versus controls taking into account the transformation efficiency of the strains. We defined the optimal clustering method for hierarchical clustering and the average linkage clustering fit best to the data (lowest Gower distance and highest cophenetic correlation). Spearman’s rank correlation test followed by Bonferroni correction were used for multiple testing of correlations between substrate utilization and transformation efficiency.

Then the dsRed-positive bacteria were used as a mask to detect the GFP-positive bacteria. This allowed to detect only the bacterial GFP signal and avoid detecting the GFP signal from the MEF nuclei.
