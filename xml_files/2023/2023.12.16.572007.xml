Through genetic and pharmacologic manipulation, we show that [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG provides a sensitive and specific marker of NRF2 activation in advanced preclinical models of NSCLC. We validate imaging readouts with metabolomic measurements of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> activity and their coupling to intracellular glutathione concentration. A redox gene signature was measured in patients from the TRACERx 421 cohort, suggesting an opportunity for patient stratification prior to imaging. Furthermore, we reveal that system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> is a metabolic vulnerability that can be therapeutically targeted for sustained tumour growth suppression in aggressive NSCLC.

This antioxidant program is mediated in part by the transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor two (NRF2, <italic>NFE2L2</italic>). Under normal conditions, NRF2 protein levels are controlled by its negative regulator, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). KEAP1 binds to NRF2 in the cytosol, recruiting the Cullin-3 (Cul3) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex which ubiquitinates NRF2, leading to its proteasomal degradation. Under conditions of oxidative stress, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidise key cysteine residues in KEAP1 (C226, C273 and C288), altering its conformation, thereby impairing the degradation of NRF2. Newly translated NRF2 subsequently accumulates in the cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup></p><p id="P3">Cancer cells exploit NRF2 activation as a pro-survival technique to overcome insult from ROS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. NRF2 stabilisation is facilitated by either gain of function mutations in NRF2, or loss of function mutations in KEAP1. Additionally, epigenetic alterations, including CpG <italic>KEAP1</italic> promoter hypermethylation, mutations in the Cul3 ligase complex, and oncogene-dependent transcriptional upregulation, alter KEAP1 function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Following its stabilisation, NRF2 directly upregulates enzymes that control glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis; enzymes involved in phase 2 drug metabolism, such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>; drug efflux pumps, including ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>; homologous DNA repair proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>; and anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Unsurprisingly, hyperactivation of NRF2 results in resistance to a broad range of traditional and emerging therapies, including chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, radiotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and more recently, escape from KRAS G12C inhibitor treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Activating mutations in NRF2/KEAP1 are found in approximately a third of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, with NRF2 activation associated with a worse prognosis in patients treated with first-line therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Ten-year survival rates for NSCLC are stuck at approximately 5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, meaning there is an urgent clinical need to identify patients with poor prognosis and develop therapeutics that exploit specific vulnerabilities in these aggressive tumour subtypes. One of the &gt;200 cytoprotective proteins directly regulated by NRF2 is system X<sub>c</sub><sup>−17</sup>. System x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> is a heterodimeric transporter that consists of two subunits: the functional transporter and light chain xCT <italic>(SLC7A11)</italic>, which confirms substrate specificity, and CD98hc <italic>(SLC3A2)</italic>, the membrane protein common to many amino acid transporters which is responsible for membrane localisation and activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. System x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> functions to exchange the intracellular amino acid glutamate for extracellular cystine, which, following reduction to cysteine, provides the rate-limiting precursor for <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of GSH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, the body’s most abundant antioxidant.</p><p id="P5">We have previously evaluated the positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer (<italic>S</italic>)-4-(3-<sup>18</sup>F-fluoropropyl)-L-glutamate ([<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG) as a specific measure of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> activity in living subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In the current study, we investigated whether tumour-intrinsic KEAP1/NRF2 mutations could be non-invasively imaged by [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG PET imaging and whether aberrant system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> expression could be exploited for treatment of refractive NSCLC tumours. Across a panel of NSCLC lines and through pharmacological and genetic manipulation of NRF2, we found that [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG provided a sensitive readout of NRF2 activation. To assess the translational relevance of our findings, we examined [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG retention in mice bearing orthotopically grown NRF2-high and NRF2-low NSCLC tumours, in the Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>; p53<sup>flox/flox</sup> adenocarcinoma model with and without Nrf2<sup>D29H</sup> mutations, and in patient-derived human xenografts. [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG retention was significantly higher in tumours with constitutively active NRF2 activity across these varied animal models of NSCLC. Having used imaging to identify NRF2-high NSCLC tumours, we finally showed that a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> induced prolonged tumour growth suppression in drug-resistant cancer. Taken together, our study reveals that NRF2 activation provides a metabolic susceptibility for targeted imaging and treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p id="P6">Human NSCLC lines A549, H460, H1944, H1792, H23, H1299, H1975 and H1650 were purchased from LGC Ltd.

Despite a revolution in new anti-cancer therapies, such as check-point inhibitors and proton beam therapy, durable responses are often not observed due to acquired or innate resistance to existing treatment regimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Currently, there is no satisfactory way to identify patients that are refractive to therapy early on in their treatment pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Treatment failure plays a critical role in the management of patients with NSCLC, where survival rates have struggled to improve over the last ten years despite advances in prevention, screening and treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In NSCLC, constitutive NRF2 activation results in resistance across the spectrum of currently available therapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. A non-invasive measure of NRF2 activation may therefore provide an attractive solution for the prediction of therapy resistance in NSCLC, which may further reveal cancer-specific vulnerabilities for the precision treatment of refractive disease.</p><p id="P44">Using a combination of metabolomics, genetic engineering, drug treatment, and biochemical analyses, we comprehensively demonstrated the ability of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> to report on NRF2 activation. In NSCLC cells grown in culture, KEAP1 loss-of-function mutations significantly increased xCT expression, had higher cystine consumption from the medium, and decreased intracellular glutamate concentrations – features indicative of increased cystine/glutamate exchange by system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup>. Given that cystine influx drives GSH biosynthesis, it was unsurprising that NRF2-high cells had elevated steady-state GSH and a concomitant reduction in ROS. Similar observations were made when KEAP1 WT cells were treated with the KEAP1/NRF2 inhibitor KI696: xCT was increased, along with GSH concentration and cystine utilisation. NRF2 depletion in KEAP1 mutant A549 cells has the opposite effect, which was rescued following ectopic expression of NRF2.</p><p id="P45">[<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG PET has been used to image system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> activity in a range of human malignancies, including NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Although exclusively used in clinical trials as a diagnostic agent, we<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> have shown that [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG is a sensitive marker of therapy-induced changes in tumour redox status. Here, disruption of redox homeostasis through NRF2 activation increased [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG cell retention; changes that were tightly correlated to cellular GSH concentration (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.89). Interestingly, whilst the R272L NRF2 mutation in H1944 cells increased both NRF2 and xCT expression, increased GSH and [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG retention compared to WT cells was muted, suggesting that not just system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> activity, but the fate of its substrates is reflected in the imaging readouts. In our genetic models and following pharmacological intervention, [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG retention mirrored NRF2 activation levels.</p><p id="P46">Whilst other non-radioactive assays are better suited to evaluate NRF2 status in isolated cells, PET imaging facilitates the measurement of biochemical processes across the whole body, permitting assessment of the entire tumour burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. This is of particular importance when evaluating clonal heterogeneity, as was evident in our PDX model studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). The TRACERx consortium has pioneered multi-region tumour sampling and phenotyping using next-generation sequencing approaches, revealing new insights into tumour evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. However, this extensive tumour characterisation, using specialised clinical and data analysis pipelines, is currently limited to a minority of patients in research studies. Alternatively, [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG imaging could be made available to patients at most major hospitals which currently use [<sup>18</sup>F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG) for tumour staging/restaging. Across a range of genetically engineered, patient-derived, and orthoptic NSCLC models, [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG retention was increased in tumours with NRF2 activation compared to tumours with a normal-functioning NRF2/KEAP1 axis. The heterogeneity of this imaging signal was reflected in <italic>ex vivo</italic> markers of NRF2, xCT, and GSH, providing further evidence that [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG reports on tumour redox status. Importantly, RNA sequencing data from TRACERx patients suggested that a ‘redox signature’ of NRF2-regulated genes that could be used to select patients for further monitoring by [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG PET imaging.</p><p id="P47">Given that NRF2 and xCT are intrinsically interconnected, and NRF2 confers therapy resistance, we investigated whether xCT was a vulnerability that could be exploited for the treatment of refractive disease. We assessed an xCT-specific ADC, HM30-tesirine, in mice bearing H460 tumours which harbour the D236H KEAP1 loss-of-function mutation. H460 tumours are intrinsically therapy-resistant, due in-part to NRF2 activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, with cisplatin treatment yielding only a moderate reduction in tumour growth rate. Conversely, HM30-tesirine treatment resulted in sustained tumour growth suppression and decreased proliferation, which was maintained following removal of treatment, likely due to the long circulation half-life of the ADC. Importantly, HM30-tesirine significantly extended the lives of H460 tumour-bearing mice compared to both cisplatin- and vehicle-treated animals. Small molecule drugs that target xCT, such as imidazole ketone erastin and sorafenib, have also displayed potent anti-tumour effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. However, the relatively poor metabolic stability of these therapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, and additional mechanisms of action besides xCT inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, may preclude their future clinical utility. This first-in-class xCT ADC may circumvent some of these issues, providing a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of refractive NSCLC.</p><p id="P48">Despite these advances, the imaging and targeted treatment of NSCLC with high system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> expression holds specific challenges. [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG is bidirectionally transported across the plasma membrane. As shown here, tumours with high NRF2 not only have elevated uptake, but also increased efflux from the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Consequently, net [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG in NRF2 activated tumours was increased ~3-fold compared to NRF2 WT tumours, despite orders of magnitude differences in protein expression. Moreover, the activity of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> is not solely driven by transporter expression, but by the concentrations of both cystine and glutamate across the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Nutrient composition in the tumour microenvironment, or metabolic alterations (e.g. anaplerosis), may therefore affect [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG irrespective of NRF2 status. Antibody-based approaches (such as HM30-tesirine) are not dependent on transporter activity and may therefore simplify therapeutic strategies. System x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> however is not exclusively expressed on tumour cells, with high expression found in the brain, pancreas, and components of the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Although HM30-tesirine was well tolerated in mice, patients receiving xCT-targeted therapies should be monitored for on-target, off-tumour toxicity. As with any other surrogate marker, system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> expression is also influenced by factors other than NRF2, such as ATF4, p53, and CD44v<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Consequently, prospective clinical trials are required to assess the specificity of [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG for NRF2 in humans and to determine the thresholds of [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG retention to classify tumours into NRF2-high or NRF2-low.</p><p id="P49">In summary, we describe the use of a clinically-tested PET radiotracer, [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG, for the imaging of NRF2 activation in NSCLC. This study sets the foundation for the clinical assessment of NRF2 in NSCLC patients with [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG at King’s College London (clinical trials number: NCT05889312). If successful, the combined imaging and xCT-targeted treatment of NSCLC with activating NRF2/KEAP1 mutations may represent a new paradigm for patients with therapy-resistant disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="extended-data" id="S31"><title>Extended Data</title><fig id="F7" position="anchor"><label>Extended Figure 1</label><caption><title>Time course of [<sup>18</sup>F]FSPG efflux across NRF2-high (red) and NRF2-low NSCLC cells (blue).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS192884-f007"/></fig><fig id="F8" position="anchor"><label>Extended Figure 2</label><caption><title>Representative BLI from mice orthotopically implanted with H460 FLuc and H1299 FLuc tumour cells.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS192884-f008"/></fig><fig id="F9" position="anchor"><label>Extended Figure 3</label><caption><p id="P50">Representative single slice PET/CT images from mice orthotopically implanted with H460 FLuc and H1299 FLuc tumour cells.
