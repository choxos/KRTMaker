Yet most miRNA profiling efforts remain at the tissue and organ levels. To overcome challenges in accessing the microRNomes from tissue-embedded cells, we had previously developed mime-seq (<italic><underline>mi</underline>RNome by <underline>me</underline>thylation dependent sequencing), a</italic> technique in which cell-specific miRNA methylation in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> enabled chemo-selective sequencing without the need for cell sorting or biochemical purification. Here, we present mime-seq 2.0 for profiling miRNAs from specific mouse cell types. We engineered a chimeric RNA methyltransferase that is tethered to Argonaute and efficiently methylates miRNAs at their 3´-terminal 2´OH in mouse and human cell lines. We also generated a transgenic mouse for conditional expression of this methyltransferase, which can be used to direct methylation of miRNAs in a cell-type of choice. We validated the use of this mouse by profiling miRNAs from B cells and bone marrow plasma cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">MicroRNAs play crucial roles in physiology and development of animals, with individual miRNA expression being highly dependent on the respective cell type. We previously developed mime-seq to retrieve the miRNomes of specific cell types within developing <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> or <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Mime-seq relies on transgenic expression of Hen1 from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (At-Hen1), a methyltransferase involved in the plant miRNA biogenesis pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. With two dsRNA-binding domains, At-Hen1 recognizes products of Dicer cleavage and positions the 3´ 2-nt overhangs of these 21-24 nt long RNA duplexes in the catalytic domain for 2´O-methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Transgenic expression of At-Hen1 under cell-specific promoters in worms and flies resulted in efficient cell-specific miRNA methylation. Methylated microRNAs were then selectively detected by performing an oxidation treatment prior to standard small RNA cloning and sequencing. Oxidation by NaIO<sub>4</sub> renders the terminal ribose of unmethylated miRNAs non-ligatable while the presence of 2´OMe prevents oxidation and leaves the 3´OH intact and available for adaptor ligation and subsequent sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Because mime-seq proved to be useful for miRNA profiling in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we set out to adapt it for use in mammalian systems, specifically in mice.</p><p id="P3">To this end, we transfected codon-optimized and Myc-tagged At-Hen1 into human HEK293T cells and assessed miRNA methylation by oxidation of the terminal ribose followed by β-elimination. This treatment removes the 3’-terminal nucleoside of unmethylated but not of methylated miRNAs and causes accelerated migration in high-resolution PAGE that can be visualized by northern blotting (Alefelder, 1998)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In contrast to what we had seen in worms and flies, we were unable to detect 2´O-methylation of endogenous miRNAs, despite detectable expression of At-Hen1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 1 b, c</xref>). This was not because the enzyme made in HEK293T cells was inactive, as immunopurified Myc-At-Hen1 from HEK293T was fully active in an <italic>in vitro</italic> methylation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>). This suggested that the difference in At-Hen1 activity in worms and flies versus human cells may reflect different availability of the miRNA duplex generated by Dicer, as in mammals Dicer cleavage is coupled to Argonaute loading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. To circumvent this, we engineered an alternative methyltransferase to meet the mechanistic requirements of the miRNA biogenesis pathway in mammals.</p><p id="P4">To develop a suitable methyltransferase, we decided to modify <italic>Mus musculus</italic> HENMT. mHENMT is a methyltransferase specifically expressed in mouse testis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, where it is required for piRNA 2´O-methylation at the 3´ terminal ribose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Specificity for piRNA methylation is determined by the C-terminal domain of mHENMT that directly interacts with Piwi proteins in which piRNAs are loaded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Contrary to At-Hen1, substrates of mHENMT are single-stranded RNAs of varying lengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. To repurpose mHENMT for miRNA methylation, we removed the C-terminal domain and replaced it with a peptide that binds to the Argonaute (AGO) proteins that load miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The GW/TNRC6 family of proteins bind AGO to mediate its repressive function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. An 84-amino acid peptide derived from TNRC6B, referred to as T6B peptide, has been shown to effectively interact with all four mouse AGOs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that tethering HENMT to AGO via the T6B peptide might force methylation of loaded miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). <italic>We</italic> tested the activity of full-length mHENMT (HENMT<sup>FL</sup>), a C-terminal truncation mutant (HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>) and the same mutant fused to T6B (HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B) by stable integration in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and transient transfection in HEK293T cells. Using β-elimination and high-resolution northern blots, we observed that only HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B, but not a catalytic mutant or any of the non-T6B versions, methylated miRNAs in MEFs and in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 1e, f</xref>). During these experiments, we noticed variable expression levels of the enzymes, with HENMT<sup>∆C</sup> and HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B having higher expression level than the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). To exclude that expression levels alone determine the large differences in activity, we cloned all HENMTs under a doxycycline inducible TRE3 promoter and integrated them using a lentiviral system into the human cell line RKO. After titrating doxycycline levels to achieve similar expression levels, still only HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B showed detectable methylation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 1g, h</xref>). We note that codon-optimized At-Hen1 could never be expressed at levels close to mHENMT. In sum, we designed a new chimeric enzyme that efficiently methylates miRNAs in human (HEK293T and RKO) and mouse (MEF) cells in culture.</p><p id="P5">The inducible HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B enabled examination of methylation dynamics, by sequencing small RNAs at different times post expression induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). We used methylated small RNA spike-ins for normalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, which were added before each sample was split in two, one half was sequenced after the oxidation treatment, and the other half without oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). This analysis showed that after 48 hours, 92.6% of miRNAs were methylated ≥5%, which was sufficient for their enrichment after oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). At 48 hours, the miRNAs detected after oxidation represent the top 98.2% of the cumulative miRNA reads in RKO cells, indicating that the physiologically important miRNAs are readily captured by mime-seq 2.0. Importantly, expression of HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B did not affect miRNA levels compared to untransduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Although miRNAs appeared to be methylated with varying rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>), perhaps relating to miRNA biogenesis and turnover dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, sequencing methylated miRNAs at steady state maintained overall information on relative miRNA expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Thus, mime-seq 2.0 is semi-quantitative. Altogether, these experiments indicate that HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B efficiently methylates miRNAs without substantial bias and should enable the implementation of mime-seq in mammals.</p><p id="P6">To implement mime-seq 2.0 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated the <italic>R26</italic><sup>LSL-HenT6B/+</sup> mouse line by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in 2-cell embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Methods</xref>). Upon Cre-mediated deletion of the loxP-Stop-loxP (LSL) cassette, the resulting <italic>R26</italic><sup>HenT6B/+</sup> mice give rise to conditional expression of the HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B-P2A-eGFP gene from the ubiquitously expressed CAG promoter in the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus. Hence, specific expression of HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B in different cell types can be achieved with appropriate cell type-specific Cre lines. The murine hematopoietic system is ideal for validating the HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B-dependent mime-seq <italic>in vivo</italic>. First, because cells are more easily accessible than in other tissues, we can directly compare miRNAs from a purified cell population to a cell mixture, to evaluate the performance of mime-seq. Second, because the different cells of the lineage can be analyzed by flow cytometry, we could quantitatively assess the effect of HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B expression in different cell types. This is particularly important given that overexpression of a T6B peptide in the mouse was used as a competitive inhibitor to decrease miRNA function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and that inhibition of miRNA activity causes various defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. We first expressed HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B specifically in B cells using the <italic>Cd79a</italic>-Cre line, which induces Cre activity in pro-B and all subsequent stages of B cell development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. As shown by flow-cytometric analysis, pro-B, pre-B, recirculating and total B cells in the bone marrow as well as mature B cells in the spleen were minimally affected in <italic>Cd79a</italic>-Cre <italic>R26</italic><sup>LSL-HenT6B/+</sup> and <italic>Cd79a</italic>-Cre <italic>R26</italic><sup>LSL-HenT6B/LSL-HenT6B</sup> mice compared with control <italic>R26</italic><sup>LSL-HenT6B/LSL-HenT6B</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 3b, c</xref>). Moreover, GFP and, by inference, HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B were expressed in splenic B cells, but not in T cells of <italic>Cd79a</italic>-Cre <italic>R26</italic><sup>LSL-HenT6B/+</sup> and <italic>Cd79a</italic>-Cre <italic>R26</italic><sup>LSL-HenT6B/LSL-HenT6B</sup> mice, although the expression was slightly variegated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>).The presence of the different B cell types in <italic>Cd79a</italic>-Cre <italic>R26</italic><sup>LSL-HenT6B/LSL-HenT6B</sup> mice is contrasted by the strong reduction of pre-B cells and absence of all subsequent B cell stages upon conditional Dicer deletion, leading to the loss of all miRNAs in <italic>Cd79a</italic>-Cre <italic>Dicer1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. We conclude that the expression of HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B minimally affects B cell development and is thus compatible with normal miRNA function.</p><p id="P7">To assess the efficiency and specificity of mime-seq <italic>in vivo</italic>, we isolated CD43<sup>–</sup> mature B cells from the spleen of <italic>Cd79a</italic>-Cre <italic>R26</italic><sup>LSL-HenT6B/+</sup>, <italic>Cd79a</italic>-Cre <italic>R26</italic><sup>LSL-HenT6B/LSL-HenT6B</sup> and control <italic>R26</italic><sup>LSL-HenT6B/LSL-HenT6B</sup> mice by immunomagnetic depletion of non-B cells. We extracted total RNA, added a mix of methylated and unmethylated spike-ins (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Methods</xref>) and generated small RNA sequencing libraries with and without prior oxidation treatment. After normalization to the methylated spike-ins, we observed that libraries from unoxidized samples showed no significant differences across all genotypes, indicating that expression of HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B does not affect miRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Second, we observed that upon oxidation, miRNAs from the mature B cells of control <italic>R26</italic><sup>LSL-HenT6B/LSL-HenT6B</sup> mice were depleted to levels comparable with unmethylated spike-ins, indicating that the oxidation treatment efficiently removes non-methylated miRNAs from the pool of sequenced miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). In contrast, HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B expressing B cells showed efficient recovery of miRNAs after oxidation, with the homozygous <italic>Cd79a</italic>-Cre <italic>R26</italic><sup>LSL-HenT6B/LSL-HenT6B</sup> B cells showing higher levels of methylation/recovery after oxidation than heterozygous <italic>Cd79a</italic>-Cre <italic>R26</italic><sup>LSL-HenT6B/+</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). Importantly, the relative abundance of miRNAs recovered after oxidation was highly similar to the relative abundance of miRNAs in B cells without methylation or oxidation treatment, again showing the semi-quantitative nature of mime-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In addition, miRNAs recovered after oxidation included all miRNA families known to be important for B cell development and homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). As the CD43<sup>–</sup> mature B cells also contained a fraction of contaminating erythrocytes, we could demonstrate that miRNAs known to be absent from B cells, like the erythrocyte-specific miR-451a and miR-144<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, were fully depleted upon oxidation even if they were present at high levels in the starting sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). To summarize, mime-seq 2.0 enables specific detection of miRNAs from a cell of interest without strongly influencing miRNA expression and without causing detrimental effects that would be expected from a loss of miRNA function.</p><p id="P8">As the main advantage of mime-seq is to facilitate miRNA profiling in rare cell populations, it is important to assess its sensitivity. As the <italic>Bhlha15</italic> (Mist1) gene is specifically expressed in plasma cells (PCs) within the hematopoietic system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, we used the <italic>Bhlha15</italic>-Cre line for conditional activation of HENMT<sup>∆C</sup>-T6B expression in splenic PCs. Seven days after immunization with sheep red blood cells, GFP<sup>+</sup> PCs (CD138<sup>+</sup>TACI<sup>+</sup>) were isolated from the spleen of <italic>Bhlha15</italic>-Cre <italic>R26</italic><sup>LSL-HenT6B/LSL-HenT6B</sup> mice by flow-cytometric sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>) and were then mixed at different ratios with wild-type C57BL/6 splenocytes, followed by miRNA sequencing before and after oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). The miRNA profiles of PCs (100%) and splenocytes (0.01% PCs) are highly similar with one miRNA exclusively expressed in PCs, miR-148a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>), which is necessary for PC differentiation and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Highlighting the specificity and sensitivity of mime-seq, miR-148a was robustly detected in cell mixes containing 1% and 0.1% PCs, and, although the signal was overall lower, miR-148a was even detected above background in a population with only 0.01% PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>). As expected, miRNAs that are expressed in both PCs and splenocytes were enriched to a lower degree than a highly cell-specific miRNA like miR-148a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Data Table 2</xref>), but we could still use the full miRNomes to more broadly assess specificity and sensitivity. We first determined a reference PC miRNome composed of 85 miRNAs that account for the top 98% of cumulative reads in the oxidized purified PC population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). We did not use the unoxidized sample because it still contains erythrocytes, given the presence of specific erythrocyte miRNAs that are eliminated after oxidation. We then asked how many of these miRNAs are robustly detected (in the 98<sup>th</sup> top percentile) after oxidation in the various cell mixes, and also show significant enrichment after oxidation (ox/unox ratio above a cutoff set as the average + standard deviation of the ox/unox ratio of the unmethylated spike-ins, which represent the maximum expected depletion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 5b-d</xref>). With these cutoffs, we detected 0 false positives (FPs) in the 1% PC mix and 3 FPs in the 0.1% mix. Moreover, in the 1% PC mix, we recovered 40 of all 85 PC miRNAs, but most importantly we retrieved 5 of the top 5, 9 of the top 10, 22 of the top 25, and 36 of the top 50 PC miRNAs. In the 0.1% mix we still detected 26/50 of the top 50 miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 5c-d</xref>). Our results suggest that mime-seq retrieves the most likely physiologically relevant miRNAs (based on abundance and cell-specific expression) in cells that are present in as little as 1/1000 in a mixed cell population.</p><p id="P9">In summary, mime-seq 2.0 enables sequencing of miRNAs from rare cell types of the mouse. For cell-specific methylation, a conditional <italic>R26</italic><sup>LSL-HenT6B/LSL-HenT6B</sup> mouse line was generated that can be crossed with a Cre driver of choice to ultimately induce cell-specific miRNA methylation in the selected cell population. Notably, double heterozygote mice already provide sufficient methylation for the implementation of mime-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). Selective cloning and sequencing of 2´O-methylated miRNAs allows semi-quantitative profiling of miRNAs in the cell type of choice.

Start/end gaps were not penalized. The cumulative alignment score was length-normalized, and reads were filtered (‘no_adapter’ reads) by comparing to a minimum score (0.9 in our experiments). Sequences upstream of the aligned adapter were extracted and interpreted as sRBC barcode (5nt) and UMI (6nt). Sequences upstream of the UMI were then extracted and interpreted as small RNA reads. Small RNA reads shorter than 18nt (‘too_short’) and reads where the extracted sRBC barcode did not match the expectation (‘wrong_srbc’, e.g., due-to cross-sample contamination) were filtered. The resulting pre-filtered FASTQ files were then further processed by fastp (v0.20.1) which was configured to first trim 4nt off the read start and then filter reads based on quality (default settings) and a minimum remaining read length of 18nt (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4</xref> for example statistics).</p><p id="P26">We then filtered and counted reads stemming from our 8 different spike-in RNAs (see below) by aligning the spike-in sequences to the read, allowing for one mismatch.

Soft-clipped bases at the 3’ends of the reads were interpreted as tails, extracted, and counted. Counts of multimapping reads were normalized by the number of optimal alignment positions (1/NH).
