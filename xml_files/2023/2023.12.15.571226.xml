A trimeric mammalian holophosphatase comprised of a PP1 catalytic subunit, the conserved C-terminally located ∼70 amino acid core of a substrate-specific regulatory subunit (PPP1R15A/GADD34 or PPP1R15B/CReP) and G-actin (an essential co-factor) efficiently dephosphorylate eIF2α<sup>P</sup> in vitro. Unlike their viral or invertebrate counterparts, with whom they share the conserved 70 residue core, the mammalian PPP1R15s are large proteins of more than 600 residues. Genetic and cellular observations point to a functional role for regions outside the conserved core of mammalian PPP1R15A in dephosphorylating its natural substrate, the eIF2 trimer. We have combined deep learning technology, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, X-Ray crystallography and biochemistry to uncover binding of the γ subunit of eIF2 to a short helical peptide repeated four times in the functionally-important N-terminus of human PPP1R15A that extends past its conserved core. Binding entails insertion of Phe and Trp residues that project from one face of an α-helix formed by the conserved repeats of PPP1R15A into a hydrophobic groove exposed on the surface of eIF2γ in the eIF2 trimer. Replacing these conserved Phe and Trp residues with Ala compromises PPP1R15A function in cells and in vitro. These findings suggest mechanisms by which contacts between a distant subunit of eIF2 and elements of PPP1R15A distant to the holophosphatase active site contribute to dephosphorylation of eIF2α<sup>P</sup> by the core PPP1R15 holophosphatase and to efficient termination of the ISR in mammals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/*metabolism</kwd><kwd>Phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>Protein Phosphatase 1/*metabolism</kwd><kwd>Substrate Specificity</kwd><kwd>Protein crystallography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The integrated stress response (ISR) modifies translation and gene expression to help eukaryotic cells overcome diverse environmental challenges and re-establish cellular homeostasis. Key to the ISR is phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 on serine 51 of its alpha subunit (eIF2α), an event triggered by four known kinases (GCN2, PERK, HRI and PKR) responsive to different stresses. Phosphorylated eIF2 (eIF2<sup>P</sup>) inhibits its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B. Slow exchange of GDP with GTP in the eIF2γ subunit attenuates translation of most mRNAs and favours translation of specialised mRNAs whose encoded proteins activate a characteristic gene expression program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Dephosphorylation of eIF2<sup>P</sup> terminates the ISR. In mammals, two related regulatory subunits direct the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to eIF2<sup>P</sup>: PPP1R15B (CReP) is constitutively expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), whilst PPP1R15A (GADD34) is an ISR target gene that is part of a negative feedback loop that quantitatively dominates rates of eIF2<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation as cells recover from stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P4">PPP1R15s are large proteins, but only ∼70 residues in their C-termini are conserved between the two mammalian proteins and in homologs in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The conserved core of PPP1R15s forms a stable trimeric complex with PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) and G-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) and is required for eIF2<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In vitro, the trimer of core PPP1R15, PP1 and G-actin efficiently dephosphorylates its core substrate: the independently-folded N-terminal domain (NTD) of phosphorylated eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Substrate-selective catalytic efficiency of the core holophosphatase is consistent with the structure of a dephosphorylation complex in which G-actin is observed to stabilise an extended segment of PPP1R15A to form a cradle that accommodates eIF2α<sup>P</sup> NTD and positions pSer51 in the PP1 active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p><p id="P5">These phylogenetic and biochemical observation point to the sufficiency of the conserved core of PPP1R15 to serve in eIF2<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation and in terminating the ISR. However, in cells, expression of the intact PPP1R15A more potently supresses the ISR than the core fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Furthermore, there are clues to functionally-important interactions between regions outside the PPP1R15A core and eIF2. On the PPP1R15A side these interactions have been mapped to several short repetitive peptides located N-terminal to the core region, but the interaction has not been mapped on the eIF2 side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P6">eIF2, the physiological substrate of the PPP1R15-containing holophosphatases, is a bi-lobed trimer. The γ subunit, a central component of the larger lobe, interacts with both the β subunit and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the α subunit which is flexibly attached to the smaller pSer51-containing lobe comprised of the independently folded eIF2α-NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). In yeast, the ISR is terminated by the PP1 (GLC7) catalytic subunit, which is recruited to eIF2 directly by eIF2γ with no intervention by a regulatory subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). The feature enabling direct recruitment of PP1 is missing in mammalian eIF2γ but together these observations hint at the potential importance of additional contacts of the holophosphatase and elements outside the eIF2α substrate lobe of the physiologically-relevant substrate (the eIF2 trimer). Such interactions are missing in experimental systems that contain only the core enzyme and core substrate, but might be mediated by the N-terminal extension of PPP1R15.</p><p id="P7">Here we have combined deep learning technology, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and traditional crystallography, biochemistry and cell biology to explore the complex structure of the N-terminal extended PPP1R15A and eIF2 trimer. Our study reveals, in atomic detail, the functionally-important binding of a short helix derived from the PPP1R15A peptide repeats in a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of eIF2γ. These findings extend our understanding of a dephosphorylation event that is key to signalling in mammals and may suggest an unanticipated target for experimental modulation of the ISR.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>An N-terminally extended PPP1R15A favours dephosphorylation of the eIF2 trimer</title><p id="P8">To investigate the functional role of elements outside PPP1R15A’s conserved core we purified from bacteria a recombinant fragment of human PPP1R15A<sup>325-636</sup> that contains the four repeats, previously implicated in eIF2 binding and the core that recruits PP1 and G-actin. This extended PPP1R15A is otherwise wildtype but lacks the hydrophobic N-terminus that associates with membranes and is incompatible with bacterial expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). In vitro assays demonstrated that dephosphorylation of the eIF2<sup>P</sup> trimer by the extended PPPR15A<sup>325-636</sup>-PP1-G-actin trimeric holophosphatase was approximately 10 time faster than by the core PPPR15A<sup>533-624</sup>-PP1-G-actin holophosphatase (based on <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic> and 1<italic>C</italic></xref>).

However, incorporation of the catalytic subunit into a PPP1R15A<sup>325-636</sup> extended holophosphatase was ∼2 times less inhibitory. These observations are consistent with functionally important interactions between the N-terminal extension of PPP1R15A and the eIF2 trimer.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>AlphaFold2-multimer (AFM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations predict interactions between PPP1R15A’s repeats and eIF2γ</title><p id="P10">Our attempts to solve a structure of the extended phosphatase complexed with the eIF2<sup>P</sup> trimer by cryo-EM were unsuccessful: Two and three-dimensional classification of the particles observed on the grid suggested that many were larger than the core holophosphatase/eIF2α-NTD complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). When reconstructed these gave rise to objects of a greater volume than the core enzyme/substrate, but the resolution was too low to plausibly assign different domains of the extended complex to the densities observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2<italic>A</italic></xref>). The NMR spectrum of isolated eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) and molecular dynamics simulations of both the eIF2 trimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2<italic>B</italic></xref>) and the extended holophosphatase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2<italic>C</italic></xref>) suggested that flexibility between the two lobes of eIF2 and the mostly unstructured nature of N-terminal extension of PPP1R15A may disfavour a fixed orientation of the components of the extended holophosphatase substrate complex, precluding a solution of its structure by CryoEM with the number of particles collected here.</p><p id="P11">Therefore, we turned to AFM to predict interactions between the eIF2 trimer and PPP1R15A, initially, with the eIF2 trimer and PPP1R15A<sup>325-517</sup> as inputs. The eIF2 models generated by AFM had high predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) values for α, C-terminal β, and γ subunits. The predicted aligned errors (PAE) plot of the α subunit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3<italic>A</italic></xref>) is explained by the flexible hinge connecting eIF2α-NTD and eIF2α-CTD previously observed in NMR solution structures of eIF2α (PDB 1Q8K) and in the MD simulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p id="P12">Despite a low pLDDT score of PPP1R15A, we noted that three of the top five ranked structures returned by AFM (ipTM+pTM score of 0.59), predicted interactions between a short peptide conserved in PPP1R15A’s repeats and a groove on the surface of eIF2γ. To refine the search process its input was confined to eIF2γ and either one of the PPP1R15A repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). High confidence models (ipTM+pTM &gt; 0.7) were returned for repeat 1 (R1, aa. 331-376), 2 (R2, aa.377-420) and 3 (R3, aa. 421-466). In these, the Phe and Trp of a conserved helical ‘<underline>F</underline>LKA<underline>W</underline>VY’ motif face into a hydrophobic groove of eIF2γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3<italic>B</italic></xref>). The pLDDT values for residues of the motif were 72-87; and the PAE plot predicted position errors of &lt; 5Å for the motif against eIF2γ. The less well conserved repeat 4 of human PPP1R15A (aa. 471-503) also engaged the same groove of eIF2γ with similar orientation (ipTM+pTM = 0.69) but with a weaker pLDDT score and lower confidence PAE plot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p id="P13">To test the stability of these predicted interactions, all-atom MD simulations of the complex formed by eIF2γ and PPP1R15A repeat 1<sup>331-376</sup> was performed. Three independent simulations carried over 500 nanoseconds showing stable engagement of the helical ‘<underline>F</underline>LKA<underline>W</underline>V’ motif in the eIF2γ groove with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 2.4 ± 0.6 Å. The distance between Phe<sup>338</sup>, Leu<sup>339</sup>, Trp<sup>342</sup>, Val<sup>343</sup> of the helical motif and residues in the eIF2γ hydrophobic groove remained between 3-6 Å throughout the simulation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3<italic>C</italic></xref>). The MD simulations also revealed that although acidic residues conserved in the C-terminal half of the PPP1R15A repeats display considerable flexibility (RMSD=15.6 ± 5.9 Å for three replicates), they still engage in electrostatic interactions with a positively-charged surface of eIF2γ, consistent with rapidly-exchanging salt bridges (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3<italic>D</italic></xref>). These hydrophobic and charge complementarity interactions result in an overall predicted binding free energy of -11.8 kcal/mol between eIF2γ and PPP1R15A_repeat 1<sup>331-376</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>A crystal structure of eIF2αγ and PPP1R15A<sup>420-452</sup></title><p id="P14">To test experimentally interactions between human eIF2γ and the repeats of PPP1R15A. We sought to crystallise a minimal complex containing eIF2γ and a single repeat. Mammalian expression of eIF2, though suited for the activity assays described above, failed to yield the quantities needed for crystallography and heterogeneous post-translations may hinder the crystallisation. After several attempts, the expression of a multi-cistronic plasmid encoding eIF2αγ and CDC123 in <italic>E.coli</italic> yielded reasonable amounts of monomeric eIF2αγ.</p><p id="P15">The PPP1R15A<sup>420-452</sup> (R3) peptide and eIF2αγ dimer, purified separately and combined at 8:1 stoichiometry yielded diffracting crystals and a structure of the complex was determined at 3.35 Å resolution. The interface between the eIF2γ and eIF2α-CTD was well resolved and consistent with previous published eIF2 complexes, whereas no density corresponding to the flexibly-attached eIF2α-NTD was observed. Polder (omit) map unambiguously showed an electron density in the hydrophobic groove between the G-domain and domain 3 of eIF2γ. Residues <sup>426</sup>SA<underline>F</underline>LKA<underline>W</underline>VY<sup>434</sup> of the PPP1R15A<sup>420-452</sup> peptide could be built into the density, with the conserved Phe and Trp facing the groove, a configuration in agreement with the AFM predicted model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Phe and Trp on the hydrophobic face of PPP1R15A’s helical repeats contribute to eIF2 dephosphorylation by the extended holophosphatase</title><p id="P16">A fluorescein-labelled peptide corresponding to repeat 3 (PPP1R15A<sup>420-466</sup>) was titrated with increasing amount of eIF2. This equilibrium binding assay yielded a saturable fluorescence polarisation (FP) signal with a <italic>K</italic><sub>1/2max</sub> of 220 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). To evaluate the contribution of contacts observed in complexes of eIF2γ and PPP1R15A’s repeat, the Phe and Trp of the helical binding motif of PPP1R15A were mutated to Ala. The fluorescein-labelled double mutant peptide bound the eIF2 trimer weakly and both wildtype and mutant peptides showed similarly low level of unspecific binding with eIF2α-NTD.</p><p id="P17">Next, we replaced these Phe and Trp residues with Ala in all four repeats of the bacterially-expressed extended PPP1R15A<sup>325-636</sup> (we refer to this mutation as 4X FW&gt;AA) and compared the wildtype and mutant in their ability to dephosphorylate the core substrate, eIF2α<sup>P</sup>-NTD and the physiological substrate, the eIF2<sup>P</sup> trimer, in the presence of PP1 and G-actin. The 4X FW&gt;AA mutant was selectively impaired in dephosphorylating eIF2<sup>P</sup> trimer compared with eIF2α<sup>P</sup>-NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). This pattern was also observed in an abbreviated version of the holophosphatase extended with wildtype or mutant version of repeats 3 and 4 (PPP1R15A<sup>420-636</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). These experiments point to a role for the conserved hydrophobic residues, Phe and Trp, that line one face of the helical repeats of PPP1R15A in binding eIF2γ and suggest that these contacts are functionally important to the dephosphorylation reaction.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Contacts made by PPP1R15A’s repeats and eIF2 contribute to signal termination in the ISR</title><p id="P18">PPP1R15A/GADD34 was initially identified as a stress-induced suppressor of the CHOP::GFP ISR reporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). We revisited this assay to investigate the significance of the interactions uncovered between PPP1R15A’s repeats and eIF2 in the context of PPP1R15A’s capacity to function within this negative feedback loop. Treatment of cells with thapsigargin, an agent that triggers PERK-dependent eIF2 phosphorylation, activated the <italic>CHOP::GFP</italic> reporter (leading to a right-shift of GFP fluorescent signal detected by flow cytometry, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, top panels). Co-expression of mCherry (by transient transfection) did not affect the CHOP::GFP signal. However, expression of wildtype full length human PPP1R15A (fused with a C-terminal mCherry) repressed the thapsigargin induced CHOP::GFP signal at both low and medium levels of expression (reflected in a shift back to the left of the CHOP::GFP signal in mCherry positive thapsigargin-treated cells). The 4X FW&gt;AA mutant version of the PPP1R15A-mCherry fusion was less effective at suppressing the ISR, and the core PPP1R15A-mCherry fusion was even less effective.</p><p id="P19">The mCherry fluorescence signal is a surrogate for the cellular concentration of the different fused PPP1R15A effectors. Therefore the FACS data can be fitted to a nonlinear regression, considering the CHOP::GFP signal as the response and mCherry signal as the inhibitor (in arbitrary fluorescence units). The plateau values of the CHOP::GFP signal supressed by the wildtype PPP1R15A was lower than that of the 4X FW&gt;AA mutant and the IC<sub>50</sub> (in units of mCherry fluorescence) of the wildtype was 3-4 times lower than the mutant. The core PPP1R15A was even less effective as an ISR inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). Similar observations were also made using wildtype and 4X FW&gt;AA mutant versions of PPP1R15A<sup>325-636</sup> lacking the N-terminal membrane interacting domain and corresponding closely to the version of the protein used in the in vitro assays, thus aligning the in vitro and in vivo data sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Stress granule formation is another marker of ISR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) that is antagonised by PPP1R15A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). In PPP1R15A knockout cells (a genetic background sensitised to stress granule formation) introduction of the 4X FW&gt;AA mutant PPP1R15A was less effective than wildtype PPP1R15A in attenuating stress granules abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). The eIF2γ-interacting 4X FW&gt;AA mutant PPP1R15A nonetheless retained significant activity, as compared to the V556E mutation that interferes with PP1 recruitment to the holophosphatase. Thus, in both cell-based assays the eIF2γ-interacting mutations have an incomplete but discernible loss-of-function to their ISR-suppressive phenotype.</p><p id="P21">The 4X FW&gt;AA mutation did not affect the formation of a stable complex between PPP1R15A and the catalytic subunit, as similar amounts of PP1 were recovered in complex with GFP-tagged wildtype and mutant PPP1R15A (immunopurified from transfected cells with a nanobody directed towards GFP). As expected, only background levels of PP1 were recovered in complex with the V556E mutant PPP1R15A. However, considerably less eIF2 was recovered in complex with the 4X FW&gt;AA mutant than the wildtype GFP-tagged PPP1R15A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>, in this assay the recovery of eIF2□ is deemed a surrogate for the eIF2 trimer). The V556E mutation also greatly decreased eIF2 binding, consistent with the importance of contacts observed between the PP1 active site and eIF2α’s substrate loop in the de-phosphorylation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The 4X FW&gt;AA mutation further decreased eIF2 binding when introduced in context of the V556E mutant PPP1R15A. Thus, the functional defect in ISR suppression wrought by mutations in PPP1R15A’s Phe and Trp residues that interact with eIF2γ correlated with impaired enzyme-substrate interaction in cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">Phylogenetics and biochemistry leave little doubt that the ancestral PPP1R15 gene encoded a protein comprised of the conserved 70 residue core that is both necessary and sufficient to form a trimeric phosphatase that selectively dephosphorylates eIF2<sup>P</sup>. Perhaps the best evidence for this is the fact that <italic>Herpes simplex</italic> virus supresses the host anti-viral ISR by directing high level expression of γ34.5, a polypeptide confined to the PPP1R15 core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). And yet our findings here suggest that the mammalian isoform that accounts for most eIF2<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation observed in cells as stress wanes, has acquired a lengthy extension to the core that endows PPP1R15A-containing holophosphatases additional catalytic efficiency when targeting their physiological substrate, the eIF2<sup>P</sup> trimer.</p><p id="P23">The biochemical counterpart to this feature of PPP1R15A is an interaction between a shallow hydrophobic groove on the surface of eIF2γ and a repeated segment of PPP1R15A with helical propensity that projects two bulky hydrophobic residues on one side of the helix (Phe and Trp) into the groove. Our crystallographic data is limited to this helix-groove interaction, but MD simulation suggests that PPP1R15A’s affinity for eIF2γ may be buttressed by additional ionic interactions between conserved acidic residues in PPP1R15A and a basic patch adjacent to the hydrophobic groove in eIF2γ. These observations fit with earlier findings pointing to a role for PPP1R15A’s repeats in eIF2 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Mutating the conserved Phe and Trp in PPP1R15A’s repeats compromises ISR suppression in cells and eIF2<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation in vitro, suggesting that the contacts established on structural grounds are functionally important. But how do they contribute to catalytic efficiency?</p><p id="P24">Combined with structures of the core components of the reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), the findings here suggest that the enzyme/substrate complex is comprised of two separate interactions: The eIF2α<sup>P</sup>-NTD (substrate lobe) is engaged by PP1c and the G-actin-stabilised C-terminal extension of PPP1R15’s conserved core, whilst the flexibly-attached eIF2α (C-term)βγ lobe is engaged with one of four PPP1R15A repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Greater affinity of an enzyme for its substrate contributes to catalysis. However, barring an unforeseen rearrangement in eIF2 upon dephosphorylation of eIF2α’s pSer51, the helix-groove interaction discovered here would also feature in the reaction product (dephosphorylated eIF2) and thus limit enzyme turnover. Fine tuning of the kinetics and dominance of contacts made by pSer51 at the PP1 active site, may render the helix-groove interaction a net benefit to catalysis on grounds of enhanced substrate recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>), but the gains made via this mechanism might be offset by product inhibition.</p><p id="P25">The core holophosphatase is less active in dephosphorylating the eIF2<sup>P</sup> trimer (the natural substrate) than its isolated eIF2α<sup>P</sup>-NTD lobe (the core substrate), whereas the extended holophosphatase inverts this hierarchy. This suggests that the bulky eIF2α(CTD)βγ lobe interferes with dephosphorylation of the flexibly attached eIF2α<sup>P</sup>-NTD substrate lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>), interference that may be overcome by contacts between the γ subunit and PPP1R15A’s repeats. According to this model, by engaging the bulky eIF2α(CTD)βγ lobe, the PPP1R15A extension favours docking of the flexibly-attached eIF2α<sup>P</sup>-NTD lobe in the core of the holophosphatase, with the pSer51 loop facing the PP1 active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p><p id="P26">The extended holophosphatase is less efficient in dephosphorylating the eIF2α<sup>P</sup>-NTD lobe (the core substrate) than the core holophosphatase. This suggests a possibility whereby the eIF2γ-PPP1R15A interaction may also relieve a repressive effect of the PPP1R15A extension on the core holophosphatase or accelerate its assembly into a functional enzyme. The flexibility of PPP1R15A N-terminal extension revealed in the MD simulation could pose an entropic penalty to clearing a path for insertion of the eIF2α<sup>P</sup>-NTD lobe in the enzyme active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5<italic>D</italic></xref>). Engagement with eIF2γ might limit this penalty. However, the putative repression relieved by this interaction would have to be substrate dependent, as the PPP1R15A extension does not favour repression of dephosphorylation of phosphorylase A (PYGM<sup>P</sup>), an irrelevant substrate.</p><p id="P27">PPP1R15 is viewed here through the prism of eIF2<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation. This seems justified by the mouse knockout in which sluggish eIF2<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation explains much of the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). However, others have suggested a role for PPP1R15A’s N-terminal extension in processes unrelated to the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Thus, it remains possible that the fitness benefits arising from ISR-unrelated functions of the N-terminal extension of PPP1R15A come at a cost to eIF2<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation, a cost that is circumvented by the interactions with eIF2γ.</p><p id="P28">The hydrophobic groove in eIF2γ is conserved in eukaryotes, whereas the gene duplication that gave rise to PPP1R15A occurred in mammals. Thus, the binding event described here exploited a pre-existing feature of the eukaryotic proteome. This study is restricted to the ISR inducible PPP1R15A subunit; we do not know if functionally-similar features are also found in the constitutive PPP1R15B subunit or in some more distant ancestors. Given the divergence in the non-core regions of PPP1R15A &amp; B (sequence identity &lt; 20%) and the lack of repeats in PPP1R15B it is likely that even if the latter were found to engage eIF2γ it could entail a different process.</p><p id="P29">Genetics suggests that limiting the rate of eIF2<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation may extend the ISR and provide a benefit in certain stress situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). This has spawned attempts to access eIF2<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation pharmacologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). The assays used to identify and characterise putative inhibitors have relied on the dephosphorylation of the core substrate, the eIF2α<sup>P</sup>-NTD lobe, and to date have yielded compounds whose activity as PPP1R15A-selective inhibitors remains contested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Here we expand the theoretical target space for inhibitors of eIF2<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation and suggest that assays that detect dephosphorylation of the natural substrate, the eIF2<sup>P</sup> trimer, may offer advantages over those that rely on the core substrate alone in identifying inhibitors that extend the ISR.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p id="P30">PCR-based manipulations, restriction digests, and gene synthesis (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ) were used to mobilize the coding sequence and produces in-frame fusions of the desired proteins with the affinity tags or fluorescent tags, and to create the point mutations indicated in the text. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref> lists the plasmids used in this study.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p id="P31">N-terminal His6-SUMO3 tagged human PPP1R15A (UK2937, UK3133, UK2996, UK3083) with C-terminal fused maltose-binding protein (MBP) were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 T7 Express lysY/Iq cells (New England BioLabs, catalog no.

The net benefit of enriched localised eIF2<sup>P</sup> concentration might be limited by product inhibition.</p><p>(<italic>C</italic>) The bulky eIF2 lobe comprised of βγ and α-CTD subunits may interfere with the alignment of the flexibly-attached eIF2α<sup>P</sup>-NTD in the active site (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Interactions between the extended N-term of PPP1R15A and eIF2γ would stabilise the eIF2α(CTD)βγ lobe limiting an entropic penalty to forming a productive enzyme substrate complex.</p><p>(<italic>D</italic>) The N-terminal extended PPP1R15A is largely disordered and may inhibit substrates engagement (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2<italic>C</italic></xref>). Helix-groove interactions with eIF2γ would stabilise the N-terminal extension of PPP1R15A limiting another entropic penalty to forming a productive enzyme substrate complex.</p><p>The box above panel A is a glossary of the reaction’s components (objects adapted from artwork by Claudia Flandoli, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.claudiaflandoli.com">http://www.claudiaflandoli.com</ext-link>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS192836-f005"/></fig></floats-group></article>
