In this work, we introduce a novel series of ionizable lipids characterized by double ethanolamine head groups, significantly amplifying mRNA binding affinity. A succinct three-component formulation is subsequently delineated, obviating the conventional dependency on phospholipids inherent in traditional four-component LNPs. Intriguingly, this formulation enables particle formation under neutral pH conditions, a notable departure from the acidic milieu traditionally required, attributable to the enhanced nonionic interactions predominating in mRNA encapsulation. The resultant particles exhibit exceptional stability, superior mRNA encapsulation efficiency, and maintain robust delivery efficacy. When deployed as a vaccine platform, the formulation elicited pronounced humoral and T-cell immune responses, concurrently exhibiting a favorable toxicity profile with a reduced induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Our exploration suggests that by fine-tuning the non-electrostatic interactions between the ionizable lipid and mRNA, the dynamics of particle formation can be considerably divergent from the prevailing paradigms of mRNA-LNP formation, hinting at a broader horizon for lipid optimization within the realm of mRNA delivery systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Lipid nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>three-component lipid nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>mRNA vaccine</kwd><kwd>iPLX</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The remarkable success of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines in combating the threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has significantly invigorated the scientific community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. These mRNA vaccines, known for their robust immune responses, excellent safety profiles, and rapid development pace, have outperformed traditional vaccine approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. However, the success of the mRNA vaccines hinges on the availability of an optimal delivery vehicle considering mRNA’s inherent fragility and poor membrane permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Addressing these challenges, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as clinically validated RNA delivery systems, exemplified by the FDA-approved siRNA-LNP drug and two SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, alongside numerous ongoing clinical trials for LNP-based mRNA therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Conventional LNP formulations typically comprise four essential components: an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a “helper” phospholipid, and a PEGylated lipid (PEG-lipid)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Each of these components in LNPs has a crucial role either in mRNA encapsulation or delivery. Among them, the ionizable lipid takes center stage with dual functions. It plays a vital role in determining the encapsulation efficiency of mRNA by electrostatic interactions between the lipid and mRNA. Moreover, this lipid aids in facilitating the escape of cargos from endosome through pH-triggered protonation within these compartments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Extensive efforts have been invested in designing and optimizing the structure of ionizable lipids through traditional combinatorial medicinal chemistry approaches to enable efficient mRNA delivery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Notably, recent studies have shed light on the significance of nonionic interactions, such as hydrogen bonds in nucleating the RNA-lipid complex core and enhancing mRNA delivery. For instance, lipids like SM-102 and ALC-0315 used in FDA-approved COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, feature a hydroxyl group attached to the amine linkage.</p><p id="P4">Apart from the ionizable lipid, cholesterol and PEG-lipid have established roles in LNPs. Cholesterol bolsters LNP stability and promotes RNA transfection, while PEG-lipid regulates particle size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, dispersion, prolongs circulation, and prevents aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Phospholipids, such as DSPC (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and DOPE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine) often overlooked, are a crucial component influencing the delivery of LNP-mRNA among the four essential components. Phospholipids are the predominant constituents of liposomes employed in drug delivery systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, and their significance becomes evident when developing delivery platforms for nucleic acids, spanning from DNA to siRNA and mRNA. Over time, the proportion of phospholipids has progressively decreased, dwindling from approximately 85 mol% in stabilized plasmid-lipid particles (SPLP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> to 25 mol% in stable antisense lipid particles (SALP) formulations, and further to 20% in stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALP) siRNA formulations. In current commercial LNPs designed for siRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> or mRNA delivery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, they contain approximately 10% DSPC. Phospholipids are now designated as “helper” lipid in the LNP system due to its role in nucleic acid encapsulation and stable particle formation, influencing in vivo delivery efficacy. Remarkably, recent research has unveiled that an increased proportion of phospholipids can enhance mRNA delivery efficacy both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, particularly when eff sphingomyelin (ESM) substitutes DSPC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, DSPC tends to favor bilayer structures, resulting in LNP formation with bilayer bleb-like structures under stressful conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> or when elevated DSPC quantities are employed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Replacing DSPC with DOPE circumvents bleb formation, as DOPE prefers a hexagonal H phase, which is incompatible with bilayer structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. In essence, phospholipids are deemed indispensable in LNP formation, with their role extending to encapsulation, particle stability, and overall efficacy in nucleic acid delivery systems.</p><p id="P5">In this study, our primary objective was to design a novel series of ionizable lipids, with a particular emphasis on the composition of the head group. Through our research efforts, we successfully identified a distinct class of ionizable lipids featuring double ethanolamine head groups. As we delved deeper into the optimization of our formulations, an intriguing revelation emerged: the commonly used “helper” lipid DSPC had a detrimental effect on both mRNA delivery and particle stability. Mechanistic investigations unveiled that these new lipid properties stemmed from the exceptional binding affinity of the ionizable lipid, largely attributed to its unique head group configuration. What was particularly interesting was that the hydrogen-bond interactions overshadowed the contribution of ionic interactions. This unique ionizable lipid could efficiently encapsulate mRNA without the necessitating use of an acidic buffer. Moreover, it rendered phospholipids unnecessary for achieving stable LNP formation and long-term storage, all while maintaining high mRNA encapsulation efficiency.</p><p id="P6">Our research has culminated in the formulation of an ultra-stable, phospholipid-free, three-component nanoparticle architecture for mRNA encapsulation, designated as the iPLX formulation to distinguish it from the conventional four-component LNP formulation. This novel formulation, particularly with the inclusion of the leading compound LQ-3, exhibited substantial potential. When deployed as a vaccine platform, LQ-3 iPLX elicited robust humoral and T-cell immune responses. Furthermore, LQ-3 iPLX manifested promising toxicity profiles, notably inducing a reduced quantity of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α.</p><p id="P7">Our study not only points to a new direction for optimizing ionizable lipids but also underscores the pivotal role of tuning the interaction between the head group and nucleic acid. This allows for the creation of stable particles using ionizable lipids, cholesterol, and PEG-lipids, with remarkable mRNA encapsulation efficiency while maintaining superior delivery efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Synthesis, Preparation, and <italic>In Vivo</italic> Screening of Ionizable Lipids with Double Ethanolamine Head Groups</title><p id="P8">At the heart of effective LNP-mediated mRNA delivery lies the role of ionizable lipids, orchestrating mRNA binding during nanoparticle assembly and facilitating escape from endosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. With a strategic focus on enhancing LNP stability, mRNA delivery efficiency, and safety, we embarked on the design of a novel library of chemically distinct ionizable lipids. The significance of tertiary amines that acquire a positive charge upon protonation in a low pH environment has been extensively explored, facilitating their interaction with the negatively-charged RNA molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Recent advancements have brought attention to the potential benefits of incorporating a hydroxyl group onto a tertiary amine to form the lipid headgroups. This augmentation further enhances <italic>in vivo</italic> mRNA delivery of formulated LNP. This advantageous effect has been attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the introduced hydroxyl group and the RNA molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Drawing inspiration from by these pivotal design cues, we meticulously crafted 14 novel lipids, all featuring dual hydroxyls and tertiary amines within their lipid headgroups. Detailed synthetic routes and structural confirmation by <sup>1</sup>H NMR were provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1-S14</xref> in the Supporting Information. We next prepared LNP-mRNAs by formulating the synthetic ionizable lipid with cholesterol, DSPC, DMG-PEG2k, and firefly luciferase (Fluc) mRNA through a microfluidic system. The lipid composition adhered to a generic mole ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 for ionizable lipid, DSPC, cholesterol, and DMG-PEG2k. The structures of the 14 ionizable lipids and the physicochemical attributes of mRNA-encapsulated LNPs (LNPs-mRNA) were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. The resulting mRNA-LNPs showed average particle sizes ranging from of 70 to100 nm, accompanied by low polydispersity indices (PDI) (∼0.1), and mRNA encapsulation efficiency exceeding 96%.</p><p id="P9">To explore the impact of these novel ionizable lipids on <italic>in vivo</italic> mRNA delivery efficacy, mRNA-LNPs were intravenously (<italic>i.v.</italic>) administrated into female wild-type Balb/c mice at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg Fluc mRNA, and the structure-activity relationships were explored. Our benchmark for comparison was SM-102, a synthetic lipid utilized in the FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. Tracking the whole-body bioluminescence intensities of these administered mice at various time points using an <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging system (IVIS) provided insights into the dynamic kinetic profiles of luciferase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, a majority of our 14 LNPs exhibited strikingly similar profiles to that of SM-102 LNP. Interestingly, the expression of mRNA seemed to diminish at a slower rate within the 4 - 24 hour interval for most of these LNPs. As a result, despite SM-102 exhibiting a more pronounced bioluminescence intensity compared to our LNPs at the 4-hour mark post-administration, the cumulative protein expression of our LQ-3, LQ-8, and LQ-13 LNPs closely matched that of SM-102 LNP. This was evident through measurement of the areas under the whole-body luciferase bioluminescent signal curve (AUC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Moreover, it has been well-established that the apparent <italic>p</italic>Ka of LNPs plays an important role in shaping the in <italic>vivo</italic> RNA delivery potency.

Typically, LNP is a four-component system encompassing an ionizable lipid, phospholipid, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Phospholipid, such as DSPC, are known to play a crucial role in encapsulating nucleic acids and providing stability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. In our first step, we maintained a molar ratio of ionizable lipid and DMG-PEG2k at 40% and 1.6%, respectively. The proportion of DSPC were adjusted from 0% to 40%, with corresponding variations in cholesterol ratios to maintain a total component ratio of 100%. Luciferase mRNAs were encapsulated at an N:P ratio of 8:1. The designed LNP formulations and the relevant characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref> in the Supporting Information. Surprisingly, as DSPC content decreased, the mRNA delivery efficacy of resulting LNPs progressively increased, reaching its peak when zero DSPC was included. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> illustrates the <italic>in vivo</italic> whole-body bioluminescence intensities 4 hours post-administration of LNPs, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> displays the AUC over 4 to 48 hours. When employing DOPE as a substitute for DSPC, a similar trend was observed; the delivery efficiency peaked when the DOPE content was reduced to 2% or entirely omitted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S15</xref>).</p><p id="P12">At the core of LNP dynamics lies the role of the ionizable lipid, influencing both mRNA encapsulation and endosomal escape. In our second optimization, we investigated the effects of ionizable lipid ratio on mRNA delivery. This was achieved through a systematic exploration of 20 formulations with varying LQ-3 content, ranging from 25% to 60%, coupled with 0%, 2%, 4%, and 10% DSPC. Detailed parameters for these LNPs are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref> in the Supporting Information. Echoing the outcomes of the first round, LNPs containing 4% and 10% DSPC exhibited notably reduced mRNA delivery efficacy compared to those with 0% and 2 % DSPC. Among the spectrum, LNPs with 40-50% ionizable lipid content demonstrated elevated mRNA delivery efficacy. Particularly noteworthy was the LNP configuration consisting of 45% LQ-3, 0% DSPC, 53.4%, cholesterol, and 1.6% DMG-PEG2k, demonstrating the peak of efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Finally, we investigated the impact of PEG-lipid ratio on luciferase expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. Parameters detailing this PEG-lipid-focused screen can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>. While maintaining the ionizable lipid/DSPC ratio at 45/0 or 45/2, we examined the expression efficacy of LNPs formulated with different PEG-lipid ratios, ranging from 1.6% to 5%, <italic>in vivo</italic>. The results showed that the formulation with 2% DMG-PEG2k ratio exhibited the highest expression, followed by the 1.6% DMG-PEG2k ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). In sum, these results highlight the optimal LQ-3 nanoparticle formulation comprising 45% ionizable lipids, 0% DSPC, 53% cholesterol, and 2% DMG-PEG2k after a three-round optimization process.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.3</label><title>Characterization of Phospholipid-Free LQ-3 iPLX Nanoparticles</title><p id="P14">Our previous investigations into nanoparticle formulations yielded an unexpected discovery: the omission of DSPC, a commonly used “helper” lipid, surprisingly enhanced the efficacy of mRNA delivery, challenging the conventional role of DSPC in LNPs featuring ionizable lipids. While in the realm of lipoplex formulation, where nanoparticles are created through the interaction of cationic lipids and nucleic acids facilitated by cholesterol, the role of DSPC becomes dispensable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. In contrast, most ionizable lipid-based formulations have historically relied on DSPC for ensuring stable LNP formation and optimal delivery outcomes.</p><p id="P15">This intriguing revelation, with our lipid LQ-3 as a prominent example, prompted us to conduct further investigations into this DSPC-free, three-component formulation. To clearly delineate this new approach from conventional formulations, we introduced the term “iPLX” for the three-component variant, drawing parallels with conventional lipoplex formations but integrating an ionizable lipid in place of a cationic lipid, which stands in contrast to the conventional four-component LNP. To ensure robust comparisons and controls, we extended our study by employing SM-102 to create nanoparticles using both iPLX and LNP formulations, providing a comprehensive understanding of our newly identified ionizable lipids within the context of the iPLX formulation.</p><p id="P16">Both LQ-3 and SM-102 demonstrated the ability to form nanoparticles in the absence of DSPC without a notable decrease in encapsulation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, transitioning from LNP to iPLX formulation, resulted in a slight size increase for LQ-3 nanoparticles (less than 10 nm), whearas SM-102 iPLX displayed a more significant expansion from 80 nm to 120 nm. Notably, the influence of DSPC on the PDI varied for LQ-3 and SM-102 nanoparticles. For SM-102, the inclusion of DSPC led to a smaller PDI, whereas for LQ-3, the PDI decreased as DSPC was excluded. These findings highlighted the divergent effects of DSPC on LNP formation for LQ-3 and SM-102.</p><p id="P17">To validate these observations, we subjected these nanoparticles to a freeze-thaw cycle. Intriguingly, SM-102 iPLX nanoparticles underwent collapse, as evidenced by the PDI increasing to nearly 1.0 and the size expanding to 350 nm, accompanied by mRNA release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Even in the presence of 2% DSPC, SM-102 LNP underwent decomposition, albeit to a lesser extent. Only with 10% DSPC did SM-102 LNP withstand freeze-thaw conditions without substantial changes in particle properties. This underscores the crucial role of DSPC in stabilizing nanoparticles, particularly for ionizable lipid SM-102. This trend likely extends to other well-characterized lipids such as DLIN-MC3 and ALC-0315, both incorporating around 10% DSPC in LNP formulation. In a contrasting scenario, transitioning from LNP to iPLX formulation did not yield noticeable particle alterations for LQ-3 lipid, implying comparable stability between LQ-3 iPLX and LQ-3 LNP. This stability underscores the potential of LQ-3 iPLX as a promising platform for mRNA delivery.</p><p id="P18">Further exploration through cryoelectron microscopy (Cryo-EM) unveiled the morphological aspects. Both LQ-3 iPLX and LNP showed a spherical structure with a dense core and monolayer shell, akin to SM-102 LNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, a closer inspection revealed that both LQ-3 iPLX and LNP exhibited a degree of multilamellarity, while SM-102 LNP displayed an amorphous core. To gain further insights, we employed thioine dye staining to visualize the localization of RNA within LNPs using Cryo-EM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. In the case of SM-102 LNP, the RNA density was clearly visible on the periphery of the dense core beneath the outer shell, consistent with prior observations, suggesting that ionizable lipids within SM-102 LNP redistributed into the core when equilibrated in a neutral buffer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Interestingly, LQ-3 iPLX and LNP did not exhibit enhanced contrast due to RNA staining, indicating that LQ-3 forms a tighter complex with RNA, impeding the interaction with thionine dye.</p><p id="P19">Additionally, we harnessed <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra to gain further insights into lipid surface distributions within these nanoparticles. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> reveals distinct hydrogen peaks corresponding to ionizable lipids and PEG-lipids, detected on the surface of LQ-3 iPLX, LQ-3 LNP, and SM-102 LNP. As anticipated, the choline signal from DSPC was absent in the LQ-3 iPLX spectrum, while evident in both the SM-102 and LQ-3 LNP spectra. Consequently, iPLX nanoparticles exhibit a higher content of ionizable lipid on the surface which may contribute to its enhanced mRNA delivery efficacy.</p><p id="P20">We measured the zeta potential of both LQ-3 iPLX and SM102 LNP in Tris Buffer (pH 7.5). The zeta potential for SM102 LNP is approximately -4 mV, whereas that for LQ-3 iPLX is slightly higher at -2.6 mV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). This aligns with the observation that the pKa of LQ-3 iPLX is marginally higher than that of SM102 LNP.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>2.4</label><title>Nonionic Interactions as Key Drivers of RNA-Lipid Nucleation in LQ-3 iPLX nanoparticles</title><p id="P21">The contrasting behaviors exhibited by LQ-3 and SM-102 prompted us to further explore their underlying mechanisms. The role of an ionizable lipid in facilitating the interactions with negatively charged nucleic acids is crucial for their encapsulation and stabilization within lipid-based delivery systems. The primary distinction between LQ-3 and SM-102 lies in the structure LQ-3’s head group, which features double ethanolamine linked by an ethyl bond. Consequently, under acidic conditions, LQ-3’s head group carries two positive charges, enabling ionic interactions with nucleic acids. However, this unique head configuration also amplifies the potential for other electrostatic interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, with nucleic acids. There, it is essential to investegate the role of these interactions in shaping LQ-3’s distinct properties.</p><p id="P22">We first assessed the capacity of LQ-3 and SM-102 to form complexes with nucleic acids. RNA was dissolved in either an acidic acetate buffer (pH 5.2) or a neutral Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2), while LQ-3 and SM-102 were dissolved in ethanol. The lipid solution was then introduced into the mRNA solution under stirring conditions, and we measured encapsulation efficiency using the ribogreen assay. In acidic conditions, LQ-3 exhibited robust mRNA encapsulation, achieving an efficiency of 98% at an N:P ratio of 6:1(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, only 50% of the mRNA was accessible to ribogreen dye when using SM-102. Remarkably, upon adjusting the pH of the lipid:RNA solution to 7.2, LQ-3 maintained its mRNA complexing ability at an efficiency of 97%, whereas SM-102’s efficiency further decreased to 38%. When the mixing was carried out in a neutral buffer at pH 7.2, LQ-3 effectively encapsulated mRNA through complex formation with 95% protection, while SM-102 only provided 43% mRNA protection.</p><p id="P23">Building on above findings, we hypothesized that mRNA may not necessarily require an acidic buffer for successful nanoparticle formation. To explore this, we dissolved mRNA in a neutral Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) and rapidly mixed it with lipid mixtures in ethanol using a microfluidic device, following standard procedures. The resulting solution was then dialyzed in the same buffer used for mRNA dissolution to remove ethanol. Considering that ionic interactions can be sensitive to ionic strength, we conducted tests with varying concentrations of Tris-HCl buffer, ranging from 10 mM to 80 mM. Interestingly, our lipid LQ-3, when combined with cholesterol and PEG-lipid, was able to encapsulate mRNA even in a neutral buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Remarkably, even with a higher 80mM Tris concentration, although the particle size expanded to 140 nm, a stable nanoparticle assembly with a 96% encapsulation efficiency was still achievable. These findings hint that the primary forces propelling RNA:lipid complex formation remain unaffected by ionic strength, underscoring the crucial role of nonionic interactions between mRNA and ionizable lipids. In contrast, when utilizing the lipid SM-102, stable nanoparticles could not be formed when mRNA was dissolved in neutral buffer, as initially expected. Additionally, the assembly of SM-102-based nanoparticles was significantly affected by ionic strength. With 10 mM Tris, the encapsulation efficiency was approximately 70%, but this efficiency plummeted to zero when Tris concentrations of 40 mM or higher were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><label>2.5</label><title>Molecular Dynamics Simulation Reveals Dominance of Nonionic Interactions in mRNA Complexation by LQ-3</title><p id="P24">The previous data compellingly demonstrates that LQ-3 has a superior propensity to form complexes with mRNA compared to SM-102, possibly due to differences in their headgroups.

To harness these promising findings for practical applications, we explored the potential of iPLX as a versatile vaccine platform, specifically for developing a multivalent mRNA vaccine targeting various SARS-CoV-2 variants. We encapsulated three distinct mRNAs encoding full-length chimeric spike protein from different SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7/B.1.351, Omicron BA.2/4/5, and XBB.1.5) into mRNA-iPLX using LQ-3 as the ionizable lipid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). As a reference, we also created LQ-3 empty iPLXs to serve as a negative control. In addition, we developed another mRNA vaccine that encapsulated the same mRNAs using the SM-102 LNP platform, facilitating direct comparisons. The immunogenicity of both LQ-3 iPLX and SM-102 LNP vaccines was evaluated in BALB/c mice, following the scheme outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>.

As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, the LQ-3 iPLX vaccine elicited a robust immune response. The S protein-specific IgG antibody titers in sera collected on day 28 from mice immunized with either 2 μg or 5 μg of LQ-3 iPLX were comparable to those in the SM-102 LNP immunized group. Furthermore, the lentiviral pseudovirus neutralization assay was employed to evaluate the levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) induced by the respective vaccines. Encouragingly, both the LQ-3 iPLX and SM-102 LNP vaccines induced substantial neutralization activity against the EG.5.1, XBB.1.5, Omicron BA.4/5, and B.1.351 viruses. No significant disparities were observed between these two delivery systems across both dosage groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results compellingly suggest that our LQ-3 iPLX vaccines effectively induced a potent humoral immune response in mice.</p><p id="P32">Furthermore, we investigated the cellular immune response against the spike protein using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assays and ELISpot assays. The ICS results revealed that LQ-3 iPLX robustly triggered a significant increase in IFN-γ and IL-2 expression by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to the placebo group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). The frequency of CD8+ T cells expressing IFN-γ induced by LQ-3 iPLX was slightly lower than that induced by SM-102 LNP.

Notably, no severe adverse reactions were observed in any of the animals immunized with either LQ-3 iPLX or SM-102 LNP, regardless of the administered doses. For the assessment, markers of hepatic and nephritic injury, namely alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine (Crea) levels were evaluated at 6 hours and 14 days post-administration in rats and at 12 days in mice.

While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have played a pivotal role in this success, optimizing their components remains a subject of ongoing research. The prevailing model suggests that LNP formation begins with ionizable lipids interacting with mRNA under acidic conditions, primarily driven by the ionic attraction between the positively charged ionizable lipid and the negatively charged mRNA. This interaction creates a nucleation core, which then accrues cholesterol, phospholipids, and PEG-lipid, until the surface accumulation of PEG-lipid inhibits further nanoparticle growth. Following formation, the particles are dialyzed to a neutral buffer, typically with a pH exceeding the apparent pKa of the particle. This shift in pH is believed to significantly alter the internal particle structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. When the ionizable lipid loses its charge due to the elevated pH, its interaction with mRNA weakens, causing the lipid to self-aggregate and create an oil-like core phase. This reorganization propels mRNA towards the periphery of the LNP near the shell, as revealed by cryo-EM imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, See also references<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>). It is assumed that phospholipids, predominantly situated on the shell, are key in keeping mRNA encapsulated. Intriguingly, LNP particles tend to morph into bleb-like structures when phospholipid DSPC is employed, as DSPC has a strong propensity to form a lipid bilayer structure that would segregate into blebs under stress or over extended storage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), which is usually followed by the release of mRNA into the bleb space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. When the ionizable lipid reacquires its charge via pH reduction, mRNA is reabsorbed into the lipid core. This dynamic underscores the crucial role of ionic interaction in maintaining LNP stability.</p><p id="P38">In our study, we unveiled a novel series of ionizable lipids characterized by double ethanolamine head groups with two biodegradable branched tails, exemplified by the leading compound LQ-3. The overall mRNA delivery efficiency of LQ-3 LNP was comparable to that of lipids with a single ethanolamine head, like SM-102. However, a unique advantage of LQ-3 became apparent when we attempted to optimize its formulation -- including phospholipids like DSPC or DOPE negatively impacted delivery and compromised particle stability in LQ-3 formulations, a stark contrast to SM-102. We speculate that these disparities likely arise from the head configuration of LQ-3, implying that the double ethanolamine head might possess a higher affinity for mRNA. This might be due to the two positive charges carried by the LQ-3 head compared to one by SM-102, or LQ-3 might be more adept at forming nonionic interactions, such as hydrogen bonds with mRNA. To differentiate these interactions, we mixed LQ-3 with mRNA under acidic or neutral conditions and discovered that LQ-3 rendered over 95% mRNA inaccessible to RiboGreen dye, irrespective of the pH, indicating a major role of nonionic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). This was further substantiated by our molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, revealing that the hydroxyl groups in LQ-3’s head establish an increased number of hydrogen bonds with mRNA, often synergistically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P39">These dominant nonionic interactions entail two significant implications. Firstly, the dependence on the charges of ionizable lipids during the initial nanoparticle formation phase is lessened, as formation can now proceed in a neutral buffer without compromising encapsulation efficiency. This is advantageous during LNP manufacturing, as the process can be executed in the same buffer, avoiding pH adjustments which frequently disrupt particle structure leading to aggregation. Secondly, the “helper” phospholipids either lose their importance or negatively affect particle stability and delivery efficiency. As detailed earlier, phospholipids like DSPC are essential for SM-102 and possibly other ionizable lipids to form stable particles, as they could mitigate the adverse impact triggered by the phase separation of ionizable lipid under neutral conditions. However, in the case of ionizable lipid like LQ-3, where nonionic interactions predominate, the RNA:lipid core remains relatively stable even when ionizable lipids lose charges, as inferred from cryo-EM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Hence, DSPC is not imperative for stability. This is reminiscent of conventional lipoplex formulation, where a permanently charged cationic lipid is used to complex with DNA or oligodeoxynucleotides, and stable particles can be formed by supplying the auxiliary lipid cholesterol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P40">Building on these insights, we developed a new iPLX formulation encompassing three components: ionizable lipid LQ-3, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid. In practice, we observed that LQ-3 iPLX generally achieved a higher mRNA encapsulation efficiency of around 98%, while SM-102 LNP usually yielded around 92% efficiency. Additionally, the exclusion of DSPC also eliminated the formation of the bleb-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P41">Comparing mRNA expression, the peak expression of mRNA-LQ-3 iPLX at the 4-hour mark slightly lagged behind mRNA-SM-102 LNP, but it waned at a slower rate from 4 to 24 hours. The rationale for this could be a less productive endosome escape of mRNA, as DSPC has been implicated in promoting endosome escape, or stronger binding of ionizable lipids to mRNA post-endosome escape, interfering with the ribosome from engaging mRNA for translation initiation. Further studies are needed to address these questions and may help to guide further optimization of the ionizable lipid.</p><p id="P42">We also explored the potential of LQ-3 iPLX as a vaccine platform. When compared with SM-102 LNP, we noticed that LQ-3 iPLX elicits similar levels of humoral response, however, T-cell immune response is slightly weaker. Further analysis revealed that LQ-3 iPLX induced significantly lower pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α, which could account for the weaker cell immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Whether this is due to the absence of DSPC or lesser adjuvant activity of LQ-3 compared to SM-102 is yet to be determined. Notably, owing to the two amine groups in LQ-3, a reduced quantity of LQ-3 was required to deliver the same amount of RNA compared to SM-102 with a fixed N:P ratio. Nevertheless, LQ-3 iPLX holds promise for a more controllable immune response, potentially reducing the prevalent adverse effects of current mRNA vaccines on the market.</p><p id="P43">In conclusion, our research has successfully uncovered a novel series of ionizable lipids that facilitate a three-component formulation, paving the way for enhanced stability and efficacy in mRNA delivery. This advancement also marks a significant stride towards lipid optimization. By capitalizing on the non-electrostatic interactions between ionizable lipids and mRNA, we can now tailor the formulation for more simplified and safer delivery systems.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><label>3</label><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="S13"><title>mRNA Synthesis</title><p id="P44">The mRNA encoding spike protein (Spike mRNA) and mRNA encoding firefly luciferase protein (Fluc mRNA) were synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription from a linearized DNA template.

The color reaction was quenched with 1N sulfuric acid for about 10 minutes, and the optical density was measured at a wavelength 450 nm by VARIOSKAN LUX (Thermo Fisher).</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Pseudovirus-based neutralization assay</title><p id="P58">Serum samples collected from immunized animals were serially diluted with the cell culture medium. The diluted serums were mixed with a pseudovirus suspension in 96-well plates at a ratio of 1:1, followed by 1 hour incubation at RT. Opti-HEK293/ACE2 cells were then added to the serum-virus mixture, and the plates were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. 48 hours later, the luciferase activity, reflecting the degree of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus transfection, was measured using the Luciferase Assay kit. The NT<sub>50</sub> was defined as the fold-dilution, which emitted an exceeding 50% inhibition of pseudovirus infection compared to the control group.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Intracellular cytokine staining assay</title><p id="P59">For the intracellular cytokine staining, mouse spleen cells were stimulated with 2 μg/ml S1、S2 peptide pools spanning SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and S2 respectively (15mers, overlapping by 11aa, GenScript) or equimolar amount of DMSO (negative control) in the presence of anti-mouse CD28 antibody (BD Bioscience) for 1 hour. GolgiStop™ protein transport inhibitor was added into the culture and further incubated for 5 hours. After stimulation, cells were washed and stained with Fixable Viability Stain 510 (BD Bioscience). Cells were then blocked with anti-mouse CD16/32 and labeled with cell surface antibody cocktail including anti-mouse CD3-FITC、anti-mouse CD4-APC and anti-mouse CD8-Percp-cy5.5 (BD Bioscience) for 30min at 4°C. Following surface staining, cells were incubated with fixed/permeabilized solution (BD Bioscience) for 20min at 4°C and stained with intracellular antibodies including anti-mouse IFN-γ-Pe-Cy7 and IL-2-BV605 (BD Bioscience) for 30min at 4°C. Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS buffer and acquired on a CYTEK Aurora/NL.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>IFN-γ and IL-2 ELISpot assays</title><p id="P60">The number of spleen cells secreting IFN-γ and IL-2 was detected by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays. In brief, single cell suspension from the mouse spleen was prepared and stimulated with 2 μg/ml spike S1、S2 peptide pool or equimolar amount of DMSO(negative control) for 22 h. IFN-γ and IL-2-secreting cells were detected using ELISpot kits (DAKEWE and MABTECH) according to the manufacture protocol and spots were counted using an ELISpot Analyzer AT-SPOT(SINSAGE).</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Luminex assay for mouse serum cytokines/chemokine detection</title><p id="P61">Mouse serum cytokine/chemokine levels were measured using the Mouse Premixed Multi-Analyte Kit (R&amp;D Systems, USA) at 6 hours after administration. The cytokines analyzed included TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ. The specific procedures were conducted according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Serum samples were diluted 2-fold for measurement. Plates were read on a Luminex®200™ instrument. The lower bound of per sample per cytokine/chemokine was set as 50 beads. Values below the limit of quantification (LOQ) were assigned as half of the LOQ.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>ELISA for rat serum IL-6 detection</title><p id="P62">To detect Rat IL-6 levels, the serum samples collected at 6 hours and 48 hours after administration were diluted 2-fold for ELISA analysis using the LEGEND MAX™ Rat IL-6 ELISA Kit with pre-coated plate (Biolegend, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations with a little modification as described below. In the final color development step, the reaction was stopped after adding Substrate Solution F for 5 minutes instead of 10 minutes, to avoid the results outside the instrument measuring range. The plates were read on a microplate reader, varioskan lux (therm23hermosntific), at the absorbance of 450 nm. Values below the LOQ were assigned as half of the LOQ.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Measurements of serum ALT and creatinine levels</title><p id="P63">ALT activity and creatinine (Crea) concentration in the serum of SD rats and C57BL/6J mice collected at 6 hours and 14 or 12 days after administration were determined using the ALT assay kit and Creatinine assay kit, respectively, following the instructions provided by the reagent kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supporting Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS189852-supplement-Supporting_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d190aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S33"><title>Acknowledgments</title><sec id="S34"><title>Funding</title></sec></ack><sec id="S35" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data and materials availability</title><p id="P64">All data associated with this study are present in the paper and/or the Supplementary Materials.</p></sec><fn-group><fn fn-type="con" id="FN1"><p id="P65"><bold>Author Contributions:</bold> J.Lin developed the lipid molecules; J.Lu and T.J. designed the experiments; T.J. performed physicochemical characterization of nanoparticles; L.C. and J.G. synthesized the lipid compounds; X.L. designed and conducted the safety assessments of the delivery system; S.T. assisted in the design of immunogenicity tests; H.G. supported cellular immunity detection; R.Y. aided nanoparticle preparation and characterization; Y.Z., J.Z., and D.O. conducted molecular dynamics simulations; H.Yao supported NMR studies; T.J., J.Lu, and J.Lin analyzed the data; T.J. drafted the manuscript; J.Lin, J.
