In fission yeast, the anchorage of perturbed replication forks to NPCs is an integral part of the recombination-dependent replication restart mechanism (RDR) that resumes DNA synthesis at terminally dysfunctional forks. By mapping DNA polymerase usage, we report that SUMO protease Ulp1-associated NPCs ensure efficient initiation of restarted DNA synthesis, whereas proteasome-associated NPCs sustain the progression of restarted DNA polymerase. In contrast to Ulp1-dependent events, this last function occurs independently of SUMO chains formation. By analyzing the role of the nuclear basket, the nucleoplasmic extension of the NPC, we reveal that the activities of Ulp1 and the proteasome cannot compensate for each other and affect RDR dynamics in distinct ways.

Nuclear organization constitutes a critical layer of regulation of DNA-associated transactions and an important determinant of genome integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The stability of the genome is jeopardized during DNA replication; the progression of the replisome being recurrently threatened by a broad spectrum of obstacles that cause replication fork slowing, temporary fork stalling or terminal fork collapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Such alterations of fork progression are a hallmark of replication stress. Failure to safeguard genome stability upon replication stress is a potent driving force behind the onset and progression of human diseases including cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. While multiple replication fork-repair pathways can be engaged at stressed forks to promote the completion of genome duplication, they result in variable outcomes for genome stability and thus must be carefully controlled and regulated. Our current knowledge of the regulatory functions played by nuclear organization in the usage of fork repair pathways remains in its infancy.</p><p id="P4">Among the fork-repair pathways, homologous recombination (HR) is particularly active in protecting, repairing and restarting stressed forks, making HR an efficient tumor suppressor mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The central factor of the HR machinery is the Rad51 recombinase that forms a nucleoprotein filament on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), with the assistance of a loader, known as Rad52 in yeast models. In a non-recombinogenic mode, the Rad51 filament limits the degradation of ssDNA by various nucleases, thus ensuring the protection and integrity of stressed forks. In a recombinogenic mode, HR repairs broken forks with a single-ended double-strand break (DSB) by a mechanism called break-induced replication (BIR) and promotes replication resumption at DSB-free collapsed forks by a mechanism called recombination-dependent replication (RDR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Both BIR and RDR are associated with non-canonical DNA synthesis, approximatively 100 times more mutagenic than canonical replication. Furthermore, during BIR and RDR, both DNA strands are synthesized by DNA polymerase delta (Pol δ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. These features allow experimental differentiation between DNA replicated by a repaired/restarted fork and DNA replicated by a canonical origin-born fork. Although stressed forks have the potential to relocate to the nuclear periphery (NP), little is known about the contribution of such changes in nuclear positioning in regulating the replicative functions of the HR machinery.</p><p id="P5">3D genome folding within the complex nuclear environment is a critical layer of DNA repair regulation. A striking example is the DNA damage response-dependent fate of DSBs that relocate to the NP or shift away from heterochromatin compartments to achieve error-free repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. This led to the concept that the membrane-less nuclear compartment exhibits distinct DNA repair capacities and that DNA repair machineries are spatially segregated. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are macromolecular structures embedded in the nuclear envelope (NE) that act as nuclear scaffolds to regulate cellular processes via a wide range of mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The overall structure of NPCs is conserved among eukaryote kingdom, being composed of multiple copies of 30 different nucleoporins that associate in stable sub-complexes. The core NPC defines a central channel composed of transmembrane and channel nucleoporins. This core complex assembles with the outer and inner rings at the cytoplasmic and nuclear sides, respectively. A Y-shaped structure, located both at the cytoplasmic and nuclear side of NPCs, called in fission yeast Nup107-Nup160 complex, is crucial for NPCs organization and proper segregation of chromosomes in eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The final composition of individual NPCs is variable, depending on their position within the NE, suggesting that the NPC structure is dynamic. In particular, the nuclear basket, a nucleoplasmic extension of the core NPC, is the most dynamic part and NPCs localized in the nucleolar part of the NE are more frequently devoid of a nuclear basket<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The primary function of NPCs is the transport of macromolecules from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and mRNA export. NPCs also define a particular nuclear compartment enriched for the SUMO SENP protease and the proteasome and act as docking sites for DSBs and perturbed replication forks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Stressed forks can relocate to the NP and, in some cases, anchor to NPCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. These include forks stalled by structure-forming DNA sequences, telomeric repeats, DNA-bound proteins and replication inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Although distinct scenarios arise depending on the source of replication stress and the model organism, the common emerging concept is that nuclear positioning of replication stress sites influences the usage of fork repair pathways. For example, in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (Sc), forks stalled within telomeric repeats associate with NPCs to restrict error-prone HR events and maintain telomere length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Forks stalled by CAG repeats, prone to form secondary DNA structures, also anchor to NPCs, in a SUMO-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In this instance, SUMOylated RPA on ssDNA at the stalled fork inhibits Rad51 loading, which is permitted only after NPC anchorage that subsequently favors error-free fork restart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Changes in nuclear positioning are far from being a yeast-specific phenomenon. Upon DNA polymerase inhibition, stalled forks in human cells relocate to the NP to minimize chromosomal instability and ensure timely fork restart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Additionally, stressed forks at human telomeres relocate to NPCs to maintain telomere integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">We previously reported that, in the yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (Sp), dysfunctional forks relocate in a SUMO-dependent manner and anchor to NPCs for the time necessary to achieve RDR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. This change in nuclear positioning is critical to spatially segregate the subsequent steps of RDR, with dysfunctional forks being processed and remodeled in the nucleoplasm to load Rad51. SUMO chains that are generated by the E3 SUMO ligase, Pli1, trigger relocation to NPCs but limit also the efficiency of HR-mediated DNA synthesis for fork restart. Relocation of dysfunctional forks to NPCs allows SUMO conjugates to be cleared by the SUMO deconjugating enzyme, Ulp1, which is sequestrated at the NP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, NPCs are an integral part of RDR regulation to promote HR-dependent DNA synthesis at dysfunctional forks. However, the dynamics underlying this process remain unexplored. In particular, the contribution of NPCs to non-canonical Pol δ/Pol δ DNA synthesis, a hallmark of HR-restarted forks, has not been addressed. Here, by mapping DNA polymerase usage during HR-mediated fork restart, we reveal that the SUMO protease, Ulp1, and the proteasome differentially affect the dynamics of HR-dependent fork restart by ensuring efficient DNA synthesis resumption and by sustaining the dynamic progression of the restarted fork, respectively. Moreover, by studying the role of the nuclear basket in RDR, we show that Ulp1 and the proteasome do not compensate for each other, with Ulp1 being critical to counteract the inhibitory effect of SUMO chains but not the proteasome. Our study uncovers mechanisms by which the NPC compartment acts as a critical environment for optimal HR-dependent fork restart.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P8">To investigate the contribution of the NP to the dynamics of HR-mediated fork restart, we exploited the <italic>RTS1</italic> replication fork barrier (RFB) that promotes the polar arrest of a single replisome at a specific genomic location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The activity of the RFB is fully dependent on the Rtf1 protein that binds to the <italic>RTS1</italic> sequence. The expression of Rtf1 can be artificially regulated by the <italic>nmt41</italic> promoter to allow Rtf1 repression in thiamine-containing media (RFB OFF condition) and its expression upon thiamine removal (RFB ON condition). Alternatively, the <italic>rtf1</italic> gene can be deleted and the results compared with an <italic>rtf1</italic>+ strain. Forks arrested at the RFB become fully dysfunctional and undergo controlled degradation of nascent strands by the end-resection machinery to generate ssDNA gaps of ˜ 1 Kb in length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. RPA, Rad52 and Rad51 are loaded onto these ssDNA gaps, ensuring fork protection until the arrested fork is either fused with a converging fork or actively restarted by RDR, which occurs approximately 20 minutes after the arrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. The restarted fork is associated with a non-canonical, mutagenic DNA synthesis in which both strands are synthesized by Pol δ, making it insensitive to the RFB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Ulp1-associated NPCs ensure the efficient priming of recombination-mediated DNA synthesis</title><p id="P9">We previously reported that the nucleoporin Nup132, part of the Y complex of NPCs core, promotes RDR in a post-anchoring manner and acts downstream of Rad51 loading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The RDR defect observed in <italic>nup132</italic> null cells is caused by the delocalization of Ulp1 from the NP since its artificial tethering to the RFB restored RDR efficiency. Thus, Ulp1-associated NPCs prime HR-dependent DNA synthesis to ensure efficient RDR, but the dynamics of this process are unknown. To address this, we employed the polymerase usage sequencing (Pu-seq) approach that allows the genome-wide mapping of the usage of Pol δ and polymerase epsilon (Pol ε) during DNA replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Pu-seq makes use of a pair of yeast strains mutated in either Pol δ or Pol ε that incorporate higher levels of ribonucleotides during DNA synthesis. The mapping of ribonucleotides in a strand-specific manner in strains mutated either for Pol δ or Pol ε allows the genome-wide tracking of polymerase usage. Combined with the <italic>RTS1</italic>-RFB, the Pu-seq method allows monitoring the usage frequency of each polymerase separately on both the Watson and Crick strands when the RFB is either inactive (RFB OFF, in an <italic>rtf1Δ</italic> genetic background) or constitutively active (RFB ON, Rtf1 expressed from the <italic>adh1</italic> promoter to maximize fork arrest efficiency)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">At an inactive barrier site (RFB OFF), replication is canonical and unidirectional coming from an early replication origin (leading strand synthesized by Pol ε and lagging strand synthesized by Pol δ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a-b</xref>, top panel). This division of labor between Pol δ and ε changed sharply in an RFB ON strain: at the barrier site, Pol ε in the leading strand is switched to Pol δ during the restart of the blocked fork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>, bottom panel). This sharp transition characterizes the efficiency of the restart itself. It means that this creates a bias towards Pol δ on both strands (Watson and Crick) downstream of the <italic>RTS1</italic>-RFB site due to the restart. The Pol δ/d bias describes the time needed for the restart as well as the progression of the restarted fork relative to the canonical convergent fork from a late replication origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Based on the Pol δ/δ bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), we estimated that, when compared to <italic>WT</italic> (<italic>nup132</italic>+) cells, only 60% of the expected number of forks were arrested and restarted in <italic>nup132Δ</italic> cells, while the remaining 40% were either not arrested or were arrested and did not restart before being rescued by an incoming leftward moving canonical fork. The increase in Pol ε usage on the Crick strand for ˜10 Kb downstream of the <italic>RTS1</italic> barrier is indicative of this latter scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Remarkably, this fork-restart defect is consistent with our previous estimation using a proxy-restart assay that exploits the mutagenic DNA synthesis to provide a genetic readout of RDR efficiency. Using this proxy assay, we reported a nearly two-fold reduction in RDR efficiency in <italic>nup132Δ</italic> cells compared to <italic>WT</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Finally, the relative slope of the Pol δ/δ bias disappearance over distance was similar between the two replicates from <italic>nup132Δ</italic> cells and the <italic>WT</italic> strain, indicating that the forks that succeeded to restart progress with similar speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The nuclear basket promotes RDR in a pre- and post-anchoring manner</title><p id="P11">We next investigated the role of the nuclear basket in dealing with replication stress. The <italic>S. pombe</italic> nuclear basket is composed of 4 non-essential nucleoporins: Nup60 (ScNup60), Nup61 (ScNup2, HsNup50), Nup124 (ScNup1, HsNup153) and Alm1 (ScMlp1/2, HsTPR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. A fifth component is the essential nucleoporin Nup211, a second orthologue of ScMlp1/2 and HsTPR. Some of these components are known to contribute to resistance to DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We confirmed that <italic>alm1Δ</italic> cells were highly sensitive to a wide range of replication-blocking agents and bleomycin-induced DSBs, whereas <italic>nup60Δ</italic> and <italic>nup61Δ</italic> cells exhibited mild sensitivity only to hydroxyurea (HU), a replication inhibitor that depletes dNTP pool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To establish if this HU sensitivity correlates with a defect in resuming replication following HU treatment, we arrested cells for 4 hours in 20mM HU and then followed DNA content by flow cytometry upon release into HU-free media. Among nuclear basket mutants, only <italic>nup61Δ</italic> cells displayed a defect in the recovery from HU-stalled forks, a defect similar to the one previously reported for <italic>nup132Δ</italic> cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>): the <italic>WT</italic> strain reached a G2 DNA content 45 minutes after release, whereas both <italic>nup132Δ</italic> and <italic>nup61Δ</italic> cells exhibited an additional 15 minutes delay. This observation is supported by the analysis of chromosomes by Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). HU treatment prevented chromosomes from migrating into the gel because of replication intermediates accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). <italic>WT</italic> chromosomes migrated into the gel, with twice intensity of an asynchronous culture, 90 minutes after release, indicating complete genome duplication <italic>WT</italic> genome and recovery from HU-stalled forks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). Consistent with the flow cytometry data, only chromosomes from <italic>nup132Δ</italic> and <italic>nup61Δ</italic> cells showed a clear delay in their ability to migrate into the gel and to fully duplicate, confirming a role for Nup61 in promoting DNA replication upon transient fork stalling by HU.</p><p id="P13">To establish the role of the nuclear basket in promoting replication resumption at the RFB, we first measured replication slippage (RS) downstream of <italic>RTS1</italic>, the proxy measure of non-canonical replication resulting from RDR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The absence of Nup60 and Alm1, but not Nup124 or Nup61, led to a ˜2-fold reduction in the frequency of RFB-induced RS, indicating a reduced RDR efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Analysis of replication intermediates by bi-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) showed that fork arrest and the formation of large ssDNA gaps (&gt;100 bp) at the RFB (which are visualized as a specific “tail” DNA structure emanating from the fork arrest signal and descending toward the linear arc; see red arrow on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> were unaltered in all four non-essential nucleoporin mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-d</xref>). This indicates that the controlled degradation of nascent strands and Rad51-dependent fork protection are unaffected. Thus, the RDR defect observed in <italic>nup60Δ</italic> and <italic>alm1Δ</italic> is not related to defects in the early steps of RDR, from ssDNA gap formation to Rad51 loading.</p><p id="P14">We next investigated the ability of the RFB to relocate to the NP. We employed a strain harboring a <italic>LacO</italic>-marked RFB, expressing LacI-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>) and an endogenously GFP-tagged Npp106, a NPCs component, to mark the NP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).

The <italic>nup61Δ</italic> cells exhibited a slight increase in the frequency of co-localization in RFB OFF condition but reached a similar enrichment at the NP to <italic>WT</italic> cells in RFB ON condition.

Although the total amount of peripheral Ulp1 was slightly increased in <italic>alm1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>), the increased nuclear size led to a significant reduction in terms of peripheral Ulp1 density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).

Finally, we quantified co-localization between Cut11-mCherry and Ulp1-GFP signal as a read-out of Ulp1-associated NPCs, using Manders overlap coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d-e</xref>) and Pearson correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). As a control, we first assigned co-localization between Cut11-mCherry and Npp106-GFP, two core components of NPCs.

In the absence of either Nup132 or Nup60, the low level of Ulp1 appeared to not overlap with Cut11 at the resolution achieved on the images, indicating that Ulp1-associated NPCs are abolished. Despite a lower NPCs density and a reduced Ulp1 expression in the absence of Alm1, Ulp1-associated NPCs were only moderately affected (˜70 % compared to ˜75 % in the <italic>WT</italic> background). In contrast, only ˜50 % of Cut11 signal was correlated with Ulp1 in <italic>nup124Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>), indicating that Ulp1-associated NPCs are less abundant.

Consistently, these strains showed a significant growth defect when plated on media free of drug (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>), indicating that either the AID2 system applied to Nup211 is leaky or that the C-terminal degron tag partially compromised Nup211 function.

We concluded that Nup211 makes little contribution to Ulp1 expression and peripheral sequestration.

Thus, when the active RFB shifts to the NP and Ulp1 is no longer recruited at NPCs to degrade SUMO conjugates, RDR is impeded. To test if the same scenario occurs in the absence of Nup60, we employed a previously successful approach to tether Ulp1-LexA to the RFB harboring 8 LexA binding sites (either <italic>t-LacO-ura4:LexBS&lt;ori</italic> for nuclear positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>) or <italic>t-ura4-sd20:lexA&lt;ori</italic> for RFB-induced RS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>).

Consistent with the role of Nup60 in sequestrating Ulp1 at the NP, the inactive RFB did not shift to the NP in <italic>nup60Δ</italic> cells but was efficiently enriched at the NP in RFB ON condition, confirming that Ulp1 is dispensable for anchorage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Remarkably, tethering Ulp1-LexA to the active RFB, anchored to NPCs, resulted in an increased frequency of RFB-induced RS in <italic>nup60Δ</italic> cells, indicating that the lack of Ulp1-associated NPCs is a limiting step in promoting HR-mediated DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). In addition, we combined the <italic>nup60</italic> deletion with SUMO-KallR, which allows only mono-SUMOylation to occur (c.f. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). As previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, we observed a slight increase in RFB-induced RS in SUMO-KallR strain, indicating that SUMO chains limit RDR efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). As expected, preventing SUMO chains in <italic>nup60Δ</italic> cells restored RFB-induced RS to <italic>WT</italic> level, further confirming that Ulp1-associated NPCs are required to overcome the inhibitory effect of SUMO chains on HR-mediated DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5c</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Surprisingly, applying similar approaches to <italic>alm1Δ</italic> cells resulted in different outcomes, indicating a distinct scenario of RDR defect. Preventing SUMO chains formation did not rescue the RDR defect observed in the absence of Alm1 (compare <italic>alm1Δ</italic> and <italic>alm1Δ</italic> SUMO-KallR on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>), indicating that this mutant does not suffer from the toxicity of SUMO chains against HR-mediated DNA synthesis. Moreover, tethering Ulp1 to the RFB did not rescue the RDR defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The analysis of the nuclear positioning of the <italic>LacO</italic>-marked RFB showed that the RFB was efficiently shifted to the NP in <italic>alm1Δ</italic> cells regardless its activity, thus allowing bypassing the role of Alm1 in locating the active RFB at the NP (compare RFB ON condition with or without Ulp1-LexA in <italic>alm1Δ</italic> on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In other words, the artificial anchorage of the RFB to Ulp1-associated NPCs is not sufficient to rescue the RDR defect of <italic>alm1Δ</italic> cells. This indicates that the lack of RFB relocation to the NP is not the underlying cause of the RDR defect and that Alm1 is probably required at NPCs to promote RDR, independently of SUMO chains. Interestingly, Daga and colleagues have reported that Alm1 is required for proper localization of the proteasome to the NE. Several proteasome subunits and anchors, such as Mts2, Mts4 and Cut8, are not properly localized at the NP in <italic>alm1Δ</italic> cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.

Rpn10 acts as an ubiquitin receptor of the proteasome and its absence results in the accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates.

To probe this function, we applied the Pu-Seq approach to the <italic>rpn10</italic> mutant to compare DNA polymerase usage at and downstream from the barrier site. Based on the Pol δ/δ bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c-d</xref>), we estimated that when compared to <italic>rpn10</italic>+ cells, approximately 85% of the expected number of forks were arrested and restarted in <italic>rpn10Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>).

This slow/unstable replication accounts for the increased number of leftward moving canonical forks evident in the Pu-seq traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). We estimated that approximately half of restarted forks progress approximately one third of the distance of <italic>WT</italic> restarted forks. This scenario contrasts with that observed in the <italic>nup132Δ</italic> cells, in which fewer forks were restarted but the progression of those that did restart was unaffected. We concluded that both the proteasome and Ulp1 are required at the NP to foster the dynamics of HR-mediated DNA synthesis by affecting, respectively, the efficient initiation of restarted DNA synthesis and the progression of the restarted fork.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">Halted replication forks are diverted to the NP and can associate with NPC components to engage error-free DNA repair pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. How the NPC environment acts mechanistically to foster the dynamics of DNA repair pathways remains unclear. Here, we reveal that NPCs define a particular nuclear compartment that favors the dynamic of HR-dependent DNA synthesis at dysfunctional forks by two distinct mechanisms. The SUMO protease Ulp1 ensures an efficient initiation of restarted DNA synthesis by alleviating the inhibitory effect of SUMO chains. This mechanism requires the sequestration of Ulp1 at the NP which is coordinated by the Y complex and the nuclear basket nucleoporin Nup60. The second mechanism relies on the ability of the nuclear basket to enrich proteasome components at the NP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, to foster the progress of restarted DNA polymerases. Surprisingly, this last function cannot be bypassed by preventing SUMO chains formation. We establish that Ulp1 and the proteasome affect differently the dynamics of HR-mediated DNA synthesis without compensating for each other.</p><p id="P23">We previously reported that the Y complex nucleoporin Nup132 promotes RDR in a post-anchoring manner, downstream of Rad51 loading at dysfunctional forks, by sequestrating Ulp1 at the NP to alleviate the inhibitory effect of SUMO chains on HR-mediated DNA synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Here, we reveal that the nuclear basket contributes to this pathway. Akin to budding yeast <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, the sequestration of Ulp1 at the NP in <italic>S. pombe</italic> requires the nuclear basket nucleoporin Nup60. Despite our efforts, we cannot rule out a synergistic functions of TPR homologs, Alm1 and Nup211, in the spatial segregation of Ulp1 at the NP. By mapping DNA polymerase usage during HR-dependent fork restart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, we establish that Ulp1-associated NPCs are necessary to ensure efficient initiation of restarted DNA synthesis that is likely inhibited by Pli1-dependent formation of SUMO chains of unknown targets. In budding yeast, a similar inhibitory effect of SUMO chains on DNA replication initiation at origins has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. The MCM helicase and other replication factors were identified as SUMO chains-modified substrates for targeting by the SUMO protease Ulp2 and proteasomal degradation. Although we did not formally address the function of t SpUlp2 in RDR, our data clearly highlight a role for Ulp1-associated NPCs in counteracting the inhibitory effect of SUMO chains on the initiation of restarted DNA synthesis. Protein-protein docking studies predicted a higher affinity of SpUlp1 towards SUMO particles compared to ScUlp1, suggesting a more specific role of SpUlp1 in targeting SUMO chains than Ulp2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Moreover, the abundance of Ulp1-associated NPCs is not a limiting factor in promoting RDR, as their reduction by 40 % in <italic>nup124Δ</italic> cells does not lead to no noticeable RDR defect.</p><p id="P24">We previously reported that the proteasome, whose activity is enriched at the NP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, promotes RDR in a post-anchoring manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The mapping of DNA polymerase usage during HR-dependent fork restart reveals that a proteasome defect affects more severely the progression of restarted DNA polymerases, with a reduction of forward movement by up to 70 %, than the initiation of restarted DNA synthesis. This contrasts with Ulp1 function in contributing primarily to the initiation of DNA synthesis with no apparent contribution to the dynamic progression of restarted DNA polymerases. This division of labour between the proteasome and the SUMO protease in ensuring the dynamics of HR-dependent fork restart is reinforced by the fact that these activities cannot compensate for each other. Indeed, the artificial tethering of the RFB to NPCs in the <italic>alm1Δ</italic> mutant shows that Ulp1-associated NPCs are insufficient to promote efficient RDR without a functional proteasome at the NP. Moreover, our genetic analysis establishes that the role of the proteasome in fostering the progress of restarted DNA synthesis is not related to counteracting the inhibitory effect of SUMO chains. This suggests distinct specificities between the proteasome and Ulp1 towards SUMOylated targets which affect differently the dynamics resumption of DNA synthesis at dysfunctional forks. We do not exclude that SUMO-independent poly-ubiquitination, targeted by Rpn10 for proteasomal degradation, plays a role in promoting RDR. However, we previously identified that the SUMO Targeted Ubiquitin Ligase (STUbL) Slx8-Rfp1-Rfp2, a family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that targets SUMOylated proteins for degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, promotes both the relocation of dysfunctional forks to NPCs and RDR efficiency in a Pli1-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. This supports the notion that mono-SUMOylated or chain-free multi-SUMOylated factors are potential targets of a proteasome and Slx8-dependent pathway that ensures the progress of restarted DNA polymerases. SUMO chains-independent functions of STUBL are documented, including the relocation of forks collapsed at CAG repeats via mono-SUMOylation recognized by the SUMO interacting motif of ScSlx5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The human STUBL RNF4 can also bind the substrate ETV4 mono-SUMOylated on multiple lysines, in a process requiring the multiple SIM domains of RFN4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">Our work also identified that in the absence of the nuclear basket nucleoporin Alm1, the RFB was no longer enriched at the NP. To our knowledge, TPR homologs have not been involved in anchoring DNA lesions to NPCs in yeast models. Upon telomeric replication stress, human telomeres relocate to the NP and associate with NPC components, including TPR, to resolve replication defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Depletion of human TPR is associated with a variety of replication defects and TPR was proposed to coordinate at NPCs a network of factors involved in RNA metabolism to protect cells from RNA-mediated replication stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Given the nuclear morphology alterations in the absence of Alm1, we do not favor the hypothesis of a direct involvement of Alm1 in anchoring dysfunctional forks at NPCs. In human cells, the mobility of stressed forks towards the NP requires F-nuclear actin polymerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, but such a mechanism has not been reported in yeasts. We estimated that, in the absence of Alm1, the RFB must explore a nuclear volume 40 % larger to reach the NP and associate with NPCs whose abundance is reduced by one quarter. We therefore favor the hypothesis that the lack of relocation is an indirect effect due to alterations of nuclear morphology and NPC density.</p><p id="P26">Overall, this work uncovers two mechanisms by which the NPC environment ensures the dynamic of HR-dependent replication restart, streamlining the need for dysfunctional forks to change nuclear positioning. Ulp1-associated NPCs contribute to the efficient initiation of restarted DNA synthesis to engage a Polδ/Polδ DNA synthesis, by counteracting the inhibitory effect of SUMO chains, whereas proteasome-associated NPCs foster the progression of restarted DNA synthesis, in a SUMO chains independent manner. These two functions cannot compensate for each other, are differently required and control distinct dynamics of replication resumption at dysfunctional forks. Moreover, our work indicates that multiple SUMOylated targets are likely engaged to limit HR-dependent DNA synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Standard yeast genetics</title><p id="P27">Yeast strains used in this work are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>.

Then cultures were diluted and plated on EMMg complete (for cell survival) and on EMMg without uracil, both supplemented with 60 µM thiamine. After 5-7 days of incubation at 30°C colonies were counted to determine the frequency of ura4+ reversion. To obtain the true occurrence of replication slippage by the <italic>RTS1</italic>-RFB, independently of the genetic background, we subtracted the replication slippage frequency of the strain devoid of RFB (considered as spontaneous frequency) from the frequency of the strain containing <italic>the t-ura4sd20&lt;ori</italic> construct, upon expression of Rtf1.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p id="P35">Flow cytometry analysis of DNA content was performed as follows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>: cells were fixed in 70 % ethanol and washed with 50 mM sodium citrate, digested with RNAse A (Sigma, R5503) for 2 hours, stained with 1µM Sytox Green nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen, S7020) and subjected to flow cytometry using FACSCANTO II (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Whole protein extract analysis</title><p id="P36">Aliquots of 1×10<sup>8</sup> cells were collected and disrupted by bead beating in 1 mL of 20 % TCA (Sigma, T9159).
