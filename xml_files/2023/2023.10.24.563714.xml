Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) in the Cornu Ammonis (CA) region, and dentate spikes (DSs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) are prime candidate network events supporting this offline process. SWRs have been studied extensively but the contribution of DSs remains unclear. By combining triple-(DG-CA3-CA1) ensemble recordings and closed-loop optogenetics in mice we show that, like SWRs, DSs synchronize spiking across DG and CA principal cells to reactivate population-level patterns of neuronal coactivity expressed during prior waking experience. Notably, the population coactivity structure in DSs is more diverse and higher-dimensional than that seen during SWRs. Importantly, suppressing DG granule cell spiking selectively during DSs impairs subsequent flexible memory performance in a multi-object recognition task and associated hippocampal patterns of neuronal coactivity. We conclude that DSs constitute a second offline network event central to hippocampal population dynamics serving memory-guided behavior.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Memories are stabilized during periods of sleep and rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Maquet, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Walker and Stickgold, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Klinzing, Niethard and Born, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Brodt <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Decades of work have provided important insights into the underlying brain network mechanisms and have identified offline hippocampal activity as essential for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Buzsáki, 2010</xref>; Girardeau and Lopes-dos-Santos, 2021). Central to our current understanding are hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs): an intermittent, high-frequency (100 – 250 Hz) network event detected in the local field potentials (LFPs) of the CA1 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Buzsáki, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Axmacher, Elger and Fell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Joo and Frank, 2018</xref>). During SWRs, the firing activity of CA1 principal cells is transiently modulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Csicsvari, H. Hirase, <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Csicsvari <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>) and reactivates the population-level firing patterns expressed in previous waking experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>). These offline spiking correlates have behavioral significance: suppressing CA1 neurons during SWRs impairs memory recall for recently acquired information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Girardeau <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">van de Ven <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Conversely, prolonging SWRs or reinforcing the coordination between SWRs and neocortical activity promotes memory consolidation and subsequent behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Maingret <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fernández-Ruiz <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Hippocampal SWRs therefore constitute an offline network event important for memory-guided behavior. However, during sleep/rest periods the hippocampus exhibits another prominent network event: dentate spikes (DS), which are seen in the LFPs of the dentate gyrus (DG). To date, DSs have received little attention compared to SWRs. Accordingly, here we characterize the neuronal spiking dynamics nested in DSs with respect to SWRs and evaluate whether DSs constitute a second network event central to offline reactivation of waking firing patterns and subsequent memory-guided behavior.</p><p id="P3">The DG gates sensory information to the hippocampus, notably decorrelating these inputs into orthogonal patterns. This function may be crucial for the hippocampus to integrate multiple items in memory and to flexibly distinguish between stimuli with overlapping features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Treves and Rolls, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">McHugh <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Knierim and Neunuebel, 2016</xref>). Within the DG, DSs represent intermittent, large amplitude network events recorded in the LFPs of the DG granule cell layer and are associated with increased spiking activity in dentate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bragin <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dvorak <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). However, across the literature both increased and suppressed spiking activity of CA principal cells have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bragin <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Penttonen <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Meier <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dvorak <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Sanchez-Aguilera <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), although, notably, some of these studies were in anesthetized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Penttonen <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; Sanchez-Aguilera <italic>et al</italic>., 2021) or head-fixed animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dvorak <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Thus, here we further performed a systematic comparative assessment of DG and CA principal cell spiking activity during DSs versus SWRs in non-anesthetized, freely behaving mice.</p><p id="P4">To investigate the influence of DSs on hippocampal network activity and memory, we combined triple-(DG-CA3-CA1) site extracellular multichannel recordings and closed-loop optogenetic interventions in mice during active behavior and sleep/rest. We observed that DSs transiently increase principal cell spiking across the DG and CA regions of the hippocampus, nesting offline population-level activity patterns that are distinct from those in SWRs. Further, we report that DSs reactivate population activity patterns seen during prior waking experience. This DS-nested activity is relevant to whole-hippocampus population dynamics and memory-guided behavior: suppressing offline DG granule cell spiking selectively during DSs affects downstream CA principal cell spiking and impairs subsequent flexible memory performance in a hippocampal-dependent, multi-object recognition task. We propose that DSs constitute a second hippocampus network event that plays a complementary role to that of SWRs by supporting the offline reactivation of higher dimensional population patterns of neuronal coactivity in support of memory stabilization.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Firing activity of hippocampal neurons synchronizes during DS events</title><p id="P5">We first used triple-(DG-CA3-CA1) site tetrode recordings to monitor network events in the LFPs and the spike trains of neuronal ensembles from the dorsal hippocampus of mice during sleep/rest (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A,B</xref>; n = 12 mice). From these LFPs, we detected DSs in DG and SWRs in CA1 to compare the spiking of principal cells between these two types of network event. Both DG DSs and CA1 SWRs were of short duration (median (IQR) duration: DSs = 42.4 (40.0 – 46.4) ms; SWRs = 47.5 (45.2 – 51.0) ms), occurring intermittently (median (IQR) occurrence frequency: DSs = 0.40 (0.25 – 0.58) Hz; SWRs = 0.75 (0.26 – 1.26) Hz) and rarely simultaneously (median (IQR) DS-SWR co-occurrence frequency: 0.03 (0.02 – 0.05) Hz). DS waveforms were consistent across mice and recording sessions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A,B</xref>). We computed the firing responses of individual principal cells (n = 2,196 total recorded principal cells; CA1, 887; CA3, 388; DG, 921 cells) with respect to the peak of either DSs (without co-occurring SWRs) or SWRs (without co-occurring DSs). In line with previous work, DG principal cells transiently increased their firing activity during DSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bragin <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Penttonen <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>); the activity of CA principal cells increased during SWRs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C-G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C-H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Csicsvari, Hajime Hirase, <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>). We further observed that DG principal cell firing increased during SWRs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C,F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C-F</xref>). However, we found that CA principal cells also increased their firing rate during DSs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D-G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C,G-H</xref>), in contrast to some earlier reports that CA principal cell firing is suppressed during DSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bragin <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Penttonen <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Previous studies identified two types of DS event (DS<sub>1</sub> and DS<sub>2</sub>), based on the laminar profile of the transmembrane currents associated with the LFP expression of these network events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bragin <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Meier <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dvorak <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we next asked whether principal cell firing responses differed between DS<sub>1</sub> and DS<sub>2</sub>. However, localizing sinks and sources of currents across hippocampal layers requires applying Current Source Density (CSD) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Pettersen <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>) to the LFPs measured at evenly spaced sites from the CA1 oriens layer to the DG granule cell layer. Such a laminar profile is not accessible with tetrode recordings. To distinguish between DS<sub>1</sub> and DS<sub>2</sub> events, we therefore implanted linear silicon-probes spanning the somato-dendritic axis of CA1 principal cells and reaching the inferior blade of the DG in a separate group of mice (n = 3). Having performed silicon-probe recordings during sleep/rest, we applied CSD analysis to these LFPs measured over the radial extent of the hippocampus to identify DS<sub>1</sub> versus DS<sub>2</sub> according to their underlying profile of current sinks and sources (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A</xref>; see methods). These CSD-validated DS<sub>1</sub> and DS<sub>2</sub> events exhibited distinct DG granule cell layer LFP waveforms (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>). We then trained a linear discriminant analysis classifier to identify these CSD-validated DS<sub>1</sub> versus DS<sub>2</sub> events using only their DG granule cell layer LFP signal. When tested on the silicon-probe LFP dataset, the classifier achieved over 85% accuracy (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). When next applied to the tetrode LFP dataset, the classifier-identified DS<sub>1</sub> and DS<sub>2</sub> events also exhibited distinct granule cell layer LFP waveforms (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C,D</xref>), which were consistent with those obtained in silicon-probe recordings (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>). In both (tetrode and silicon-probe) datasets, DS<sub>2</sub> represented two-thirds of all DS events (median (IQR): 66 (61 – 73) %), thus constituting the dominant type. Leveraging this cross-dataset approach, we found that the firing response of DG and CA principal cells was consistently stronger for DS<sub>2</sub> than DS<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A,B</xref>). The average activity of principal cells in DS<sub>1</sub> (and DS<sub>2</sub>) was nevertheless significantly higher than their baseline firing (calculated outside of any DS or SWR events during sleep/rest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C-F</xref>). A greater proportion of CA principal cells showed suppressed firing activity during DS<sub>1</sub> compared to DS<sub>2</sub> (35% versus 11%; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3G,H</xref>), providing insights into the previously documented DS-suppressed firing in some CA principal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bragin <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Penttonen <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Nokia and Penttonen, 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, the proportion of active principal cells increased in DS<sub>1</sub>, DS<sub>2</sub>, and SWR events compared to baseline periods (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), with equivalent proportions of neuronal recruitment in DS<sub>2</sub> and SWRs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). These results show that the spiking activity of individual principal cells distributed across hippocampal regions is transiently modulated during DS events in offline sleep/rest behavior.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>DS events nest higher dimensional patterns of population coactivity</title><p id="P7">We next investigated how the hippocampus organizes the collective activity of its principal cells both within individual DS events and across events, comparing these population-level patterns to those expressed in SWRs. To proceed, we first considered the neuron-wise vectors formed by the instantaneous spike discharge of principal cells in DSs, SWRs, or duration-matched control windows (without any DSs or SWRs) of the same sleep/rest (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A</xref>; “population vector analysis”). A logistic regression classifier trained on these population firing vectors significantly distinguished DS from SWR events but could not distinguish between their corresponding pre-event control epochs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Successful classification was also obtained when using only DS<sub>2</sub> events, which matched SWRs in the proportion of cells activated per event (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>). When evaluating the pairwise similarity of DS-nested population vectors versus those of SWR-nested vectors (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), we further observed that DSs contained a higher diversity of firing vectors compared to those in SWRs, which were more similar to one another (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4C,D</xref>).</p><p id="P8">This difference in cross-population vector similarity suggested that DSs and SWRs differ with respect to their neuronal motifs of transient coactivation. By examining the topological organization of peer-to-peer firing associations, we indeed observed that DS events contain more motifs of coactive principal cells than SWRs. For each cell pair (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>), we trained a generalized linear model to predict the spike discharge of neuron <italic>j</italic> from that of neuron <italic>i</italic> while accounting for the activity of the remaining peers (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; “peer-to-peer coactivity analysis”). We performed this procedure separately for DS and SWR events, which returned for each type of network event a matrix of <italic>β</italic> regression weights that represented the coactivity structure of the population (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). With these matrices, for both DS and SWR events we constructed neuronal coactivity graphs (with no self-connections) where each node is a cell and the edge linking any two nodes represents the firing association of that cell pair (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F,G</xref>). This revealed that DS-based graphs contained more triads of coactive nodes compared to SWR graphs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). This remained the case when comparing DS<sub>2</sub> and SWR events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4E</xref>).</p><p id="P9">These findings showed that while both DS and SWR events synchronize hippocampal principal cells, population coactivity responses to DSs are more diverse. The higher diversity of DS firing vectors could allow the hippocampus network to transiently expand to higher-dimensional activity subspaces where more population patterns can coexist with minimized interference. Consistent with this idea, applying principal component analysis showed higher dimensionality of population vectors in DS events compared to SWRs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4F-G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Waking theta coactivity patterns reactivate in offline DSs and support flexible memory</title><p id="P10">The DS-nested motifs of peer-to-peer firing associations could instantiate population patterns of neuronal coactivity undergoing offline reactivation to support memory-guided behavior.</p><p id="P11">Notably, the link between hippocampal SWRs and memory reactivation was initially established through the observation that the neural patterns of joint spiking activity expressed during exploratory behavior are more strongly correlated with those nested in post-exploration sleep/rest SWRs than those in SWRs before waking experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">O’Neill <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, we next determined whether DSs constitute another hippocampal timeframe for offline reactivation of waking coactivity patterns. To proceed, we used our peer-to-peer coactivity analysis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), applying it to DS versus SWR events of sleep/rest before and after exploration of open field arenas (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Likewise, we obtained the waking patterns of population coactivity in theta cycles during exploration (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). With these, we computed DS and SWR reactivation by measuring the tendency of the peer-to-peer theta firing associations to reoccur in post-exploration sleep/rest DS (or SWR) events, while controlling for prior pre-exploration DS (or SWR) coactivity. In line with previous work, offline patterns of SWR coactivity reflected those of theta coactivity significantly more during post-exploration than pre-exploration sleep/rest (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>; <italic>left panel</italic>). This SWR reactivation was significantly higher than that obtained with a null distribution generated from models using randomly shuffled cell pair identities (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>; <italic>right panel</italic>). Importantly, we observed that theta coactivity patterns were also strongly reactivated in post-exploration DSs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). By applying the same analytical framework to the neuronal ensembles tracked in both SWRs and DSs, this result provided evidence for offline DS reactivation of hippocampal waking firing patterns.</p><p id="P12">The reactivation of waking population patterns in DSs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), which contain more diverse and higher-dimensional patterns of neuronal coactivation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D,H,I</xref>), raised the question of their network contribution to memory-guided behavior. We thus tested whether the offline population response during DSs was necessary for a task that requires integrating multiple items in memory, to flexibly distinguish between previously-encountered versus novel objects. To this end, we transduced dentate granule cells with the yellow (561-nm) light-driven optogenetic silencer Archaerhodopsin T (ArchT) in Grm2-Cre mice (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,B</xref>). We subsequently implanted these Grm2<sup>DG</sup>::ArchT mice for triple-(DG-CA3-CA1) ensemble recordings combined with bilateral optic fibers for DG light delivery. In these experiments, DG light delivery was performed in a closed-loop manner during sleep using real time monitoring of DS onset (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; “DS-sync” condition). We used a within-subject control paradigm where, on different days, light was instead delivered after each DS had elapsed (“DS-delay” condition). Light delivery synchronized to DS onset significantly suppressed principal cell activity compared to the delay condition (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A,B</xref>). We applied this approach during interposed sleep sessions in a hippocampal-dependent multi-object recognition memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">McHugh <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). In this task, mice repeatedly explored a square-walled arena containing four objects (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). In the first session (‘Sampling’), mice encountered four distinct novel objects, each one placed beside a wall. On the subsequent sessions ('Test'), one of the initially sampled objects was replaced by a different novel object so that the mouse could explore one completely novel object along with the three ‘familiar’ objects from the previous session that day. These exploration (sampling and test) sessions alternated with sleep/rest sessions where mice received DG-targeted light delivery, either synchronized or delayed with respect to DS onset. In each test session <italic>n</italic>, we measured novelty preference using the proportion of time mice spent investigating the novel versus the familiar objects, thereby probing recognition memory for objects explored in session <italic>n</italic> − 1. We found that novelty detection was not impaired in test sessions following sleep with DS-delayed suppression, with mice expressing a stronger preference for novel over familiar objects (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). This novel object preference was similar to that observed in control mice without any optogenetic intervention (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref>). However, novel object preference was absent in test sessions following DS-synchronized suppression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5D</xref>). The total object exploration time did not differ between the DS-synchronized and DS-delayed conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5E</xref>). We also observed that successful recognition memory in the DS-delayed condition was accompanied by stronger peer-to-peer theta coactivity during exploration of familiar compared to novel objects (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). This difference in theta coactivity was not present following DS-synchronized hippocampal suppression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Moreover, in the DS-delayed condition, theta coactivity increased over test sessions whereas it decreased in the DS-synchronized condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5F</xref>). Thus, the hippocampal population response to offline DS events is required for flexible, memory-based recognition of previously encountered items and associated network increase in theta coactivity patterns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">Our findings establish that offline DSs activate neurons across the DG and CA regions. DSs therefore constitute a second hippocampal network event that hosts short timescale coactivation forming population-level neural patterns, like the well-established SWRs. However, the structure and content of spiking activity is distinct in DSs. Notably, we found that DSs nest more motifs of coactive neurons, yielding population patterns of higher diversity and dimensionality compared to those in SWRs. Like SWRs, DSs reactivate hippocampal population patterns expressed in prior waking experience. This offline reactivation is behaviorally significant: closed-loop suppression of DG granule cell spiking selectively during offline DS events is sufficient to disrupt downstream CA principal cell activity and impair subsequent flexible recognition memory for previously encountered items, as well as the associated network gain in theta-nested neuronal coactivity. Collectively, these findings identify a core contribution for DSs to hippocampal patterns of population coactivity and memory-guided behavior.</p><p id="P14">We started this investigation by observing that DSs increase spiking activity in principal cells across the DG, CA3, and CA1 regions of the hippocampus. This finding is consistent with previous reports of DS-evoked spiking activity in DG granule cells but contrasts with some earlier reports of DS-suppressed CA pyramidal cell spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bragin <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Penttonen <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Meier <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dvorak <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Notably, Bragin and colleagues reported suppressed spiking in 3/14 CA3 principal cells and suppressed CA1 multi-unit activity in 2/10 rats, showing some, rather than consistent, CA suppression. In addition, Penttonen et al. reported suppressed CA1 multi-unit activity and hyperpolarization of 4 intracellularly recorded CA1 neurons during DSs in anaesthetized rats. However, DS rates are ∼10-fold lower and have smaller amplitude during anesthesia compared to DSs observed during natural sleep/rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Penttonen <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). Other studies reported increased CA1 multi-unit activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Meier <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) and increased CA3 single-unit spiking during DS events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dvorak <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) in non-anaesthetized mice. Here, we report a variety of firing responses across individual CA neurons, ranging from strong activation to suppression during DS events (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). However, our systematic study (including &gt; 2,000 principal cells) shows that DSs do drive increased mean population spiking activity in both DG and CA principal cells.</p><p id="P15">Previous studies distinguished between two types of DS event (DS<sub>1</sub> and DS<sub>2</sub>), based on the laminar profile of their transmembrane currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bragin <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Meier <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dvorak <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Here, we found that DS<sub>2</sub> are more effective than DS<sub>1</sub> events at recruiting hippocampal principal cells, with higher spike rates per cell and more coactive cells per event. This result is consistent with a recent report that DS<sub>2</sub> but not DS<sub>1</sub> events reliably increase spiking in DG and CA3 principal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dvorak <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The same report saw only a slight increase in CA1 spiking during DS<sub>2</sub>, and no effect of DS<sub>1</sub> events on either CA1 or CA3 principal cells.</p><p id="P16">They also found that DG principal cell spiking was suppressed during DS<sub>1</sub>, in contrast to our study and previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bragin <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>).

The observed differences between studies might reflect differences between DS events in head-fixed awake mice versus those in sleep/rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bragin <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Headley, Kanta and Paré, 2017</xref>), akin to the differences previously reported for SWRs detected across distinct behavioral states, from exploration to quiet immobility to sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">O’Neill, Senior and Csicsvari, 2006</xref>). These observed differences could also indicate a moment-to-moment diversity across DS events, similar to that recently highlighted for individual SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Navas-Olive <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) and theta cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lopes-dos-Santos <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P17">In this study, we directly compared patterns of population spiking activity in DSs versus SWRs. Strikingly, we found that the structure of population activation differed across these two types of brief network event; allowing a classifier to distinguish DSs versus SWRs based on their population vectors of principal cell spiking. We also found that the tendency of groups of neurons to fire together was stronger during SWRs than DSs, in line with the observation of more (uncorrelated) activity patterns and therefore higher dimensionality in DSs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Importantly, we found that waking patterns of neuronal coactivity nested in theta oscillations reactivate in DSs of post-exploration sleep/rest (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). These findings thus provide important evidence for offline reactivation of hippocampal waking firing patterns outside of SWRs.</p><p id="P19">To determine whether spiking activity observed during DS events was required for subsequent memory-guided behavior, we deployed a closed-loop optogenetic feedback approach to suppress DG granule cell activity selectively during DS events. This DS-synchronized suppression of DG principal cells reduced spiking activity in CA principal cells. When applied in sleep/rest following object exploration, this DS-synchronized neural suppression impaired subsequent novel object recognition memory performance. Although ours is the first study to leverage a closed-loop optogenetic approach, this finding is consistent with previous behavioral studies using electrical stimulation to disrupt hippocampal activity during DSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Nokia <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lensu <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Nokia and Penttonen, 2022</xref>). Moreover, we found that increased theta coactivity was associated with familiarity, both within and across test sessions; and that this gain in theta coactivity was absent following DS-synchronized neural suppression. This finding is consistent with recent work showing that continual integration of new memory items across behavioral experiences increases neuronal coactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gava <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Altogether, these results support the idea that neuronal activity during DS events plays an important role in subsequent memory-guided behavior, as SWRs do.</p><p id="P20">Why does the hippocampus use more than one offline network mechanism to support memory? DSs and SWRs are driven by distinct neural circuits. SWRs depend on excitatory inputs from CA3, generating high-frequency CA1 ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Buzsáki, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Nakashiba <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Sullivan <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Davoudi and Foster, 2019</xref>).

Our structural analysis of DS versus SWR population patterns raises the intriguing possibility that SWRs may be more suited for lower-dimensional network coactivity serving robust information flow; whereas DSs may promote higher-dimensional activity, allowing diverse mnemonic patterns to coexist offline and support flexible, pattern separation during subsequent behavior. Collectively, these findings open important new avenues for future work to explore the interplay between DS versus SWR events as two distinct timeframes for the hippocampus to optimize offline computations serving memory-guided behavior.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Animals</title><p id="P21">These experiments used adult (4–6 months old) wild-type C57Bl6/J mice (Charles River Laboratories, Kent, UK) or hemizygous Nestin-Cre mice (Jackson Laboratories; B6.Cg-Tg(Nes-Cre)1Kln/J, stock no. 003771, RRID: IMSR_JAX:003771) for the initial investigation of principal cell spiking in DSs and SWRs using tetrodes or silicon-probe recordings (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>–<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

To remove potential biases caused by unequal numbers of events, we used the event-type with the fewest epochs to determine the final matrix size – for example, if there were 200 DS events in a given recording session, we randomly subsampled the SWR and baseline matrices to extract 200 SWR and 200 baseline population vectors (with identical principal cells) for comparison. Next we binarized these matrices (spike count &gt; 0 = 1, else 0). Then we assessed the self-similarity for each event matrix (cells × event number) by computing the Pearson correlation coefficient for every pair of population vectors from the same event-type, and then calculating the mean across all of these correlation coefficients.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Population dimensionality</title><p id="P45">We estimated the dimensionality of the principal cell population firing structure during SWRs and DSs from activity matrices that were matched for neuron identity and the number of DS and SWR events. We applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to each activity matrix, using the number of simultaneously recorded principal cells as the maximum number of components. Each matrix required at least 20 principal cells for inclusion in the analysis. We then extracted the number of components explaining 90% of the variance in these population vectors and scaled this by the total number of neurons in each matrix.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Theta-cycle detection</title><p id="P46">Theta cycles were detected as described in Lopes dos Santos <italic>et al</italic>.

We delineated individual theta cycles from their troughs and peaks, i.e. the local maxima and minima of the theta IMF. Theta cycles were defined as peak-trough-peak sequences with trough-peak and peak-trough intervals between 31-100 ms and peak-to-peak distances between 71-200 ms.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Reactivation of waking coactivity patterns</title><p id="P47">We leveraged our pairwise peer-to-peer coactivity measure (as described above and in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) to estimate DS and SWR reactivation. We compared the tendency of principal cell pairs to co-fire in theta cycles during exploration (theta coactivity) with the tendency to co-fire in DS or SWR during the following sleep/rest period (post-DS or post-SWR co-firing), controlling for their baseline co-firing in the sleep/rest period before (pre-DS or pre-SWR co-firing). From the resulting GLM, we extracted the β coefficients of the linear regression that predicted post-SWR or post-DS coactivity from theta coactivity, controlling for pre-SWR or pre-DS coactivity, respectively. We tested the significance of these β coefficients in two ways. First, we performed control GLMs using the pre-DS (or pre-SWR) coactivity as the dependent variable and the theta coactivity and post-DS (or post-SWR) coactivity as the independent variables. Second, we constructed a random probability distribution of β weights for theta coactivity by shuffling the cell pair identity, thereby generating a null distribution (based on 1000 GLMs, each time randomly shuffling cell-pair identity).</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Closed-loop optogenetic intervention</title><p id="P48">Real time detection of DSs was achieved by first high pass filtering the DG LFP signals (5 Hz) using the on-board signal processing capabilities of the Intan RHD evaluation board (RHD2000, Intan Technologies, USA) and triggering a laser pulse if the LFP signal exceeded a voltage-threshold. Thresholds for DS-onset detection were set for each mouse during a sleep session at the start of each recording day so that DS events were consistently detected (∼3 S.D. above mean signal amplitude). Threshold detection triggered a digital transistor-transistor logic (TTL) output pulse from the RHD interface to a Master 8 stimulation timing device (A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel), which in turn sent a 100 ms duration square-wave pulse to activate the laser. In the ‘DS-synchronized’ condition, the laser was triggered with zero latency from DS-onset, whereas in the ‘DS-delay’ condition the laser was triggered 100 ms after DS detection (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The laser delivered yellow-green light (561-nm) into the dentate gyrus, which in Grm2<sup>DG</sup>::ArchT mice activated the outward proton pump, Archaerhodopsin T to suppress DG granule cells. To investigate changes in firing rates in individual hippocampal principal cells during light-delivery, we constructed PETHs over 400 ms windows, 200 ms either side of DS-onset, using a 1 ms bin width, and then z-scored these binned spike trains. To quantify light firing responses, we extracted the maximum z-score after DS-onset (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) and the summed z-score (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>) between DS-onset and 100 ms after DS-onset for each hippocampal principal cell.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Novel object recognition memory task</title><p id="P49">On each task day, mice explored a square-walled open field (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>; the ‘object arena’) containing four objects, each positioned midway along a given wall, ∼1-cm from the wall edge. During the first session in the object arena, mice explored four completely novel objects (‘sampling’ session, 10 min). After the sampling session, mice were placed into a sleep box where they received DG-targeting light delivery that was either synchronized to DS-onset (DS-synchronized condition) or delayed by 100 ms from DS-onset (DS-delay condition), as described above (sleep/rest session, 20 min). Before the start of the next test session, one of the four objects was replaced with a different (and completely novel) object, and mice then explored the four objects again (‘test 1’ session, 10 min). This process was repeated, with another sleep session (∼20 min, with either DS-sync or DS-delay light-delivery), followed by another object exploration session with one completely novel object and three previously encountered objects (‘test 2’ session, 10 min). During each test session, we measured the time spent exploring each object and we calculated the percentage time spent investigating the novel object versus the (mean) percentage time spent investigating the familiar objects (i.e., those objects seen in the previous session). On any given day, mice received the same light-delivery condition (i.e. both sleep sessions were either DS-sync or DS-delay). There was no difference in the number of DS-onset events detected and therefore the number of light pulses delivered across the two conditions (mean ± SEM: DS-synchronized = 351 ± 81; delay = 377 ± 83; paired permutation test: p = 0.7) and there was no difference in the number of SWR events detected across the two conditions (mean ± SEM: DS-synchronized = 570 ± 98; delay = 393 ± 128; paired permutation test: p = 0.4).</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry</title><p id="P50">At the completion of experiments, mice were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital and perfused transcardially with 0.1 M PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS.
