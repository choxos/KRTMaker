In response, plants deploy distinct yet interconnected mechanisms to cope with these facets of salinity stress. In this investigation, we observed a substantial overlap in the salt (NaCl)-induced transcriptional responses of Arabidopsis roots with those triggered by osmotic stress or the plant stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA), as anticipated. Notably, a specific cluster of genes responded uniquely to sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) ions. Surprisingly, expression of sodium-induced genes exhibited a negative correlation with the ABA response and preceded the activation of genes induced by the osmotic stress component of salt. Elevated exogenous ABA levels resulted in the complete abolition of sodium-induced responses. Consistently, ABA signalling mutants displayed prolonged sodium-induced gene expression, coupled with increased root cell damage under high salinity conditions. Moreover, ABA signalling mutants were unable to redirect root growth to avoid high sodium concentrations and failed to contain their root cell swelling in the presence of elevated salt levels.</p><p id="P5">In summary, our findings unveil an unexpected and pivotal role for ABA signaling in mitigating cellular damage induced by salinity stress and modulating sodium-specific responses in plant roots.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P6">Plants are bound to their location and must adequately respond to their environment to survive. This requires the translation of environmental cues to cellular signaling, which is achieved by various sensing mechanisms. Soil salinization is one of the major threats to agriculture affecting &gt;1 billion hectares worldwide, including 20% of all irrigated farmlands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">High soil salinity lowers the water potential, which limits plant water content and causes osmotic stress, which is putatively sensed by mechanosensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In addition, toxic ions (sodium and chloride) cause ionic stress due to their accumulation in plants, inhibiting several cellular processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Some plants, including mangrove trees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and quinoa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, have evolved mechanisms to deal with extremely high salt concentrations, and are called halophyte species. On the other hand, the majority of plants, including most important crops, are highly salt sensitive (termed glycophyte species)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Interestingly, glycophytes can redirect root growth to specifically avoid high sodium concentrations in soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, a process named halotropism, which is not induced by an equimolar level of osmotic stress or by other monovalent cations, such as K<sup>+</sup> or Li<sup>+ 7â€“9</sup>. This indicates the existence of a yet unexplored sodium-induced sensing mechanism in plants that allows plants to mount responses to this toxic ion that is increasingly present in natural and agricultural soils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">On the other hand, many responses to salt overlap with those induced by osmotic stresses, including drought. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is produced in response to many water-limiting abiotic stresses (such as drought, osmotic stress, salinity, cold and frost) and has an important role in the regulation of germination, stomatal closure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and root development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. ABA is sensed by binding to the <italic>PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE1 (PYR)/PYR1-LIKE</italic> family of receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, which releases the inhibition by PROTEIN PHOSPHATASES TYPE 2C (PP2C) proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> of the SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING 1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE2 family (SnRK2; 2.2, 2.3 and 2.6 in Arabidopsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). SnRK2s activate downstream transcription factors (TFs) such as ABA INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3), ABI4, ABI5 and ABA-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING FACTOR/ABSCISIC ACID RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING FACTOR 1 TFs (AREB/ABF; 4 homologs in Arabidopsis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In response to salt, ABA accumulation and ABA-induced gene expression peak at 3-6 hours after salt application in Arabidopsis roots and decrease again after 24 hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, which is similar to the response of plants to water deficit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Until recently it was widely accepted that the osmotic responses induced by salt precede those induced specifically by the ionic stress, which would occur only after sodium and chloride ions have accumulated to toxic levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The discovery of the sodium-specific halotropism response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and the rapid (&lt;20 seconds) induction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves migrating from root to shoot after root exposure to salt, but not osmotic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, have challenged this longstanding idea.</p><p id="P10">To understand how plant roots integrate the osmotic and ionic component in the early response to salt, we first sought to identify specific sodium-induced transcriptional responses in Arabidopsis. We performed an RNA sequencing experiment on roots of 8-day-old seedlings with two sodium treatments (NaCl and NaNO<sub>3</sub>), an ionic control (KCl) and an osmotic control (sorbitol) at 6 and 24 hours. We discovered that genes that are specifically induced by sodium ions, are induced earlier than those general to all osmotic stresses and are negatively regulated by ABA. Further investigation of the relation between ABA and sodium-induced responses revealed that endogenous ABA signaling not only plays a general role in abiotic stress responses but is also required to specifically attenuate rapid sodium-induced responses in roots. Timing of ABA accumulation acts to limit sodium-induced cell damage and finetunes salt-induced changes in root growth and morphology.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Salinity triggers sodium-induced gene expression that is inhibited by ABA</title><p id="P11">To identify sodium-induced transcriptional changes, 8-day old Arabidopsis seedlings were subjected to mock (control), 130mM ionic (NaCl, NaNO<sub>3</sub>, KCl), 260mM osmotic (sorbitol) or 25 Î¼M ABA treatments on solid Â½MS medium. Roots were harvested after 6 and 24 hours. The principal component analyses (PCA) of both timepoints show that the treatments caused more distinct expression patterns after 6 hours compared to 24 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A and B</xref>). Next, the ionic (NaCl, NaNO<sub>3</sub>, KCl) and osmotic (sorbitol) treatments were used to identify sodium-induced gene expression. Genes that were differentially expressed (False Discovery Rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05, Log fold change (LFC) &gt; |0.5|) in at least one of the treatments compared to the control were selected for further analysis. The overlap between treatments is visualized in Venn diagrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). Up- and downregulation were presented separately, and we defined sodium-induced gene regulation as agonistically regulated by both NaCl and NaNO<sub>3</sub>, and not significantly, or antagonistically by KCl and sorbitol treatments.</p><p id="P12">We identified 271 upregulated and 107 downregulated sodium-induced genes at 6 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) and 181 upregulated genes and 75 downregulated genes at 24 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). However, few genes exceeded LFC &gt; |1| in the NaCl treatment at 24 hours (19) compared to 6 hours (80) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>). Hence, we studied the 6-hour dataset in more detail.</p><p id="P13">The 8431 selected DEGs at 6 hours after treatment were clustered to identify common expression patterns in response to the different treatments. Clustering was performed using Euclidean distance mapping and Ward clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The ABA treatment was not included in the selection of DEGs or the clustering itself but was added as a separate annotation column. At 6 hours, the genes were divided into 9 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Four clusters (I-IV) are predominantly downregulated by all treatments, while four others (V-VIII) are upregulated. On the contrary, on the cluster level, genes in cluster IX show upregulation by sodium (NaCl, NaNO3), but not by sorbitol, KCl or ABA. 125 genes in this cluster were sodium-induced on the individual gene level as identified in the Venn diagrams of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>. A gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis showed that genes in the downregulated clusters (I-IV) are mostly related to translation, and those in the upregulated clusters (IV-VIII) enriched for terms related to abiotic stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Surprisingly, GO terms associated with (defense) response to bacterium and wounding, were strongly enriched in the sodium-induced cluster (IX) at 6 hours. Consistent with the PCA plots and the Venn diagrams, no sodium-induced cluster was identified at 24 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>), which indicates that a distinct sodium-induced response is transient. The mean NaCl response of genes in cluster I â€“ VIII positively correlates with the response to ABA (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.996, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), as expected. Interestingly, this correlation is not observed in the mean transcriptional response of cluster IX genes (Residual Standard Deviation &gt; 2.5Ïƒ). The genes in this cluster are generally repressed by the ABA treatment. Based on the similarities of clustering results with ABA-induced expression patterns, we hypothesize that an increase in ABA, caused by the osmotic component of NaCl stress, is responsible for the transcriptional changes of genes in cluster I-VIII, but could potentially at the same time compromise the sodium-induced response to salinity (cluster IX).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Sodium-induced gene expression peaks at early timepoints</title><p id="P14">We hypothesized that the activation of sodium-induced gene expression and the induction of ABA signaling by high salinity could be temporarily separated. Our transcriptome dataset Cluster IX transcripts generally showed very low abundance in the NaCl treatment compared to other genes and were mostly undetectable in control conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>). We first selected the most upregulated sodium-induced gene (<italic>REDOX RESPONSIVE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1; RRTF1/ERF109</italic>) as a robust sodium-induced marker gene and quantified the expression <italic>RRTF1</italic>, and an ABA marker gene <italic>(RESPONSIVE TO ABA 18; RAB18)</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> over time after NaCl stress induction by RT-qPCR. Expression of <italic>RRTF1</italic> was induced within an hour after salt application, was quickly reduced at 3 hours, followed by a stable level of expression and a further decrease at 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). <italic>RAB18</italic> expression increased gradually upon NaCl treatment and reached its maximum expression level at 3 hours post-salt application and stayed elevated for several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). To investigate how these expression patterns relate to the synthesis of ABA in roots, we quantified ABA levels at 1, 3, 6 and 12 hours after NaCl, KCl and sorbitol treatment. ABA levels significantly increased after 1 hour, peaked at 3 hours for all three stress treatments and slowly declined afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the early sodium-induced gene expression is most apparent 1 hour after stress, and is later reduced, while ABA levels are still increasing.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>ABA pretreatment inhibits sodium-induced responses</title><p id="P15">We have seen that (1) sodium-induced genes are repressed by ABA in the absence of NaCl and (2) NaCl-induced ABA signaling peaks at later timepoints. Hence, we questioned if ABA can also suppress sodium-induced gene expression in the presence of NaCl. To test this, we applied a combined treatment of ABA and NaCl. For these experiments, we selected a lower concentration of 5 Î¼M ABA, which approximates gene expression changes of ABA marker genes as did 125 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). To maximize ABA-induced gene expression at the start of the NaCl application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), seedlings were transferred to mock or 5Î¼M ABA treatment plates 12 hours prior to the NaCl or control treatment with the corresponding ABA concentration. Gene expression was quantified for <italic>RRTF1</italic> and the ABA signaling marker gene <italic>RAB18. RRTF1</italic> was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) upregulated after 1 hour of NaCl, while a pretreatment with 5 Î¼M ABA significantly reduced NaCl-induced expression of <italic>RRTF1</italic> to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). As expected, the ABA signaling marker gene <italic>RAB18</italic> was not induced after 1 hour of salt stress, but upregulated by ABA and even more upregulated by the combination of ABA and NaCl. Taken together, these results suggest that the strong induction of the sodium-induced marker gene <italic>RRTF1</italic> at 1 hour after salt treatment is facilitated by the low ABA levels at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To investigate whether ABA also represses sodium-induced phenotypic responses of roots, we next studied halotropism, which is the redirection of root growth to specifically avoid high sodium concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Four-day old seedlings were transferred to fresh plates with or without 5 Î¼M ABA and 12 hours later a salt gradient was introduced by removing the lower part of the agar and replacing it with control medium or medium supplemented with 200mM NaCl (plus 5 Î¼M ABA for ABA pretreated samples). After 24 and 48 hours, the NaCl gradient caused a change in root growth direction of almost 30Â°, consistent with published data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>). Intriguingly, ABA pretreated roots were initially avoiding high sodium concentrations, but showed positive halotropism, bending towards the higher NaCl concentration after 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Because the sodium-induced gene cluster IX is enriched for genes involved in wounding-related processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), we investigated whether salinity stress causes wounding to roots. Cell damage of root cells was assessed using Evans Blue staining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> at 48 hours after a halotropism assay in the presence or absence of an ABA pretreatment. No damage was detected in the control group, but the NaCl-treated roots were severely damaged in the elongation zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) and ABA reduced the NaCl-induced damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C/D</xref>).</p><p id="P17">As the ABA pretreatment abolishes sodium-induced responses, we hypothesized that ABA lowers Na<sup>+</sup> levels. Therefore, we quantified sodium content in 7-day-old roots at 6 hours after a homogeneous control or 125mM NaCl treatment, in the presence or absence of a 5 Î¼M ABA pretreatment. ABA pretreatment strongly reduced the sodium content in the root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>), which might cause the inhibition of sodium-induced root growth responses.</p><p id="P18">To visualize NaCl-induced cell damage at a cellular resolution, we imaged NaCl-treated roots with Evans Blue using confocal microscopy. We confirmed staining of cells in the early elongation zone in response to salt treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F/G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). As an ABA pretreatment abolishes both NaCl-induced cell damage and sodium-induced gene expression, we investigated if both processes are spatially overlapping. Therefore, we visualized the localization of <italic>pRRTF1:RRTF1-Venus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> at 2 hours after salt stress and compared it to the confocal images of the Evans Blue staining. In accordance, RRTF1-Venus accumulated in the epidermal cells of the early elongation zone (600-850 Î¼m from the root tip) in response to salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig, 3H/I</xref>). Thus, only few cells express the sodium-induced <italic>RRTF1</italic> marker, which aligns well with the low transcript counts in the RNA sequencing dataset as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). In conclusion, ABA consistently abolishes sodium-induced responses, including gene expression, halotropism and cell damage of the elongation zone of roots exposed to high salinity.</p><p id="P19">As salt stress induces cell damage, we investigated the role of Jasmonic Acid (JA), a plant hormone involved in plant wounding responses, in sodium-induced responses. JA is also known to quickly induce <italic>RRTF1</italic> expression during mechanical damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Even though control levels of <italic>RRTF1</italic> were significantly lower in mutants with reduced biologically active JA (<italic>aos</italic> and <italic>jar1-1</italic>), expression was still induced by NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). These mutants also showed wildtype root halotropic reponses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A/B</xref>/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7</xref>)., indicating that early sodium-induced responses are JA-independent. As reactive oxygen species (ROS) are quickly induced by wounding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and <italic>RRTF1</italic> expression is induced by ROS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that ROS could be the signal responsible for the induction of sodium-induced gene expression. NADPH RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE PROTEINs (RBOHs) are a major source for ROS production during NaCl stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We investigated <italic>RRTF1</italic> and <italic>RAB18</italic> expression, halotropism and cell damage in <italic>rbohc, rhohd</italic> and <italic>rbohf</italic> mutants. Interestingly, <italic>rbohc</italic> and <italic>rbohf</italic> mutant roots exhibited reduced <italic>RAB18</italic> expression compared to wildtype during control and NaCl treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), while <italic>RRTF1</italic> expression was higher in these mutants during salt stress. This aligns well with our observation that ABA responses negatively correlate with sodium-induced responses. The <italic>rbohc</italic> and <italic>rbohf</italic> mutants also showed increased areas of damaged cells during NaCl stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D/E</xref>) and the halotropic response was reduced in these mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). Taken together, our data show that sodium-induced responses are repressed by ROS and ABA and are independent of JA accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Sodium-induced gene expression is enhanced in the <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> mutant and is independent of MOCA1 function</title><p id="P20">To investigate whether sodium-induced gene expression is affected by endogenous ABA signaling, <italic>RRTF1</italic> expression was studied in roots of 7-day-old seedlings in the ABA-insensitive <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> double mutant at 1, 3, 6 and 12 hours after NaCl stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9</xref>) and was found to be significantly higher in NaCl-treated <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> mutants compared to Col-0 from 3 hours onwards.

First, we studied halotropism in various mutants with defects in ABA signaling: the <italic>pyr1/pyl1/2/4</italic> ABA receptor mutant (referred to as <italic>abaQ</italic>), the <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> protein kinase mutant and mutants for downstream positive regulators of ABA signaling: <italic>abi3-8, abi4-3, abi5-7</italic> and <italic>areb1/areb2/abf3/abf1-1</italic> (referred to as <italic>arebQ</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Halotropism was significantly reduced in both <italic>abaQ</italic> and <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> mutants, showing that core ABA signaling is essential for root directional avoidance of sodium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S12A</xref>). All investigated mutants for downstream ABA signaling components on the other hand, showed a wildtype halotropic response. This could indicate genetic redundancy in downstream ABA signaling or the involvement of other downstream targets that were not tested here.</p><p id="P25">To study the temporal characteristics of halotropism in the <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> mutant, 5-day-old plants were placed in a timelapse imaging setup for 48 hours after the introduction of the NaCl gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Both Col-0 and snrk2.2/2.3 seedlings quickly changed the growth direction of their main root to avoid high sodium concentrations and were significantly different (FDR &lt; 0.05) from control conditions after 2:40 hours and 3:00 hours, respectively. However, the halotropism response stagnated in the <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> mutant after approximately 5 hours. Even though roots of the <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> mutant grew slower than wildtype roots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12B</xref>), plotting root growth vs angle shows that this could not explain the difference in root angle response between the genotypes. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12C</xref>). Taken together, these results show that the initial sodium-avoidance response is independent of ABA and ABA is required to enhance the avoidance response at later timepoints. This is consistent with the timing of ABA accumulation and signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) and the lack of halotropic response after ABA pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Previous work reported NaCl-induced cell swelling in the early elongation zone, which is not observed by a comparable osmotic treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (and confirmed here in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13</xref>). Interestingly, we observed sodium induced cell damage and <italic>RRTF1</italic> gene expression in this zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) and halotropism is driven by asymmetrical cell elongation in this zone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Hence, we asked if endogenous ABA signaling also affects cell morphology during salt stress, which we investigated by measuring root width at 24 hours after salt stress induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14A-C</xref>). The initial root swelling (1400-2300 Î¼m zone) was comparable between Col-0 and <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S14D</xref>). However, salt-treated <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> roots showed significantly more cell swelling compared to control grown seedlings in the region closer to the root tip (900-1500 Î¼m zone) and salt-treated <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> roots were significantly wider than salt-treated Col-0 roots (at 500-900 Î¼m from the tip; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C/D</xref>), while salt-treated Col-0 roots were not significantly different in width compared to control treated roots. Taken together, this shows that endogenous ABA signaling is important for roots to recover from sodium-induced stress on the transcriptional and cellular level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">In this study, we report that in response to high salt, roots exhibit quick sodium-induced transcriptional responses (1-hour post-stress induction), which are repressed by ABA, which naturally accumulates in response to salinity at later timepoints. Modifying this natural course of action by means of an ABA pretreatment abolishes sodium-induced responses altogether. Moreover, genetic inhibition of ABA signaling during salt treatment leads to (1) increased and prolonged sodium-induced gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), (2) increased root cell swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C/D</xref>) and (3) reduced negative root halotropism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). Our data thus reveal an essential role for ABA in mitigating the effects of sodium stress.</p><p id="P28">Sodium-induced gene expression is quickly induced by salt stress but is restored to control levels even in the continuing presence of salt stress at later timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). We found that these responses are enhanced and prolonged in the ABA-insensitive mutants and on the other hand abolished altogether when applying an ABA pretreatment, which confirms that the restoration to normal root functioning after root response to high salinity depends on ABA signaling. The halotropism response is more complex as it is reduced by either ABA pretreatment or genetic ABA insensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>/<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This may seem contradictive, but as redirection of root growth depends on an asymmetry in cell elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, we hypothesize that disturbing this asymmetry either by genetically blocking or treating with ABA homogeneously, hampers the halotropic response. Interestingly, the <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> halotropism timeseries data suggest that <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> mutants can initially redirect root growth to avoid high salt concentrations like wildtype, but the response stagnates after 5:00 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). This aligns well with the halotropism phenotype after the ABA pretreatment, in which roots initially bend, but no net root avoidance is measured after 24 hours. Thus, while not essential for the initial redirection root growth, ABA could be required to inhibit gravitropism and thus maintenance of the sodium avoiding halotropic response at later timepoints. Notably, <italic>rbohc</italic> and <italic>rbohf</italic>, but not <italic>rbohd</italic> mutants, also show reduced ABA marker gene (<italic>RAB18</italic>) expression under control and salt treatment, and enhanced sodium-induced gene expression and reduced halotropism. These mutants thus phenocopy <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> with respect to sodium-induced responses of the root. This aligns well with existing literature which shows that responses to ABA (root growth and stomatal closure) are reduced in <italic>rbohf</italic>, but not in <italic>rbohd</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> mutants. Therefore, RBOHF-mediated ROS production is recognized as a secondary messenger to ABA signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">The quick induction and consequent repression of sodium-induced gene expression is highly correlated with previously reported root growth phases during early salt stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. After exposure to NaCl, roots go through a stop (0-5 hours), quiescent (5-9 hours), recovery (9 â€“ 12 hours) and homeostasis (&gt;12 hours) growth phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Our timeseries show that <italic>RRTF1</italic> expression is high at the early timepoints after stress induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), which corresponds with the stop and quiescent phase. Later, the osmotic stress-induced ABA biosynthesis and signaling repress sodium-induced gene expression, which aligns with the timing of growth recovery. These correlations suggest that increased expression of sodium-induced genes causes growth reduction. Supporting this hypothesis, overexpression of some highly expressed sodium-induced genes (<italic>RRTF1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, <italic>DWARF AND DELAYED FLOWERING 1</italic> (<italic>DDF1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> or <italic>CALMODULIN BINDING PROTEIN 60G</italic> (<italic>CBP60g</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>) leads to severe dwarfism. In this model, ABA signaling (and thus, the repression of sodium-induced genes) is required to restore root growth. Indeed, chemical inhibition of ABA biosynthesis during salt stress inhibits growth recovery after the quiescent phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Taken together, this indicates that sodium-induced gene expression correlates with early root growth dynamics after salt stress exposure.</p><p id="P30">To get a better understanding of sodium-induced regulatory mechanisms, we aimed to disentangle the sodium-induced, general monovalent cation, and osmotic responses to salt stress. We expected to identify monovalent-cation specific transcriptional responses, as salt stress specifically causes a rapid (&lt;20 seconds) increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> which migrates in waves throughout the plant. These waves cause transcriptional changes in the shoot, which is not directly in contact with the saline soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Recently, it was described that these Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves are not sodium-induced, but are induced by other monovalent cations (Li<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>) as well, and are sensed by negatively charged sphingolipids (biosynthesized by MOCA1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>), which in turn activate yet unknown Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. In our transcriptome analysis we were able to distinguish sodium-induced gene expression from a general osmotic stress response induced by both KCl and osmotic stress, as well as ABA treatment. However, no evident generic monovalent cation stress pattern was identified, which aligns well with the almost wildtype-like salt stress transcriptome of the monovalent cation sensor mutant <italic>moca1</italic>. In accordance, we found MOCA1 not to be required for the sodium-induced halotropism response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>). This suggests that monovalent cation-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves do not affect early sodium-induced responses in the roots in our conditions, leaving open the question of the molecular nature of sodium perception in plants.</p><p id="P31">We used <italic>RRTF1</italic>, a strong sodium-induced transcript as a marker gene to characterize the regulatory mechanisms of sodium-induced gene expression. Previously, we showed that <italic>RRTF1</italic> expression is downstream of MAP KINASE6 (MPK6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, but up- and downstream phosphorylation cascades remain unknown. We investigated a possible role for JA because elevated sodium levels cause cell damage and <italic>RRTF1</italic> expression is strongly induced by damage in a JA-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. However, while JA mutants have reduced <italic>RRTF1</italic> expression under control conditions, the expression was still induced by salt. Genetic explorations of other signaling pathways, including ROS production (<italic>rbohc/f</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C-E</xref>), ABA (<italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>/<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) and cell wall maintenance (<italic>fer-4</italic> and <italic>herk1 the1-4</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>) all showed enhanced expression of <italic>RRTF1</italic>. Because <italic>RRTF1</italic> expression is induced by multiple factors, we hypothesize that these factors regulate cellular functioning during salt stress, and misregulation therefore makes plants more susceptible to salt stress.</p><p id="P32">To investigate the cause of these enhanced stress responses, we focused on the biological processes associated with sodium-induced responses. Interestingly, the sodium-induced gene cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and genes with enhanced expression in <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) are associated with biotic stress/wounding responses. It was shown that these processes are also differentially regulated in the transcriptome of salt-stressed <italic>fer-4</italic>, which has increased salt-induced cell swelling (and even bursting)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Strikingly, despite being more subtle than <italic>fer-4</italic> mutants, <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> mutants also showed increased cell swelling in the apical root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). This aligns well with previous reports in which NaCl-induced cell swelling is strongly enhanced when ABA biosynthesis is chemically inhibited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, even though <italic>fer-4</italic> and <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> both have a cell swelling phenotype, ABA signaling is enhanced in <italic>fer-4</italic> mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, highlighting again the complexity of regulation of cell wall modifications during salt stress in roots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. On the other hand, ABA biosynthesis and signaling mutants also have a strongly reduced cellulose content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and inhibition of cellulose biosynthesis causes hypersensitivity during salt stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Furthermore, ABA-mediated alterations in microtubule organization during salt stress are important to strengthen the cell wall and limit cell damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Taken together, we hypothesize that weakened cell walls in <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> roots could contribute to the observed increased cell swelling induced by NaCl.</p><p id="P33">To conclude, we have shown that when plant roots are exposed to salinity, early sodium-induced gene expression is repressed by the slower osmotic stress-induced ABA accumulation and signaling. By enhancing (ABA treatment) or repressing (ABA-insensitive mutants) ABA signaling, we were able to show that the interaction between the stress components is required to mount an adequate response to salt while maintaining cell integrity. Our work gives novel insights in the tight temporal and spatial responses of a complex stress. We argue that salinity stress, like many abiotic stresses, triggers different response pathways, which are separated in time and space. The existence of a clearly specific response opens new doors to investigate sodium sensing mechanisms and targets for salt stress resilience.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Online materials and methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Plant materials, growth conditions and stress assays</title><p id="P34"><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants of ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) were used in all experiments.

In short: after 7 days the plants were transferred to fresh agar plates supplemented with 125 mM NaCl (Duchefa), 125 mM KCl (Merck), 250 mM Sorbitol (Duchefa) or Â½ MS control medium without supplements. After 1, 3, 6, 12 hours roots were dissected with a sharp blade, weighed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80Â°C. 60 roots (11.8Â±3.0 mg material) were pooled in one biological replicate. Frozen material was ground to a fine powder using 2 stainless steel beads at 50 Hz for 1 minute in a paint shaker (Fast &amp; Fluid). Ground samples were extracted with 1 mL of 10% methanol containing 100nM stable isotope-labeled internal standards for each investigated compound (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). Samples were extracted using an existing protocol with modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Namely, a StrataX 30mg/3mL spe-column (Phenomenex) was used. Solvents were removed by speed vacuum system (ThermoSavant).</p><p id="P50">For detection and quantification by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy, sample residues were dissolved in 100Î¼L acetonitrile/water (20:80 v/v) and filtered using a 0.2 Î¼m nylon centrifuge spin filter (BGB Analytik). ABA was quantified by comparing retention times and mass transitions with ABA standards using a Waters XevoTQS mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source coupled to an Acquity UPLC system (Waters) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. Chromatographic separations were conducted using acetonitrile/water (+0.1% formic acid) on a Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm x100mm, 1.7Î¼m, Waters) at 40Â°C with a flowrate of 0.25 mL/min. First the column was equilibrated for 30 minutes using the solvent (acetonitrile/water (20:80 v/v) + 0.1% formic acid). Samples were analyzed by injecting 5Î¼L, followed by the elution using program of 17 minutes in which the acetonitrile fraction linearly increased from 20% (v/v) to 70% (v/v). The column was washed after every sample by increasing the acetonitrile fraction to 100% in one minute and maintaining this concentration for 1 minute. The acetonitrile fraction was reduced to 20% in one minute and maintained at this concentration for one minute before injecting the next sample. The capillary voltage was set at 2.5kV, the source temperature at 150Â°C and the desolvation temperature at 500Â°C. Multiple reaction monitoring was used for quantification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. Parent-Daughter transitions and cone voltages were set using the IntelliStart MS Console. Peak quantification was processed with Targetlynx. Samples were normalized for the internal standard recovery and sample weight. All values were normalized to the 1-hour control timepoint.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P51">Single timepoint data was analyzed using Leveneâ€™s test to verify equal variances (p &gt; 0.05) and Shapiro-Wilk to verify normal distribution (p &gt; 0.05). Two-way ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Tukey test when samples were normally distributed and had an equal variance. Alternatively, samples were analyzed using the non-parametric Dunn test preceded by a Kruskal-Wallis test (p &lt; 0.05). Benjamini-Hochberg was used to correct for multiple testing. Halotropism timeseries and root witdth were analyzed using non-paired t-tests per timepoint or length unit (NaCl vs control per genotype), respectively, and corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Other multi-timepoint data was analyzed per timepoint, using Two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post-hoc test (after Leveneâ€™s test to verify equal variances (p &gt; 0.01) and Shapiro-Wilk to verify normal distribution (p &gt; 0.05)).

(E) A schematic summary of the results presented in this paper. During NaCl stress, sodium ions quickly trigger sodium-induced gene expression, wounding/cell swelling and negative root halotropism. The osmotic component of salt stress triggers the ABA accumulation and signaling and after &gt;3 hours ABA represses sodium-induced gene expression and cell swelling in a <italic>SnRK2.2/2.3</italic>-dependent manner. Therefore, these responses are enhanced in the <italic>snrk2.2/2.3</italic> mutant. Root halotropism is initially ABA-independent but requires ABA signaling to reach full potential.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS193140-f006"/></fig></floats-group></article>
