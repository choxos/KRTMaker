Ablation of CD44 ameliorates adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity. Here, we investigated cell type specific CD44 expression in human and mouse adipose tissue and further studied how CD44 in preadipocytes regulates adipocyte function. Using Crispr Cas9-mdediated gene deletion and lentivirus-mediated gene re-expression, we discovered that deletion of CD44 promotes adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis, whereas re-expression of CD44 abolishes this effect and decreases insulin responsiveness and adiponectin secretion in 3T3-L1 cells. Mechanistically, CD44 does so via suppressing <italic>Pparg</italic> expression. Using quantitative proteomics analysis, we further discovered that cell cycle-regulated pathways were mostly decreased by deletion of CD44. Indeed, re-expression of CD44 moderately restored expression of proteins involved in all phases of the cell cycle. Our data suggest that CD44 plays a crucial role in regulating adipogenesis and adipocyte function possibly through regulating PPAR□ and cell cycle-related pathways. This study provides evidence for the first time that CD44 expressed in preadipocytes plays key roles in regulating adipocyte function outside immune cells where CD44 is primarily expressed. Therefore, targeting CD44 in (pre)adipocytes may provide therapeutic potential to treat obesity-associated metabolic complications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CD44</kwd><kwd>adipogenesis</kwd><kwd>insulin signalling</kwd><kwd>PPAR□</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Obesity is a metabolic complication of excess fat accumulation in organs, including adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. The increasing obesity epidemic contributes to the prevalence of obesity-associated metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiometabolic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Klein et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Stefan, 2020</xref>). Over 670 million adults are obese worldwide, which causes huge socioeconomic burden to our society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Collaboration, 2017</xref>). Despite great efforts being made into elucidating the pathogenesis of obesity, mechanisms of the development of obesity are not fully understood. Thus, it’s important and urgent to identify novel therapeutic targets to advance the prevention and treatment of obesity and obesity-associated metabolic complications.</p><p id="P3">CD44 is a membrane protein and has different variants rising from alternative splicing in the <italic>Cd44</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Ponta et al., 2003</xref>). The standard form of CD44 (CD44s) without alternative splicing variants is the smallest CD44 isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Zöller, 2011</xref>). CD44s is ubiquitously expressed in a wide variety of tissues including the central nervous system, liver, lung, adipose tissue and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Weng et al., 2022</xref>). CD44 was intensively studied in cancer initiation and tumorigenesis, where increased expression of CD44 is often found as a biomarker of advanced tumour progression and poor prognosis in many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Zöller, 2011</xref>, Hassn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Mesrati et al., 2021</xref>). However, recent studies suggest a potential role of CD44 in chronic metabolic diseases, such as obesity and T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Weng et al., 2022</xref>). Increased CD44 expression and deposition of its ligands - hyaluronan (HA) and osteopontin (OPN), were found in the adipose tissue of obese mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Kodama et al., 2012</xref>). The plasma CD44 level was positively correlated with insulin resistance and poor glycaemic control in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Cd44</italic> gene was implicated in the pathogenesis of T2D by a gene expression-based genome-wide association study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Kodama et al., 2012</xref>). Ablation of CD44 by genetic deletion or anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody administration reduced adipose tissue immune cell infiltration and insulin resistance in diet-induced obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Kodama et al., 2015</xref>). These studies highlight that CD44 has critical roles in regulating adipose tissue function during obesity. Adipocytes are essential in maintaining adipose tissue function, and adipogenesis and insulin response are key characteristics of adipocyte function. However, how CD44 regulates adipogenesis and insulin signalling in adipocytes, therefore contributing to adipose tissue function is unclear.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we utilised CRISPR Cas9-mediated gene deletion and lentivirus-mediated gene re-expression in 3T3-L1 cells to determine the role of CD44 in adipogenesis and insulin response in adipocytes.

The expression pattern of CD44 in mouse and human WAT was next analysed using published single cell sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Emont et al., 2022</xref>). It was shown that CD44 was ubiquitously expressed with highest expression in mast cells and monocytes in human WAT, but in neutrophils and monocytes in mouse WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).

Furthermore, we compared the expression level of CD44 in epididymal WAT of mice fed with LFD (10% fat) or HFD (60% fat) using another single cell sequencing dataset (Sárvári et al., 2021).

These data suggest that CD44 was regulated in adipose tissue during obesity and expressed in preadipocytes, whose expression level was downregulated during adipocyte differentiation.

These data suggest that CD44 could decrease <italic>Pparg</italic> expression, therefore inhibiting adipogenesis.</p><p id="P20">To further confirm these results, we conditionally removed the agonists of various adipogenic stimuli in the differentiation medium of CD44KO2 EV and CD44KO2 RE cells. The cells were then differentiated for 7 days and adipogenesis was assessed. Consistently, CD44RE significantly decreased Oil Red O staining in the CD44KO2 cells when incubated with control differentiation cocktail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). Removal of IBMX, an activator of cAMP-associated pathway, significantly attenuated adipogenesis in both CD44KO2 EV and CD44KO2 RE cells, suggesting that activation of cAMP-associated signals was required for adipogenesis independent of CD44 expression. In contrast, removal of Dex, an activator of glucocorticoid receptor-associated pathway, had no effects on adipogenesis, indicating that CD44-mediated adipogenic regulation was unlikely through glucocorticoid receptor-associated pathways. Interestingly, the adipogenic cocktail without RAZ, a <italic>Pparg</italic> agonist attenuated adipogenesis in both CD44KO2 EV and CD44KO2 RE cells, when compared to the control cocktail, but to a much greater extend in the CD44KO2 RE cells when compared to CD44KO2 EV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). These results further demonstrate that CD44 could suppress <italic>Pparg</italic> expression, therefore inhibiting adipogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><label>3.4</label><title>CD44RE in CD44KO cells impaired adipocyte function by decreasing insulin signalling and adiponectin secretion</title><p id="P21">To examine whether CD44RE attenuates adipocyte function, CD44KO EV and CD44KO RE cells were treated with 100nM insulin for 30mins after 14 days of differentiation. The insulin response was decreased by CD44RE in both CD44KO cell lines, evidenced by decreased AKT phosphorylation (S473) when compared to CD44KO EV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-D</xref>). In addition, adiponectin, a metabolically favourable hormone secreted by adipocytes, was decreased in differentiated CD44KO2 RE cells relative to CD44KO2 EV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C and E</xref>), suggesting an impaired secretory/endocrine function of adipocytes.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><label>3.5</label><title>Proteomics analysis of CrisprWT EV, CD44KO2 EV and CD44KO2 RE cells</title><p id="P22">Next, we applied proteomics to explore the potential mechanisms of how CD44 regulates adipogenesis and adipocyte function. To minimise the off-target effects of Crispr Cas9 gene editing, single cell sorting and lentiviral transfection, the CrisprWT EV cells were used as the control. CD44KO2 EV and CD44KO2 RE cells were studied due to their interesting phenotype on <italic>Pparg</italic>. Cells were validated by both CD44 protein and mRNA expression before the tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2A and B</xref>). Data were processed using Perseus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2C</xref>). In total, 8541 proteins were identified from all three cell lines. A subset of 1087 DEPs were observed while comparing CD44KO2 EV to CrisprWT EV cells, with 548 proteins decreased and 539 proteins increased in the CD44KO2 EV cells. The proteomics results were visualized in volcano plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>), where the top 10 most-changed DEPs were marked. Surprisingly, between CD44KO2 RE and CD44KO2 EV cells only 30 DEPs were identified.</p><p id="P23">We further explored the molecular regulation of CD44 on gene expression of some of the top 10 most-changed DEPs, which have been implicated in regulating adipogenesis. <italic>Pref-1</italic> (also known as <italic>DlK1</italic>) is a preadipocyte growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Moon et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Nueda et al., 2007</xref>), and was quantified as one of the mostly increased DEPs by the deletion of CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Consistent with the protein expression changes, its mRNA expression was increased by 20 folds in CD44KO2 EV when compared to CrisprWT EV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, there was no difference in <italic>Pref-1</italic> mRNA or protein expression between CD44KO2 EV and CD44KO2 RE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). <italic>Scara5</italic> is a scavenger receptor class A member protein, and previous study suggested that knockdown of <italic>Scara5</italic> inhibited adipogenesis in C3H10T1/2 pluripotent stem cells and A33 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we found that deletion of CD44 significantly increased both the protein and mRNA expression of <italic>Scara5</italic>, while CD44RE attenuated its mRNA expression but not the protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). <italic>Npr3</italic>, natriuretic peptide receptor 3, has been shown to arrest cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Li et al., 2021</xref>). We found that Npr3 was decreased after CD44 deletion and was one of the mostly increased DEPs by CD44RE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B and E</xref>). However, mRNA level of <italic>Npr3</italic> was unchanged between CrisprWT EV, CD44KO2 EV and CD44KO2 RE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Fabp4</italic> is a fatty acid binding protein and identified as a marker of terminally differentiated adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). Fabp4 protein was decreased after CD44 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). However, its mRNA expression was significantly increased in CD44KO2 EV cells but was restored in CD44KO2 RE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p id="P24">The pathway enrichment was further analyzed using identified DEPs by metascape. Cell cycle-related pathways, such as mitotic cell cycle process, mitotic cell cycle phase transition, and cell cycle, were mostly enriched by CD44 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). This implied that CD44 might regulate adipogenesis through regulating cell cycle progression. However, the pathway enrichment analysis between CD44KO2 RE and CD44KO2 EV cells was not possible due to small numbers of DEPs identified. Next, we analysed the protein expression of cell cycle related genes in the proteomics dataset. Deletion of CD44 caused a dramatic downregulation in proteins involved in all phases of cell cycle except for Pold4 (DNA polymerase delta 4) and Optn (optineurin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). The downregulation in cell cycle-related proteins was consistent with the decrease in CD44 protein expression in CD44KO2 EV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). When CD44 was re-expressed in each cell line (CD44KO2 RE vs. CD44KO2 EV), this downregulation of most cell cycle-related proteins was rescued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Altogether, our data suggest that CD44 may regulate adipogenesis via altering cell cycle progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S19" sec-type="discussion"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">CD44, a well-known stem cell biomarker is recently implicated in chronic metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Weng et al., 2022</xref>). CD44 and its ligands HA and OPN were increased in the adipose tissue of obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Kang et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Kiefer et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Nomiyama et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Romo et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we found for the first time that CD44 expression in preadipocytes hinders adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis, therefore negatively impacting adipocyte function including insulin responsiveness and its secretory capacity. Mechanistically, CD44 does so possibly through suppressing adipogenic transcription factor <italic>Pparg</italic> expression and cell cycle-related pathways.</p><p id="P26">CD44 has previously shown to be primarily expressed in inflammatory cells such as macrophages in obese adipose tissue and CD44 expression positively correlated with inflammatory markers CD68 and IL6 gene expression in the subcutaneous WAT of obese human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Kodama et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). In consistent with these findings, we observed that CD44 was highly expressed in mast cells and monocytes in human WAT, and monocytes and neutrophils in mouse WAT. But a considerable amount of CD44 was also expressed in ASPCs in human WAT. Moreover, in obese mice, in addition to immune cells CD44 expressing cells mainly enriched in ASPC cells and adipocytes. These results support the notion that CD44 may be important in regulating adipose function through its direct action in adipocytes or adipocyte precursor cells. It is worth noting that CD44 was differentially expressed in human and mouse WAT, with the highest expression in subcutaneous WAT in humans but in epididymal WAT in mice. These data suggest a potentially differential role of CD44 in human and mice since subcutaneous adipose tissue in human is considered metabolically beneficial while epididymal adipose tissue in mice is detrimental to metabolic regulation during obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Wajchenberg et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Boyko et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Misra et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Snijder et al., 2004</xref>). The species differences of CD44 expression in adipose tissue remains unknown and will merit future investigations.</p><p id="P27">Adipose <italic>Cd44</italic> gene was associated with T2D by an expression based-genome wide association study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Kodama et al., 2012</xref>), however, it is unclear which mutations in the coding region of <italic>Cd44</italic> or which CD44 variant may be involved. Using CRISPR Cas9-mediated gene editing technique, we established two stable CD44KO cell lines, which adopted distinct genetic decorations to ablate CD44. Interestingly, despite the distinct genetic manipulations, both KO cells promoted adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. However, this promotion was only observed 7 days after differentiation initiation but was lost by Day 14. This suggests that CD44 may be more crucial in regulating mitotic proliferation and cell cycle arrest than terminal differentiation and maturation of adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Chang and Kim, 2019</xref>). Moreover, the two KO cell lines enhanced early differentiation through different mechanisms, where CD44 KO2 but not CD44 KO1 cells had increased <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Cebpa</italic> expression relative to 3T3-L1WT and CrisprWT cells on Day 7. The discrepant regulation of <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Cebpa</italic> expression in two CD44KO cell lines may be due to differences in genetic mutations (bp deletion in CD44KO1 vs. insertion in CD44KO2). Indeed, genetic deletion was suggested to cause more harm than insertion mutation because a deleted DNA fragment is difficult to be replaced at the exact position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Pineda et al., 2019</xref>). Regardless, the gene expression of <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Cebpa</italic> were not induced after 7 days of differentiation in the CrisprWT cells unlike in the 3T3-L1 naïve cells, which may suggest potential off-target effects of CRISPR Cas9 gene editing. While the gRNAs guide the Cas9 protein to break DNA sequences of interest in the genome, it can also promote Cas9 protein to mismatch targeted DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), resulting in off-target effects. However, if any, these off-target effects will be equivalent between the CrisprWT control cells and the two KO cell lines.</p><p id="P28">Here, we observe an inhibitory role of CD44 in adipogenesis, at least in 3T3-L1 cells, as deletion of CD44 promoted lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation and re-expression of CD44 in CD44 KO cells abolished this effect, accentuating CD44 specific effects. Kang et al., reported that HFD-fed CD44 global KO mice had increased epididymal WAT mass with larger adipocytes and increased lipogenic gene expression (e.g. <italic>Cidec, Fasn, Fabp1, Mogat2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Kang et al., 2013</xref>), indicative of enhanced adipogenesis and lipogenesis, which support our findings. Moreover, we provided additional mechanistic evidence how CD44 may regulate adipogenesis via modulating <italic>Pparg</italic> expression. Activation of <italic>Pparg</italic> by rosiglitazone has been previously shown to promote marrow mesenchymal stem cell U-33/γ2 differentiation with decreased CD44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Shockley et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting a possible negative regulation between <italic>Pparg</italic> and CD44. Furthermore, our conditional culture medium studies confirmed that lack of <italic>Pparg</italic> activation significantly attenuated adipogenesis in both CD44KO and CD44RE cells, but to a much greater extent in the CD44RE cells. Taken together, these results suggest that CD44 suppressed <italic>Pparg</italic> expression, therefore, inhibiting adipogenesis.</p><p id="P29">We further explored potential mechanisms by which CD44 inhibits adipogenesis through unbiased proteomics analysis. The metascope pathway enrichment analysis suggests that cell cycle progression-related pathways, e.g. mitotic cell cycle process and mitotic cell phase transition were most changed by deletion of CD44 in preadipocytes. Preadipocytes undergo unlimited proliferation until they become growth-arrested through contact inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Lefterova and Lazar, 2009</xref>). Under the stimulation of hormones such as insulin, the growth-arrested preadipocytes undergo cell cycle re-entry for mitotic clonal expansion and subsequent adipogenic induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Lefterova and Lazar, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, our proteomics data suggest that most proteins involved in all phases of the cell cycle were decreased by deletion of CD44 and was restored by re-expression of CD44. These results suggest that deletion of CD44 in preadipocytes may decrease cell division but increase growth arrest, therefore inducing cells towards mitotic clonal expansion and lipid accumulation. However, this hypothesis remains to be tested. It is important to recognise that overall changes in protein signatures caused by CD44 re-expression were moderate. This could be due to insufficient re-expression of CD44 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S2A-B</xref>) or possibly fragmented CD44 as identified by a 65KDa GFP-tagged protein band in Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Other protein expression strategies including direct transfer of plasmid DNA of CD44 are needed to further uncover CD44 specific proteomic effects.</p><p id="P30">In addition, we also observed some interesting regulation of CD44 on the mRNA and protein expression of various factors that have been shown to regulate adipogenesis, including Pref-1, Scara5, Npr3, and Fabp4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Moon et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Nueda et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Lee et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Li et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). Particularly, gene expression of <italic>Scara5</italic>, a novel mediator of adipocyte commitment, was increased by deletion of CD44, which was partially rescued by re-expression of CD44. Protein expression of Npr3, an atrial natriuretic peptide receptor which was recently shown to inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Roos et al., 2021</xref>), was decreased by deletion of CD44 and restored by re-expression of CD44. These results suggest that CD44 may regulate adipogenesis and adipocyte function through other novel mediators, which merits further investigations.</p><p id="P31">Blocking CD44 by genetic ablation or antibody antagonism attenuates adipose tissue inflammation, fibrosis, and insulin resistance with increased adiposity in obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Kodama et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Kang et al., 2013</xref>). Genetic deletion of CD44 also ameliorates HFD-induced skeletal muscle insulin resistance in obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Hasib et al., 2019</xref>). CD44 abrogates insulin responsiveness upon activation by its ligands HA and OPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Weng et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we found that re-expression of CD44 in CD44KO adipocytes decreased the insulin response by downregulating AKT phosphorylation (S473) and decreased adiponectin secretion. Adipose tissue stores excess energy in the form of triglycerides via <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis, adipogenesis and adipocyte hypertrophy during obesity. Impaired adipogenesis pressurises adipocytes into hypertrophy and subsequent adipocyte death, contributing to insulin resistance <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Gustafson et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Vishvanath and Gupta, 2019</xref>). Thus, the regulation of CD44 on adipogenesis in preadipocytes may be crucial for determining insulin responsiveness and endocrine functions of mature adipocytes. Regardless, it is important to recognise that CD44 is primarily expressed in immune cells which were not tested in the current study but remains an important contributor to adipose function.</p><p id="P32">In conclusion, our study utilised CRISPR Cas9-mediated <italic>Cd44</italic> deletion and lentivirus-mediated <italic>Cd44</italic> re-expression techniques in 3T3-L1 cells and discovered that CD44 in preadipocytes is a critical regulator of adipocyte differentiation and the endocrine function of mature adipocytes. We are the first to study the direct role of (pre)adipocyte CD44 in adipose function, providing insight into a potential extracellular matrix-receptor regulatory component, the HA/OPN-CD44 signalling in adipocytes. It is currently unknown whether the favourably metabolic effects of CD44 deletion in obesity is through cell-autonomous actions or non-adipocytes e.g. macrophages and adipocytes interactions. Future studies using CD44 conditional KO mice to investigate cell type specific role of CD44 in metabolism is essential. Nevertheless, our studies together with previous evidence suggest that CD44 may be a therapeutic target to treat obesity associated metabolic diseases such as T2D.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS189616-supplement-Supplemental_materials.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d151aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>LC-MS analysis was done at the FingerPrints Proteomics Facility at the University of Dundee.</p><sec id="S21"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by Diabetes UK (15/0005256 and 21/0006329 to LK) and British Heart Foundation (PG/18/56/33935 to LK).
