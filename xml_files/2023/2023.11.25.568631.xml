Evolutionary bifurcation, in which two mutational trajectories segregate, becoming non-interchangeable over time, is the basis of diversification in all kingdoms of life. Here, we present a detailed molecular description of a bifurcation event that rapidly led to the emergence of two distinct enzymes from a common ancestor. When initiated from two starting points that differed by a single amino acid, the laboratory evolution of a phosphotriesterase (PTE) toward arylester hydrolysis resulted in different genetic and phenotypic outcomes. One trajectory led to a &gt;35,000-fold increase in activity <italic>via</italic> the reorganization of its active site to achieve exquisite enzyme-substrate complementarity. The second trajectory gave rise to an evolved variant with a ∼500-fold increase in activity, but exhibiting an alternative substrate binding mode resulting from the destabilization of an active site loop. While initial mutations tend to dictate mutational accessibility, we rather observed the gradual divergence and specialisation of each trajectory, following the emergence of distinct molecular interaction networks. Intramolecular epistasis underlay pathway bifurcation by promoting unique synergistic interactions within each trajectory, while restricting the fixation of mutation across pathways. Our results illustrate how distinct molecular outcomes can radiate from a common protein ancestor and give rise to phenotypic diversity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Enzyme evolution</kwd><kwd>Epistasis</kwd><kwd>Fitness landscape</kwd><kwd>Adaptive radiation</kwd><kwd>Genetic Incompatibility</kwd><kwd>Contingency</kwd><kwd>Entrenchment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">From higher organisms to molecules, life has evolved into “<italic>endless forms most beautiful</italic>” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. This incredible diversity of evolutionary solutions arose from diverse factors, such as selection pressure, environmental influence, time, or even chance, which are inherent to evolutionary dynamics. For instance, an event as seemingly insignificant as a single mutation may dictate the path taken by evolution, leading to distinct evolutionary solutions. If so, evolution becomes highly contingent on a chance event. Evolutionary bifurcation, a phenomenon in which such a mutational event can trigger the segregation of two trajectories, giving rise to distinct and genetically incompatible species over time, has long fascinated biologists <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The mechanisms underlying evolutionary bifurcation, following a chance event, remain largely unexplored, however.</p><p id="P3">Evolutionary bifurcation may stem from the complicated and intertwined nature of biological networks. Indeed, networks of amino acids, embedded within three-dimensional structures, underpin the remarkable efficiency of protein functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. While diverse residues shape the active site architecture to bind specific ligands, distal clusters of residues underlie protein motions and allostery <italic>via</italic> long-range coupling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Thus, functional evolution often entails the reorganization of the active site through the formation of novel interactions and the loss of existing ones; these alterations can trigger a signifcant rewiring of established intramolecular networks. Such rewiring is often accompanied by epistasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, whereby mutations interact in a non-additive fashion, a cardinal phenomenon that can dictate the fate of evolutionary trajectories <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that bifurcation can arise when evolution follows alternative paths to rewire intramolecular networks, a consequence of extensive epistasis between mutations within, and across, evolutionary trajectories.</p><p id="P4">To explore the molecular underpinnings of evolutionary bifurcation in the laboratory, we conducted the parallel evolution of an enzyme, PTE phosphotriesterase, and observed the bifurcation of an ancestral lineage into two evolutionary pathways, from a common ancestor. Parallel experimental evolution, playing and replaying the “tape of life” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, is a conventional approach to study the influence of chance on evolution. In fact, several studies already demonstrated that alternative trajectories can give rise to variants with distinct mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. However, these studies have seldom elucidated the molecular changes that accompany the fixation of mutations, and it remains unclear how distinct solutions genetically segregate during evolution. Can a single mutation trigger a bifurcation by directly altering the effect of all dowmstream mutations, or is bifurcation rather a gradual phenomenon? By performing detailed genetic, biochemical, and biophysical characterizations of two evolutionary trajectories in unprecedented details (23 intermediates), we unveiled a molecular picture of an evolutionary bifurcation, which led to the emergence of two distinct molecular forms from a common ancestor. Our study illuminates how rapidly, but gradually, distinct molecular solutions can radiate from a common ancestor, giving rise to diversity.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Laboratory evolution from neutral neighbours led to evolutionary bifurcation</title><p id="P5">We generated and compared two independent laboratory evolution experiments of PTE phosphotriesterase (PTE<sup>WT</sup>) toward the hydrolysis of an arylester, 2-naphthyl hexanoate (2NH) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). The reference trajectory, previously described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, saw a 35,000-fold increase in arylesterase activity over 18 rounds of directed evolution from PTE<sup>WT</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. H254R was the first mutation fixed along this trajectory (henceforth referred as ‘<italic>Arg</italic> trajectory’); it increased the arylesterase activity by ∼3.5-fold and became a key residue, as other mutations accumulated (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The prominent role of H254R led us to hypothesize that distinct amino acids at position 254 could set the stage for a bifurcation event and the creation of alternative adaptive pathways (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). A mutational scanning at position 254 in PTE<sup>WT</sup>, <italic>i.e.</italic>, mutating His254 to all 19 amino acids, revealed that most substitutions are mildly deleterious or neutral. We chose Ser254, a residue with a different charge and size from arginine, and nearly neutral with respect to the arylesterase activity in PTE<sup>WT</sup> (1.2-fold increase in 2NH hydrolysis) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). We then performed directed evolution to enhance PTE’s arylesterase activity, under identical experimental conditions (‘<italic>Ser</italic> trajectory’, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Note that PTE variants are named according to the evolutionary round and trajectory in which they occurred: for example, R8 is the round 8 variant fixed along the <italic>Arg</italic> trajectory, while S8 is the corresponding variant in the <italic>Ser</italic> trajectory.</p><p id="P6">Contrary to <italic>Arg</italic>, our efforts to evolve highly active variants along the <italic>Ser</italic> trajectory were thwarted (∼500-fold in PTE<sup>S8</sup> <italic>vs.</italic> &gt;35,000-fold in PTE<sup>R18</sup>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Despite initially differing by a single amino acid, the two bifurcated trajectories reached genetically distinct solutions: all mutations but F306I are unique to their respective lineages (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Overall, the <italic>Arg</italic> mutations are scattered across the whole structure, particularly within Loop 4-8, whereas the <italic>Ser</italic> mutations are restricted to Loop 6-8. In addition to His254 and Phe306, Asp233 and Leu271 are also mutated in both trajectories, albeit to different amino acids. While D233E / L271F arose with H254R in the <italic>Arg</italic> trajectory, D233A / L271H were fixed along H254S in the <italic>Ser</italic> trajectory. Interestingly, these positions all surround the active site, and can - depending on the amino acid present - form interactions with the substrate and with one another (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). We refer to the ‘REF’(Arg254-Glu233-Phe271) and the ‘SAH’ (Ser254-Ala233-His271) triplets in each trajectory hereafter.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The rewiring of intramolecular networks created alternative structural solutions</title><p id="P7">Next, we sought to investigate the molecular changes underlying each trajectory. We first obtained 10 crystal structures of all seven <italic>Ser</italic> variants, including PTE<sup>S5</sup> in complex with a transition state analogue (HLN, hexylphosphonate 2-naphthyl ester). We then compared them to 16 structures of 13 variants from the <italic>Arg</italic> trajectory, including PTE<sup>R18</sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-d</xref>). Moreover, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e,f</xref>) and ensemble refinement (ER) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>) on 6 and 16 structures, respectively, to investigate potential differences in structural motions along the two trajectories. We previously demonstrated that along the <italic>Arg</italic> trajectory, the active site pocket was reshaped to provide exquisite enzyme-substrate complementarity, supporting the high catalytic efficiency of PTE<sup>R18</sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Here, we found that HLN – and by extension 2NH – bind in strikingly different orientations in PTE<sup>S5</sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). While the hexyl chain adopts a similar position in both enzymes, the naphthyl moiety of the substrate exhibits a kinked conformation in PTE<sup>S5</sup>. This orientation, albeit productive, appears suboptimal and more solvent-exposed, consistent with a ∼130-fold lower activity in PTE<sup>S5</sup> compared to PTE<sup>R18</sup>.</p><p id="P8">These two binding modes seem to originate from contrasting structural adaptations, resulting from the establishment of distinct intramolecular networks (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). In the <italic>Arg</italic> trajectory, a hydrogen-bonding network arose between active site residues 254-233-271(<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). As previously shown, Arg254 adopted a bent conformer (Cβ-Cγ-Cδ-Nε dihedral angle ∼40−70°) enabling the productive binding of 2NH observed in PTE<sup>R18</sup> by forming cation-π interactions with the naphthyl moiety of the substrate. The Arg254 bent conformer is directly stabilized by hydrogen-bonding interactions with D233E and Loop 7 residues, such as F271L <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Consequently, Loop 7 motions are greatly reduced in PTE<sup>R18</sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e,g</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. On the contrary, PTE<sup>S5</sup> mutations do not induce the formation of hydrogen-bonding interactions between positions 233-254-271, resulting in a dramatically destabilized Loop7 in PTE<sup>S3-S8</sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, f, g</xref>), such that Loop 7 residues are too mobile to be observed in the electron-density map. Furthermore, we computed shortest path maps (SPM), an approach that identifies networks of residues with coupled motions, <italic>i.e.</italic>, communication pathways, during MD simulations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. We found that distinct intramolecular networks were formed along each trajectory (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h,i</xref>). In PTE<sup>R18</sup>, the transduction of structural motions seems to span various active site loops. In particular, we observed a high number of pathways connecting Arg254 to Loop 7, where high residue connectivity could help minimize Loop 7 dynamics to enhance catalysis (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>). By contrast, in PTE<sup>S8</sup>, communication pathways are atrophied and overall, disconnected, which suggests that the intramolecular network mediating Loop 7 dynamics is significantly distinct in this enzyme (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that, despite an identical selection pressure, two bifurcated trajectories led two distinct molecular solutions, <italic>i.e</italic>., exhibiting distinct intramolecular networks, structural dynamics, and perhaps more surprisingly, enzyme-substrate complexes.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Differential mutational tolerance supports distinct adaptive mechanisms and exposes epistasis</title><p id="P9">Exploring mutational tolerance can inform on the contribution of a given residue to the enzymatic function. To this end, we mutated each key position 254, 233, 271 and 306 to all 19 amino acids in PTE<sup>WT</sup>, PTE<sup>S5,</sup> and PTE<sup>R18</sup>. In PTE<sup>R18</sup>, all R254X substitutions decreased the activity by &gt;1,000-fold, including serine and histidine. Similarly, mutations at position 271 and 306 are largely deleterious, albeit to a lesser extent. Mutations at 233 are only marginally deleterious in PTE<sup>R18</sup>. We observed contrasting mutational reponses in PTE<sup>S5</sup>: mutations at position 306 are the most deleterious, whereas 254 mutations exhibit a binary behaviors, <italic>i.e.</italic>, they either appear neutral or deleterious. Mutations at 233 are mildly deleterious and almost completely neutral at position 271. Differential mutational responses in the two evolved variants are consistent with structural observations: disrupting any element of the 233-254-271 network supporting the Arg254 - substrate interaction is strongly detrimental along the <italic>Arg</italic> trajectory. The corresponding mutations within the SAH triplet (<italic>Ser</italic> trajectory), which no longer forms an interaction network, are thus less disruptive. Note that I306X mutations are poorly tolerated in both variants, confirming that F306I is a key mutation in both trajectories, where it mediates the binding of the alkyl side-chain.</p><p id="P10">The saturation libraries at 233-254-271 contain ‘back to wild-type’ reversions, <italic>e.g.</italic>, R254H or S254H, and ‘swapping’ mutations between the <italic>Ser</italic> and <italic>Arg</italic> trajectories, <italic>e.g.</italic>, R254S or E233A. A detailed characterization of these mutations can expose if and how each lineage has specialized to utilize a given amino acid. As expected, most reversions are deleterious in both enzymes, especially in PTE<sup>R18</sup>, which demonstrated the relevance of these positions for the evolved function, and confirmed that these lineages have significantly diverged from PTE<sup>WT</sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Swapping alleles between <italic>Arg</italic> and <italic>Ser</italic> trajectories at position 233 (Glu <italic>vs</italic>. Ala), 254 (His <italic>vs.</italic> Arg), and 271 (Phe <italic>vs</italic>. His), individually or altogether (REF <italic>vs</italic>. SAH), demonstrated that hybrid variants are less fit than their parents (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). For example, R254S in PTE<sup>R18</sup> decreased the arylesterase activity by ∼430-fold; S254R while being deleterious in PTE<sup>S5</sup> or PTE<sup>S8</sup>, is limited to a 2-fold decrease. This mutual incompatibility between amino acids at position 233-254-271, a phenomenon reflecting reciprocal-sign epistasis, suggests that each residue in the network plays a specialized role in their respective evolved variant, rendering them non-functional in another background. The X-ray structures of these two ‘swapped’ variants provided molecular insights into this incompatibility: PTE<sup>R18</sup>+R254S exhibits a distorted active site architecture, including high flexibility in Loop 7. On the other hand, introducing S254R into PTE<sup>S5</sup> has little functional or structural effect: the 1.5-fold decrease in arylesterase may be attributed to a slight steric clash with the substrate bound in the <italic>Ser</italic> conformation (<italic>i.e.</italic>, as in PTE<sup>S5</sup> + HLN structure).</p><p id="P11">Finally, we probed the role of Loop 7 along each trajectory by constructing Loop 7 deletion variants (named ΔL7) on the PTE<sup>WT</sup>, PTE<sup>S5</sup> and PTE<sup>R18</sup> and obtaining their crystal structures (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref>). While ΔL7 does not prevent soluble expression in any variants, the functional and structural consequences differ substantially. ΔL7 has virtually no effect on the arylesterase activity, nor on the active site integrity of PTE<sup>WT</sup> and PTE<sup>S8</sup>. By contrast, ΔL7 is extremely detrimental to PTE<sup>R18</sup>; the activity decreased by ∼1,000-fold. We found that the active site organization became very disrupted, particularly in the vicinity of Arg254: this key residue now exhibits, once again, two conformers (bent and extended), which likely compromised catalysis. Taken together, these results confirm the existence of extensive underlying epistasis, which could have arised from potential alterations of pre-existing interaction networks.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The bifurcation of the <italic>Ser</italic> and <italic>Arg</italic> trajectories is gradual</title><p id="P12">We established the relevance of studying 233-254-271 in the evolved variants. Yet, several other mutations (15 in <italic>Arg</italic> and 9 in <italic>Ser</italic> trajectories, respectively) were also accumulated in the intermediate variants along each path. To acquire a time-resolved picture of evolutionary bifurcation, we introduced “254 reversions” (S/R254H<bold>, not shown</bold>), “254 swaps” (R254S, S254R, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), and ΔL7 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) mutations at various stages along the trajectories. We found that the effect of every mutation was gradually altered over the course of evolution. For instance, in the <italic>Arg</italic> variants, R254S, R254H, and ΔL7 only initially decreased the arylesterase activity by a few fold; these effects gradually and significantly increased in later rounds, up to &gt;1,000-fold. While the effects in the <italic>Ser</italic> trajectory appear less drastic, the initial beneficial effect of S254R and the deleterious effect of ΔL7 gradually disappear, becoming neutral as evolution unfolds. This remarkable graduality in mutational effects is a manifestation of extensive epistasis: most, if not all, mutations interact with position 254 and/or Loop 7 and alter the functional role of these two key elements. Furthermore, these observations suggest a gradual and extensive rewiring of the original intramolecular networks that existed in PTE<sup>WT</sup> during evolution. This rewiring is distinct along the two trajectories, <italic>Arg</italic> and <italic>Ser</italic> adapted to their initial mutation differently: Arg254 gradually became essential to the function in the <italic>Arg</italic> trajectory, whereas Ser254 (and position 254 overall) became largely insensitive in the <italic>Ser</italic> variants.</p><p id="P13">Structural, ER and B-factor analyses of all variants provided evidence for a gradual network rewiring (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c-e</xref> and <bold>Ext. Fig 6</bold>). We found that the structural changes strikingly mirror the functional ones. First, we observed a unique shift in Loop 7 dynamics along the <italic>Ser</italic> trajectory, with a significant increase in Loop 7 dynamics throughout evolution (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). The extent of the conformational fluctuations sampled in PTE<sup>S5</sup> can be visualized in the liganded structure with HLN, where Loop 7 became visible again (but not in the apo structure) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that the rmsf (ER) and B-factors of Arg254 gradually decreased along the <italic>Arg</italic> trajectory, as more mutations accumulated (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d,e</xref>). In parallel, Loop 7 was initially destabilized following the fixation of H254R (round 1), but became gradually stabilized over the course of evolution. By contrast, Loop 7 is increasingly - and gradually - destabilized along the <italic>Ser</italic> trajectory (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d,e</xref>), in correlation with our functional observations (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Our results reveal the molecular mechanisms by which the gradual functional optimization of PTE was accompanied by a gradual evolutionary optimization of the structural motions of Loop 7 and Arg254.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Epistasis causes the divergence of protein lineages across the fitness landscape</title><p id="P14">Last, we sought to identify specific epistatic interactions causing the bifurcation of the two trajectories. To this end, we generated and characterized the local fitness landscape of the key triplet positions, 254 (His, Ser and Arg), 233 (Asp, Ala and Glu) and 271 (Leu, His and Phe), by constructing all 27 combinatorial genotypes on the background of PTE<sup>WT</sup>+F306I (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Interestingly, the triplets accumulated in each trajectory (REF and SAH) exhibit distinct epistatic trends. The <italic>Arg</italic> trajectory exhibited strong pairwise positive epistasis, <italic>e.g.</italic>, H254R-D233E, and H254R-L271F (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). This suggests that the initial H254R mutation enabled the fixation of subsequent mutations D233E and L271F, paving the way for the <italic>Arg</italic> trajectory to evolve. It may also explain the stepwise creation of the 254-233-271 network, each position acting as a building block in this interaction network that stabilizes the substrate and the active site. By contrast, the <italic>Ser</italic> trajectory comprises more negative epistasis, whereby double mutants exhibit lesser effects than the additive effect of the individual mutations (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). This negative epistasis may illuminate how the <italic>Ser</italic> trajectory relied on the disruption of the 233-254-271 network: each mutation damages the network in a similar, but not additive, manner. Beyond the trends observed within each trajectory, we identified several examples where mutation(s) in one trajectory restricted the appearance of mutations in the other, due to sign epistasis. For instance, H254S (<italic>Ser</italic>) diminished the effect of D233E (<italic>Arg</italic>), and concomitantly H254R (<italic>Arg</italic>) that of D233A (<italic>Ser</italic>) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Furthermore, when D233A (<italic>Ser</italic>) and L271F (<italic>Arg</italic>) are fixed after H254R (<italic>Arg</italic>), they exhibit reciprocal sign epistasis causing a 66-fold lower arylesterase activity than their additive effect (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). H254R (<italic>Arg</italic>) and L271H (<italic>Ser</italic>) also exhibit sign epistasis, which implies that the fixation of H254R in the <italic>Arg</italic> trajectory restricted the emergence of L271H in this trajectory (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). These results are consistent with the fact that <italic>Arg</italic>/<italic>Ser</italic> hybrids are incompatible with one another (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and explain, at the molecular level, the bifurcation of these lineages.

Beyond this case study, our observations have broader implications for long-sought questions in protein evolution and engineering. For instance, how does protein evolution lead to different local maxima? Our study shows, for the first time, that genetically and molecularly distinct enzyme solutions exist in the fitness landscape, a stone’s throw away from a common ancestral state, and from one another. While we found that the initial mutations (H254R <italic>vs.</italic> H254S) triggered the bifurcation by promoting and restricting access to distinct subsets of mutations, the cumulative impact of subsequent mutations was essential to achieve pathway segregation. As more mutations accumulate, they gradually rewire interactions, expand or annihilate existing networks, reinforcing their own role within these networks. Our results, consistent with previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, further suggest that intertwined networks could reflect the fine-tuning and optimization of structural dynamics along the evolutionary trajectories of highly efficient enzymes. Such sophisticated coupling did not occur along the <italic>Ser</italic> trajectory, which also explains its dimisnished catalytic efficiency.</p><p id="P16">Concomittantly, we demonstrate that newly evolved networks can become incompatible with residues contributing to distinct networks, resulting in the creation of two uniquely distinct “molecular species”. While we report on a single enzyme, such mechanisms are likely relevant to other biological systems, where substantial networks (<italic>e.g.</italic>, intra- or inter-molecular, and genetic networks) underlie the function. In this study, we convincingly demonstrate that, while the fixation of key initial mutations may set the stage for network rewiring, it is the accumulation of consecutive mutations, and how they interact with the initial mutations, that will cause evolutionary diversification. Such snowball effects can lead to the rapid bifurcation of evolutionary pathways, and ultimately, the adaptive radiation of species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">A question arises regarding the frequency of such “bifurcating mutations” within the protein sequence space. Our study might constitute an exceptional case whereby mutations at the same position led to a clear bifurcation and diversification. Indeed, position 254 is located at the heart of the active site and can form direct interactions with the substrate. Other positions in PTE are unlikely to cause similar effects. Furthermore, it is generally assumed that only a relatively small fraction of mutational combinations will give rise to epistasis in a protein, let alone sign epistasis, an even rarer phenomenon. Moreover, the magnitude of epistasis is rarely as drastic. Therefore, only a handful of mutational pairs may be able to trigger evolutionary bifurcation. Yet, our study illustrates that, once such pairs are identified, rapid and drastic diversification can unfold.</p><p id="P18">Nonetheless, when we consider long-term evolutionary time scales, evolutionary bifurcation caused by chance, <italic>i.e.</italic>, seemingly insignificant mutational events, can be substantial. During genetic divergence, <italic>i.e.</italic>, neutral drift, multiple mutations will accumulate, while maintaining the primary function of a protein. Since genetic divergence among protein orthologs can easily exceed &gt;100 amino acid changes, these functionaly neutral mutations can set the foundation for evolutionary bifurcation by dictating potential rewiring strategies. Indeed, several recent studies showed that experimental evolution from homologous sequences resulted in significantly different evolutionary outcomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Thus, protein evolution is highly unpredictable, unless we understand the molecular details, that support protein functionality, including the mechanisms underlying the emergence and functionaing of intricated interaction networks in proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material And Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Methods Summary</title><p id="P19">Libraries of <italic>Ser</italic> variants were created by error-prone PCR or DNA shuffling and cloned into a pET-Strep vector, as described in ref.

Structures and structure factors were obtained from the wwPDB and re-refined using phenix.refine. For each structure in both Ser and Arg trajectories, phenix.readyset was used to add hydrogen atoms and generate .cif files for the ligands. Each monomer present in the crystallographic dimer was assigned to a unique translation-liberation-screw (TLS) group. Harmonic restraints were added to any ligands present. The ensemble refinement parameters were optimized by testing various TLS fitting procedures (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>TLS</italic></sub>= 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0) followed by optimization of the X-ray weight (by changing the simulation temperature bath, T<sub>bath</sub> = 290 K, 295 K, and 297.5 K) and the relaxation time of the time-averaged restrained (T<sub>x</sub> = 0.3, 0.6, 1). Finally, nine additional random seed repeats were performed using the parameters that led to the ensemble with the lowest R<sub>free</sub>. Alpha-carbon RMSF values were calculated using the get_rmsf tool in GROMACS (version 2018.3); analysis was performed on the five ensembles with the lowest R<sub>free</sub> values, following averaging of values across the two chains in the crystallographic dimer.

The protein was described with the AMBER-ff14SB force field <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, the two active-site zinc ions coordination sphere was represented with a bonded model generated with MCPB.py <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> and GAFF parameters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, and water molecules with the TIP3P force-field <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Each variant was solvated in a cubic box with a 10 Å buffer of TIP3P water molecules and was neutralized by addition of explicit sodium and chloride counterions (Na<sup>+</sup> or Cl<sup>-</sup>). Next, a two-stage geometry optimization approach was performed. First, a short minimization of the water molecules positions, with positional restraints on solute by a harmonic potential with a force constant of 500 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> Å<sup>-2</sup> was done. The second stage was an unrestrained minimization of all the atoms in the simulation cell. Then, the systems were progressively heated using six 50 ps steps, incrementing the temperature 50 K each step (0-300 K) under constant-volume, periodic-boundary conditions and the particle-mesh Ewald approach to introduce long-range electrostatic effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. For these steps, a 10 Å cut-off was applied to Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions. Bonds involving hydrogen were constrained with the SHAKE algorithm. Harmonic restraints of 10 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> were applied to the solute, and the Langevin equilibration scheme is used to control and equalize the temperature. The time step was kept at 2 fs during the heating stages, allowing potential inhomogeneities to self adjust. Each system was then equilibrated for 2 ns with a 2 fs time step at a constant pressure of 1 atm to relax the density of the system. After the systems were equilibrated in the NPT ensemble, three replicas of 500 ns MD simulations for each variant (R0, R1, R18, S1, S5, and S8) were performed under the NVT ensemble and periodic-boundary conditions using the Galatea cluster at the University of Girona.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Shortest Path Map analysis</title><p id="P39">The MD simulations were further analyzed by calculating the inter-residue mean distance and correlation matrices for SPM construction.

At the basis of the landscape, nodes (purple: R254; grey: H254 and blue: S254) represent genotypes (254X, 233X, 271X) and edges (grey lines) represent single mutational steps between neighbours.
