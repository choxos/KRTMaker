Although treatable with a restricted number of antibiotics, the emergence of resistant variants and high relapse rates necessitate alternative countermeasures. Phage therapy represents an attractive option. However, its implementation is handicapped by the narrow host specificity of the <italic>C. difficile</italic> bacteriophages isolated to date. One strategy to rationally expand phage host range would be to make appropriate modifications to the phage receptor binding protein (RBP). Here, we identify the tail fibre as the RBP of two <italic>Myoviridae</italic> phages, ΦCD1801 and ΦCD2301, which were previously isolated and propagated using the <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains CD1801 (RT078) and CD2301 (RT014), respectively. Contrary to studies into reprogramming the host ranges of phage of other bacterial other species, exchanging the tail fibre genes (<italic>tcf/tfp</italic>) alone between the two phage was insufficient to change host specificity. Rather, alterations to host range were dependent their exchange together with a putative chaperone encoded by <italic>hyp</italic>, localised adjacent to the tail fibre gene. Capitalising on this discovery, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to change the host range of one phage to that of the other by swapping the respective <italic>tcf/tfp</italic> and <italic>hyp</italic> genes. Significantly, one of the resulting mutants, surpassed both parental phages in terms of host range and efficiency of infection. This is the first time that genome engineering has successfully expanded the host range of a <italic>C. difficile</italic> phage, a prerequisite for implementing phage for the treatment of CDI.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic></kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd><italic>Myoviridae</italic></kwd><kwd>receptor binding protein</kwd><kwd>host range</kwd><kwd>phage tail</kwd><kwd>phage therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The pathogenic anaerobe, <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> (formerly <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>), is considered a major threat to public health by the US Centre for Disease control and Prevention which demands urgent attention <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The rising case rates of <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infections (CDI) over the last 20 years have led to it becoming the most common hospital-associated infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In the UK alone, ∼43,000 cases were reported for the 2021/22 financial year. CDI occurs following prolonged antibiotic treatment which disrupts the integrity of the gut microbiome, leading to dysbiosis and proliferation of the pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The complications that arise can sometimes be fatal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Further, the spore-forming nature of <italic>C. difficile</italic> leads to relapse in up to 35% of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> with some individuals suffering multiple recurrences. Paradoxically, the first-line therapy for CDI is antibiotic treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The continued long-term use of antibiotic therapy may lead to reduced susceptibility of the bacterium to antimicrobials and further instigate emergence of resistant and hypervirulent strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The nature of CDI calls for a more targeted treatment with precise therapies that leave the microbiome unperturbed.</p><p id="P3">A particularly attractive option would be the implementation of phage therapy. This is because bacteriophages (phages), the most abundant entities on Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, are known for their precise host specificity. This can range from the infection of an entire genus, down to subspecies level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Phages have been used for over 100 years to cure infections, although largely superseded in the West after 1940 with the development of antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Phages therefore represent a promising, narrow-spectrum alternative to antibiotics for the treatment of CDI – clearing the infection with minimal microbiome disruption and eliminating the possibility of recurrence. Isolated phages of <italic>C. difficile</italic>, however, are generally known for their very narrow host ranges, although some “broad range” phages infecting prevalent ribotypes have been isolated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Their specificity is a welcome advantage, but also a double-edged sword as the currently available phages are not able to target all clinically prevalent <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains. To address the issue of specificity, the underlying mechanisms dictating phage binding range require investigation. Phage receptor binding protein (RBP) and host range determining factors are poorly characterised in phages infecting <italic>C. difficile</italic>, although it has been established that the counterpart host receptor is encoded by the <italic>slpA</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Part of the phage host range is its binding range, dictated by the tail components, mainly the RBP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, which is recognised as the tail fibre (or spike in other species)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Many phages also require accessory proteins to support tail fibre function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, although genes of this nature have not yet been reported in <italic>C. difficile</italic> phages.</p><p id="P4">To overcome the current barriers to phage therapy in <italic>C. difficile</italic>, we sought to establish the receptor binding determinants of the typical <italic>C. difficile Myoviridae</italic> phages and thereafter alter host range through genome engineering. This was accomplished through the use of a CRISPR/Cas9-based editing tool, RiboCas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, to create seamless deletion, complement and exchange mutants. The latter comprised phage mutants in which their tail genes were replaced with those of a second phage with different host specificity. Testing of the ability of the hybrid phages to infect a range of <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains confirmed the tail fibre as the principal determinant of host specificity and revealed supporting tail genes. This study provides a blueprint for host range manipulation of <italic>Myoviridae</italic> phages infecting <italic>C. difficile</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Tail fibre validation</title><p id="P5">Our strategy was based on two phages, ΦCD1801 and ΦCD2301, which were previously isolated and propagated using the <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains CD1801 (RT078) and CD2301 (RT014), respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The initial focus was on the phage tail fibre-encoding genes, before expanding to include other tail genes within the vicinity. First, we sought to establish the identity of the genes encoding the RBP, usually the tail fibre, and thereafter determine whether they dictate binding specificity.</p><p id="P6">Tail fibre genes are typically located between the genes encoding the tail tape measure protein and the endolysin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and fall within the structural tail gene module<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.A BLAST query of genes located within the tail module revealed the presence of “tail collar fiber protein” (QVW56628.1, <italic>tcf</italic>) in ΦCD1801 and “tail protein” (QVW56667.1, hereafter referred to as <italic>tail fibre protein</italic> – <italic>tfp</italic>) in ΦCD2301; both ∼800bp in size. These were predicted to be the RBP for each phage through homology and location. The two proteins shared 83% identity and 92% similarity, exhibiting the greatest divergence at their C-terminals (Supplementary, S5). Using HMMER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, both were shown to contain a “domain of unknown function” (DUF3751), at the N-terminal (Accession IPR022225). This domain is a common feature of phage tail fibres across many species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and docks the fibre to the baseplate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The C-terminal region likely determines the binding specificity and is, therefore, less conserved between phages. The same pattern can be found between this region of ΦCD1801 and ΦCD2301, which likely explains their differing host ranges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">To enable functional verification of the identified tail fibre genes, RiboCas was used to generate deletion mutants of both phages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The resultant two mutant phages lacking their respective tail fibre genes (ΦCD1801ΔBM1 and ΦCD2301ΔBM1), were then assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). No binding was detected in either case as no plaques were obtained. Binding capabilities were restored to that of the WT phages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>) following complementation of the deleted gene in each phage (ΦCD1801*CompBM1 and ΦCD2301*CompBM1).</p><p id="P8">The examination of mutant and WT phage particles by TEM showed that ΦCD1801ΔBM1 was able to form complete virion particles that maintain structural integrity. When compared to the WT and ΦCD1801*CompBM1 phage particles, however, the deletion mutant appeared to lack tail fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-e</xref>). This was indicated by the “blunt” appearance of ΦCD1801ΔBM1 tail ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), whereas the presence of fibres in WT and ΦCD1801*CompBM1 phage particles gave their tails a “fluffy” appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>). Further, using AlphaFold 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, the 3D protein structure of the tail fibres was predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2g</xref>). The resulting predictions resemble a tail fibre comprised of the DUF3751 domain (attaches fibre to the baseplate) mostly depicted by tightly packed β-sheets, which leads onto α-helices arranged into a long fibre-like projection (that recognises and binds the receptor). Combined, these data strongly suggest that these genes encode tail fibres, recognised as the phage RBP.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Mapping of phage genes involved in binding</title><p id="P9">As binding range is determined by the tail fibre and often supported by neighbouring tail proteins, we sought to manipulate it by generating hybrid mutants of ΦCD1801 in which various tail genes (termed ‘binding modules’) were exchanged with the equivalent genes from ΦCD2301 and vice versa. Although the overall sequence identity between the ΦCD1801 and ΦCD2301 genomes is low, at only 36%, the tail regions share 71.6% identity and appear highly homologous. Despite the latter homology, the two phages do not have a shared host range. First, we mapped the tail region of both phages to identify additional genes, apart from the tail fibre (encoded by <italic>tcf</italic> and <italic>tfp</italic>), that may play a direct or supporting role in the host range encoding the following components: the baseplate (<italic>bpJ</italic>), tail component (<italic>ptp</italic> and <italic>ptc</italic>) and hypothetical protein (<italic>hyp</italic>). Single deletion and exchange mutants were generated to help resolve the individual contribution of each gene. We anticipated that the exchange of multiple genes may be required to maintain structural integrity (upstream genes – <italic>bpJ</italic>; <italic>ptp</italic> and <italic>ptc</italic>) and/or provide an accessory function like a chaperone (downstream gene – <italic>hyp</italic>). In total, seven regions/genes were targeted for testing – designated as Binding Module (BM) 1 to 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P10">BM1, investigated in the preceding experiments, comprised the tail fibre gene and was expected to be the main determinant of host range. BM2-4 mutants were generated to ensure structural compatibility between the tail fibre and upstream components like the tail component (BM2 and BM3) and baseplate (BM4). Many phages utilise chaperones to fold tail fibres <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, and in some cases, ensure their function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Consequently, BM5 and 6 mutants were created to determine whether the hypothetical protein could play a role in tail fibre function. BM7 (composed of the tail component, tail fibre and the hypothetical protein) was included in case both structural and chaperone activities were at play.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Identification of binding modules that determine host range through deletions and exchanges</title><p id="P11">We generated further deletion (ΦCD1801ΔBM2-7 and ΦC23801ΔBM2-7), and subsequently, exchange mutants (ΦCD1801*eBM1-6 and ΦC23801*eBM1-7) to determine the combination of genes needed to change phage host range.</p><p id="P12">Out of all 14 deletion mutants generated, only mutant ΦCD1801ΔBM5 was able to bind to its original propagating host – CD1801 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The phage’s binding capability, however, was substantially diminished when compared to the WT, showing a 99.98% decrease in number of particles which were able to bind. This effect was not observed in the parallel mutant – ΦCD2301ΔBM5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) and is likely a consequence of a much lower induction titre of ΦCD2301 at 10<sup>4</sup> compared to 10<sup>7</sup> pfu/ml of ΦCD1801. The hypothetical titre of ΦCD2301ΔBM5 would therefore be expected to be reduced to 3.5 pfu/ml, which is below the experimental detection limit (10 pfu/ml).</p><p id="P13">Following, exchange mutants were generated by inserting the binding module genes from one phage into the other in place of the previously deleted genes. The backbone of the exchange mutants remained unchanged and the resulting hybrid phage mutants (ΦCD1801*eBM1-6 and ΦCD2301*eBM1-7) now carried various binding modules from the other phage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Generation of the ΦCD1801*eBM7 mutant proved not to be possible, despite multiple attempts, likely owing to challenges in the uptake of large vectors by CD1801. The mutant exchange phages generated were then induced and the ability of the released phage particles to infect either propagating strain (CD1801 and CD2301) was tested by plaque assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Exchange of the tail fibres alone (ΦCD1801*eBM1 and ΦCD2301*eBM1) did not result in infectious phage particles as the mutants were unable to infect either of the propagating hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). Under TEM, ΦCD1801*eBM1 appeared to maintain structural integrity showing complete virion particles with “fluffy” tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), indicating a tail fibre was present, yet lacking in function.</p><p id="P15">Mutant ΦCD1801*eBM2 and its counterpart ΦCD2301*eBM2 were both able to infect their original propagating strains at levels similar to that of the WT phages (no statistical significance). Combined with the lack of infection when the tail component is deleted (ΔBM2) this result showed that the tail component gene needs to be present for a functional phage particle to be formed, however, it is non-specific and interchangeable between these two phages.</p><p id="P16">Mutants ΦCD1801*eBM3 and ΦCD1801*eBM4 were also able to plaque, albeit at extremely low levels (99.98% and 99.99% decrease, respectively) and again only on the original propagating strain, CD1801. These data indicate that the structural genes targeted in BM2-4 do not play a role in determining host range as the mutants were unable to plaque on their respective new target strains. Mutant ΦCD1801*eBM5 was able to bind to CD1801 at levels comparable to those of the deletion mutant (ΦCD1801ΔBM5), showing that the hypothetical protein originating from ΦCD2301 is not functional in ΦCD1801 on its own and appears specific to the tail fibre of origin. Further, under TEM the deletion and exchange mutants both appear blunt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">g</xref>), as if the tail fibres are not present or folded correctly. The reciprocal mutants ΦCD2301*eBM3-5 did not bind to either strain. This was expected, however, due to the previously specified low induction level of the phage putting mutants below the detection limit.</p><p id="P17">Significantly, the exchange mutants ΦCD2301*eBM6 and ΦCD2301*eBM7 were able to plaque on the propagating strain of ΦCD1801, CD1801. This represents the first time that the host range of a <italic>C. difficile</italic> phage has been deliberately changed. Both mutants encoded the tail fibre, as well as the downstream hypothetical protein from ΦCD1801. Mutant ΦCD2301*eBM7 additionally encoded the tail component from ΦCD1801, which we previously showed through *eBM2 to not be involved in specificity. Consequently, its exchange in future experiments is unnecessary. Taken together, these data indicate that the tail fibre and its corresponding downstream hypothetical protein determine binding specificity.</p><p id="P18">Given the change in host range observed with ΦCD2301*eBM6, the reciprocal exchange mutant ΦCD1801*eBM6 would have been expected to infect CD2301, however this was not the case. As this apparent barrier may be specific to strain CD2301, we tested several other strains previously shown to be infected by WT ΦCD2301<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Of those tested, strain CD8001 was found to be particularly susceptible to ΦCD1801*eBM6 and was therefore designated as the new propagating host in following experiments. This indicated a problem with entry of ΦCD1801 backbone into CD2301 cells specifically, rather than the exchanged tail components. The phage particles were imaged under TEM, as the titre of the mutants could be increased to an appropriate level. The WT phages (ΦCD1801 – 2c, ΦCD2301 – 4h) and their respective *eBM6 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">j</xref>) all appeared to have fibres at the terminal tail ends; they could also be differentiated by their backbones as ΦCD1801 tails are ∼160nm in length, but ΦCD2301 tails are much shorter at ∼100nm.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Exchange mutants mimic host range of WT phages based on tail components</title><p id="P19">We next tested the host range of the ΦCD1801*eBM6 and ΦCD2301*eBM6 exchange mutants, alongside the WT phages, against a panel of <italic>C. difficile</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). The panel comprised 75 strains selected based on previously infected ribotypes (RT002, 014, 078 and 122) and previous susceptibility to infection by other phages. The titre of each preparation of phage particles in the panel was normalised to 10<sup>8</sup> pfu/ml using their propagating strain.</p><p id="P20">As expected, mutant ΦCD2301*eBM6 was able to fully mimic the host range of WT ΦCD1801 and infected 35 out of 75 strains, including strains CD7701.1 and CD2315 which were not infected by the WT phage. Strain CD2315 (RT078) was previously shown to exhibit lysogenic immunity to WT ΦCD1801 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, however ΦCD2301*eBM6 was able to infect it at EOP 0.79 (Supplementary, S6) as the repressor found in its ΦCD2301 backbone differs considerably to that of WT ΦCD1801 (19% identity). Moreover, the EOP of the mutant phage on the strains was more than twice that of the WT ΦCD1801, being 0.70 and 0.31, respectively. Most EOPs fell within the expected range of 0.01-1.0, however the ΦCD2301*eBM6 efficiency on strain B32 was at 2.47, which is unusually high, particularly when compared to the WT phage, at 0.0051. Overall, these data demonstrate that such hybrid phage can display some advantages over the parental phage.</p><p id="P21">Consistent with previous data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, the host range of ΦCD2301 and its corresponding exchange mutant ΦCD1801*eBM6, appeared much more limited and each phage was only able to infect 9 panel strains. The propagating strain, CD2301, was exclusively infected by the WT phage and CD7701 was only infected by the mutant phage. As resident prophages can grant immunity to phage infection, PHASTER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> analysis was employed to identify possible prophages in the CD2301 genome. A total of seven prophage regions were identified, two of which were scored as intact phages. Despite their presence, no common repressor sequence was identified, suggesting that other host factors may prevent ΦCD1801*eBM6 entry into CD2301, although lysogenic immunity cannot be ruled out. Aside from the propagating strain, the mutant phage was able to infect the remaining 8 strains at an average EOP of 0.148 which was equivalent to the average EOP (0.144) of WT ΦCD2301.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">While phage therapy is an attractive alternative to antibiotics for the treatment of CDI, <italic>C. difficile</italic> phages isolated to date have very narrow host ranges, often infecting only a few strains. This compromises their potential application as effective therapeutics. A logical solution would be to use engineering biology to expand the host range. A prerequisite of such an undertaking, and the aim of this study, was to identify and engineer the RBP of existing <italic>C. difficile</italic> phages with a goal of altering their host range.</p><p id="P23">Prior studies that have examined the interaction between <italic>C. difficile</italic> and phages have focussed on the host receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, leaving the reciprocal phage BRP largely uncharacterised. In phages infecting other species, the tail fibres have been shown <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> to be the RBP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The experiments undertaken here have confirmed this is also the case for <italic>C. difficile Myoviridae</italic> phages. However, contrary to studies into reprogramming host ranges of other species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, exchanging the tail fibre alone (*eBM1 mutants) was insufficient to change the host range. Rather, as evidenced from the properties of the *eBM6 mutants, changes to host range were dependent on exchange of the tail fibre together with corresponding downstream hypothetical protein.</p><p id="P24">The hybrid mutant phages created were able to infect their new target strains, mimicking the host range of the WT phages, except in instances where host interference was suspected. The hypothetical protein, therefore, appears to serve an accessory function to the tail fibre in some capacity and is specific to the fibre of the phage from which it originated. Database searches indicated the encoding gene (<italic>hyp</italic>) to be present in other phages infecting <italic>C. difficile</italic>, but that similarity aside, the encoded polypeptide shares no similarity to any protein of known function. On its own, it is not essential for virion function, although when deleted (ΦCD1801ΔBM5), the number of functional phage particles was severely reduced by almost ∼5000-fold, decreasing the titre by 4-logs of magnitude. Lone exchange of the <italic>hyp</italic> gene had no effect on binding as the ΦCD1801*eBM5 mutant behaved the same as the deletion mutant. The BM5 mutants demonstrated that the hypothetical protein does not determine the host range alone and to function it must be paired with a native tail fibre.</p><p id="P25">Based on the outcomes of the exchange experiments, a likely function of <italic>hyp</italic> is that of a chaperone-encoding gene. These are typically found immediately downstream of tail fibre genes in other phages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, but vary in mode of action and size. Classic chaperones, such as gp38 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> and gp57 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> .of T4, and Tfa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> of phage lambda, are typically associated with mediating tail assembly. In contrast, adhesins such as gp38 of T2, K3 and Ox2 phages are displayed at the end of tail fibres and contribute to receptor binding and, therefore, host range <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. The features observed in the hypothetical protein in ΦCD1801 and ΦCD2301, however, are more consistent with a chaperone that combines both functions. These include the apparent specificity towards its parent tail fibre gene, the lack of tail fibre function in the absence of the hypothetical protein and their large size (496-564aa) compared to typical chaperones (90-200aa). Tfa chaperone-adhesins of phages Mu and P2 have similarly been shown to assist both in tail folding and exhibit specificity to their native tail fibre <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">The host range of any particular phage is dictated by the binding range (determined by phage tail components) and host factors, such as resident prophage elements. The latter can be highly influential but are often and the entire emphasis is placed on the phage components. It is important to consider host factors when working with polylysogenic organisms such as <italic>C. difficile</italic> which can contain up to six prophages, more commonly one to three <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Prophages represent a not inconsiderable obstacle to the successful implementation of phage therapy by preventing infection by therapeutic phages through superinfection exclusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. The current study highlights the advantages of hybrid phages as ΦCD2301*eBM6 was able to overcome this phenomenon in strain CD2315, as its ΦCD2301 backbone isn’t associated with RT078 <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains. Therefore, it is unlikely that these strains contain excluding prophage elements effective against this backbone, for example repressor genes with high sequence similarity. This mutant superseded its WT parent phages by exhibiting the broadest host range, infecting 46.6% of the tested panel and exhibiting the highest EOP of those tested.</p><p id="P27">The work described here has for the first time shown that the ability of <italic>Myoviridae</italic> phages to bind to their <italic>C. difficile</italic> host is dependent on their tail fibre genes and adjacent <italic>hyp</italic> gene, encoding the RBP and a putative chaperone, respectively. The RBP alone was insufficient for binding but required the presence of the putative chaperone. Capitalising on our discovery and using engineering biology, it proved possible to change the host range of the one phage to that of the other by swapping the respective <italic>tcf/tfp</italic> and <italic>hyp</italic> genes. Significantly, one of the resulting mutants, ΦCD2301*eBM6 surpassed both WT phages with its superior host range and efficiency of infection. This is the first time that genome engineering has been used to successfully expand the host range of a <italic>C. difficile</italic> phage. Our work provides a blueprint for enhancing the host range of <italic>Myoviridae</italic> phages, a prerequisite for implementing phage therapy for the treatment of CDI.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Online Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Growth of <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains</title><p id="P28">Required strains of C. difficile (Supplementary, S1) were routinely grown at 37°C in a Don Whitley anaerobic workstation, MG1000 (80% N<sub>2</sub>, 10 CO<sub>2</sub>, 10% H<sub>2</sub>).

Phage therapy presents an attractive option as it has the potential to clear the infection with minimal microbiome disruption and eliminate the possibility of recurrence. However, the <italic>C. difficile</italic> bacteriophages isolated to date have highly restricted host ranges. Moreover, rational strategies to alter specificity have till now been precluded as the identity of the phage receptor binding proteins involved was largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that tail fibre proteins and an associated putative chaperone determine the host range of two <italic>Myoviridae</italic> phage. This enabled the alteration of specificity through CRISPR-mediated genome editing and the creation of a phage derivative with a host range and infection efficiency exceeding that of the parental phages. This is the first time that the host range of a <italic>C. difficile</italic> phage has been successfully expanded through rational genome engineering.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Mutant generation and evaluation.</title><p id="P42"><bold>a)</bold> CRISPR/Cas9 based editing using RiboCas.

The colour scale is indicative of the degree of infection when compared with the propagating strain, calculated as EOP – efficiency of plating. Yellow coloured rectangles, mostly populated by ΦCD2301 and mutant following its host range, ΦCD1801*eBM6, indicate very inefficient infection. Whereas the red, and deep red coloured rectangles indicate a much more efficient infection. Propagating strains are highlighted in bold. The EOP of propagating strains with corresponding phages is always 1. The full list of strains used, their origins and corresponding EOP values can be found in the Supplementary data. White rectangles indicate no infection was detected. *indicates ribotype 786, see Supplementary, S4.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS189804-f005"/></fig></floats-group></article>
