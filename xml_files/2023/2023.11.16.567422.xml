Given the well-established role that the PDE11 substrates cAMP and cGMP play in eye physiology and sleep, we determined if 1) PDE11A protein is expressed in the retina or other eye segments in mouse, 2) PDE11A-Y7272C affects catalytic activity and/or subcellular compartmentalization more so than the nearby suicide-associated PDE11A-M878V variant, and 3) <italic>Pde11a</italic> deletion alters eye growth or sleep quality in male and female mice. Western blots show distinct protein expression of PDE11A4, but not PDE11A1-3, in eyes of <italic>Pde11a</italic> WT–but not KO mice–that vary by eye segment and age. In HT22 and COS-1 cells, PDE11A4-Y727C reduces PDE11A4 catalytic activity far more than PDE11A4-M878V, with both variants reducing PDE11A4-cAMP more so than PDE11A4-cGMP activity. Despite this, <italic>Pde11a</italic> deletion does not alter age-related changes in retinal or lens thickness, axial length, nor vitreous or anterior chamber depth. Further, <italic>Pde11a</italic> deletion only minimally changes refractive error and sleep quality. That said, both variants also dramatically alter the subcellular compartmentalization of human and mouse PDE11A4, an effect occurring independently of dephosphorylating PDE11A4-S117/S124 or phosphorylating PDE11A4-S162. Rather, re-compartmentalization of PDE11A4-Y727C is due to the loss of the tyrosine changing how PDE11A4 is packaged/repackaged via the trans-Golgi network. Therefore, the protective impact of the Y727C variant may reflect a gain-of-function (e.g., PDE11A4 displacing another PDE) that warrants further investigation in the context of reversing/preventing sleep disturbances or myopia.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">3’,5’-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are much investigated drug targets due to their ability to modulate cyclic nucleotides in an organ and brain region-specific manner as well as a subcellular compartment-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. There are 11 families of PDEs (PDE1-11), each composed of multiple isoforms that show unique tissue expression profiles and distinctive subcellular distributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Thus, each PDE isoform is a unique drug target capable of modulating separable physiological processes. The PDE11A family breaks down both cAMP and cGMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] and is comprised of 4 spliciforms: PDE11A1, A2, A3 and A4. The longest isoform, PDE11A4, is the isoform that is expressed in neural tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], and it is ~95% homologous across mouse, rat and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. This high degree of homology argues that the impact of human genetic variants can be readily interrogated in rodent systems. PDE11A4 is strongly expressed in neurons of the ventral and dorsal hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], the adjacent amygdalohippocampal and amygdalostriatal transition areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], but not in any of the 20+ peripheral organs we have compared in young adult <italic>Pde11a</italic> KO versus WT mice to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Consistent with its particularly enriched expression in the ventral hippocampus, the best known neurological roles for PDE11A4 are regulating social interactions, altering the formation of social memories, impacting neuroinflammation, and triggering age-related cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Interestingly, a Y727C missense mutation in PDE11A has been genetically linked in humans to improved sleep quality and reduced risk of myopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Ventral hippocampus activity in animals and humans correlates with sleep processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], and aberrant sleep is associated with hippocampal dysfunction at a molecular, cellular, and behavioral level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Further, ventral hippocampal projections containing PDE11A4 project to the hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], a brain region well known to regulate sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Although the presence of PDE11A protein has not yet been reported in the eye, its presence has been implied by human single-cell RNA sequencing studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Further, myopic development is associated with inadequate exposure to light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], photo-transduction is highly dependent on hydrolysis of the PDE11A substrate cGMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], and specific wave lengths of light that upregulate PDE11A expression in fibroblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] demonstrate promise as potential anti-myopic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Of particular interest to the fact that PDE11A-Y727C is both protective against myopia and enhancing to sleep quality, myopia has been associated with reduced sleep quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] and a dysregulated retinal circadian clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. In addition, RNA sequencing and phosphoproteomic studies show PDE11A4 regulates the molecular underpinnings of circadian entrainment in the ventral hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Together, these studies suggest the PDE11A-Y727C variant stands to impact sleep quality and eye physiology.</p><p id="P4">Given this evidence, along with the well-established role for cyclic nucleotide signaling and PDE function in eye physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>] and sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], the current study determined 1) if PDE11A is expressed in the mouse retina, anterior, and/or posterior segment of the mouse eye and if that expression changes with age, 2) if the PDE11A-Y727C mutation affects PDE11A catalytic activity or trafficking more so than the nearby PDE11A-M878V variant that is associated with high risk suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>] but not associated with myopia or sleep, and 3) if the loss of PDE11A leads alters ocular biometry, refractive error, or sleep quality.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p id="P5">Studies employed 3 lines of <italic>Pde11a</italic> knockout (KO) mice.

In this mouse strain, exon 6 and flanking splicing regions were constitutively deleted from the <italic>Pde11a</italic> gene using Crispr Cas9 gene editing technology (Crispr B6/N). The second and third line (used in analyses of whole eye PDE11A4 expression, cataract studies, and sleep studies) are the LacZ-generated Deltagen <italic>Pde11a</italic> KO lines that is maintained on either a predominantly C57BL/6J (LacZ B6/J) or BALB/cJ background (LacZ BALB/cJ) as previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. For each line, mice heterozygous for the <italic>Pde11a</italic> allele were mated to generate <italic>Pde11a</italic> homozygous KO and wild-type (WT) mice.

Mice were killed by cervical dislocation with or without isoflurane anesthesia. Eyes were harvested fresh and kept whole or dissected in phosphate-buffered saline on wet ice. Ocular tissue was separately isolated for the 1) anterior segment (i.e., cornea, ciliary body and muscle, and zonules), 2) retina, and 3) posterior segment (i.e., sclera, choroid, Bruch’s membrane, retinal pigmented epithelium, and parts of the optic nerve).

All tissue samples were isolated between 8 am and 2 pm.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Preparation of samples for Western blots</title><p id="P7">All tissue samples were stored at -80°C and kept on dry ice until processed. For analysis of whole eye tissue, 215 uL of either ice-cold 20mM Tris-HCl/2 mM MgCl2/0.5% Triton X-100 with protease inhibitor (Pierce #A32953) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3 (Sigma #P0044; Buffer #1, Bf#1) or boiling 1%SDS/50mM NaF (Buffer #2, Bf#2) was added. Due to the tough nature of the eyes, samples then underwent three cycles of sonication (Fisherbrand FB120 sonic dismembrator), where each cycle was followed by either freezing (Buffer #1) or boiling (Buffer #2) for five minutes. The samples were then pulse centrifuged, and the liquid portion was transferred to a new test tube.</p><p id="P8">For analysis of individual eye segments, all samples were sonicated for 3 cycles using ice-cold Buffer #1. Homogenized retina samples were precleared by centrifuging at 4°C for 10 minutes at 1,000 x g and transferring the resultant supernatant to a new test tube. Any solid tissue that remained in the anterior and posterior segment samples was shaken down to the bottom of the tube and the liquid portion was transferred to a new test tube because preclearing greatly reduced protein concentrations of the samples. Previously verified hippocampal tissue from either LacZ C57BL/6J or Crispr C57BL/6N <italic>Pde11a</italic> KO and WT mice were sonicated in Buffer #1 and used as negative and positive controls, respectively. To enable loading of the same positive and negative controls across many blots, hippocampal tissue from multiple male and female WT or KO mice were combined into one test tube.</p><p id="P9">Total protein concentration for each sample was determined using the DC Protein Assay kit (BioRad, Inc.; Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Whole eye samples and hippocampal controls were prepared at a concentration of 3.0 ug/uL. Due to the large number of samples being processed, eye segment tissue was prepared in separate batches of WT and KO mice. To increase the opportunity of detecting a PDE11A4 signal, each batch was prepared at the highest possible concentration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Only 1 batch was loaded per gel, so any difference in overall expression between gels due to differences in protein concentration were normalized by expression data as a fold change of a given gel’s control group (see more below in <italic>Data Analyses</italic>). Postnatal day 7 (P7) samples could only be analyzed for the retina, as the other segments were insufficiently concentrated. Due to initially low concentrations, 2 batches underwent an additional step of acetone precipitation (as per Thermo Fisher Scientific protocol TR0049.1; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), which a pilot study confirmed did not interfere with PDE11A4 detection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Samples for Western blotting were prepared from tissue lysates with the addition of Invitrogen sample buffer #NP0007 and sample reducing agent #NP0009.

For analysis of PDE11A expression, 11 μL of each sample (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for concentrations) was loaded onto 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE polyacrylamide gradient gels (Life Technologies; Bedford, MA) for electrophoresis. Protein was transferred onto a 0.45μm nitrocellulose blotting membrane (Amersham #10600008), which was then stained with Ponceau S (Fisher Scientific #6266-79-5). Ponceau S was used as a loading control based on the best practice statement of the Journal of Biological Chemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk/0.1% Tween20. Whole eye blots were probed overnight at 4 °C with 1 of two PDE11A antibodies: the pan-PDE11A antibody PD11-112 (1:1000, rabbit, Fabgennix) or the PDE11A4-specific antibody PDE11A#1-8113A (1:10,000, chicken, Aves Labs custom). All segment blots were probed with the PDE11A#1-8113A antibody only. The membranes were then incubated with a species-specific secondary antibody: anti-rabbit (Jackson Immunoresearch, 111-035-144; 1:10 000) and anti-chicken (Jackson Immunoresearch, 103-035-155; 1:40 000). Protein bands were visualized using the WesternSure Premium Chemiluminescent Substrate (LI-COR, #926-95000). Multiple film exposures were taken for each membrane to ensure exposures fell within the linear range of the film. For the initial assessment of PDE11A presence in whole eye tissue and eye segment tissue, all gels were run with the hippocampal controls. For the assessment of age-related changes in PDE11A4, gels were run with the segment-specific KO controls (P28KO for retina; P28 and P500 KO for anterior and posterior – P500 shown). All PDE11A4 expression was normalized to Ponceau S staining intensity as a loading control, and densitometry was conducted on films scanned in at 1200 dpi using ImageJ software (NIH).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Plasmid and lentivirus generation</title><p id="P11">As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], constructs were generated by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ) that expressed either EmGFP alone containing an A206Y mutation to prevent EmGFP dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>], or an EmGFP-tagged mouse <italic>Pde11a4</italic> (NM_001081033) with the <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Xho</italic>I recognition sequences added to the N-terminal and C-terminal, respectively.

The measured axial compartment sizes (corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, vitreous chamber depth and retinal thickness) were converted to geometrical length values by dividing the optical path length by the approximate average refractive index (n) of the medium (n=1.44 for the lens, n=1.34 otherwise).</p><p id="P16">Refractive state was measured using the infrared eccentric photorefractor developed by Schaeffel <italic>et al</italic> (software versions 2017 and 2019) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. The eye was oriented with the first Purkinje image in the center of the pupil, such that the estimated angle of the pupil plane was within 5 degrees from perpendicular to the camera axis. Refractive error was computed from the vertical gradient of the pupil reflection (10 samples per measurement, 99 measurements per eye). Measurements with the following criteria were included: minimal pupil size mean &gt;1.70, maximum pupil size standard deviation &lt;0.05, pupil brightness 50-200, maximum pupil brightness standard deviation &lt;10, maximal refraction standard deviation &lt;2. We computed mean and standard deviation from the 25%-75% quartiles of the refraction data for each eye. In case of an irregular reflection, generally caused by irregularity of the tear film, measurement was postponed. The photorefractor setup was calibrated by measuring refractive errors after placing trial lenses (ranging from -10 to +20 D) at a fixed distance of 3 cm from the eye of an anesthetized mouse. We applied a correction for the magnification factor of the trial lenses (calibration factor software version 2017 = 1.08; version 2019 = 1.90).</p><p id="P17">Both ocular biometry and refractive state measurements were performed on both the right and left eye, as long as both were uninjured, under general anesthesia of ketamine/xylazine (KX: 80 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg body weight, resp.; Aneketin, Dechra veterinary products; Xylasan, Alfasan diergeneesmiddelen BV).

Interestingly, compartment-specific expression within a given tissue appears to be the modus operandi for PDE11A4. Within the hippocampus, this enzyme is only expressed in the CA1 and subiculum subfields and not in CA3 or dentate gyrus.

Using samples from multiple <italic>Pde11a</italic> mouse lines processed using multiple lysis buffers, PDE11A4 protein was reliably detected in whole eyes from WT mice (but not KO mice) by A) a pan-PDE11A antibody (A4 ~ 97kD; A3 ~ 78 kD; A2 ~ 66 kD; A1 ~ 56 kD) as well as a B) PDE11A4-specific antibody. To determine potential enrichment in one segment over another, eyes from the Crispr B6/N line were dissected into retina, anterior segment, and poster segment and were lysed in buffer #1 and then probed with the PDE11A4-specific antibody. C) Retina shows robust PDE11A4 protein expression requiring minutes-long film exposures to visualize. In contrast, D) anterior segment and E) posterior segment show minimal expression that require overnight exposures to visualize. Note: PDE11A4 expression in the hippocampus(Hipp)is much higher than that in the eye, requiring far shorter film exposures to reveal strong specific signals in WT–hence why those exposures are shown blocked off from the eye samples in all but panel A.

A strong trend towards an opposing genotype effect in K) male versus L) female <italic>Pde11a</italic> KO mice is also observed across the higher frequencies of theta power during REMS. <italic>Post hoc:</italic> *vs. WT, P=0.0263-0.0017.

Quantification shows that C) Y727C and D) M878V reduce the occurrence of small mPDE11A4 puncta to the same extent as a previously reported phosphomimic mutation of serine 162 (S162D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]; each variant, n=18 biological replicates/group over 3 experiments). E) Y727C also increases the presence of larger mPDE11A4 punctate accumulations, while F) S162D and M878V do not. G-H) When the Y727C variant is co-expressed with PDE11A4-WT, as would occur in a patient, the phenotype of the Y727C variant completely dominates that of the WT construct, whereas WT+M878V results in the mathematically-predicted 50% effect size of M878V alone. I) Y727C decreases PDE11A4-pS117/pS124 (n=5/group) but J) M878V does not (n=4/group). K) Images of representative PDE11A4-pS117/pS124 (pp-11A4) and total PDE11A4 (t-11A4) Western blots. L) Neither a phosphomimic S117D/S124D nor a phosphoresistant S162A changed the ability of Y727C to reduce the presence of small PDE11A4 puncta nor M) increase the presence of large PDE11A4 accumulations. N) Similarly, S162A does not alter the dispersal effects of M878V; however, M878V is not able to fully block the pro-accumulating effect of S117D/S124D. O) There is no significant interaction between M878V and the phosphomutants on large PDE11A4 puncta. P) The phosphoresistant Y727A and the phosphomimic Y727D mutants elicited the same effect as the Y727C variant on P) small and Q) large PDE11A4 puncta. R) Relative to mCherry alone (i.e., negative control), overexpression of TGN38 increases the presence of small PDE11A4-WT, PDE11A4-Y727C, and PDE11A4-M878V puncta and S) doubles the effect of Y727C on the accumulation of large PDE11A4 puncta.
