In mammals, action potentials fired by rapidly adapting mechanosensitive afferents are known to reliably time lock to the cycles of a vibration. This stands in contrast to coding in the higher-order somatosensory cortices, where neurons generally encode vibrations in their firing rates, which are tuned to a preferred vibration frequency. How and where along the ascending neuraxis is the peripheral afferent temporal code of cyclically entrained action potentials transformed into a rate code is currently not clear. To answer this question, we probed the encoding of vibrotactile stimuli with electrophysiological recordings along major stages of the ascending somatosensory pathway in mice. Recordings from individual primary sensory neurons in lightly anesthetized mice revealed that rapidly adapting mechanosensitive afferents innervating Pacinian corpuscles display phase-locked spiking for vibrations up to 2000 Hz. This precise temporal code was reliably preserved through the brainstem dorsal column nuclei. The main transformation step was identified at the level of the thalamus, where we observed a significant loss of phase-locked spike timing information accompanied by a further narrowing of tuning curve widths. Using optogenetic manipulation of thalamic inhibitory circuits, we found that parvalbumin-positive interneurons in thalamic reticular nucleus participate in sharpening frequency selectivity and disrupting the precise spike timing of ascending neural signals encoding vibrotactile stimuli. To test the functional implications of these different neural coding mechanisms, we applied frequency-specific microstimulation within the brainstem, which generated frequency selectivity reminiscent of real vibration responses in the somatosensory cortex, whereas microstimulation within thalamus did not. Finally, we applied microstimulation in the brainstem of behaving mice and demonstrated that frequency-specific stimulation could provide informative and robust signals for learning. Taken together, these findings not only reveal novel features of the computational circuits underlying vibrotactile sensation, but could also guide biomimetic stimulus strategies to activate specific nuclei along the ascending somatosensory pathway for sensory neural prostheses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Vibrations are a fundamental component of our tactile experience. We use our ability to sense vibrations in many daily situations, such as perceiving incoming phone calls or detecting an approaching vehicle. In mammals, high frequency vibrations (&gt;100Hz) are transduced to electrical signals by Pacinian corpuscles (PC), which are innervated by primary sensory neurons whose soma are situated in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). This information is relayed to second order neurons in the dorsal column nuclei (DCN, gracile and cuneate) of the medulla. DCN axons project to neurons of the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus (VPL), which in turn project to primary somatosensory cortex (S1). The earliest electrophysiological recordings from receptor end organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Adrian and Umrath 1929</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Mountcastle, LaMotte, and Carli 1972</xref>) revealed that the receptor potentials, as well as the resulting action potentials in DRG neurons, reliably time-lock to the cycles of a vibration up to 1000 Hz. However, little is known about how this precise temporal coding is processed in the rest of the central nervous system to achieve feature specific computation, commonly with a rate code.</p><p id="P3">In the medulla, only very few studies in cats have recorded neuronal responses to vibration, and they reported mostly 1:1 locking of spikes to the phase of the stimulus in low frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gynther, Vickery, and Rowe 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Rowe 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sahai et al. 2006</xref>). In contrast, VPL has been more extensively studied and is considered an integration hub for ascending somatosensory information along the lemniscal pathway. Individual neurons were found to be occasionally temporally entrained, and there was an increasing complexity in preferred frequencies and neural adaptation to vibration in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Herron and Dykes 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">VÃ¡zquez, Salinas, and Romo 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Finally, at the cortical level different coding modes have been described. On one hand, in primate S1, vibration information seems to be represented by precise spiking patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Suresh, Saal, and Bensmaia 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Saal, Harvey, and Bensmaia 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Suresh et al. 2021</xref>), similar to the cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Birznieks et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Birznieks and Vickery 2017</xref>). It is not until the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), that the frequency-dependent firing rate modulations become the primary neural code for vibration and phase-locked responses seem absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Salinas et al. 2000</xref>). On the other hand, in rodent S1, neurons seem to represent vibration frequency by a rate code tuned to a preferred stimulus feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Prsa et al. 2019</xref>). This resembles feature-selective coding found in many other sensory modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Prsa et al. 2019</xref>). Yet it raises an important question: how are cyclically entrained action potentials (a temporal code) in afferents of peripheral mechanoreceptors transformed along the ascending neuraxis into a rate code in the cortex? Although a similar transformation of low frequencies (&lt; 10 Hz) has been investigated in the rat whisker system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ahissar, Sosnik, and Haidarliu 2000</xref>), it remains unclear for high frequency encoding of skin vibrotactile stimuli. In the current study, we addressed this question in mice by recording along the dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway to first uncover the basic coding principles and rules underlying sensory perception. Then, we sought to uncover the circuit mechanism underlying the transformation of neural coding with optogenetic manipulations. Finally, we tested to what extent these coding strategies might be leveraged as artificial sensory feedback in neuroprosthetics using microstimulation to selected neuronal populations. Overall, our results provide key insights into how to artificially mimic vibrotactile stimuli in neuroprosthetic devices.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Temporal code of vibrotactile stimuli along the ascending pathway</title><p id="P5">To identify the location and mechanism of the transformation of neural coding for vibration, we first conducted <italic>in vivo</italic> extracellular recordings in anesthetized mice along the ascending somatosensory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Pure sinusoidal vibrations of a wide range of frequencies (100 Hz to 1900 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Prsa et al. 2019</xref>) were delivered to the hindlimb of anesthetized mice. Frequency and amplitude combinations were selected based on previous psychophysical and physiological findings, in which mice can perceive stimuli as gentle vibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">K.-S. Lee et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Prsa et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">2021</xref>). We computed standardized inter-spike intervals (ISIs; see Methods) whose distribution should peak at integer multiples of the stimulus period in the case of phase-locked entrainment of action potentials by the oscillatory stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b-e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Nerve recordings from low-threshold mechanoreceptors that are likely innervating Pacinian corpuscles (AÎ² RA2-LTMR; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>), display phase-locked spiking for vibrations up to 1900 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). We show that the precise temporal code found in the periphery is surprisingly well preserved in putative second-order neurons in the brainstem gracile nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). This reliable high-frequency spiking transmission in DCN likely relies on specialized mechanisms, possibly endocytic processes and synaptic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wu, Ryan, and Lagnado 2007</xref>). We therefore conducted reconstruction of focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy data of DCN synapses and expected to find structures similar to either the ribbon synapses in cochlear hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lenzi et al. 1999</xref>), or the calyx of Held in the auditory brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Sun, Wu, and Wu 2002</xref>). However, we did not find evidence of either, suggesting that different mechanisms might govern high-throughput transmission in DCN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>), consistent with previous observations with transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ellis and Rustioni 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Banna and Jabbur 1989</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In contrast to the reliable transmission revealed at the DCN level, precise temporal coding is lost in thalamic VPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>) and remains absent in somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). Phase-locking probability thus suddenly drops downstream of the brainstem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>), suggesting that loss of temporal coding for vibration in the ascending pathway occurs at the level of the thalamus.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Rate code of vibrotactile stimuli in the ascending pathway</title><p id="P7">The absence of cyclically phase-locked spiking beyond the brainstem suggests that vibration frequencies are represented as pure rate codes in both thalamus and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Prsa et al. 2019</xref>). However, rate coding for different vibration frequencies could also exist at early stages of the ascending pathway. We therefore investigated the feature-selective encoding of substrate vibrations within the same data as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Most of the vibration responsive units, even from nerve fibers, showed a frequency preference across various amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Nerve recordings revealed broad tuning curves covering a wide range of preferred frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), which indicated a moderate level of rate coding for vibration in the periphery. The pattern and distribution of tuning curves in the brainstem gracile nucleus were similar to the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). In contrast, tuning curves in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus became much more narrowly tuned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>), as did those in somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). Comparison of tuning curve widths for vibration frequency, defined by the half-width at half-maximum amplitude (HWHM), from the periphery to cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>), suggests that the main step causing a narrowing of tuning found in S1 involves thalamic circuits. In addition, we found the coefficient of variation (CV) of inter-spike intervals also greatly increased at the thalamus (mean CV: LTMR, 0.019; DCN, 0.024; VPL, 0.975; S1, 1.088). Taken together, our results show that the neural code transformation, from mechanoreceptor temporal encoding to cortical rate encoding, thus mainly occurs in thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The role of inhibitory thalamic circuits</title><p id="P8">According to previous work, loss of temporal coding can be partially attributed to strong, frequency-dependent depressing-type excitatory connections, which supply âdriverâ type inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sherman and Guillery 1998</xref>) between DCN and VPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Yamawaki et al. 2021</xref>). However, this would not explain the significant narrowing of rate code tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This aspect might be better explained by local interconnected feedforward and feedback circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Temereanca and Simons 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Briggs and Usrey 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Pinault and DeschÃªnes 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Y.-T. Li et al. 2013</xref>). To disentangle how the neural circuits within the thalamus could contribute to the transformation of the neural coding, we manipulated the neuronal activity with optogenetic tools. It has been shown that parvalbumin positive inhibitory interneurons participate in improving feature selectivity in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">S.-H. Lee et al. 2012</xref>) and controlling temporal firing patterns in spinal dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Rankin et al. 2023</xref>). In rodents, sensory thalamus receives inhibitory drive from the thalamic reticular nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Martinez-Garcia et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Y. Li et al. 2020</xref>). Here, we paired <italic>in vivo</italic> optogenetic stimulation through fiber optics with extracellular recordings in thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To achieve bi-directional optogenetic manipulation of parvalbumin neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN-PV), we selectively expressed both excitatory Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and inhibitory Archaerhodopsin-3 (ArchT) in TRN-PV by using a double-transgenic strategy (<italic>PV-Cre</italic> Ã <italic>ChR2</italic>-EYFP, <italic>PV-Cre</italic> Ã <italic>ArchT</italic>-GFP, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). We first recorded TRN-PV and VPL neuron responses to blue light stimulation and to vibration stimuli paired with this optogenetic activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). We found that optogenetic activation of TRN-PV neurons did not alter temporal processing of vibration in VPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). However, inactivation of TRN-PV neurons in <italic>PV-Cre</italic> Ã <italic>ArchT</italic>-GFP mice, via yellow light stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>),contributed to the phase-locking probability of VPL neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). Note that the phase-locking probability never reached that of the brainstem level, which suggests that other mechanisms such as intrinsic synaptic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sherman and Guillery 1998</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">S.-H. Lee et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Y.-T.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that TRN-PV neurons are generally broadly tuned to vibration, and their inactivation can broaden VPL neuron tuning widths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3g</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). We deduced that TRN-PV neuronal activity sharpens VPL neuron frequency selectivity and contributes to the loss of temporal coding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e, f</xref>). Thus, the mechanism by which they achieve this is similar to the broad inhibition that sharpens feature selectivity in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">S.-H. Lee et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Y.-T.

First, the vibration frequency tuning of S1 neurons was determined using two photon calcium imaging in anesthetized <italic>CaMKII-tTA</italic> Ã <italic>TRE</italic>-GCaMP6s mice (see Methods). Subsequently, we characterized responses of the same S1 neurons to electrical stimulation (bipolar platinumâiridium electrodes) using matched frequencies of electrical pulses applied to the DCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). Microstimulation resulted in frequency selective tuning curves comparable to the tuning curves evoked by hindlimb vibration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). To compare the responses of both modalities we calculated two indices: a âtemporal coding indexâ (TCI, correlation of frequency tuning curves for vibration and electrical stimulation) and ârate coding indexâ (RCI, correlation of tuning curves to frequency invariant responses depending only on the number of pulses, see Methods). Equivalent experiments were then conducted with VPL stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d-e</xref>). TCI and RCI show that the neural coding within DCN and VPL can be fully distinguished as a non-overlapping distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f</xref>), which could be partly attributed to the heterogeneity of VPL response properties, and the amount of convergence/divergence in thalamic circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ahissar, Sosnik, and Haidarliu 2000</xref>). To further support this idea, microstimulation within the spinal dorsal column paired with frequency selectivity readout at DCN also showed that feedforward innervation from the periphery is mostly based on a temporal code (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). In conclusion, temporally precise microstimulation within the DCN, but not within the VPL, can reproduce S1 frequency tuning for vibration, confirming significant differences in the neural coding mechanisms in these two areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Perceptual relevance of temporal coding in the brainstem</title><p id="P11">Finally, we tested if DCN stimulation with high temporal precision could be perceived and thus potentially used for biomimetic feedback in neuroprosthetic devices. Because of the dense passage of fibers and the close proximity of nuclei involved in vital functions, such interventions have not yet been attempted. We therefore developed a new chronic stimulation method that allows us to target the DCN unilaterally (see Methods). Inspired by other cortical microstimulation tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Romo et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Callier et al. 2020</xref>), we trained mice (n = 5) to perform a frequency discrimination task from artificial sensory stimulation interleaved between vibration stimuli applied to the hind limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>, see Methods). All five mice learned to discriminate 200 Hz from 800 Hz vibration stimuli applied to the hindlimbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>) and were then, on test days, challenged to discriminate 200 Hz from 600 Hz electrical microstimulation applied to either the DCN or S1 on 20% of the trials, while the other 80% of trials remained vibrations applied to the hindlimb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a,c</xref>). On the first day that electrical stimulation was introduced, performance for electrical stimulation trials was at chance level for 4/5 animals. Two animals experienced DCN microstimulation first and three animals experienced S1 microstimulation first. After training with electrical microstimulation in both regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>), all five animals performed significantly better for DCN microstimulation compared to S1, suggesting mice were better able to relate the DCN electrical stimulation frequencies to the vibrations of the same frequency. These results are reinforced by the discrimination of only electrical stimuli by the same five mice as performance in response to DCN stimulation was significantly better than for S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e</xref> and legend). Most of the electrodes continued functioning even after two months of implantation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>). These results establish for the first time that mice can be chronically implanted with DCN electrodes by which frequency-specific stimulation can provide informative and robust signals for learning, which in most cases were better than cortical microstimulation in S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P12">In the current study, we identified a circuit mechanism for the emergence of feature-selective encoding from peripheral mechanoreceptors along the ascending neuraxis, with a main transformation step at the level of thalamus.

In this study, we show that thalamus contributes to the transformation of neural coding from a temporal to a rate code. Specifically, we demonstrate for the first time that thalamic reticular nucleus plays a crucial role in transforming vibrotactile temporal coding into a rate code. The role of this inhibitory thalamic circuit is reminiscent of how cortical parvalbumin-positive interneurons improve feature selectivity, or how corticothalamic feedback sharpens spatial tuning in the mouse visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Born et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">S.-H.

Our behavioral experiments show, for the first time, that mice could discriminate brainstem electrical microstimulation frequencies. However, despite mice being able to discriminate high-frequency vibrations with very high accuracy, performance for discriminating high-frequency electrical microstimulation was relatively poorer. Indeed, mouse performance was comparable to that previously demonstrated by a macaque in a similar microstimulation task, only when the electrode quality was lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Callier et al. 2020</xref>). This suggests higher quality electrodes that can be chronically implanted in the brainstem, are necessary to investigate the feasibility of a brainstem neural prosthetic device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Loutit and Potas 2020a</xref>). Nevertheless, Manipulation of temporal patterns of electrical pulses through microstimulation is readily achievable, and does not require characterization of detailed response properties, nor targeting of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Stieger et al. 2022</xref>). In addition, the previously reported place code in DCN, where somatotopy and tonotopy were jointly observed, could be advantageous for reliably targeting neurons encoding spatial and temporal features of somatosensory stimuli, analogous to the artificial cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">K.-S.

Because of the heterogeneity of thalamic response properties, the amount of convergence and divergence in downstream networks could complicate the effect of electrical stimulation. The hypothesis that activation of a frequency-tuned neuron directly links to perception of its preferred frequency could be directly tested by sensory mapping with two-photon calcium imaging combined with targeted multiphoton holographic optogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adesnik and Abdeladim 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Carrillo-Reid et al. 2019</xref>) or by using selective expression of channelrhodopsins such as a dual-protein switch system Cal-Light in the neural population responding to a targeted frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">D.

Mice were fixed on a bite bar with a snout clamp and rested on top of a heating pad. For viral expression at the brainstem, thalamus and cortex, the scalp was cut over the midline between the ears and eyes. After removing the dura, a bulk viral injection (400 to 800 nL) was administered with pulled and beveled glass pipettes (â15 Î¼m tip diameter) at an approximate rate of 20 nL/min into either, the gracile nucleus right next to the obex, the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus (2 mm lateral and 2 mm posterior to bregma; 3.5 mm below the dura), inferior colliculus (2 mm lateral and 0.5 mm posterior to lambda; 350 Î¼m below the dura), or the hindlimb representation of the primary somatosensory cortex (2 mm lateral and 0 mm anterior to bregma; 350 Î¼m below the dura). For a dense expression among the neural population, the injections consisted of AAV1.Syn.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40 (University of Pennsylvania, CS0939, titer 6.93 x 10<sup>13</sup>), AAV1.Syn.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 (University of Pennsylvania, CS0205, titer 3.22 x 10<sup>13</sup>), or AAVrg.Syn.jGCaMP7b.WPRE (Addgene, lot. no. v63074, titer 1 x 10<sup>13</sup>). For GCaMP expression in the DRG neurons, AAV5.CAG.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 (Addgene, lot. no. v20751, titer 3.2 x x 10<sup>13</sup>), or AAV1.CAG.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 (University of Pennsylvania, V3096TI-3, titer 2.33 x 10<sup>13</sup>) was directly injected (1000 to 3000 nL) into the lumbar enlargement in between T13 and L4 vertebrates.

In the end, the physiological results were not significantly different between different AAV serotypes and GCaMP variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">K.-S. Lee et al. 2023</xref>). For visualizing the process of injection, 0.1 Î¼L of 2% FastGreen was added into 5 Î¼L of the virus. After the end of each injection, the pipette was left in place for at least another 10 min before being retracted. After 3-8 weeks of expression and recovery, experiments could be conducted.</p><p id="P23">All imaging and electrophysiology experiments were surgically prepared under terminal anesthesia by inhalation of isoflurane (~2%) and the body temperature was maintained near 37 Â°C. For analgesia, buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg SC) was provided 15-20 min before the procedure, except for thalamus and cortex, where chronic preparation was employed. An additional dose of buprenorphine was given if the procedure exceeded 4 hours. The whole procedure was limited to 8 hours. For imaging of brain structures, a custom-made titanium head bar was fixed on the skull with a cyanoacrylate adhesive (ergo 5011, IBZ Industrie) and dental cement to allow subsequent head fixation.

A custom made titanium head bar was fixed on the skull with a cyanoacrylate adhesive (ergo 5011, IBZ Industrie) and dental cement. The head was fixed at approximately 45Â° downward. After the removal of dura and the skull above the posterior part of the cerebellum, Kwik-Sil was applied to the surface of the brainstem before a hand-cut wedge-shaped glass coverslip (150 Î¼m thickness) was placed over the brainstem. The glass window over the gracile nucleus was first stabilized by the pressure of a micromanipulator. The micromanipulator was removed after the cyanoacrylate glue and dental acrylic hardened. Due to the fact that the DCN of those animals with viral injection in thalamus or inferior colliculus will show neurons retrogradely labeled from their axonal terminals in these target areas, we performed DCN imaging in those animals to investigate the tuning properties of thalamic projection neurons and inferior colliculus projection neurons.</p><p id="P26">For thalamic and cortical imaging, survival surgery for window implantation was performed either right after viral injection or after 2-4 weeks of recovery period and viral expression. A craniotomy was performed over the target structures. For cortical imaging, two hand-cut glass coverslips (150 Î¼m thickness) matched to the shape of the craniotomy were glued together with optical adhesive (NOA 61, Norland Products).The lower glass was placed on top of the cortex, and the upper glass, which was larger than the craniotomy, was glued to the skull with cyanoacrylate adhesive and secured with dental cement. For the cortical imaging using transgenic mice, viral injections were skipped. For thalamic imaging, a gradient-index (GRIN) lens (Inscopix) was used instead of a glass coverslip.

In most of the recording in the deep brain areas, the electrode was coated with Dil (ThermoFisher) before insertion, for identification of the precise recording site.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Confocal imaging</title><p id="P42">Dissection of tissue was done under a fluorescent microscope (Leica M165FC). The expression pattern of GCaMP, ArchT or ChR2 was imaged by illuminating the dissected tissue with a blue LED light, with emission channels optimized for each fluorophore (GFP, or YFP), and subsequently imaged with confocal or two-photon microscopes. Confocal imaging was done using a ZEISS LSM 800 confocal microscope. Images were acquired using 405, 488, and 561 nm laser lines with emission channels optimized for each fluorophore (DAPI, GFP, DiI) while minimizing cross-talk between channels. Images were acquired at 512Ã512 with sampling resolution ranging from 0.15 to 1 Î¼m per pixel. Z-stacks were acquired using 0.5 to 5 Î¼m steps and the confocal pinhole was set to 1 AU. Colocalization was performed manually. The imaging data was analyzed using ImageJ (NIH).</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="S27"><title>Significant responses</title><p id="P43">For calcium imaging, ROIs were circular or drawn manually for the targeted neuronal structures in ImageJ (NIH). Fluorescence time-courses were computed as the mean of all pixels within the ROI at each time point, then extracted using Miji (Sage et al., n.d.), and finally synchronized with the stimulation. Evoked responses were computed as changes in fluorescence relative to baseline fluorescence. Frequency selectivity for individual neurons or nerve fibers was quantified by a previously reported method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">K.-S. Lee, Huang, and Fitzpatrick 2016</xref>). To computing tuning properties, the fluorescence signal was calculated as Îf/f=(fâf0)/f0, where f0 is the baseline fluorescence signal averaged over the 1 s period immediately before the start of the vibration stimulation and f is the fluorescence signal averaged over the first 1.5 s period after the start of the stimulation. Tuning curves were obtained by calculating the mean fluorescence signal (Îf/f) for each stimulation, and then fitting a polynomial curve to the resulting data. For electrophysiological recording, tuning curves were computed by the spike rate of the neurons. To ensure that we were recording from a single nerve fiber/neuron and to avoid the complications of spike sorting, we only sampled units with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) &gt; 5, when responding to a vibration stimulation (100 or 700 Hz). SNRs were calculated as the maximum amplitude of the mean spike waveform divided by the standard deviation of the background noise. There was no additional offline filtering performed for spike detection.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Tuning curve fitting</title><p id="P44">Neuronal structures were considered to be responsive if the maximum stimulus-related fluorescence response (Îf/f) or spiking responses to any stimulus was greater than 5% on average, and also greater than 2 standard deviations (SD) above the mean baseline fluorescence. In addition, we required that neurons responded at least 2 SD above baseline on at least 20% of the trials tested. The same criteria were used to identify neurons with significant responses to the vibration, optogenetic and electrical stimuli.</p><p id="P45">Neuronal structures were considered to be frequency selective if they were responsive and also met the following criteria: (1) well fit by the polynomial function (r &gt; 0.7, p &lt; 0.05), and (2) tuning index (<italic>TI</italic>) &gt; 0.2 <disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mo>Î¼</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>pref</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mo>Î¼</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ortho</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mo>Î¼</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>pref</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo>Î¼</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ortho</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P46">where Î¼<sub>pref</sub> denotes the mean response to the preferred stimulus frequency and Î¼<sub>ortho</sub> is the mean response to the least preferred stimulus frequency, defined by the curve fitting. To characterize a neuronâs tuning to vibration frequency, the normalized mean responses were fit to frequency by the polynomial curve fitting function (Matlab) using the method of non-linear least squares, with the degree of polynomial fit set at 6. The tuning preference of individual neurons was defined by the peak of the curve and the tuning width was defined by the half-width at the half-maximum of the curve (HWHM).</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Phase-locked spiking</title><p id="P47">To determine whether a nerve fiber or a neuron was entrained by the sinusoidal vibration, we calculated standardized inter-spike intervals. We chose this measure because it is immune to variability in response onset times across different stimulus repetitions. For a given vibration frequency, the inter-spike intervals (ISI) of all possible spike pairs that occurred during stimulation were calculated and grouped across stimulus repetitions. Because entrained spiking should yield an ISI distribution that peaks at integer multiples of the sinusoidal stimulus period <italic>T</italic>, values were converted to standardized inter-spike intervals (SISI) according to SISI = <italic>T</italic> + (ISI â <italic>nT</italic>), where <italic>nT</italic> is the integer multiple of <italic>T</italic> closest to ISI. Entrainment probability was defined as the percentage of ISIs in the [<italic>nT</italic> â <italic>T</italic>/12, <italic>nT</italic> + <italic>T</italic>/12] interval. Given that standardized ISIs are distributed between <italic>nT</italic> â <italic>T</italic>/2 and <italic>nT</italic> + <italic>T</italic>/2, entrainment probability should equal unity in the case of perfect entrainment and be equal to 1/6 in the case of chance entrainment. For each neuron and at each frequency we repeated the calculation of entrainment probability 1,999 times with randomly sampled ISIs (with replacement). We then measured whether the lower 99th percentile of the repeated measures was less than 1/6, which constitutes a one-tailed bootstrap test at significance level P &lt; 0.01. For complementary analysis of spiking regularity, we computed the coefficient of variation (CV), which is the standard deviation of the inter-spike intervals (ISI) divided by the mean ISI.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Temporal and rate coding index</title><p id="P48">Temporal coding index (TCI) and rate coding index (RCI) were computed for individual imaged neurons in S1 or in DCN by comparing their tuning curves to vibrotactile stimuli and electrical microstimulation of downstream brain areas. Temporal coding index (TCI) was defined as the reproducibility of the vibration-induced frequency tuning curve by temporally structured microstimulation, which mimics the spiking of the sensory afferents responding to vibration on the skin. TCI was defined as the correlation coefficient between tuning curves to vibration vs. microstimulation. On the other hand, rate coding index (RCI) was defined as the invariant responses from the microstimulation with various frequencies but with the same number of electrical pulses, which mimics the fixed number of spikes of the presynaptic inputs. In the case where the temporal precision is not critical and the response to the stimulation is only determined by the number of spikes, the neural responses of the postsynaptic neuron should be the same for all stimulation with different temporal patterns under the control of the inputsâ spiking rate. We considered the whole calcium trace following the stimulation as a response from the cortical neuron, as calcium imaging is empirically sensitive to the time scale in this range. <disp-formula id="FD2"><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P49">where <italic>Res</italic> denotes the responses to all four microstimulation patterns with different frequencies (30, 100, 300 Hz with equal periods, and 100 Hz jittered by Â±3 ms, from a uniform distribution) but with the same number of 15 pulses.

After surgical recovery, mice were placed under a water restriction regime (1ml/day) and habituated to the tunnel and head-fixation frame where they performed the task.</p><p id="P52">Mice were trained daily to discriminate vibration or electrical microstimulation at lower frequencies from stimuli at higher frequencies in two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) tasks. Each trial began with a 1-s hold period in which mice had to refrain from licking the reward ports. Licking of the reward ports resulted in resetting the 1-s interval. After the holding period, a 0.5 s stimulus was delivered as vibration to the hindlimbs applied through a flat plexiglass plate to the hindlimbs, or through electrodes implanted in the DCN or S1. A white noise auditory signal was applied over the stimulus period to mask the sound of vibration stimuli and act as a stimulus cue. A 2-s response window followed the stimulus presentation in which mice were trained to initiate licking of the left water port in response to lower frequencies and to the right water port in response to higher frequencies. To minimize a direction bias, the trial type was chosen pseudo-randomly by allowing a maximum of three trials of the same type in a row. Hit trials (correctly licking left for lower frequencies and right for higher frequencies) were rewarded by a drop of water and the immediate transition to a new trial. Miss trials (licks to the incorrect side) resulted in a timeout punishment of 2-4 seconds. If mice did not lick within the 2-s response window this resulted in a 2-s timeout. After the timeout period a new trial started with the hold period in which mice had to refrain from licking for 1-s.</p><p id="P53">Five mice (n = 5) were trained for 14-26 days on a 2AFC vibration task in which mice had to discriminate 200 Hz and 800 Hz.

These same five mice also completed an electrical only discrimination task in which they had to discriminate 200 Hz, 300 Hz, and 400 Hz from a 100 Hz standard.

White dashed lines indicate the boundaries of the left and right gracile nuclei. Mice were trained to discriminate vibration stimulation frequency pairs applied to the hindpaws. Comparison frequencies were 200 Hz and 800 Hz. Mice learned to discriminate 200 Hz and 800 Hz during training, and this was reduced to 200 Hz compared to 600 Hz during test days for the Vibration + Electrical stimulation task. Electrical stimulus probe trials of the same frequencies as for vibrations were introduced in 20% of stimulus presentations, randomly interleaved with the vibration trials. Electrical stimuli were applied to either the right DCN or left somatosensory cortex hindlimb region (S1). For probe trials, the licking choice task was the same as for training on vibration only. <bold>b,</bold> Learning curves represented as d-prime (dâ) calculated from hits and misses from mice discriminating between 200 Hz and 800 Hz hindlimb vibration stimulation, over training days. Testing commenced after mice reached dâ &gt; 1 (gray dashed line) over 100 consecutive trials. <bold>c,</bold> Dâ values showing how performance changed from the end of training on vibration stimuli (200 Hz vs 800 Hz) to the first day that mice experienced the interleaved electrical microstimulation trials (200 Hz vs 600 Hz).
