PP2A phosphatase holoenzymes containing the B55 family of regulatory B subunits (PP2A-B55) function as major CDK1-counteracting phosphatases during mitotic exit in mammals. However, the identification of the specific mitotic roles of these PP2A-B55 complexes has been hindered by the existence of multiple B55 isoforms. Here, through the generation of loss-of-function genetic mouse models for the two ubiquitous B55 isoforms (B55α and B55δ), we report that PP2A-B55 α/δ complexes display overlapping roles in controlling the dynamics of proper chromosome individualization and clustering during mitosis. In the absence of PP2A-B55α/δ activity, mitotic cells display increased chromosome individualization in the presence of enhanced phosphorylation and perichromosomal loading of Ki-67. These data provide experimental evidence for a new regulatory mechanism by which the balance between kinase and PP2A-B55 phosphatase activity controls the Ki-67-mediated spatial organization of the mass of chromosomes during mitosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cell division requires an ordered series of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events, which are regulated by both protein kinases and phosphatases. Entry into mitosis is triggered by the activation of Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), whose activity is controlled at multiple levels and regulated by several feedback loops <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Once active, CDK1-cyclin complexes phosphorylate over 1000 proteins and cause the major rearrangements that mark mitotic entry. Additional mitotic kinases, such as Aurora A, Aurora B or Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) support mitotic entry and progression by phosphorylating additional substrates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Proteolytic degradation of the CDK1-activating subunit cyclin B1during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition triggers mitotic exit. This event is accompanied by the dephosphorylation of mitotic substrates through the ordered activation of specific phosphatase complexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In budding yeast, the phosphatase Cdc14 plays a major role in counteracting Cdk-dependent phosphorylation and it is essential for mitotic exit. However, this function does not appear to be conserved in mammals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, and several phosphatases, mostly PP2A and PP1, have been involved in mitotic exit in higher eukaryotes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">PP2A is the major serine and threonine phosphatase in eukaryotic cells. In cells PP2A can exist in two complex types: a dimeric core enzyme consisting of a catalytic C subunit and a scaffold A subunit; and a heterotrimeric holoenzyme composed by the core dimer (A subunit + C subunit) in complex with a regulatory B subunit, which provides substrate specificity and subcellular localization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. In mammals, there are 4 different subfamilies of B regulatory subunits: B/B55, B’/ B56, B” and B”’, each one with multiple isoforms and with some splice variants within isoforms, which allow the formation of about 80 different PP2A configurations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Among them, PP2A in complexes with B regulatory subfamily isoforms (PP2A-B55) appears to be the main CDK1 counteracting phosphatase during mitotic exit. Knockdown of PP2A-B55 complexes by RNA interference delays nuclear envelope reformation and post-mitotic reassembly of the Golgi apparatus in human cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, and impairs dephosphorylation of CDK phosphosites and mitotic exit in mouse cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. More recently, it has become evident that CDK1 antagonizing phosphatases are equally important for the dynamics of mitotic entry. The discovery of Greatwall or Microtubule-Associated Serine-Threonine Like kinase (MASTL) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and its function as a specific PP2A-B55 inhibitor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, has further confirmed PP2A-B55 as a critical CDK-counteracting phosphatase, which must be downregulated to ensure the maintenance of a stable mitotic state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. However, the specific roles of PP2A-B55 phosphatases during mitosis are still poorly understood. This is partially due to the existence of four different isoforms of the PP2A subfamily of B regulatory subunits in mammals (B55α, B55β, B55γ and B55δ), encoded by 4 independent genes (<italic>PPP2R2A-D</italic>). B55α and B55δ are expressed in most tissues, but expression of B55β and B55γ is almost restricted to brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. These four isoforms display high sequence similarity, with around 90% of identity at the aminoacidic level. Although some functions have been attributed to specific B55 isoforms, it is not currently clear to what extent they perform isoform-specific functions in the cell cycle.</p><p id="P4">By using loss-of-function genetic mouse models of the two ubiquitous B55 isoforms (B55α and B55δ), we report here overlapping roles of these PP2A-B55 complexes for timely mitotic entry and exit.

We first generated a conditional knock-out (KO) mouse model for <italic>Ppp2r2a</italic>, the gene encoding B55α, in which exons 5-8 may be deleted upon expression of Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure.

We also generated a constitutive KO mouse model for B55δ, by targeting exon 3 of the mouse <italic>Ppp2r2d</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C-E</xref>).

Depletion of B55 was confirmed at the protein level in both models by Western-blot analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with isoformspecific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).

The balance between CDK activity and its counteracting phosphatase PP2A-B55 has been shown to be important both for mitotic entry and exit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. To first explore the kinetics of mitotic entry upon PP2A-B55 depletion, cells stably expressing histone H2B fused to red fluorescent protein (RFP) were synchronized in G0 by serum starvation, and then stimulated with serum to re-enter the cell cycle. Entry into mitosis was monitored by time-lapse microscopy, and no differences were observed in B55α KO or B55δ KO compared with wt cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B, C</xref>). However, cells lacking both B55α and B55δ, entered mitosis prematurely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2D</xref>). Despite this earlier entry into mitosis, the duration of mitosis (DOM) was prolonged in these B55α/δ KO cells, but not in single KOs (80.97 ± 4.53 min in B55α/δ KO vs 70.41 ± 4.25 min in B55δ, 71.96 ± 13.92 min in B55α and 64.70 ± 12.41 min in wt cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, although no delay was observed from nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) to metaphase, the timing from anaphase onset to nuclear envelope reformation (NER) was significantly increased in B55α/δ KO cells compared to control cells (47.7 ± 3.14 min in B55α/δ KO vs 34.73 ± 6.05 min in wt cells on average) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In agreement with these observations, mitotic segregation defects, such as misaligned or lagging chromosomes, were observed in all mutant genotypes, being slightly more frequently in B55α compared to B55δKO, and much more frequently and severe in B55α/δ KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D, E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Deletion of B55 induces chromosome scattering in the presence of nocodazole</title><p id="P8">To further investigate the defects observed during mitotic progression, we evaluated the robustness of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) in B55-deficient cells, by performing time-lapse microscopy in the presence of the microtubule depolymerizing poison nocodazole.</p><p id="P9">Both wt and B55-mutant cells displayed a significant arrest for about 9 ± 1h in prometaphase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). However, chromosomes were often scattered out of the main chromatin mass during the prometaphase arrest in B55-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The chromosome scattering phenotype was detected in about 27% of wt cells, more than 60% of B55α and B55δ single KOs, and in almost all cells doubly deficient for both B55 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Mitotic exit in the presence of nocodazole occurs through mitotic slippage, resulting in most cases in a single cell with one tetraploid nucleus or, in few cases, in one multinucleated cell in control cultures. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). Mononucleated cells after mitotic slippage were, however, observed only in about 25% of cells lacking either B55α or B55δ. In these single mutant cultures, about 50% of cells slipped out of mitosis as multinucleated cells, and the rest 25% died during mitosis, a cell fate that reached almost 80% in the combined depletion of B55α and B55δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3B</xref>). Given the high frequency of mitotic cell death in the B55α/δ double KO model, we focused on B55 single depletion models for further analysis of cell fate during mitotic slippage. In the presence of nocodazole, about 40% B55-deficient cells (41.43 ± 10.16 in B55α– and 35.75 ± 4.67 in B55δ–deficient cells) exited mitosis as a single cell with a large number of small micronuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Although micronuclei were also observed in about 20-25% wt cells, the number of micronuclei per cell was significantly higher in B55-mutant cells compared with wt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>), in correlation with the presence of chromosome scattering in these mutant cells. Thus, B55 regulates the arrangement of mitotic chromosomes in a microtubule-independent manner.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>PP2A-B55 regulates chromosome separation and Ki-67 accumulation at mitotic chromosomes</title><p id="P10">The chromosome scattering phenotype detected in B55-deficient cells might be due to repulsion between neighboring chromosomes during mitosis, which is regulated by the surfactant-like chromosome periphery protein Ki-67 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. To quantify the degree of chromosome separation, we measured the area occupied by chromosomes in nocodazole-arrested prometaphase cells. Indeed, the area occupied by chromosomes was significantly higher in B55δ KO than in control cells, suggesting excessive separation of chromosome in the absence of B55 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Prior work has shown that excessive separation between neighboring chromosomes can be induced by overexpressing Ki-67 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> which led us to investigate whether the chromosome separation phenotype caused by B55 depletion might be due to misregulated Ki-67 levels on chromosomes. Indeed, Ki-67 accumulated to elevated levels in the perichromosomal layer in B55δ KO cells compared with wt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that PP2A-B55 regulates Ki-67 levels on mitotic chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Effects of B55 depletion on chromosome scattering are dependent on Ki-67</title><p id="P11">Ki-67 is hyperphosphorylated in mitosis at least partially by CDK1, and this phosphorylation is required for Ki-67 accumulation at the chromosome periphery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Ki-67 interacts and targets the phosphatase PP1 to anaphase chromosomes to revert mitotic histone phosphorylation during mitotic exit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, PP1-binding is not required for its role in the assembly of the mitotic chromosome periphery, therefore, suggesting the involvement of other phosphatases.

In agreement with these observations, we detected increased levels of phosphorylated Ki-67 on condensed chromosomes in the absence of B55δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that the chromosome scattering phenotype of PP2A-B55 depletion might be caused through Ki-67 as a potential PP2A substrate.</p><p id="P12">We assessed whether Ki-67 is involved in the chromosome scattering phenotype induced by B55 depletion by transfecting B55δ KO MEFs with a siRNA against Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A,B</xref>).

Thus, B55 regulates chromosome individualization during mitosis through the modulation of Ki-67 levels at the chromosome periphery.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>PP2A-B55 regulates chromosome clustering in mitosis in human cells</title><p id="P13">To explore whether B55 also regulates the arrangement of mitotic chromosomes in human cells we next transfected Hela cells with siRNAs against human <italic>PPP2R2A</italic> (B55α) and <italic>PPP2R2D</italic> (B55δ) subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Upon nocodazole treatment we also detected chromosome scattering, although to a lesser extent than in mouse fibroblasts. Importantly, both B55α and B55δ single-depleted cells, as well as B55α/δ double-deficient ones, showed an increased frequency of this phenotype compared to scramble-transfected control cells, which was more significant in B55δ single knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast to MEFs, mitotic slippage did not result in mitotic exit as multinucleated cells, and most nocodazole-arrested Hela cells either died in mitosis or exited as tetraploid mononucleated cells to die in the next interphase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). To quantify the degree of chromosome clustering, we also measured the area occupied by chromosomes in nocodazole-arrested prometaphase Hela cells upon B55 depletion. In agreement with our data in MEFs, chromosome area was significantly higher in B55δ deficient cells compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Moreover, Ki-67 accumulation was also increased in B55δ depleted cells compared to control ones, suggesting a similar phenotype to the above described in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that PP2A-B55 phosphatases contribute to proper chromosome distance during mitosis by regulating Ki-67 levels at the chromosome surface.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">The role of PP2A-B55 phosphatases in mammalian mitosis has mostly been studied in the context of mitotic entry or exit. Although single depletion of B55α or B55δ does not affect the kinetics of entry into mitosis, combined depletion of both isoforms results in premature mitotic entry, indicating redundant roles for these two subunits in this mitotic function. This could explain why this phenotype has not been detected in previous genetic studies, in which single depletions were evaluated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. In contrast, depletion of B55δ is sufficient to induce premature mitotic entry in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts, probably due to the low expression of other isoforms in this cellular system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The requirement of PP2A for mitotic entry seems to be contradictory with our previous data on MASTL (Greatwall) being dispensable for mitotic entry in mouse cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, it has recently been reported that PP2A-B55 is also directly inhibited by CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of its catalytic subunit to promote mitotic entry in a MASTL independent manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, which could explain the requirement of PP2A but not of MASTL for this function. A similar redundancy between B55 isoforms is also detected in the timing of mitotic exit, since only combined deletion of both subunits results in a significant delay from anaphase onset until nuclear envelope reformation, in agreement with our previous data showing the requirement of both isoforms for dephosphorylation of CDK mitotic substrates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In contrast, single depletion of B55α was sufficient to delay mitotic exit in Hela cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, with no effect of B55δ. These differences could be due to isoform-specific functions or to the differential expression levels of those isoforms between cellular systems. Indeed, B55α appears to be the predominant isoform in many frequently-used human cell lines, whereas both B55α and B55δ are both similarly expressed in mouse cell lines, at least at the mRNA level (unpublished data). Thus, the different degree of redundancy detected between isoforms is thought to reflect variations in co-expression levels across different organisms and cellular systems.</p><p id="P15">Our data also show for the first time the requirement of PP2A-B55 phosphatases for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. While deletion of B55α or B55δ only induce relatively mild missegregation, combined depletion of both isoforms causes prominent missegregation. This mitotic function also seems to be conserved since anaphase defects in chromosome segregation have already been described in two mutants of Twins, the only B55 isoform present in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. The severe segregation defects that we observed in the double B55α/δ KO cells might be the consequence of a premature mitotic entry in these cells, possibly before completion of DNA replication thereby preventing complete separation of sister chromatids during anaphase. Segregation defects might also be the result of a direct role of PP2A-B55 complexes in chromatid segregation. Interestingly, PP2A-B55 phosphatase have been related with centriole assembly and duplication in other organisms, such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, and, more recently, with centrosome maintenance in prostate cancer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>; and it is well known that centrosome dynamics alterations during mitosis may also lead to chromosome mis-segregation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Considering the wide spectrum of identified CDK mitotic substrates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, a significant number of putative substrates of PP2A-B55 could participate in the regulation of all these processes, and further studies will be required to identify the most relevant ones in each mitotic phase.</p><p id="P16">Our data also reveal a novel function of PP2A-B55 phosphatase complexes in the regulation of chromosome separation during mitosis. In contrast to the previously discussed functions, B55α and B55δ display limited redundancy in this function. During mitosis, chromosomes undergo extensive structural changes, including chromosome condensation, global chromatin compaction, individualization of chromosomes and sister chromatid separation, which allow proper segregation into daughter cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Two studies have revealed that Ki-67 is required for the maintenance of spatially separated chromosome arms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. The long and highly charged Ki-67 protein promotes the individualization of chromosomes through surfactant-like properties acting as a repulsive layer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Recent data suggest that during mitotic exit Ki-67 promotes chromosome clustering rather than repulsion, as observed during early mitosis, contributing to the removal of cytoplasm during nuclear assembly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that both Ki-67 localization and chromosome separation are regulated by PP2A/B55. First, depletion of B55 correlates with increased phosphorylation and accumulation of Ki-67 at mitotic chromosomes in early mitosis. Second, the excessive separation of chromosomes in the scattering phenotype caused by deletion of B55 is suppressed by co-depletion of Ki-67. This is in agreement with a recent report showing that mitotic hyperphophorylation (presumably by CDK1) of the disordered repeat domains of Ki-67 generates alternating charge blocks and promotes their liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form the periphery of mitotic chromosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Based on all these data together, it is tempting to propose a working model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>) in which high CDK1 and low PP2A-B55 activities both contribute to promote Ki-67’s function as a surfactant-like protein on the chromosome surface in early phases of mitosis. During mitotic exit, the inactivation of CDK1 and increased activity of PP2A-B55 would lead to the dephosphorylation of Ki-67, reducing its repulsive activity to promote clustering, thereby favouring coordinated chromosome segregation and nuclear assembly during mitotic exit.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Genetically-modified mouse models</title><p id="P17">The <italic>Ppp2r2a</italic> knockout mouse model was generated by injecting the ES cell clone EPD0328_1_G08 (KOMP Repository) into C57BL/6J blastocysts.
