Nevertheless, certain aberrant methylation modifications can have lethal consequences. The mechanisms by which bacteria detect and respond to such damage remain incompletely understood. Here, we discover a highly conserved but previously uncharacterized transcription factor (Cada2), which orchestrates a methylation-dependent adaptive response in <italic>Caulobacter.</italic> This response operates independently of the SOS response, governs the expression of genes crucial for direct repair, and is essential for surviving methylation-induced damage. Our molecular investigation of Cada2 reveals a cysteine methylation-dependent post-translational modification and mode of action distinct from its <italic>E. coli</italic> counterpart, a trait conserved across all bacteria harboring a Cada2-like homolog instead. Extending across the bacterial kingdom, our findings support the notion of divergence and coevolution of adaptive response transcription factors and their corresponding sequence-specific DNA motifs. Despite this diversity, the ubiquitous prevalence of adaptive response regulators underscores the significance of a transcriptional switch, mediated by methylation post-translational modification, in driving a specific and essential bacterial DNA damage response.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>bacterial PTMs</kwd><kwd>post-translational modification</kwd><kwd>SOS response</kwd><kwd>Adaptive response</kwd><kwd>methylation damage</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>Caulobacter</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Information regarding biological processes is primarily encoded in the genomes of living organisms. Functional modalities are further enhanced via modulation of the epigenetic states of DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. For example, methylation of DNA occurs in organisms across all domains of life. In bacteria, physiological DNA methylations at N5-meC, N4-meC and N6-meA nucleotide positions play diverse functions ranging from defensive roles involving immunity against invasive genetic elements to regulatory roles in cell cycle and transcriptional control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. In contrast to these physiological modifications, certain types of methylations can be aberrant. DNA methylations on O6-meG and O4-meT positions act as a potent source of mutagenesis, while N3-meA, N1-meA and N3-meC block DNA replication and transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Bacteria cope with this threat of aberrant methylations via eliciting two DNA damage responses (DDR). The first response is the well-characterized and ubiquitously conserved SOS response that consists of two regulatory units, RecA and LexA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The transcriptional repressor LexA occupies <italic>lexA</italic> boxes present in the promoter regions of SOS genes and inhibits their expression. Upon DNA damage, an activated RecA nucleoprotein filament triggers the autocleavage of LexA leading to de-repression of the SOS response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Three distinct features are hallmarks of this response a). It is induced under all forms of DNA damage and is not specific to methylation damage alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], b). The response has leaky expression even in the absence of damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and c). The response can result in mutagenesis due to expression of translesion synthesis polymerases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Thus, SOS response induction is a trade-off between its essentiality and its cost.</p><p id="P4">A temporally delayed DDR subsequent to the SOS response, known as the adaptive response to methylation damage (or the Ada response) has also been reported in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. This response exhibits key distinguishing features compared to the SOS response: a). It is activated independent of the SOS response and is specific to methylation damage only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], b). The response is adaptive i.e., exposure to a sub-lethal dose of methylation damage encodes for memory that allows cells to adapt and survive formerly lethal levels of DNA methylation damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], c). The response exhibits bi-stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]; a subpopulation of cells do not induce the response even under continuous exposure to methylation damage, and d). Repair via this response is non-mutagenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].</p><p id="P5">The master regulator of this DDR is the methyltransferase EcAda, comprising of an AdaA domain in its N-terminus (which associates with ‘A’ and ‘B’ DNA boxes located upstream of EcAda-regulated promoters) and a C-terminal methyltransferase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. EcAda expression is tightly regulated, with only 0-2 molecules of Ada present in cells in the absence of damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Post-translational modification (PTM) via methylation of a conserved cysteine in N-Ada is crucial for activating EcAda as a transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Once activated, EcAda drives its own expression as well as expression of genes involved in direct repair of methylation lesions.</p><p id="P6">How prevalent is the risk of methylation damage, which could have resulted in the evolution of a methylation-specific DDR? Instances of encountering methylation DNA damage are not infrequent, and bacteria often face methylation stress. Intrinsic factors, such as insidious metabolic byproducts (e.g., lipid peroxidation) pose a prominent risk for DNA methylation damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Environmental factors including halocarbons and methylating agents produced by bacteria as instruments of inter-microbial warfare also contribute to this damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Additionally, infected mammalian cells subject invading bacteria to methylation stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. More recently, studies have reported instances where physiological DNA methyltransferases, which are otherwise innocuous, erroneously inflict methylation damage on genomic DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Thus, given the prevalence of methylation stress, it is likely that bacteria have evolved unique systems such as the Ada response to protect their genomes.</p><p id="P7">Intriguingly, despite the simultaneous discovery of the adaptive response to methylation damage alongside the SOS response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], our knowledge of this pathway is presently restricted only to the <italic>E. coli</italic> paradigm. Thus, the significance and conservation of a methylation-based PTM in the regulation of a damage-specific bacterial DDR remains unknown. Indeed, limited number of computational studies suggest only sporadic conservation of EcAda across the bacterial kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], and many bacteria, such as <italic>Caulobacter crescentus,</italic> are reported to lack an inducible adaptive response altogether [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>].</p><p id="P8">In this work, we discover a methylation-specific DDR in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, which showcases key features of an adaptive response. This pathway is regulated by a conserved but uncharacterized transcription factor <italic>ccna_03845</italic> (‘Cada2’ henceforth). Detailed molecular characterization reveals a novel sequence-specific DNA-binding domain in this protein, as well as a methylation-based PTM required for activation of Cada2 as a transcription factor in a manner that is distinct from its <italic>E. coli</italic> counterpart. Despite the contrasting mechanistic features of EcAda and Cada2, we observe remarkable similarities in the defining characteristics of the downstream response. Phylogenetic distribution of adaptive response regulatory proteins further reveals their widespread prevalence across the bacterial kingdom, with ubiquitous conservation of key residues required for methylation-based activation (either in an EcAda-like or Cada2-like form). Collectively, our work highlights the importance of a transcriptional switch mediated by methylation post-translational modification in activating an essential bacterial response to methylation DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A methylation-specific DNA damage response in Caulobacter</title><p id="P9">We undertook a comprehensive transcriptomic approach to identify whether <italic>Caulobacter</italic> induces an SOS-independent transcriptional response specific to methylation damage. For this, we treated <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cells with agents that predominantly induce one specific form of DNA damage (methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) a causative agent of methylation DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], mitomycin-C (MMC) that induces intra-strand crosslinks and mono-adducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], and norfloxacin that induces double-strand breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]). We collected samples at 0, 20 and 40 minutes post damage exposure for RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Our analysis revealed several genes that were induced in all conditions (‘universal’) and a set of genes that were specifically induced under MMS treatment, but in none of the other damaging conditions (methylation-specific) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We next asked whether the expression of these genes was independent of the SOS response. We subjected <italic>recA</italic> deleted cells to MMS treatment and carried out RNA sequencing in this background. Comparing wild type to <italic>recA</italic> deletion cells showed that the methylation damagespecific genes were induced in a <italic>recA</italic>-independent manner (SOS-independent) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In contrast, genes that were induced under all DNA damaging conditions in wild type background remain uninduced in <italic>recA</italic> deletion cells (SOS-dependent) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We identified <italic>ccna_00745</italic> to be the highest induced under methylation damage in the transcriptome analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). This gene is co-operonic with a second gene <italic>ccna_00746,</italic> that is also induced in a methylation DNA damage-specific manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). To further corroborate the RNA-seq observations, we constructed a fluorescence-based readout for promoter activity of these genes (P<italic><sub>ccna_00746</sub>-yfp</italic>). No significant expression of <italic>yfp</italic> was detected in the absence of damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We observed YFP expression from this construct only in cells treated with MMS, and not other DNA damaging agents MMC, Norfloxacin and hydroxyurea (HU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). We additionally utilized a second methylation damaging agent, streptozotocin (STZ), a naturally occurring antibiotic produced by <italic>Streptomyces achromogenes</italic> var. <italic>streptozoticus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. In this case as well, we observed YFP expression from the methylation damage-specific promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). These observations were distinct from those seen for a fluorescence reporter for the promoter of <italic>sidA,</italic> a known SOS-dependent gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], that has been reported to be induced under other types of DNA damage in a RecA-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Thus, <italic>Caulobacter</italic> elicits a transcriptional response to methylation damage that is independent of the SOS response.</p><p id="P12">We next investigated the temporal kinetics of the methylation-specific response in relation to the SOS response. For this, we carried out time-lapse imaging of cells carrying either the P<italic><sub>ccna_00746</sub>-yfp</italic> or the <italic>PsidA-yfp</italic> reporter after MMS exposure. We observed that expression of <italic>yfp</italic> from the methylation damage-specific promoter expression was delayed when compared to the SOS reporter, and succeeded the SOS response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Finally, we tested whether the induction kinetics of this response is adaptive. For this, we first exposed our promoter fusion strain to a low (0.5mM) dose of MMS. This led to only a modest increase in the expression of P<italic><sub>ccna_0746</sub>-yfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Consistent with an ‘adaptive’ response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] these pre-treated cells were able to induce P<italic><sub>ccna_00746</sub>-yfp</italic> significantly faster as compared to untreated cells upon exposure to a higher dose (1.5mM) of MMS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Together, the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> methylation damage-specific response showcases key features of an adaptive response to methylation damage as reported in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Based on these observations, we henceforth refer to this response as the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> adaptive response to methylation damage.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Caulobacter adaptive response to methylation damage is regulated by Cada2</title><p id="P13">Given the striking similarity between the adaptive responses of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> and <italic>E. coli,</italic> we wondered whether the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> response was regulated by an EcAda-like protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. While we could not identify any EcAda-like protein in <italic>Caulobacter</italic>, we observed that three adaptive response candidates <italic>(ccna_00746, ccna_03845</italic> and <italic>ccna_00725</italic>) possessed an Ada-like methyltransferase domain (PF01035) in their C-terminus region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Intriguingly, domains corresponding to N-Ada of EcAda protein (required for forming sequence-specific interactions with the cognate Ada promoters) were split between <italic>ccna_00746</italic> (with A box-binding domain) and <italic>ccna_03845</italic> (with B box-binding domain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We thus annotated these as <italic>‘cada’ (<bold>C</bold>aulobacter <bold>ada</bold>ptive response)</italic> genes <italic>cada1, cada2</italic> and <italic>cada3.</italic></p><p id="P14">Next, we asked whether Cada1, Cada2 or Cada3 regulated the adaptive response. We deleted all three <italic>cada</italic> genes individually and assessed the activity of the P<italic><sub>ccna_00746</sub>-yfp</italic> reporter. We found that only cells lacking <italic>cada2</italic> were unable to induce P<italic><sub>ccna_00746</sub>-yfp</italic> under methylation damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). In support, RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that other MMS-specific, RecA-independent genes were also not induced in cells lacking <italic>cada2</italic>, but were unaffected in cells lacking <italic>cada1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Thus, A-box containing Cada1 does not drive gene expression under the adaptive response, while Cada2 possessing solely the B-box binding domain is required for response activation. Cell survival upon exposure to the natural antibiotic streptozotocin was also significantly compromised in cells lacking <italic>cada2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), suggesting that the Cada2-dependent adaptive response to methylation damage was an essential DDR pathway in <italic>Caulobacter</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cada2 associates with adaptive response promoters in a sequence-specific manner</title><p id="P15">To determine whether Cada2 was directly responsible for the induction of the adaptive response genes under methylation damage, we performed ChIP-sequencing experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). For this, cells expressing <italic>cada2-3x-flag</italic> from its endogenous promoter were used. The flag-tagged strain resembled survival of wild type cells under methylation DNA damage and damage-dependent expression of Cada2 was detected via western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-B</xref>). Using this strain, we carried out ChIP-seq experiments in the presence or absence of methylation damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We estimated Cada2-3xFlag enrichment across the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> genome under damage using untagged wild type cells as control. This allowed us to identify bona fide Cada2-binding sites.</p><p id="P16">Under damage, we observed Cada2 enrichment at its own promoter as well as at other promoters of the adaptive response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C-D</xref>). This autoregulation of its own expression appears to be a conserved feature between EcAda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>] and Cada2. To further assess the methylation damage-dependent transcription of these genes, we performed ChIP-seq with flag-tagged RNA polymerase subunit C (RpoC-3xflag) construct. We did not observe localization of RpoC to the <italic>cada2-</italic>associated promoters in the absence of methylation damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C-D</xref>). Upon exposure to damage, RpoC signal could be detected at the <italic>cada2</italic> promoter, as well as other adaptive response promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C-D</xref>). ChIP-seq results overlapped significantly with the Cada2-dependent upregulated genes identified via RNA-seq manner (~83%). Superimposing the two datasets allowed us to describe the Cada2 regulon comprising six genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), most of which appear to have direct repair-associated activities.</p><p id="P17">We carried out MEME analysis of Cada2-bound regions to identify any sequence-specific DNA binding motifs. This revealed two sequences consistent across all promoters of the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> adaptive response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). One of these sequences, ‘GCAA’, was identical to the B-box sequence motif bound by the B-box binding domain of EcAda (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Thus, we annotate it as the B-box motif in case of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> as well. We did not detect an A-box sequence motif (‘AAT’, bound by EcAda A-box binding domain). We instead identified a second recurrent motif that was GC-rich (‘CGG’). We annotated this as ‘X-box’ sequence motif. These two sequence motifs were separated by a 3-base pair spacer which exhibited no recurrently conserved sequence, but seemed to be consistently AT-rich. Together, we annotated the B-box and X-box motif, separated by the AT-rich spacer as the Cada2 binding sequence motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To assess whether this sequence is required for Cada2-mediated regulation, we scrambled the complete sequence in our P<italic><sub>ccna_00746</sub>-yfp</italic> reporter construct. We found that such a reporter was no longer induced under methylation damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). We next asked whether an EcAda-like DNA binding motif comprising of an ‘A-box’ instead of the ‘X-box’ DNA motif could drive promoter activity by Cada2. Here too we observed that our reporter construct carrying an A and B box DNA motif was not responsive to methylation damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). This suggests that the newly identified B+X-box motif is essential for the induction of the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> adaptive response.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Cada2-like proteins are widespread and encode a novel DNA binding domain</title><p id="P19">The absence of the A-box DNA motif as well as the A-box protein domain in case of Cada2 led us to hypothesize that the X-box DNA motif must likely have a cognate DNA binding region in the Cada2 protein. We thus performed a comprehensive computational search for all Cada2-like methyltransferases across the bacterial kingdom. For this, we built a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] profile from a multiple-sequence alignment of Cada2-like proteins. As comparison, we followed the same process to identify EcAda-like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] and AdaA-like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] proteins as well. Phylogenomic distribution of these proteins across a curated, non-redundant database of diverse bacterial species showcased that they are abundant and widespread across all major bacterial phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>). Furthermore, Cada2-like proteins infrequently co-occurred with EcAda-like proteins in the same genome (~7%).</p><p id="P20">We zoomed into the DNA binding (regulatory) regions of EcAda and Cada2-like proteins to identify conserved and unique features. As anticipated, both classes of proteins encoded the B-box binding domain (marked by the conserved ‘SPHFQR’ amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>)). It is likely that this region associates with the B-box DNA motif, that can be found in both EcAda and Cada2 regulons. The two proteins deviated with regards to the A-box, with A-box (marked by the four cysteine residues) being conserved in all EcAda-like proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), but absent in all Cada2-like proteins. Instead, proximal to the putative B-box binding domain, Cada2-like proteins possessed a unique and highly conserved ‘RLHD’ sequence domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). We highlight here that the conservation of the RLHD domain is even more than that of the B-box. AlphaFold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>] model of the Cada2 protein predicted that this RLHD domain falls in a helix-turn-helix domain similar to the B-box binding domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In support of the significance of these putative DNA binding regions of Cada2, mutation of the conserved arginine (usually associated with DNA-binding) in both domains to an alanine residue (B-box <italic>cada2<sup>R68A</sup></italic> and RLHD-motif <italic>cada2<sup>R114A</sup></italic>) abrogated P<italic><sub>ccna_00746</sub>-yfp</italic> reporter activity under methylation damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). The two mutants were not compromised in expression and phenocopied the <italic>cada2</italic> deletion when assessed for survival under methylation damage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B-C</xref>). Promoter binding was also compromised in both mutants as seen from ChIP-qPCR experiments for Cada2 association at promoter regions of genes belonging to the Cada2 regulon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).

However, it is the methylation of Cys38 in the A-box binding domain that is required for its activation as a transcription factor via modulation of sequence-specific DNA binding affinity of EcAda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. While Cada2 lacks the A-box binding domain, it does possess the methyltransferase domain (in its C-terminus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Hence, we tested whether Cada2 is methylated post exposure to methylation DNA damage and whether this PTM is required for its activity.</p><p id="P25">Using mass spectrometry, we identified a methylation modification on a cysteine residue (Cys267, part of the ‘P<bold>C</bold>HR’ methyltransferase domain) of Cada2 in cells treated with methylation damage, with no detectable methylation in the absence of damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). We mutated the Cys267 residue to an alanine to disrupt the methylation modification. This mutant, <italic>cada2<sup>C267A</sup>,</italic> was unable to drive the induction of the P<italic><sub>ccna_00746</sub>-yfp</italic> reporter and phenocopied a <italic>cada2</italic> deletion under streptozotocin treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B, Fig. S4C</xref>).

We thus wondered whether there could be growth conditions where such a response must remain repressed. To test this, we subjected wild type and <italic>cada2<sup>C267G</sup></italic> mutant cells to MMC-treatment, an unrelated DNA damage condition where Cada2 activity is not essential and would ordinarily be in an ‘OFF’ state. In contrast to the growth advantage under methylation damage, we observed that <italic>cada2<sup>C267G</sup></italic> cells were considerably compromised in growth in comparison to wild type when exposed to MMC (that induces mono-adducts and intra-strand crosslinks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). While the molecular mechanism underlying this crosstalk warrants further investigation, these observations support the possibility that a PTM-based methylation specific transcriptional switch is important for Cada2 regulation, due to antagonistic effects associated with this response being mis-regulated in other stress conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Regulatory features of Cada2 are conserved across bacteria and distinct from the EcAda paradigm</title><p id="P28">Taken together, the following regulatory features constitute the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> adaptive response: a.

Cada2 protein N-terminus encodes B-box binding and RLHD domains, that enable it to interact with promoter regions in a sequence-specific manner. c. Cada2 protein C-terminus encodes a methyltransferase domain. Methylation of the conserved cysteine in this domain activates Cada2 as a transcription factor, likely via enabling interaction with RNA polymerase.</p><p id="P29">We asked how extrapolatable these observations would be across bacterial species. For this, we collated the presence or absence of the features listed above for a set of bacteria (including closely-related and unrelated) that carry either an EcAda-like or Cada2-like protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). To our surprise, we found that every organism that encoded an EcAda-like protein carried all the associated regulatory features for an <italic>E. coli</italic>-like adaptive response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>), while organisms with Cada2-like protein had regulatory features observed in case of the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> adaptive response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p><p id="P30">The conservation of the protein and promoter sequence across Cada2-like proteins motivated us to test whether these proteins are functionally inter-changeable. For this, we expressed a Cada2-like protein from <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> (Cada2<sup>myxo</sup>) in <italic>Caulobacter</italic> lacking its own <italic>cada2.</italic> Cada2<sup>myxo</sup> has overall low identity (44%) to the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> Cada2 protein, however, it shares high similarity in terms of conserved regulatory features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). As a control, we expressed EcAda in the same background to assess whether EcAda could complement the absence of Cada2. We found that Cada2<sup>myxo</sup> was able to fully complement the absence of <italic>Caulobacter cada2</italic> under methylation damage, as assessed by cell survival as well as promoter activity of P<italic><sub>ccna_00746</sub>-yfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>).

However, the Cada2<sup>myxo</sup> showed Cada2-specific activity and could not induce <italic>yfp</italic> expression from the EcAda reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>).

We further implicate a critical and conserved role for PTM-based activation of this class of bacterial transcription factors, albeit with varying mechanisms of action (Cada2 vs EcAda) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). We hypothesize that the organizational diversity observed across regulators of the adaptive response pathways are likely an adaptation to the physiological features of bacteria. The downstream adaptive response is, however, robust to this variability.</p><sec id="S10"><title>Diverse mechanisms, unifying function</title><p id="P32">The mechanistic differences between Cada2 and EcAda would suggest that the response dynamics would also be dissimilar. Cada2 and EcAda use distinct DNA binding domains to associate with their cognate promoters (B-box and ‘RLHD’ domains vs A and B-box binding domains respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. The two proteins are also activated as transcription factors in non-overlapping ways: In case of EcAda, methylation of the cysteine residue within the sequence-specific DNA-binding A-box domain activates it as a transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. In contrast, Cada2 activation occurs via PTM of the cysteine in its methyltransferase domain that is distally located from the sequence-specific DNA bindings domain. Furthermore, unlike EcAda, unmethylated Cada2 appears to form sequence-specific interactions with its own promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). Presence of electrostatic repulsion (as in EcAda) would hinder this interaction. This would suggest that Cada2 acts via an alternate, non-electrostatic mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Yet despite these contrasts, the response kinetics are invariant between the two organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). The adaptive response of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> is tightly regulated, showing low levels of expression (Ada OFF) in the absence of methylation DNA damage. Upon exposure to methylating agents, <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cells also elicit a delayed adaptive response, subsequent to the SOS response. Similar to the <italic>E. coli</italic> Ada response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> response exhibits bi-stability with a subpopulation of cells resembling expression of Ada OFF cells even in the presence of DNA methylation damage. Interestingly, the OFF population is abolished in a strain over-expressing Cada2, mirroring observations made in case of EcAda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The factors influencing the differences in the mechanisms of action of the response regulators, while retaining the defining features of the response itself are an important and exciting avenue for future investigations.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Requirement for a methylation damage-specific response in bacteria</title><p id="P34">How pervasive is the adaptive response to methylation damage? Our computational analysis reveals that the regulatory Ada methyltransferase is widely conserved, but it appears to have diverse domain organizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Given the apparent modularity of these domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that such diverse organizations arise as a result of domain-shuffling from a common ancestor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. Despite their prevalence, multiple regulators rarely occur on the same genome. A case in point is the comparison between EcAda and Cada2. We were able to detect only ~7% genomes possessing both proteins. The genomes that encoded both EcAda and Cada2 displayed varied and unique regulatory circuits, including autoregulation as well as crossregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>).</p><p id="P35">What drives the observed diversity? Comparison of EcAda and Cada2 might provide a compelling hypothesis. Both EcAda and Cada2 share the B-box motif in their cognate promoters. However, instead of the AT-rich A-box motif observed in the promoters of EcAda regulon genes, Cada2 binds to a GC-rich X-box motif. This correlates well with the GC-content of the genomes that encode these proteins. The GC-content of the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome is ~50% (low), while the GC-content of the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> genome is ~67% (high). This hypothesis is consistent with previous studies that have also suggested the interdependence of genome GC-content and presence/absence of specific DNA repair pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>].</p><p id="P36">Thus, it is likely that distinguishing physiological characteristics of bacteria warrant organizational adaptation and domain reorganizations of regulatory Ada methyltransferases. However, regardless of the diversity observed at a regulator level, the adaptive response-like pathways seem to retain certain characteristics as emphasized previously. In this context, we highlight the PTM-based transcriptional switch required for activation and regulation of the response. It is possible that costs (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>) or fitness advantages associated with this response serve as constraining forces that render this system robust to variations in regulator organization, and yet drive the retention of key regulatory features. Together, the conservation of bacterial adaptive response mechanisms, albeit in diverse regulatory forms, underscores the fundamental requirement for a dedicated methylationspecific DNA damage response.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p id="P37">All strains, plasmids and oligos used in this study are listed in Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1-S3</xref> respectively. <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> cells were grown at 30°C in Peptone Yeast Extract (PYE) media (0.2% peptone, 0.1% yeast extract and 0.06% MgSO4) and supplemented with antibiotics or inducers, as required, at suitable concentrations.

Protein-DNA complexes were then eluted twice from the beads by incubating the beads first with 150 μL of the elution buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS] at 65°C for 15 min, then with 100 μL of 1X TE buffer + 1% SDS for another 15 min at 65°C. The supernatant (the ChIP fraction) was then separated from the beads and further incubated at 65°C overnight to completely reverse the crosslink. The Input fraction was also de-crosslinked by incubation with 200 μL of 1X TE buffer + 1% SDS at 65°C overnight. DNA from the ChIP and input fraction were then purified using the PCR purification kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction, then eluted out in 40 μL water. Purified DNA was then made into libraries suitable for Illumina sequencing using the NEXT UltraII library preparation kit (NEB, UK). ChIP libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 at the Tufts University Genomics facility.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>ChIP-seq analysis</title><p id="P47">Raw reads for the ChIP-seq results were obtained as fastq files.
