These GF have been reported to have various physiological roles in development and organ regeneration ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). They have been described to signal <italic>in vivo</italic>, by binding to a ternary complex of type-I and type-II BMP or TGF-β receptor (called BMPR and TGF-βR respectively), which then activates a cascade of signaling pathways such as the canonical Smad pathway and other Smad-independent pathways. In the Smad pathway, the ternary complex of GF and receptors activates Smad 1/5/9 in response to BMP-2, and the Smad 2/3 with TGF-β, by undergoing a carboxy-terminal phosphorylation from the type-I receptor kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The phosphorylated Smads translocate and accumulate in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) and induce the transcription of several regulation genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The fact that the pSmad signaling is activated by BMP that has a major osteogenic role <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, led to the consideration of Smad as an essential marker of early bone regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Consequently, this pathway was extensively studied by the standard molecular techniques such as western blot, gene reporter assay under a specific promoter (like bioluminescence luciferase), and immunofluorescence. The western blot technique has the advantage of having a high sensitivity of the picogram order, and being selective in binding specific target antibody in the presence of heterogeneous mixture of several proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Similarly the gene reporter based on bioluminescence luciferase technique is characterized with a high sensitivity of the order of 10 femtogram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). However, these techniques have limitations in terms of their need for optimization steps, variation of signal quantification, in addition to the limitation of the number of samples in the case of western blot. Most importantly, these techniques measure the signal average across a population of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). On the other hand, the immunofluorescence technique is generally used for visualization purposes, since the quantification in experiments with several conditions is usually a tedious and lengthy task. However, this technique has the advantage of being compartment-specific and quantitative at a single-cell level. This characteristic could be particularly interesting in detecting phenotypic changes that affect subpopulation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The BMP and TGF-β Smad signaling is studied extensively, due to its association with several diseases such as Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive, Barret esophagus, leukemia and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Thus, pharmaceutical companies have been focusing on the discovery of new target molecules that can modulate their signaling, in an effort to develop new therapies. The modulation of BMP and TGF-β signaling can be done at different steps of their signaling, but it is mainly the receptor kinase inhibitors that have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Thus, our aim was first to develop a high-content screening assay to quantify pSmad intensity on the standard glass condition. Our second aim was to apply this assay to thin biomimetic coatings made of polylysine/hyaluronic acid (PLL/HA) previously developed in the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), and to optimize it to arise above the difficulties of doing cellular studies on biomaterials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Indeed, performing drug screening on biomaterials is not common, yet it has been recently applied to develop a human breast cancer model and hence investigate the effect of extracellular matrix in inducing drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). In that context, drug tests on biomaterials could reveal notable processes that could be masked on glass surfaces. Here, using C2C12 skeletal myoblast as a reference model for BMP-responsive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), we show a proof-of-concept with the receptor-kinase inhibitor drugs LDN-193189, inhibitor of the BMP type 1 receptors (ALK1, ALK2, ALK3, ALK6), as well as Galunisertib and Vactosertib, inhibitors of the TGFß type I receptor ALK5, on glass and biomaterials using the fluorescence-based pSmad assay.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Materials and reagents</title><p id="P6">Poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) and Poly(L-lysine) hydrobromide (PLL) were purchased from Sigma-Alrich (St Quentin Fallavier, France), and Sodium Hyaluronate (HA) from Lifecore medical (USA).

We started by optimizing the experimental conditions, notably cell culture, image acquisition and subsequent analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">FIG. 1</xref>) to be compatible with both our biomimetic films and the standard glass condition used for imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). For simplicity, sBMP-2 and sTGF-β1 designations will be used to indicate the soluble proteins used on glass surfaces, while bBMP-2 and bTGF-β1 will be used to designate the matrix-bound proteins loaded in the biomimetic films. For image acquisition and analysis, we used an automated imaging system (In Cell analyzer) adapted for high-content screening, as described in the materials and methods section. To quantify pSmad 1/5/9 in the nucleus, the raw image of the nuclei stained with DAPI was used to set a threshold in order to remove the background fluorescence and to select solely the nuclei. This analysis generates a “mask image” of the nuclei, which can be subtracted afterwards from the image of pSmad staining. As a result, a new image is created that shows solely pSmad staining inside the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">FIG.1.A</xref>). The nuclear intensity was then quantified using either InCarta®, which is the commercialized program of In Cell analyzer, or can be alteratively analyzed using the widely-used image analysis software ImageJ.</p><p id="P15">In a kinetic imuno-fluorescence assay, the cell fixation step is essential since cells need to be fixed at different timpe points throughout the experiment. Hence, we first optimized the experimental conditions using soluble BMP-2 (sBMP-2) and compared three different methods of cell fixation: 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) that is a commonly-used fixation protocol, 95% methanol and 40 mM citrate/60% acetone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">FIG.1.B</xref>). Immunofluorescence of pSmad 1/5/9 showed that pSmad signal was the highest for fixation with PFA4% and 95% methanol, in comparison to the citrate/acetone mixture. Next, we looked at several other parameters related to i) the possibility to do a kinetic experiment on the same plate, ii) to quantify cell adhesion via the cell number (nucleus labeling) and cell spreading area (actin staining of the cell cytoskeleton), iii) the need for a permeabilization step, iv) the the possibility to perform an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, since it is considered an early marker of differentiation in bone cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). The results are summarized in the table of <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">FIG.1.C</xref></bold>. Overall, a toxicity was found when using PFA for the kinetic assay on the same plate. We observed that the citrate/acetate solution is not compatible with pSmad staining, as also seen with the lower Smad intensity level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">FIG.1.A</xref>). In contrary, fixation with 95% methanol was compatible with pSmad staining and did not require a permeabilization step, but it affected the actin staining. Thus, we conclude that both PFA and methanol can be used to study pSmad signaling depending on the desired readout, PFA fixation being well adapted for studies at a single time-point, while methanol can be used for kinetic studies, but it is not suited for quantitative measurement of cell spreading area.</p><p id="P16">After defining the fixation conditions, we needed to optimize the imaging conditions, especially the type of antibodies for cells grown on the different types of supports (glass or tissue culture polystyrene, TCPS) without or with a film coating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">FIG. 2</xref>). We first compared the effect of two different fluorescent primary antibodies Alexa488 and Alexa555, and of two supports (glass, TCPS) on pSmad fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">FIG.2.A-B</xref>). pSmad 1/5/9 signaling was analyed for cells cultured for 1h with sBMP-2 at 400 ng/mL. We observed a higher pSmad intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">FIG.2.A</xref>) and a lower background intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">FIG.2.B</xref>) with Alexa555 in comparison to Alexa488. Moreover, the background intensity was lower on glass plates, which were chosen for their image clarity. Notably, the background intensity on films was lower when Alexa555 antibody was used for pSmad staining. As last step, we investigated the effect of the dilution level of the antibodies used for immunofluorescence. We thus used five dilutions of pSmad 1/5/9 primary antibody from 1/400 to 1/1200 and two dilutions of Alexa 555 secondary antibody (1/500 and 1/700) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">FIG.2.C</xref>). While we observed negligible differences in secondary antibody, the concentration of primary antibody slightly impacted the signal levels. Therefore, we selected an intermediate dilusion of 1/800 of primary antibody and a 1/500 dilution of secondary antibody as optimal dilutions, to perform the immunofluorescence test.</p><p id="P17">After selecting the preparation and imaging conditions, we performed a dose-response assay by adding sBMP-2 and sTGF-β1 to C2C12 cells that were pre-cultured for 24h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">FIG 3</xref>). After 1h of contact with sBMP-2 or sTGF-β1, the cells were fixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">FIG 3.A.</xref>). Cells in contact with sBMP-2 were stained for pSmad 1/5/9 while those in contact with sTGF-β1 were stained for pSmad2. As seen in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">FIG.3B</xref></bold>, a clear increase in intensity of pSmad 1/5/9 in the nucleus was visible when the concentration of sBMP-2 increased from 10<sup>-1</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> ng/mL. The control condition without BMP-2 (GM) was effectively negative. The pSmad intensity in the nucleus was subsequently quantified and the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) calculated, after performing a non-linear dose-response fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">FIG.3.C</xref>). The EC50 was determined to be 0.92 ± 0.06 ng/mL for sBMP-2 (equivalent to 0.2 ± 0.01 ng, when expressed in absolute mass) and 0.12 ± 0.01 ng/mL (corresponding to 0.02 ± 0.002 ng) for sTGF-β1.</p><p id="P18">These values are consistent with the literature data since a study reported the EC50 values, calculated using an AlphaLisa test in C2C12 to be 0.9 ± 0.1 ng/mL for BMP-2 and 0.052 ± 0.002 ng/mL for TGF-β1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). In addition, other studies determined using luciferase assay, the EC50 of BMP-4 to be 0.3 ng/mL in human cervical carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), and 2.4 ng/mL in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). If compared to BMP-4, the values of EC50 for BMP-2 appears to be comparable to literature data.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Kinetic of pSmad phosphorylation with soluble and matrix-bound BMP-2 and TGF-β1</title><p id="P19">After defining the optimal experimental parameters, we examined the kinetics of pSmad signaling with BMP-2 and TGF-β1 on both glass and film with the aim of defining the optimal time-window to perform the drug experiments. The kinetic experiments were done for cells cultured on glass plate with sBMP-2 and sTGF-β1, and for cells cultured on the biomimetic films with bBMP-2 and bTGF-β1. The cells were fixed at different time points ranging from 30 min up to 3 days and pSmads were quantified at each time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">FIG.4.A-B</xref>).</p><p id="P20">The pSmad intensities exhibited differences depending on the type of ligand (BMP-2 versus TGF-β1) and presentation mode of the ligand (soluble versus matrix-bound).

A second peak could be observed at 3h. Then pSmad nuclear signal remained sustained at 40% up to 24h, before retaining to basal level at 48h.</p><p id="P21">For cells on bBMP-2, the pSmad peak was sharp at ∼1h, before decreasing to ∼50% and remaining sustained up to 24h.

Then, the signal fully returned to its basal level at 48h, some minor oscillations being visible over time.</p><p id="P23">For bTGF-β, the first peak was at the same time point a for sTGF-β, but the second peak was less marked. A decrease to 25% was also fast and quickly observed at 1h30, then the signal was sustained until 8h, after which it returned to its basal level.</p><p id="P24">These results are compatible with the literature as kinetic studies of BMP-2 done by western blot showed the presence of a pSmad 1/5/8 signal after 30 min with a sustained signal up to 180 min on different types of biomaterials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Similarly, studies with TGF-β1 in different cell models showed the activation of pSmad 2 signaling after 30 min of TGF-β1 addition, and up to 8h in continuous ligand stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p><p id="P25">The presence of a sustained signal may be explained by the mechanism of Smad regulation of import and export to/from the nucleus. Indeed, it was reported that Smad 3 possess an NLS-like sequence in the MH1 domain, capable of binding a karyopherin (the importing β1) and hence induce its import to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).

We did not observe any effect on the Smad intensity signal for levels of DMSO up to 1%, which was the maximal concentration used in our assay, while 2% and 5% levels showed an important increase in Smad signaling.</p><p id="P30">For the film condition, we seeded the C2C12 cells directly on the biomimetic films loaded with bBMP-2 and bTGF-β1, and on the glass condition supplemented with sBMP-2 or sTGF-β1 simultaneously as described in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">FIG.3.A</xref></bold>. After quantification of Smad intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">FIG.3.B-C</xref>), we determined the EC50 values, which were similar for the glass and film conditions. The values of EC50 on glass are 120 ± 47 ng/mL (corresponding to 24.0 ± 9.4 ng) for sBMP-2, and 0.5 ± 0.16 ng/mL (equivalent to 0.1 ± 0.03 ng) for sTGF-β1. As for the film, the EC50 values were determined to be 288 ± 20 ng/mL (equivalent to 14.4 ± 1.0 ng) for bBMP-2, and 8 ± 2 ng/mL (corresponding to 0.4 ± 0.1 ng) for bTGF-β1. We note that the EC50 value of sBMP-2 when cell seeding and the protein is added simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">FIG.5.B-C</xref>) are higher than the EC50 value of sBMP-2 and sTGF-β1 when cell have adhered to 24h (0.2 ± 0.01 ng and 0.02 ± 0.002 ng, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">FIG.3.A</xref>).</p><p id="P31">These IC 50 values are in agreement with previous studies where the adhesion of C2C12 on the biomimetic films with bBMP-2 was studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). They showed that the presentation of the usage of biomimetic films and presenting BMP in a matrix-bound manner leads to a crosstalk between the BMPR and integrins that are responsible for the adhesion. They also showed that the cascade of events starts with BMP-2 binding to BMPR followed by integrin activation, before the Smad signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). We can thus hypothesize that the added BMP-2 when the cells have not yet adhered, are used in focal adhesion formation to ensure adhesion, in addition to the activation of BMPR to initiate pSmad signaling. We can also assume that a similar process involving integrin occurs when cells are seeded on glass. Hence, the adhesion process could explain the need for a higher quantity of protein when cells have not yet adhered in comparison to when the cells have already adhered.</p><p id="P32">After characterizing the cellular response to BMP-2 and TGF-β1 on biomaterials, we chose suitable concentrations higher than the EC50 values to do the drug experiments. We selected LDN-193189, one of the first discovered kinase inhibitor of Type I BMP receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), in addition to two ALK5 kinase inhibitors currently being developed in clinical trials for cancer: Galunisertib, which was stopped at phase 2 of clinical trials by the sponsor company, and Vactosertib which is currently in phase 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). The experiments were performed as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">FIG.5.D</xref></bold>. The drugs were added for 45 min, followed by cell fixation.</p><p id="P33">After quantification of the Smad signal, we were able to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). The results showed similar curves and IC50 values for both the film and glass conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">FIG.5.E</xref>). The IC50 for LDN-193189 is determined at 3.0 ± 0.03 nM and 2.7 ± 0.2 nM for glass and film respectively. While the IC50 of Vactosertib are 85 ± 12 nM and 118 ± 21 nM and Galunisertib are 1276 ± 79 nM and 1587 ± 552 nM <bold>(SI.FIG.2)</bold>, and for glass and film respectively.</p><p id="P34">In order to validate that our IC50 are not BMP concentration-dependent, we performed a drug assay with LDN-193189 and several concentrations of BMP-2. The results showed that the pSmad intensity is independent of the BMP-2 concentration <bold>(SI.FIG.3)</bold>. This result may be explained by the action mode of the inhibitors that inhibits the BMP and TGF-β signaling at the receptor level.</p><p id="P35">The data in the literature for the exact IC50 varies, as it is cellular and assay dependent. For instance, the manufacturer ’s reported IC50 values are 0.8 nM, 11 nM, and 56 nM for LDN-193189, Vactosertib, Galunisertib and respectively using <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays, commonly used in drug development. This kinase assay consists in measuring the kinase activity by determining the amount of radioactive ATP transferred to the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Furthermore, a study of pSmad 1/5/9 signaling inhibition with BMP-4 and LDN-193189 determined its IC50 to be 4.9 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). On the other hand, other studies have reported the IC50 of Galunisertib at 50 to 430 nM depending on the used assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Nevertheless, in our work the values of IC50 are similar for both film and glass conditions with the three drugs, indicating the robustness of the immunofluorescence assay and its application in different experimental conditions for soluble and matrix-bound proteins, on glass or on biomaterials. This also confirms that the drug is acting similarly and independently of the presentation mode of BMPs, which indicates that biomaterials could be used in future drug testing.</p><p id="P36">In order to determine the stability of our assay in performing high-throughput screens, we carried out a Z’ factor experiment, where LDN-193189 was added at a concentration of 100 nM and BMP-2 at 2 µg/mL and 400 ng/mL for the film and glass respectively. The study demonstrated a Z’ factor of 0.3 for glass and 0.6 for film. Since an acceptable assay has a Z’ factor around and higher than 0.5, we show here that our pSmad assay is adapted for high-content drug assays on both glass and biomaterials.</p><p id="P37">The similarity in IC50 values between the film and glass indicates that the film is comparable to the glass condition, which is commonly used as reference for <italic>in vitro</italic> drug testing. From our study, we can conclude that this optimized pSmad test is adapted to do high content drug screening on biomimetic materials, similarly to the standard glass condition. These results further show the possibility of future studies on biomaterials to investigate pathologies in a biomechanical context by modifying the biomimetics films’ stiffness.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P38">In this work, we present a high-content immunofluorescence assay to study the pSmad pathway for cells on glass and biomaterials. We show the optimization of the classic protocol to overcome the limitations of doing certain tests such as the kinetic tests on protein-loaded biomaterials. We also demonstrate a proof-of-concept of pSmad activity-based drugs assay on biomaterials. This assay may thus be further used on the biomimetic films containing other ECM proteins or growth factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>supplemental file</label><media xlink:href="EMS192786-supplement-supplemental_file.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d215aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S16"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Marie-Odile Fauvarque, Emmanuelle Soleilhac and Catherine Pillet for fruitful discussions and advices, notably regarding the drug assay experiments.
