These multiscale interactions have been difficult to measure and to simulate. Here we integrated CODEX multiplexed tissue imaging with multiscale modeling software, to model key action points that influence the outcome of T cell therapies with cancer. The initial phenotype of therapeutic T cells influences the ability of T cells to convert tumor cells to an inflammatory, anti-proliferative phenotype. This T cell phenotype could be preserved by structural reprogramming to facilitate continual tumor phenotype conversion and killing. One takeaway is that controlling the rate of cancer phenotype conversion is critical for control of tumor growth. The results suggest new design criteria and patient selection metrics for T cell therapies, call for a rethinking of T cell therapeutic implementation, and provide a foundation for synergistically integrating multiplexed imaging data with multiscale modeling of the cancer-immune interface.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Multiplexed tissue imaging</kwd><kwd>multiscale modeling</kwd><kwd>agent-based modeling</kwd><kwd>spatial biology</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>tumor cell phenotype</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>systems biology</kwd><kwd>computational analysis of tissue imaging data</kwd><kwd>cellular therapy</kwd><kwd><italic>Vivarium</italic></kwd><kwd>theory experiment cycle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Cancer is a complex system of interactions that unfold across molecular, cellular, and tissue scales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Adoptive T cell immunotherapy—in which patients are given T cells specific for cancer—causes a systems-level perturbation to cancer and has shown decisive clinical results in certain types of cancer but limited efficacy in solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ahmed et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fesnak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Johnson and June, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">June et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Neelapu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Restifo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Thistlethwaite et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Yee, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">2014</xref>). Indeed, much still needs to be learned about the manners by which infused cellular products cause effective therapeutic results. For instance, it is well understood that T cell phenotype matters, but how does cancer cell phenotype influence T cell therapy efficacy? Can infused T cells transform cancer phenotype, and is this related to T cell phenotype at the time of therapeutic delivery? Are there additional mechanisms for T cell phenotype maintenance related to their environment? How does the phenotype of the T cell product affect restructuring of the tumor tissue?</p><p id="P4">Such questions remain unanswered given the difficulty of interrogating the native cancer-immune state that provides sufficiently reflective biological measurements that would allow researchers to build models to simultaneously capture the multiple scales (molecular, cellular, tissue) of cancer. Single-cell measurement technologies have allowed characterization of molecular changes in intracellular processes but do not reveal the spatial features of intercellular interactions in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Galletti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Krishna et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, traditional histologic approaches can capture spatial features of cancer but is limited to only a few molecular markers at once—restricting the ability to co-define cell types or cell phenotypes <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Schietinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Stack et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Thul et al., 2017</xref>). Computational modeling has been largely restricted to a single biological scale for either description or source of input data, which limits the ability of modeling to accurately predict interactions across multiple scales. Consequently, methods are needed that can provide data that both deconstructs cancer’s interaction networks at multiple scales and that allows accurate modeling and reconstruction of such networks that allows testing predictions or hypotheses to be made.</p><p id="P5">Multiplexed imaging is a recently developed technology that enables deconstructing the complexity of tissues from the top-down with spatial features preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hickey et al., 2021a</xref>). The ability to probe more than 50 markers simultaneously using the CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) multiplexed imaging platform makes it possible to identify molecules, cell states, cell types, and network interactions in space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Goltsev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Schürch et al., 2020</xref>). The concurrent development of computational systems biology approaches has facilitated quantifying and identifying key network interactions from this data such as multicellular neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bhate et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Multiscale modeling is a complementary approach for discovering critical interactions, by reconstructing the complexity of tissues from the bottom-up with computational simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">An et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Makaryan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Norton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Swat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Talman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Vivarium</italic> is a recently introduced software tool that simplifies multiscale modeling, making it possible to connect modules of diverse mechanistic models into integrative simulations that cover multiple spatial and temporal scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Agmon et al., 2021</xref>). This enables leveraging extensive prior knowledge about relevant biological mechanisms that were measured separately, as demonstrated previously with the construction of spatial bacteria colony models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Skalnik et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We leveraged both CODEX multiplexed imaging and the <italic>Vivarium</italic> multiscale modeling software to understand the interactions of T cell therapies with cancer at multiple scales. To date, most studies have employed either top-down (deconstructing the data through analysis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fraietta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Vodnala et al., 2019</xref>) or bottom-up (reconstructing the data with mechanistic models) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cess and Finley, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jessica and Bagheri, 2021</xref>) approaches to the study of cancer. However, there is synergy in employing both approaches simultaneously to drive discovery of a more accurate tissue representation. As demonstrated here, multiscale modeling can be used to identify key points of the system for perturbation. Furthermore, information from multiplexed imaging feeds multiscale agent-based models by providing more accurate parameter values, initial states, and update rules.</p><p id="P8">By combining multiplexed imaging and multiscale modeling, we demonstrated that both tumor and T cell phenotype are key determinants of T cell therapeutic efficacy. T cell phenotype control has been a main focus to promote T cell longevity for killing cancer, with most approaches centering on intracellular molecular perturbation of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Blank et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gattinoni et al., 2017</xref>). Much less attention has been given to tumor phenotype. Here we observed that the conversion of tumor phenotype was a critical determinant in the control of cancer growth. Tumor phenotype conversion was dependent on a CD8+ T cell phenotype with ability to divide rapidly (memory-like) and secrete IFNγ (effector-like), suggesting this as a design criterion/goal for T cell therapies as well as a matching patient selection metric. The results suggest that integrating modeling approach with multiplexed imaging data can provide a roadmap towards such a goal.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Changing tumor phenotype to an inflammatory state enhances T cell recognition and killing</title><p id="P9">To understand the influence of tumor cell phenotype on T cell therapeutic efficacy, we evaluated how differences in tumor phenotype influenced killing by T cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. We incubated B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells with IFNγ overnight to induce intracellular signaling, which is known to be critical to function and phenotype of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hoekstra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sucker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Thibaut et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Williams et al., 2020</xref>). As shown by CyTOF analysis, there was a phenotype change in about half of the tumor cells—characterized by upregulation of both anti-inflammatory (PDL1) and inflammatory (H2Db) surface markers in the group treated with IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">These tumor cells express both anti-inflammatory and inflammatory molecules, but it was unclear whether this phenotype would inhibit T cell killing or promote more efficient killing. We performed a dynamic <italic>in vitro</italic> killing assay with a 1:1 ratio of cognate, antigen-specific (PMEL), activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and B16-F10 tumor cells or IFNγ-pretreated B16-F10 tumor cells. Despite equal growth rates for the two tumor phenotypes, IFNγ-treated tumors were killed much more effectively (50% vs. 7% at 13 hours) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To formulate a mechanistic explanation why this tumor phenotype conversion led to such enhanced killing, we created a multiscale agent-based model using <italic>Vivarium</italic>. The ability to create agents at multiple scales (e.g., molecular and cellular) governed by defined biological rules within a spatial environment can be used to test multiple hypotheses and detect critical inflection points in network structures and dynamics. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> illustrates how multiple biological scales of cell-state interactions is modelled with Vivarium with a simplified wiring diagram (left panel). The model was focused on interactions between two subsets of therapeutic T cells and the two subphenotypes of cancer cells. We modelled fundamental immune-tumor interactions in T cell therapy, for instance 1) PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells interaction with PDL1 on the surface of PDL1<sup>+</sup> MHCI<sup>+</sup> tumor cells, 2) PD1<sup>-</sup> T cells/PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells recognition of tumor cells through interactions of the TCR with MHCI on tumor cells wherein PD1<sup>-</sup> T cells can be converted to PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells through repeated stimulation of their TCR and 3) CD8+ T cells release of IFNγ, which then converts tumor cells to PDL1<sup>+</sup> MHCI<sup>+</sup> tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, right panel).</p><p id="P12">To create this model required encoding prior knowledge and lab-derived parameter values to create the rules governing individual cancer cells and T cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We additionally encoded intracellular and intercellular interactions in <italic>Vivarium</italic> and tuned the parameters by comparing process performance with expected behavior standards<italic>. Vivarium</italic> also enables environmental interaction such as migration and diffusion of molecules. Jupyter notebooks explaining the development and rationale behind the model are provided on the project’s GitHub repository, where example notebooks ran different permutations of the model for testing. A documented code base also describes the rules and parameters of the model and can be found in the Methods.</p><p id="P13">We then evaluated whether our <italic>in-silico</italic> model would show the expected higher T cell killing efficacy of an IFNγ-induced tumor phenotype. To accurately initialize our model, we measured <italic>in vitro</italic> levels of PD1, effector molecules involving killing (granzyme B, perforin), and IFNγ expression from restimulated PMEL CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells used for the <italic>in vitro</italic> killing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 3</xref>). Using these values, in addition to <italic>in vitro</italic>-measured PDL1 and MHCI expression by tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), as inputs to initialize both T cells and tumor cells in the model and ran modeling simulations that mimicked our <italic>in vitro</italic> killing assay setup.</p><p id="P14">To observe cellular behavior from the <italic>T cell killing</italic> simulation we plotted “snapshots” as output for the IFNγ-treated tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, time of each snapshot shown above starting with the initial state a 0 h to 13.5 h). This figure thus contains rich information across spatial, time, agent, and molecular dimensions, where T cell migration, tumor proliferation, tumor phenotype change, secretion of IFNγ, and tumor killing can be observed over the course of 13.5 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, larger circles indicate tumor cells and smaller circles indicate T cells, color represent the phenotype of a given cell type, and the red background color represents the local concentration of IFNγ). For instance, zooming in on the 5.8 h snapshot, there is a PD1+ T cell (green) interacting with a PDL1+ tumor cell (light blue) and several other tumor cells (upper left of zoomed figure) with no T cells next to them. In the next snapshot (7.7 h) this tumor cell has been killed and other tumor cells have not moved or been killed, while the T cells have all migrated. This zoomed-in area (5.8 h) also has a concentration of soluble IFNγ around 18 ng/mL with some variation in the grid squares. IFNγ has increased with the number of T cell and tumor cell interactions from a starting concentration of 0 at snapshot 0 h and decreases by the next snapshot (7.7 h) due to some T cells beginning to downregulate TCR and tumor uptake of soluble IFNγ. This led to a majority of the tumor cells changing phenotype, as can be noticed from 11.6 h to 13.5 h window (salmon color to light blue color).</p><p id="P15">We quantified the cytotoxicity in this simulation to compare with our <italic>in vitro</italic> data by evaluating the number of deaths and normalizing to a simulation with no T cells added. Quantification of killing by cytotoxicity indicated an important role of tumor phenotype on T cell killing even at early time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Consequently, starting with a population of tumor cells that have a PDL1+ MHCI+ phenotype has a large impact, potentially due to increased levels of interactions between tumor cells expressing higher levels of MHCI and T cells. In summary, with identical cognate T cell inputs but different cancer cell phenotype ratio inputs, as observed <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data demonstrated that conversion of tumor phenotype to an inflammatory state enhances the ability of T cells to kill tumor cells, resulting in fewer total cancer cells and an inflammatory microenvironment conducive to T cell killing.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Initial phenotype of the input therapeutic T cells drives conversion of tumor cells to an inflammatory phenotype</title><p id="P16">Controlling T cell phenotype during <italic>ex vivo</italic> expansion prior to therapeutic transfer is expected to be critical, especially since cells are in foreign environments for extended periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hickey et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kosmides et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Oh et al., 2015</xref>). Therapeutic T cell phenotype is known to cause dramatic differences in anti-tumor efficacy, especially from the perspective of T cell persistence and effector molecule expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Blank et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gattinoni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Henning et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Van der Leun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Speiser et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">2016</xref>). Broadly, memory T cells are expected to persist longer and give rise to more daughter cells, whereas effector cells are expected to be shorter-lived and secrete effector molecules like perforin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Farber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kaech and Cui, 2012</xref>). However, because T cells are usually isolated from subjects or dissociated from cancer tissues to be measured, the manners by which their phenotype relates to tumor phenotype, at the beginning and end of therapy, remain unknown.</p><p id="P17">One approach shown to generate T cells with these distinct phenotypes, is via inhibition of acetyl-CoA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Vodnala et al., 2019</xref>) by incubating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with 2-hydroxycitrate (2HC) during expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Inhibition of acetyl-CoA formation pushes T cells toward memory stemness resulting in significantly better tumor control than conventionally activated T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Vodnala et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, cells incubated <italic>in vitro</italic> with 2HC had lower expression of PD1<sup>+</sup> than the untreated cells (25% vs. 75% PD1<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Additional characterization by CyTOF showed further subphenotypes <italic>(Hickey et al cosubmitted)</italic>, but two main categories of memory and effector T cells were broadly separated by PD1 status, and we used these as inputs to our model.</p><p id="P18">We compared how these two phenotypes influence the ability of T cells to alter tumor cell phenotype under conditions found within the tumor microenvironment. For our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, the ratio of tumor to T cells was controlled; however, there are several barriers to entry into tumors <italic>in vivo</italic> (e.g., extracellular matrix, trafficking to non-tumor organ sites). Therefore, to create an accurate starting ratio of tumor to T cells in the tumor microenvironments, we transferred therapeutic T cells into mice bearing established B16-F10 tumors. This <italic>in vivo</italic> data showed that the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell frequency in these tumors was approximately 1% of all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P19">With biologically and therapeutically relevant initialization conditions for both phenotype and T cell ratio, we ran simulations with 1% CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (12 T cells to 1200 tumor cells) to compare our two differentially activated T cell phenotypes (with 2HC: 25% PD1<sup>+</sup>; without 2HC: 75% PD1<sup>+</sup>) as separate therapies over a period of 72 hours. Snapshots from the simulations show distinct dynamics of IFNγ secretion, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation, and tumor killing as well as different spatial phenomenon relating to tumor phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, Supplemental Videos 1-3). For example, tumor cells proliferated in all groups from 0 h to 31.5 h. T cells also proliferated by 31.5 h, started to kill tumor cells, and converted tumor cells to PDL1<sup>+</sup> phenotype in pockets (black arrows) for both 25% and 75% PD1<sup>+</sup> T cell conditions. These T cell pockets have higher local concentration of IFNγ (red/brown) than other areas of the tumor, and highest levels of IFNγ in the 25% PD1<sup>+</sup> T cell condition. By 73.3 h, the T cells killed enough tumor cells to coalesce into common pockets and escape the tumor bed (magnified area, bottom right of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Quantification of the simulations showed that the starting condition of 25% PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells inhibits tumor growth more effectively (~1000 tumor cells at 60 h) than the starting condition of 75% PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells (~3000 tumor cells at 60 h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Under conditions without T cells, the tumor cells grew exponentially (~5000 tumor cells at 60 h). These results were expected based on previous <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Vodnala et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P21">To explain the difference in tumor control <italic>in silico</italic>, we looked at the number of tumor cells killed in each of the conditions. Surprisingly, control of tumor growth was not explained by the number of T cell-induced killing events in the two conditions (25% PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells, ~1300 cell deaths at 60 h; 75% PD<sup>+</sup> T cells, ~1200 deaths at 60 h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 4A</xref>). Since tumor phenotype made a large functional difference in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and earlier simulations, we investigated the sub-phenotypes of tumor cells in these simulations. In the 25% PD1<sup>+</sup> T cell condition, there was an earlier (at 18 h indicated by black arrow) and stronger conversion of tumors from a proliferative to non-proliferating inflammatory phenotype than in the 75% PD1<sup>+</sup> T cell condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). This control was linked to increased numbers of PD1- T cells in the tumor, though in both conditions T cells became PD1+ over the course of the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 4B</xref>). Thus, greater tumor control from phenotype-switched T cells was due to greater ability to inhibit tumor proliferation rather than differences in inhibition from T cell direct killing.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>T cells induce tumor cell phenotype conversion <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P22">Our attempts to reconstruct the complexity of the system in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> models suggested the critical importance of a tumor phenotype transformation by T cells. To study this <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used CODEX multiplexed imaging to enable measurement of tumor phenotype changes in a spatial context in a therapeutically relevant adoptive T cell model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Black et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kennedy-Darling et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Vodnala et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, we transferred T cells that were treated or not with 2HC into B16F10 established tumors (day 10) and harvested them 3 days after treatment (day 13) for CODEX multiplexed imaging. Imaging was performed with a 42-antibody panel designed to detect cancer phenotypic markers (e.g., PDL1, H2Kb, H2Db, Ki67), immune cell-type-defining markers (e.g., CD3, CD4, CD8, F4/80), and functional markers (e.g., PD1, CD27) (<italic>Hickey et al. cosubmitted</italic>).</p><p id="P23">Because we observed spatial restriction of the T cells that was also associated with proximity to PDL1<sup>+</sup> MHCI<sup>+</sup> tumor cells within our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), we predicted we would see the same proximal events in our <italic>in vivo</italic> data. To compare results between <italic>in vivo</italic> and simulations we first examined the positions of T cells within tumor sections, since CODEX generates single-cell data that enables cell-type identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hickey et al., 2021b</xref>). Because of this we can visualize each individual cell in x and y coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Each individual cell contains the quantification of each protein marker and so we used this to gate T cells and PDL1<sup>+</sup> MHCI<sup>+</sup> tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). An analysis of the locations of T cells (TCRb<sup>+</sup> CD45<sup>+</sup>, red) and PDL1<sup>+</sup> MHCI<sup>+</sup> tumor cells (blue) in each tumor section revealed spatial restriction of the T cells and co-localization with inflamed tumor cells in both T cell conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), mirroring the Vivarium modeling prediction.</p><p id="P24">To further investigate this phenomenon, we compared the <italic>in vivo</italic> CODEX data and <italic>in silico</italic> modeling output by performing multicellular neighborhood analysis on our simulation data since both datasets preserve spatial features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Schürch et al., 2020</xref>). In the <italic>in silico</italic> data, there are neighborhoods representing borders of immune attack on the tumor from both T cell-treated groups, with larger borders in tumors treated with 25% PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells than 75% PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells and disorganized tumor neighborhoods in tumors without T cell treatment (compare 4E middle figure to rightmost). Here, the borders were enriched in both T cells and PDL1<sup>+</sup> MHCI<sup>+</sup> tumor cells. These features of the <italic>in silico</italic> models were consistent with major structural components in the <italic>in vivo</italic> data <italic>(Hickey et. al., co-submitted)</italic>, suggesting the important role of coordination of the neighborhood interactions, structure, and function. Moreover, co-localization of transformed T cells and tumor cells supports the hypothesis that T cells are responsible for tumor phenotype conversion <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P25">We also compared the cell-type percentages in the CODEX data with <italic>in silico</italic> percentages at day 3 to understand whether relative phenotype conversion rates were similar. We found good correlations of ending percentages for PDL1<sup>+</sup> tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>, R=0.91), PDL1<sup>-</sup> tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>, R=0.85), and PD1<sup>-</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>, R=0.97). However, this was not the case for PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells: The ratio of PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells to PD1<sup>-</sup> T cells was much greater in the <italic>in silico</italic> model than we observed in the CODEX multiplexed imaging data for the 25% PD1<sup>+</sup> T cell treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 5A</xref>). Because the death rate for PD1<sup>-</sup> T cells was lower than for the PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells in the <italic>in silico</italic> model, this suggests that death does not account for the ratio difference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 5B, C</xref>). This result suggests that there is a mechanism for T cell phenotype maintenance missing from our model.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Spatial location of T cells impacts ability to maintain phenotype</title><p id="P26">We hypothesized that discrepancies between our model and <italic>in vivo</italic> data provide an avenue to uncover biological mechanisms of T cell phenotype preservation by combining CODEX data with our multiscale model. Part of the reason we chose an agent-based model design is because it complements the spatial and compositional structure of CODEX multiplexed imaging. Since we quantify protein expression at the single-cell level with spatial coordinates that are linked to cell type, we can directly import our CODEX multiplexed imaging data as initial states of our multiscale simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). This uniquely allows us to use the model to interpret complex CODEX data, extend the dynamics of static multiplexed imaging data, and establish more accurate initial conditions.</p><p id="P27">We were particularly interested to see if initializing our simulations with spatial information obtained from <italic>in vivo</italic> data would reveal the reason that the ratio of PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells to PD1<sup>-</sup> T cells observed in the <italic>in-silico</italic> model was higher than in the CODEX multiplexed imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref>). We took a region of ~2000 cells from CODEX images to initialize our model, and then simulated the changes in the tumor microenvironment over 3 days. Tumor cell growth rates from each condition matched expectations and previous simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 6A-C</xref>). Similarly, we observed an exhaustion of the T cells in both T cell treatment conditions after about 50 hours; however, only in the 75% PD1<sup>+</sup> T cell-treated condition did all the T cells become exhausted, whereas in the 25% PD1<sup>+</sup> T cell-treated condition a proportion of PD1<sup>-</sup> T cells remained at 72 h (~250 PD1<sup>-</sup> T cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 6D</xref>). This contrasts with the results of our previous simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>), where both T cell treatments led to complete phenotype conversion to PD1<sup>+</sup> by the end of 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Since T cells become exhausted through chronic TCR stimulation, we hypothesized that a spatial relationship might be responsible for phenotype preservation. The snapshots from the simulations initialized with CODEX data revealed that in the <italic>in silico</italic> 25% PD1<sup>+</sup> T cell condition there is a front of attacking T cells on the periphery of the tumor and that the tumor cells on the border with these T cells are inflamed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). This can be seen by the increased IFNγ concentration at the edge of the periphery of the tumor (brown) and by zooming in on the interface of T cells and tumor cells at 30.8 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, blue square). In contrast, the T cells in the <italic>in silico</italic> 75% PD1<sup>+</sup> T cell condition initially attacked from the periphery but were soon surrounded by proliferating cancer cells seen at 30.8 h and remained so until 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, orange square). This suggests that the spatial location of T cells on the periphery of tumors may be critical for T cell phenotype maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Conversion of tumor cell phenotype is more critical for tumor control than T cell phenotype preservation</title><p id="P29">We hypothesized that since T cells were on the periphery of the tumor, they could escape chronic stimulation and thus delay exhaustion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). To test this, we initialized our simulations with 25% PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells conditions (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), except that T cells were located outside the tumor bed rather than inside. Like our CODEX-initialized experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), we observed tumor phenotype changes on the periphery of the tumor where tumor cells contacted T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, increase in light blue PDL1+ tumor cells). When the T cells were initialized outside the tumor, we saw a dramatic increase in total numbers of T cells compared to the numbers when T cells were initialized on the inside of the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). This increase resulted from a delay in T cell exhaustion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 7A, B</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Interestingly, despite the much higher numbers of T cells located outside the tumor, in our simulations, the tumors with T cells initialized outside the tumor grew more quickly than tumors with T cells initialized inside (~4500 cells vs. ~2500 cells at 75 h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 7C-E</xref>). Consequently, delay of T cell exhaustion came at the cost of enhanced early tumor growth rates, which even larger numbers of T cells were not able to overcome in the long run. Since resting preserves phenotype, but does not enhance tumor outcome, a mechanism for enhanced tumor control in metabolically treated T cells is missing from our model.</p><p id="P31">We speculated therefore that T cells could come from outside the tumor enabling founder T cells to reside in supportive microenvironments like the lymph node, while daughter cells migrate into the tumor. To test this hypothesis, we harvested lymph nodes from mice with tumors treated with 75% PD1+ T cells, 25% PD1+ T cells, or No T cells treated 3 days before. We then created a tissue array of all these lymph nodes and imaged them simultaneously with CODEX multiplexed imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). Comparing the median marker expression of PD1 for CD8+ T cells found in the lymph node to the CD8+ T cells in the tumor showed increased levels of PD1 in the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). This agrees with our hypothesis that founder T cells reside in protected lymph node environments sending daughter cells to tumors. However, we did not observe drastic differences of PD1 expression between treatment conditions and did not explain the discrepancy between treatments.</p><p id="P32">To see if the percentage of CD8+ T cells were different between the two conditions we segmented and clustered cell types in the CODEX lymph node datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>). This analysis showed that there were no differences in cell type percentages within the lymph nodes of both treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref>). Since we did not observe differences between conditions within the lymph node, perhaps this concept of supportive microenvironments for T cells extends to the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I</xref>). We propose that T cells actively build microenvironments within the tumor to support T cell phenotype and function. This led us to perform extensive studies evaluating the tumor microenvironment composition surrounding T cells and indicates immune cell supportive microenvironments provide critical support for productive T cell killing (<italic>Hickey et. al., cosubmitted</italic>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P33">We developed a scalable agent-based model of T cell therapy of tumors to complement, leverage, and probe CODEX multiplexed imaging datasets of T cell-treated tumors. We specifically explored the importance of tumor phenotype on T cell therapy efficacy by incorporating molecular switches of cellular phenotype and function that led to tissue-level phenomena in our data-informed multiscale agent-based model. We then used findings from the simulations to guide design of an <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment and choice of antibodies for use in CODEX imaging to catalog cell types and transitions we saw within our models. This synergistic back-and-forth of model and data across biological scales revealed critical design components of effective T cell therapies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P34">The results indicated that tumor phenotype considerably influences the ability of T cells to control tumor cell growth through inhibiting proliferation and increasing killing. Most recent work has focused on controlling T cell phenotype for both the secretion of killing molecules and self-preservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Blank et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gattinoni et al., 2017</xref>). We found that T cell phenotype also impacts its ability to change tumor phenotype, and a focus on converting tumor phenotype results in greater control than minimizing T cell exhaustion.</p><p id="P35">Comparing <italic>in silico</italic> results to CODEX multiplexed imaging reinforced the importance of T cell phenotype and influence on tumor phenotype; however, CODEX data indicated that T cells were able to change tumor phenotype and minimize T cell exhaustion. Most methods of analysis of T cell phenotype preservation are focused on molecular mechanisms of control since most assays require dissociation of tumors or <italic>ex vivo</italic> manipulation of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Galletti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Krishna et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, both multiscale modeling and multiplexed imaging preserve spatial features of the data, and our spatial analysis of CODEX and <italic>in silico</italic> experiments demonstrated that the spatial positioning of T cells influenced T cell phenotype. In the comparison to CODEX data, this suggested that our model was missing a mechanism for T cell phenotype preservation.</p><p id="P36">This incongruence motivated parallel research on T cell therapies, where we observed that therapeutic T cell phenotype changes the structure and cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment <italic>(Hickey et. al., cosubmitted)</italic>. We found in this other work that T cells create distinct multicellular neighborhoods based on their phenotype and molecular expression profiles. For example, 2HC T cell treated tumors result in more productive T cell and tumor neighborhoods, whereas T cells not treated with 2HC secrete more anti-inflammatory cytokines and have T cell and tumor areas also enriched with regulatory neighborhoods. Thus, T cells should be engineered with the ability to transform tumor cell phenotype and to be agents of structural change of the tumor microenvironment.</p><p id="P37">In future work, driven by molecular data acquired through multiplexed tissue imaging, the model should be expanded to include other cell types and anti-inflammatory molecules. Since the <italic>Vivarium</italic> framework for multiscale modeling is modular and compositional, it will be straightforward to add additional cell types with different representations of internal mechanisms and environmental interactions. Not straightforward are the selection of molecular features and phenotypes that will increase the accuracy of the model under a broader range of conditions. Although we have some clues about missing components from our CODEX and RNA dataset (<italic>Hickey et. al., cosubmitted</italic>), additional data collection will be needed. For example, single-cell RNA sequencing of the cell types within the tumor will shed light on key molecular and cellular interactions. Building this complexity within <italic>in silico</italic> models will be necessary because as the number of intercellular connections are increased, it will become more difficult to recapitulate and deconvolute these networks within <italic>in vitro</italic> systems.</p><p id="P38">The modularity of the model will enable our group and others to build from this starting point to investigate the effects of various T cell-based therapies in solid tumors. Integration of models and measurements across biological scales with spatial features preserved will enable decoding of the rules that govern complex networks from biological and clinical samples. We and others can leverage this model as a template for integrating and using the growing number of spatial datasets, like CODEX imaging datasets, in other disease settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Consortium, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hickey et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 2020</xref>). Integration of multiscale modeling and imaging data will enable better interpretation through leave-one-out experiments and ensemble simulations while simultaneously increasing the complexity and accuracy of agent-based models.

Each cell type has an associated <italic>Vivarium</italic> process that represents the mechanisms that make a cell switch between phenotypes. These processes define fundamental rules that govern cellular interactions with the other cell types and with the inputs it receives from the environment. The tumor process is focused on two phenotypic states: proliferative with low levels of immune molecules (MHCI and PDL1) and quiescent with high levels of immune molecules (MHCI and PDL1). Its transition from the proliferative state is dependent on the level of IFNγ secreted by T cells. Both tumor types can be killed by receiving cytotoxic packets from the T cells. The T cell process is focused on two phenotypic states. The PD1<sup>-</sup> T cells secrete larger amounts of immune molecules (IFNγ and cytotoxic packets) than PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells. These immune molecules impact the state and death of tumor cells. The transition from the PD1<sup>-</sup> state to the PD1<sup>+</sup> state is dependent on the length of time the T cell is engaged with tumor cells.

larger tissue structures and organs. At the cellular scale, cells engage with each other through intermolecular interactions, and intracellular interactions mediate cellular function. B) CODEX imaging enables multiplexed molecular measurements of 50 or more proteins that can be quantified at a single-cell level. These molecular profiles can be used to define both cell types and states. Using the spatial features of the data, multicellular structures can be identified based on conserved composition. Finally, network interactions across these scales can be interpreted to fully <underline>deconstruct</underline> the complexity of a tissue. C) Multiscale modeling enables <underline>reconstruction</underline> of complex biology across scales. Models are defined by molecular rules for cell agents that facilitate interactions. These interactions happen within a spatial microenvironment that result in emergent biological behavior.
