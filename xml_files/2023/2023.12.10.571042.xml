The persistence and accumulation of senescent cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic autoimmune disease in which loss of immune tolerance and systemic autoimmunity precedes clinical onset of disease. Lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs) are important regulators of immune tolerance. Accordingly, accumulating senescent LNSCs may potentially lead to defective immune tolerance and the development of systemic autoimmune disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P2">Human LNSCs were isolated and cultured from inguinal lymph node needle biopsies from individuals at risk of developing RA (RA-risk individuals), RA patients and seronegative healthy volunteers. Senescence hallmarks and the effect of dasatinib treatment were assessed using quantitative PCR, flow cytometry, microscopy and live-cell imaging.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results</title><p id="P3">Cell size, granularity and autofluorescence were significantly higher in RA LNSCs compared with control LNSCs. Stainings indicate more senescence associated β-galactosidase activity, more lipofuscin positive granules and increased DNA damage in RA-risk and RA LNSCs compared with control LNSCs. Moreover, we found altered gene expression levels of senescence associated genes in LNSCs from RA patients. Strikingly, the capacity to repair irradiation induced DNA damage was significantly lower in RA-risk and RA LNSCs compared with control LNSCs. Treating LNSCs with dasatinib significantly improved cell size and DNA repair capacity of cultured LNSCs.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P4">We observed multiple senescent hallmarks in RA LNSCs and to lesser extent already in RA-risk LNSCs, which could partly be restored by dasatinib treatment.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Autoimmunity</kwd><kwd>RA-risk individuals</kwd><kwd>lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs)</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S5" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">Aging and age-related diseases have become more prevalent since the average human life span has drastically increased. One hallmark of aging is the accumulation of senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). These cells are in a state in which they are viable and metabolically active yet do not proliferate. Cellular senescence can be described as an emergency brake on cells that allows for proper repair during cell cycle arrest to prevent them from tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). However, the persistence and accumulation of senescent cells can cause tissue imbalance and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Aging is an important risk factor of RA, a systemic chronic autoimmune disease in which immune cells infiltrate synovial tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Age-associated changes in immune function contribute to cellular senescence and create a pro-inflammatory microenvironment which might accelerate disease progression in RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Previous studies have defined premature aging of T cells in RA patients and showed that maladaptive aging of T cells contributes to the development of autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that synovial fibroblasts from RA patients display pro-inflammatory and senescent characteristics and accumulate in synovial tissues compared with age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). These studies show that senescence in RA is not limited to one cell type. As most studies have been performed using tissues of patients with established disease, it is unclear whether senescence is a primary cause of RA or secondary to chronic inflammation.</p><p id="P7">In the absence of synovial inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), RA-specific autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) can be present years before clinical manifestation of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). This allows the identification of individuals at risk of developing RA (RA-risk) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) and enables studies on the preclinical phase of disease in absence of inflammation. Because systemic autoimmunity apparently precedes synovial tissue inflammation, it is hypothesized that other unidentified immune processes, possibly outside the synovium, are altered and contribute to disease development. Because autoimmunity can develop when tolerance mechanisms are not properly controlled in secondary lymphoid organs, this might be a location of interest to study the at-risk phase of RA. In secondary lymphoid organs, such as peripheral lymph nodes (LNs), the modulation of effective immune responses and the regulation of peripheral tolerance depend on the proper functioning of lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Previously, we have shown that LN fibroblasts from patients with RA have a reduced capacity to respond to external triggers like TLR-3 and TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). We hypothesize that during the development of RA, LNSCs might exhibit a senescent phenotype and accumulate prematurely in lymphoid organs which can potentially lead to defective peripheral tolerance, improper control of immune responses and the development of systemic autoimmune disease.</p><p id="P8">To date, the aetiology of RA remains unclear and despite current treatment options are able to suppress inflammation and join pain, curative treatment does not exist. To target senescent cells there are several senolytic agents that selectively eliminate senescent cells by inducing apoptosis. Dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown to attenuate arthritis symptoms in murine collagen-induced arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Additionally, <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured synovial fibroblasts from RA patients showed decreased proliferation and migration capacity upon dasatinib treatment. Moreover, dasatinib treatment led to a significant increase in apoptosis of synovial fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Transcriptional analysis comparing peripheral blood derived T cells from RA patients and age-matched healthy controls showed that ephrin B1 (<italic>EFNB1</italic>), a tyrosine kinase ligand targeted by dasatinib, was elevated in RA patients. Furthermore, <italic>EFNB1</italic> expression correlated with RA symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), making dasatinib an interesting drug for potential future therapies. In this study we investigated the senescence phenotype of LN fibroblasts (referred to as LNSCs) during health, systemic autoimmunity and RA. Additionally, we examined whether dasatinib treatment could restore their cellular phenotype and function.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Study subjects and tissue samples</title><p id="P9">Individuals with arthralgia and/or a family history of RA who were positive for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies and without any evidence of arthritis upon examination were included. These individuals were considered to be at risk of developing RA (RA-risk individuals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). For comparison, we included patients diagnosed with RA and aged-matched seronegative healthy volunteers. LN tissues were collected by ultrasound-guided inguinal LN needle core biopsy as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) after which LNSCs were isolated and expanded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). The study was performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Amsterdam UMC and all study subjects gave their written informed consent. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> shows the demographics of the included study subjects.

Flow cytometry gating strategy used to identify LNSCs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>. Quantitative analysis of LNSCs <italic>ex vivo</italic> revealed that RA LNSCs are significantly larger compared with control LNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Cell size of LNSCs from RA-risk individuals was numerically, but non-significantly, higher compared with control LNSCs. Cell granularity was not significantly different between diagnoses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). This data suggests that morphological alterations can be observed in LNSCs directly <italic>ex vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P11">Additionally, <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured LNSCs from RA patients and RA-risk individuals also showed morphological differences when compared with control LNSCs on both microscopic images as well as spectral flow cytometry plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d, e</xref>). Flow cytometry measurements of unstained LNSCs show that RA LNSCs harbor a significantly larger cell size and higher granularity compared with control LNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f, g</xref>). Immunofluorescent stainings, did not show any significant differences in nuclear size between donor groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref>). Increased autofluorescence was recently discussed as reliable senescence marker for <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured human mesenchymal stromal cells as it correlates with multiple established senescence markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). In our cohort, autofluorescence in FITC channel was significantly higher in RA LNSCs compared with control LNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1i</xref>). Autofluorescence was detected at similar levels in other fluorescent channels (data not shown). Altogether, this data revealed that the <italic>ex vivo</italic> increase in cell size is maintained during LNSC culture allowing functional <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to assess additional senescence hallmarks.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Increased lysosomal content in RA(-risk) LNSCs</title><p id="P12">We next evaluated lysosomal content of cultured LNSCs by measuring the activity senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), a lysosomal enzyme. Cultured LNSCs were defined SA-β-gal positive at a cut off intensity according to the Senescence Counter macro in ImageJ as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2a</xref>. Hardly any positive cells were detected in control LNSCs, whereas RA LNSCs displayed a relatively high percentage of blue stained cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). Image quantification showed that SA-β-gal activity was significantly higher in RA LNSCs and numerically higher in RA-risk LNSCs compared with control LNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Morphological alterations partially restored by dasatinib treatment</title><p id="P13">Because we detected relatively high SA-β-gal positivity in cultured LNSCs, we decided to investigate whether LNSCs are sensitive to senolytics that specifically target senescent cells. The most studied senolytic in fibroblasts is Navitoclax, which induces apoptosis by targeting the anti-apoptotic pathways of BCL2 and BCL-xL. However, titration experiments in LNSCs did not show any effect on cell viability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1a</xref>), suggesting that LNSCs are not sensitive for Navitoclax. In line with this, mRNA levels of <italic>BCL2L1</italic> (encoding for Bcl-xL) was not differentially expressed between donor groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1b</xref>). The senolytic piperlongumine decreased cell viability in both control and RA LNSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1c</xref>), making it an unsuitable drug to target altered LNSCs in RA patients and quercetin did not show any effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1d</xref>). In contrast, dasatinib, reported to effectively remove senescent pre-adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), did reduce cell viability only in RA LNSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1e</xref>). Dasatinib is often used in combination with quercetin, but we did not detect an additional drop in cell viability after combining the two senolytic drugs (data not shown). Dasatinib interferes with ephrin B1 (EFNB1), an ephrin dependent receptor ligand, which was non-significantly higher expressed in RA LNSCs compared with control LNSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1f</xref>). Guided by these findings, showing a selective effect of dasatinib treatment on RA LNSCs, we next investigated the effect of dasatinib treatment on cell morphology.</p><p id="P14">To selectively eliminate senescent cells, cultured RA-risk and RA LNSCs were treated with 5µM dasatinib for 24h. Subsequently, dasatinib was washed away after which remaining cells were given the time to proliferate until confluence of the untreated cells, followed by cell harvest and analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). To demonstrate the functional effect of dasatinib on senescent cells, healthy LNSCs were irradiated before treatment which, as expected, led to a significant increase in cell and nuclear size and a numerical increase in cell granularity and autofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3b, c, d, e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2</xref>). Dasatinib treatment partly restored the morphological alterations observed in RA-risk and RA patients, as well as in irradiated healthy LNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3b, c, d, and e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Dasatinib treatment restores increased lysosomal accumulation in LNSCs</title><p id="P15">We next evaluated whether the observed increased SA-β-gal activity in RA(-risk) LNSCs would also decrease after dasatinib treatment. A significant increase of SA-β-gal positive cells in irradiated control LNSCs confirms that those cells have adapted a senescence phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Dasatinib treatment after irradiation significantly reduced the percentage of SA-β-gal positive cells in these control LNSCs. Although dasatinib treatment did not show a significant effect on SA-β-gal activity in both RA and RA-risk LNSCs, there was a pronounced decline in the expression levels of <italic>GLB1</italic>, the gene coding for SA-β-gal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Another marker for lysosomal biogenesis is SenTraGor, used to detect lipofuscin granules. Lipofuscin granule accumulation indicates reduced lysosomal degradation. SenTraGor can be visualized using immunofluorescence and was hardly detected in control LNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). In line with the SA-β-gal data, irradiation of control LNSCs significantly increased the amount of lipofuscin granules which was reduced after dasatinib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>), suggesting that dasatinib treatment is able to target lysosomes. The percentage of SenTraGor positive cells was significantly higher in both RA-risk and RA LNSCs compared with control LNSCs. The effectiveness of dasatinib to target endogenous lipofuscin granules was highly variable within donor groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Senescence-associated gene expression profile in RA LNSCs</title><p id="P17">Senescent cells accumulate primarily in tissues with chronic inflammation which can have detrimental consequences for tissue structure and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Senescent cells are able to create a pro-inflammatory microenvironment by secreting a variety of different molecules to communicate with adjacent cells, such as interleukins, chemokines, growth factors and growth regulators. Released factors can affect cell proliferation, disruption of tissue structure and function and immunomodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Indeed, gene expression levels of TP53, CDKN1A, IL6, FOXO4 and CD38 are significantly higher expressed in RA LNSCs compared with control LNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). CD38 is related to coenzyme NAD, a critical metabolic for many cellular processes, other genes linked to NAD, <italic>SIRT1, PARP1</italic> and <italic>NAMPT</italic> were not differentially expressed between donor groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 3</xref>). Expression of <italic>NOTCH3</italic> was already significantly altered in RA-risk LNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Dasatinib treatment had no significant effect on gene expression levels in cultured LNSCs, although dasatinib did restore expression levels of <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>CDKN2A, CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>FOXO4</italic> in RA(-risk) LNSCs to the expression levels measured in control LNSCs and partially restored the expression levels of <italic>IL6</italic>, <italic>NOTCH3</italic>, <italic>LMNB1</italic> and <italic>CD38</italic>. This shows that also at transcriptional level senescence can be detected in cultured LNSCs of RA patients, which is restored after dasatinib treatment for most of the analyzed genes.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Lower migration capacity in RA LNSCs</title><p id="P18">Next we investigated the viability, proliferation and migration of cultured LNSCs over time. Previously we have shown that the first 27 hours after seeding, LNSCs are only attaching and spreading, while the proliferation phase starts after these 27 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). As the viability of the cells is similar between controls and RA(-risk) LNSCs 24 hours after seeding, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>), we conclude that, as expected, a similar amount of LNSCs has been seeded for all donors tested. Over time, viability of all groups increase, indicating cell proliferation.</p><p id="P19">To get more insight into the proliferation rate of LNSCs in culture, we followed the cells real-time using an IncuCyte ZOOM S3. This system automatically acquired an image every 24 hours during a 6-days cell culture experiment and analyses cell confluency as a measure of proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>). This life-cell analysis confirmed the slow proliferation of LNSCs, which started in control LNSCs 48h after seeding. Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in proliferation rate, but RA LNSCs tend to lag behind. As a measure of cell function, we also studied the migration capacity of cultured LNSCs using a scratch wound assay. Cells were seeded at confluence and after 24h, an equal scratch wound was made automatically in every well using the IncuCyte wound maker. To analyse the migration capacity, the relative wound density was measured every 12 hours for 5 days, representing the closing of the wound. Control LNSCs were able to close the wound after 3 days culture, while RA LNSCs never closed the wound reflecting a significantly lower migration (and/or proliferation) capacity compared with control LNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>).</p><p id="P20">We next investigated whether dasatinib could restore these observed alterations in cell behavior. As expected, irradiation of control LNSCs had a negative impact on their viability, migration and proliferation and dasatinib treatment could restore part of these defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 4</xref>). However, dasatinib treatment in RA(-risk) LNSCs did not impact their viability, proliferation or migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 4</xref>). In summary, these live-cell imaging based analysis revealed that RA LNSCs have a lower migration and proliferation capacity compared with LNSCs which could not be restored by dasatinib treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>RA-risk and RA LNSCs have an impaired capacity to repair DNA damage</title><p id="P21">We next quantified the number of yH2AX foci, which accumulate at sites of unresolved DNA damage. A significantly higher number of foci was observed in nuclei of RA LNSCs compared with control LNSCs, as well as a non-significant (P=0,0665) numerical increase in RA-risk LNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7a, b</xref>). As positive control we irradiated LNSCs from controls, which significantly increased the number of yH2AX foci. Treating these irradiated control LNSCs for 24h with 5µM dasatinib showed a significant reduction in yH2AX foci, although not all DNA damage was repaired. This indicates that dasatinib treatment can partially restore irradiation induced DNA damage in cultured LNSCs. However, dasatinib treatment did not decrease DNA damage present in RA-risk and RA LNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7b</xref>). Because we already detected DNA damage in cultured LNSCs at baseline, we next investigated whether RA(-risk) LNSCs had an impaired DNA repair capacity. Therefore, cultured LNSCs were first irradiated with 1 Gray after which DNA damage repair was followed over time by imaging these cells directly (0h), 20 and 40 hours after irradiation. Irradiation induced significantly more DNA damage in RA LNSCs compared with control LNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7c, d</xref>), indicating that RA LNSCs might be more sensitive to DNA damage induction. After 20 hours DNA damage was significantly reduced in all donors, although yH2AX foci levels remained significantly higher in RA-risk and RA LNSCs compared with control LNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7c, d</xref>), indicating that DNA repair is faster in control LNSCs. Complete DNA damage repair was observed in control LNSCs 40 hours after irradiation, while yH2AX foci persist in RA-risk and RA LNSCs. The number of yH2AX foci detected 40 hours after irradiation of RA-risk and RA LNSCs was still higher than measured in untreated LNSCs, indicating that DNA damage repair in these cells is slow and incomplete. Pre-treatment of cultured LNSCs with 5µM dasatinib showed significantly less yH2AX foci directly after irradiation, implying that this makes RA-risk and RA LNSCs less sensitive to irradiation induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, less yH2AX foci were detected in dasatinib pre-treated LNSCs 20 hours after irradiation and after 40 hours DNA damage was completely restored. This indicates that dasatinib pre-treatment can increase repair of irradiation induced DNA damage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">Previous studies have shown premature cellular aging in RA. Changes detected in RA patients include accelerated immunosenescence, decreased thymic functionality, telomeric attrition and excessive senescence-associated secretory phenotype related cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Besides many T cell related studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), it was recently shown that senescent synovial fibroblasts prematurely accumulate in synovial tissue of RA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Currently, it is unclear whether this premature aging is a primary event occurring already before onset of disease or whether it is a secondary event driven by inflammatory processes or treatment. Moreover, it is unknown whether premature aging originates in lymphoid organs crucial for immune cell differentiation and development and whether it can be observed in tissue-resident lymph node fibroblasts, which have a major influence on immune cell function.</p><p id="P23">In this study we aimed to delineate the potential senescence phenotype of LN fibroblasts during the earliest phases of autoimmunity. To investigate hallmarks of senescence during systemic autoimmunity in absence of chronic inflammation we compared LNSCs collected from autoantibody positive individuals at risk of developing RA with LNSCs from RA patients and seronegative healthy volunteers. We detected senescence markers in LNSCs from RA patients at morphological, transcriptional and functional level compared with LNSCs from age-matched controls. LNSCs from RA-risk individuals also presented several senescence markers although to a lesser extent, suggesting that senescent cell accumulation starts before onset of clinical disease</p><p id="P24">Morphological characteristics related to senescence, such as enlarged and more granular cells, were significantly more present in <italic>ex vivo</italic> analyzed RA LNSCs and this morphology was maintained in culture allowing functional <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. Moreover, cell size and granularity of cultured RA-risk LNSCs were also higher compared with control LNSCs, although to a lesser extent. Forward-sideward scatter plots suggest that there might be a smaller number of larger (senescent) cells present in RA-risk individuals compared with RA LNSCs, suggesting that accumulation of larger cells starts before onset of RA and continues after diagnosis. Increased endogenous autofluorescence in senescent and slow dividing cells has been attributed to lipofuscin accumulation in lysosomes as result of oxidative stress and ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). These lipofuscin granules contain highly oxidized proteins, mostly unsaturated fatty acids, that cannot be removed by proteasomal degradation and accumulate in lysosomes with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). We previously showed increased ROS production by RA LNSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) and here we observed significantly more lipofuscin granules already in RA-risk LNSCs. In aggregate, this indicates that detected autofluorescence in RA(-risk) LNSCs may reflect increased lysosomal content and oxidative stress.</p><p id="P25">In senescent cells increased lysosomal mass is partially reflected by elevated SA-β-gal activity in senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). SA-β-gal activity has been acknowledged as one of the first markers of senescence but has been extensively debated. Despite the high percentage of positivity in cultured RA LNSCs, this is not necessarily representative for <italic>in vivo</italic> LN tissues. Most studies comparing <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> SA-β-gal stainings, found a much lower percentage of positive cells in tissue, indicating that the culture process may influence SA-β-gal activity. However, our findings can still be relevant as our age-matched control LNSCs almost don’t exhibit SA-β-gal positive cells. Moreover, our SenTraGor immunofluorescence staining was significantly higher already in RA-risk LNSCs, pointing towards accumulation of lysosomal content.</p><p id="P26">Transcriptomic analysis of senescence-associated genes in cultured LNSCs revealed multiple differentially expressed genes in RA LNSCs compared with control LNSCs. Overexpression of <italic>FOXO4</italic> mRNA was detected in RA LNSCs and is suggested to prevent cell death of senescent cells by sequestering p53 in the nucleus. Of note, increased <italic>NOTCH3</italic> expression was already detected in RA-risk LNSCs. Studies in inflamed synovium has shown that Notch3 is involved in the differentiation and arthrogenic expansion of a specific CD90+ fibroblast subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Another gene upregulated in RA LNSCs is <italic>CD38</italic>. CD38 levels inversely correlate with the age-related decline in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which ultimately leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). It is interesting to postulate that our earlier detected metabolic alteration in LNSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) is related to altered CD38 and NAD+ levels. Additional research is needed to investigate whether the differential expression of these genes are causative related to the observed senescence phenotype of RA LNSCs and may guide future studies aimed at restoring LNSC function.</p><p id="P27">Cellular senescence has been described as a state of proliferation arrest of cells. Although LNSCs proliferate slowly, we did not detect a proliferation arrest or significant differences between donor groups. However, the expression level of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor <italic>CDKN2A</italic> was significantly increased in RA LNSCs compared with control LNSCs. CDKN2A is one of the main drivers of cell cycle arrest in senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). The increased cell size measured using flow cytometry might explain why we were not able to detect any differences in cell proliferation as this was measured using the IncuCyte, which uses confluence as proliferation readout. When cells are larger, confluence is reached earlier compared with smaller cells thus cell size is a confounding factor in our comparison between control and RA LNSCs. The scratch wound assay showed that RA LNSCs have a decreased migration capacity reflected by impaired wound repair, though this might also be caused by a difference in proliferation. Further research is needed to clarify whether or not there is a difference in proliferation rate between RA and control LNSCs.</p><p id="P28">Accumulating DNA damage or dysfunctional DNA repair machinery is linked to senescence and has been observed in T cells of patients with RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). T cells closely interact with resident stromal cells within LN and synovial tissue, an interaction that might play an important role in initiating chronic inflammation. DNA damage is already present in LNSCs of RA-risk LNSCs, thus before onset of disease. The persistence of DNA damage in senescent cells activates phosphorylation of transcription factor p53, which induces growth arrest to allow for DNA damage repair. Indeed, p53 expression was significantly upregulated in RA LNSCs compared with control LNSCs. Additionally, DNA damage repair capacity was diminished in RA-risk and RA LNSCs. Despite RA-risk and control LNSCs having a similar number of yH2AX foci directly after irradiation, yH2AX foci persisted in RA-risk LNSCs after irradiation. Further research should be undertaken to investigate whether impaired DNA damage repair correlates with future arthritis development in RA-risk individuals and what effect DNA damage in LNSCs has on peripheral tolerance.</p><p id="P29">After testing four different senolytic agents, only dasatinib was able to selectively remove (senescent) LNSCs in RA patients and not affecting control LNSCs. When evaluating cell viability upon dasatinib treatment we showed that viability of irradiated control LNSCs increased after 48-72h, suggesting that irradiation-induced senescent cells were eliminated. The exponential curve after this time point suggests that healthy LNSCs then got the opportunity to grow. This effect was less clear in dasatinib treated RA LNSCs. However, dasatinib treatment did partly restore cell size and gene expression levels in RA(-risk) LNSCs. Dasatinib only had minor effect on the lysosomal content of cultured LNSCs. Data from baseline and irradiation experiments showed that dasatinib significantly improved irradiation-induced DNA damage but not the endogenous DNA damage observed in untreated RA(-risk) LNSCs suggesting different repair mechanisms are involved. The mechanism by which dasatinib (partly) restores altered senescence associated characteristics in LNSCs remains to be further elucidated. Nevertheless, dasatinib treatment of LNSCs has revealed that senolytic agents can be effective to restore LNSC function early in disease.</p><p id="P30">To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating cellular senescence in human LNSCs during systemic autoimmunity. The presence of increased numbers of senescent LNSCs in RA patients compared with controls suggest that besides T cells and synovial fibroblasts, also LN fibroblasts present signs of premature aging. Unfortunately, the relatively low number of donors tested in this study makes it hard to reach statistical significance. However, these unique human lymph node biopsy studies are extremely challenging to perform, especially in the context of systemic autoimmunity. Moreover, it is difficult to find seronegative healthy volunteers who would like to participate in such a study and LNSCs are typically slowly growing cells making these experiments very labor intensive and time consuming. A limitation of our study is that one type of senescence known as replicative senescence can easily be induced in <italic>in vitro</italic> culture systems. Replicative senescence is characterized by a decrease in proliferation potential induced in cells after undergoing multiple cell divisions, leading to replicative exhaustion. However, we cautiously monitored our proliferation and passaging process and compared LNSCs from different donors always from the same passage after <italic>ex vivo</italic> digestion. Of importance, our data in LN biopsies confirm increased cell size of RA fibroblasts analyzed directly <italic>ex vivo</italic> before <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion. Accordingly, this suggest that the observed senescence phenotype in RA(-risk) LNSCs is not purely induced by <italic>in vitro</italic> culture.</p><p id="P31">In conclusion, our results showed that RA LNSCs exhibit many characteristics linked to cellular senescence which could be partly restored by dasatinib treatment. Although one of the most important hallmarks of senescence, proliferation arrest, was not detected we postulate that LNSCs from RA patients display a senescence phenotype which is even partly present before onset of disease and contributes to premature aging of the LN stromal microenvironment. Further studies are needed to investigate how senescence of the local stromal microenvironment affects immune responses in the context of autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary methods</label><media xlink:href="EMS192733-supplement-Supplementary_methods.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d159aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS192733-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d159aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank our study subjects for participating in the study, the AMC radiology department for lymph node tissue sampling, the rheumatology lab for sample processing and Tatum van Maanen for the DNA damage analysis support.</p><sec id="S18"><title>Funding</title><p>The research leading to these results was funded within the FP7 HEALTH program (EuroTEAM) under the grant agreement FP7-HEALTH-F2-2012-305549, AMC fellowship, the Dutch Arthritis Foundation LLP-30 and the Dutch Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw) VIDI n° 91718371.</p></sec></ack><glossary><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term>RA</term><def><p>rheumatoid arthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RF</term><def><p>rheumatoid factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ACPA</term><def><p>anti-citrullinated protein antibodies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RA-risk</term><def><p>individuals who are positive for RF or/and ACPA and at risk of developing RA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LNSC</term><def><p>Lymph node stromal cell</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="con"><p id="P32"><bold>Contributors:</bold> TJ and LB designed the study.

After 24h, dasatinib was washed away and remaining cells were left in culture until flasks with untreated LNSCs reached 80% confluence. Upon reaching confluence, both flasks per donor were harvested and seeded for experiments. Two flasks of control LNSCs were irradiated with 10 gray, from which one was treated for 24 hours with 5µM dasatinib 24 hours after irradiation and the other was left only irradiated.
