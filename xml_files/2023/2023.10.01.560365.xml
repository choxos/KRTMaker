This variant is a descendant of the Omicron BA.2 variant, with the most recent common ancestor estimated to be from between 9th April and 24th July 2023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Since the emergence of BA.2.86, multiple countries have reported its presence, primarily as sporadic BA.2.86 cases with no clear epidemiological link. From the first 12 BA.2.86 cases in Denmark, the estimated effective reproduction number (R<sub>e</sub>) of this variant was 1.29-fold greater than that of XBB.1.5 and at least comparable to that of EG.5.1, one of the most rapidly expanding XBB subvariants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). This is consistent with an outbreak of BA.2.86 in a care home in the United Kingdom (UK) that experienced an attack rate above 85%, indicating high transmissibility in close contact situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The earliest cases of BA.2.86 in Denmark suggested a clinical presentation and disease severity no different from other SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating during July/August 2023, such as EG.5.1 and XBB.1.16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Symptoms included cough, shortness of breath, and fever; none were severely ill. Some of the early cases had an underlying disease or received immune-modulating treatment. Taken together with the care home outbreak in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), individuals of older age and with comorbidities appear to be more at risk of developing a symptomatic BA.2.86 infection that warrants medical attention.</p><p id="P4">The increasing numbers of BA.2.86 infections 1-2 years after 3-4 immunisations, with or without prior infection, suggests that waning immunity may contribute to the susceptibility to BA.2.86 infection. Moreover, the highly mutated spike protein of BA.2.86 is antigenically distinct from all other SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the XBB subvariants, as determined using mRNA-vaccinated mouse serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). This suggests that BA.2.86 may evade pre-existing humoral immunity, as well as the acquired immunity from the updated XBB.1.5-based vaccines. The care home outbreak data suggested limited vaccine effectiveness against infection with BA.2.86 four months after vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P5">To estimate the cross-neutralisation of BA.2.86 by XBB.1.5-induced antibodies, we used serum or plasma samples from persons who had experienced an XBB.1.5 infection as a proxy for the humoral immune response generated by the updated XBB.1.5 vaccines. In contrast to assessing antibodies raised against single SARS-Cov-2 variants in vaccinated or infected animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), human XBB.1.5 breakthrough infections are more representative of the complex and diverse pre-existing immunity of future XBB.1.5-based vaccine recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). As a representative of the 2022 SARS-CoV-2 variant vaccine, we assessed antibody responses in persons who had either experienced an Omicron BA.4/5 breakthrough infection or received the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 bivalent mRNA vaccine as a fourth vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P6">SARS-CoV-2 variants exhibit variable affinities for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) host receptor and dominance in using either the fusion or the endocytic entry pathway in immortalised cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). To account for this, we attempted viral isolation on different cell lines permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection with respiratory sample material obtained from individuals with an RT-PCR- and sequencing-confirmed BA.2.86 infection. Using a protocol detailed in the Method section, BA.2.86 established a primary infection from clinical sample material in human-derived cell lines CaLu-3 and iGROV-1, but not African Green Monkey kidney-derived cell lines Vero E6, Vero/hSLAM, and VeroE6 expressing ACE-2 and TMPRSS2. In contrast, EG.5.1 was readily isolated from Vero E6 cells. BA.2.86 infection of CaLu-3 and iGROV-1 cells from a single clinical sample did not yield cell line-specific spike protein adaptations, as determined by sequencing of these cell culture progenies. Once isolated, BA.2.86 efficiently infected Vero E6 cells and induced a clear cytopathic effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The spike protein of BA.2.86 contains approximately 60 amino acid changes relative to the SARS-CoV-2 index strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). To assess its potential immune evasiveness, we first determined neutralising antibody titres in a live virus neutralisation assay for 13 individuals who experienced an XBB.1.5 breakthrough infection of whom the majority (n=12) received at least three prior vaccinations. The geometric mean neutralising antibody titre to D614G (B.1), BA.2, BA.5, XBB.1, EG.5.1 and BA.2.86 were 376, 363, 464, 99, 123, and 61, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). The neutralisation titres for XBB.1, EG.5.1 and BA.2.86 were 3- to 7.6-fold lower compared to the ancestral D614G strain and the Omicron BA.2 and BA.5 variants. The geometric mean titre for BA.2.86 did not differ significantly from that of XBB.1 and EG.5.1.</p><p id="P8">We next evaluated neutralising antibody titres for individuals who experienced a BA.4/5 breakthrough infection (n=30; of whom 23 received at least three prior index strain vaccinations) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). To compare we also assessed BA.2.86 virus neutralisation for individuals who had received the bivalent BA.4/5 mRNA vaccine as a fourth vaccination (n=6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). For both these groups, the geometric mean titres to D614G, BA.2, and BA.5 were higher than those for individuals who experienced an XBB.1.5 infection and marginally lower to XBB.1, EG.5.1, and BA.2.86 compared to the same group. Similar to that observed for the XBB.1.5 infected group, the neutralisation titres for BA.2.86 did not differ significantly compared to titres for XBB.1 and EG.5.1.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P9">The Omicron BA.2.86 subvariant has a distinctly different, highly mutated spike protein that alters its <italic>in vitro</italic> infectivity characteristics and antigenicity relative to earlier variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). This raises concern over the effectiveness of 2023/2024 updated vaccines derived from the Omicron XBB.1.5 spike protein. Data from this study and others suggest that, despite the highly different spike mutation constellation of BA.2.86 that alters monoclonal antibody specificities, the overall neutralisation ability of polyclonal serum antibodies after an XBB.1.5 breakthrough infection is comparable to that of circulating XBB recombinant strains (2,5,6,8–10).</p><p id="P10">Multiple factors relating to the virus, vaccine, and host modulate the antibody response in a person. These include vaccine modality, number of vaccine doses, time since vaccination, homologous or heterologous vaccination, the interval between doses, virus antigenicity, hybrid immunity (combination of prior infection and vaccination), immune imprinting, host age, sex, and immune-modulatory drug treatment. Vaccine-related variables and exposure to different SARS-CoV-2 variants before or after vaccination, and consequently the diversity of pre-existing immunity of future vaccine recipients, differ notably between regions of the world and countries. This variability introduces uncertainty in extrapolating virus neutralisation data between countries. Therefore, to inform public health policies, it is necessary to characterise the anticipated sensitivity of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants to vaccines in different populations using clearly defined cohorts.</p><p id="P11">The combination of Danish SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing surveillance, vaccination registries and biobanking enables the selection of clearly defined cohorts. Of relevance, the cohorts selected in the present study included primarily older individuals, who represent the population groups most likely to receive the updated XBB.1.5 vaccines. An additional strength of the study includes the use of live, replication competent SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates that represent the pathogens circulating in the population. A limitation of the study is the limited sample sizes; although, the relative neutralisation data are in agreement with the findings of others (2,5,6,8–10).</p><p id="P12">In conclusion, this study provides antibody cross-neutralisation data for the newly emerged Omicron subvariant BA.2.86 and globally dominating subvariant EG.5.1 in a population that received mRNA vaccines as primary regimen and boosters, and who experienced an Omicron BA.2 wave followed by smaller waves of BA.4/5 and a subsequent dominance of XBB.1 recombinant variants. We demonstrate that BA.2.86 neutralisation is comparable to that of XBB.1 and EG.5.1 in individuals who experienced XBB.1.5 breakthrough infection, BA.4/5 breakthrough infection, or BA.4/5 bivalent vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="P13">This study is part of national infectious disease surveillance and response to an emerging virus variant performed on surplus biological material by Statens Serum Institut, a governmental institute under the Danish Ministry of Health, according to Section 222 of the Danish Health Act and following data protection regulations.
