The characterization of neural organoids using single-cell genomic methods has revealed a large diversity of neural cell types with molecular signatures similar to those observed in primary human brain tissue. However, it is unclear which domains of the human nervous system are covered by existing protocols. It is also difficult to quantitatively assess variation between protocols and the specific cell states in organoids as compared to primary counterparts. Single-cell transcriptome data from primary tissue and neural organoids derived with guided or unguided approaches and under diverse conditions combined with large-scale integrative analyses make it now possible to address these challenges. Recent advances in computational methodology enable the generation of integrated atlases across many data sets. Here, we integrated 36 single-cell transcriptomics data sets spanning 26 protocols into one integrated human neural organoid cell atlas (HNOCA) totaling over 1.7 million cells. We harmonize cell type annotations by incorporating reference data sets from the developing human brain. By mapping to the developing human brain reference, we reveal which primary cell states have been generated in vitro, and which are under-represented. We further compare transcriptomic profiles of neuronal populations in organoids to their counterparts in the developing human brain. To support rapid organoid phenotyping and quantitative assessment of new protocols, we provide a programmatic interface to browse the atlas and query new data sets, and showcase the power of the atlas to annotate new query data sets and evaluate new organoid protocols. Taken together, the HNOCA will be useful to assess the fidelity of organoids, characterize perturbed and diseased states and facilitate protocol development in the future.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Human neural organoids, self-organizing 3D human neural tissues that can be grown in vitro, are becoming powerful tools for studying the mechanisms of human brain development, evolution and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Neural organoids can be generated using external patterning factors (e.g. morphogens) to guide their development towards certain brain regions or to drive the emergence of specific cell types (guided protocols)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Conversely, unguided protocols rely on the self-patterning capacity of organoids to generate diverse cell types and states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a versatile tool to characterize cell type heterogeneity in human neural organoids, and has been used to characterize molecular features of neural cells generated in different neural organoid protocols. It also enables the comparison of human neural organoid cell types and states to those in the primary human brain, and has revealed many similarities in molecular signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, there are no comprehensive surveys that catalog all cell states that can arise in neural organoid systems. As a consequence, it is still unclear which portions of the developing central nervous system can already be generated with existing protocols and which ones are still lacking. It has also remained challenging to systematically quantify the transcriptomic fidelity of neural organoid cells compared to their primary counterpart.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we address these challenges by combining 36 scRNA-seq data sets covering numerous human neural organoid protocols, to generate a transcriptomic cell atlas of human neural organoids using state-of-art computational methods. We establish an analytical pipeline, which allows for the comprehensive and quantitative comparison of the organoid atlas to a recently published reference atlas of the developing human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. By combining the two atlases, we harmonize annotations of neural and non-neural populations in the two systems, estimate the capacity and precision of different neural organoid protocols to generate neural cells representing different brain regions, and identify primary cell populations that are under-represented in neural organoid protocols. We further estimate transcriptomic fidelity of neurons in neural organoids and identify cell stress as a universal factor distinguishing metabolic states of in vitro neurons from primary neurons. Finally, we map the data of a recent neural organoid morphogen screen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> to the integrated atlas to assess regional specificity, and generation of novel states. Together, our work provides a rich atlas resource and a new framework to assess the fidelity of neural organoids, characterize perturbed and diseased states and streamline protocol development in the future.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Establishment of a human neural organoid cell atlas (HNOCA) by data curation, harmonization and integration</title><p id="P5">To build a transcriptomic human neural organoid cell atlas (HNOCA), we collected single-cell RNA sequencing data and detailed, harmonized technical and biological metadata from 36 different data sets, including 33 published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and three currently unpublished ones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), accounting for 1.77 million cells after consistent preprocessing and quality control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The HNOCA represents cell types and cell states that are generated with 26 distinct neural organoid differentiation protocols, including three unguided and 23 guided ones, at different time points ranging from seven to 450 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). To remove sample-specific batch effects, we implemented a three-step integration pipeline. First, to anchor our analysis in primary human developing brain data, we projected the HNOCA to a single-cell transcriptomic reference atlas of the developing human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> using reference similarity spectrum (RSS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Then, to allow for informed, label-aware integration, we developed an algorithm (snapseed, see Methods) to perform an initial marker-based hierarchical cell type annotation. Last, we used scPoli36 for label-aware data integration based on the hierarchical snapseed annotations. Evaluation of scPoli together with other integration approaches using the previously established benchmarking pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> showed that scPoli had the best performance for these data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). We performed Leiden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> clustering based on the scPoli representation and refined annotations for these clusters based on the expression of canonical markers, organoid sample age, as well as the auto-generated cell type labels. A UMAP embedding revealed three neuronal differentiation trajectories corresponding to dorsal telencephalic, ventral telencephalic and non-telencephalic populations as well as trajectories leading from progenitor cells to non-neuronal cell types such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes precursors (OPCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Cells from both unguided and guided protocols were distributed across all trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To elucidate the dynamics and transitions of cell states and cell types represented in the HNOCA, we reconstructed a real-age-informed pseudotime of HNOCA cells based on neural optimal transport (OT) using the moscot framework39 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Focusing on dorsal telencephalic neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons, we observed consistent pseudotemporal expression profiles of genes such as NPC marker SOX2, as well as neuronal markers BCL11B (CTIP2) for deeper layer neurons, and SATB2 for upper layer neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). To further resolve heterogeneity among non-telencephalic neurons, we performed sub-clustering of this population revealing numerous neuronal populations characterized by distinct marker gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j-k</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Projection of the HNOCA to a human primary developing brain reference atlas</title><p id="P7">To assess our cell type annotation, and more precisely annotate the heterogeneous non-telencephalic neuronal populations, a comprehensive reference atlas of human neural cell types and states is needed. Because neural organoids generally model early stages of the human central nervous system, we used a recently published single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the developing human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) as the reference for comparison with the HNOCA. We applied scVI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> and scANVI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> to the primary reference atlas, and used scArches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> to project the HNOCA to the same latent space. The shared latent space allowed us to reconstruct a bipartite weighted k-nearest neighbor (wKNN) graph between cells in the HNOCA and the primary reference atlas. With the established wKNN graph, the ‘CellClass’ and ‘Subregion’ labels, as well as the neurotransmitter transporter (NTT) information of neuroblasts and neurons were transferred to the HNOCA. The transferred labels are strongly consistent with our assigned labels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>) and allowed us to refine the regional annotation of non-telencephalic NPCs and neurons in the HNOCA, as well as the NTT annotation of the non-telencephalic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), resulting in the final hierarchical cell type annotation of the HNOCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Based on the final regional annotation of the HNOCA, we evaluated the capacity of each neural organoid protocol to generate neural cells of different brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The five data sets of unguided neural organoids show a wide distribution of cells across all brain regions with proportions varying across data sets, indicating the capacity of unguided protocols to generate many brain regions but with high batch-to-batch and line-to-line variability. In contrast, we find that data sets derived from guided organoid protocols are strongly enriched for cells of the targeted brain region. This supports the use of morphogen guidance to efficiently generate a given brain region of interest. Further, we found that data sets of organoids guided to a certain region often show an increased proportion of cells of the brain regions neighboring the targeted regions in the neural axis. For example, several data sets derived from midbrain organoid protocols also show high proportions of diencephalic and hindbrain neurons, indicating an imprecision of morphogen guidance for deep regions of the brain.</p><p id="P9">To evaluate how well organoid protocols represented by the HNOCA generate the different primary cell types or states, we went beyond coarse regional labels and estimated presence scores for every primary cell type in each HNOCA data set (see Methods). A large presence score indicates high frequency and likelihood that cells of a similar type and state are observed in the HNOCA data set. After normalizing the scores per organoid data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), we obtained the max presence score for each primary reference cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>) as the metric to describe how well the cell type is represented in at least one HNOCA data set. This analysis confirmed the absence of erythrocytes, immune cells and vascular endothelial cells in the HNOCA, all of which are derived from non-neuroectoderm germ layers during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). The presence of neural cell populations (radial glia (RG), intermediate progenitor cells (IPC), neurons) from different brain regions varied in the organoid data sets. As expected, telencephalic cell types are most strongly represented in HNOCA, as half of the data sets were based on protocols guided towards telencephalon. In contrast, cell types of the thalamus, midbrain and cerebellum are least represented, including thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) GABAergic neurons, dorsal midbrain m1-derived GABAergic neurons and m1/m2-derived glutamatergic neurons, and cerebellar Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f,g</xref>). It is worth noting that, even though these cell types are less abundant in the HNOCA organoid datasets than in the primary atlas, certain organoid protocols are able to generate them (e.g. Purkinje cells generated by cerebellum and midbrain organoid protocols).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Transcriptomic fidelity of primary neural cell types in neural organoids</title><p id="P10">We next aimed to understand the transcriptional similarities and differences between organoids generated by distinct differentiation protocols as well as between organoids and primary brain tissue. To this end, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on pseudobulk replicates, comparing neural cell types in the HNOCA with their respective primary reference cell type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, we found that for most neural cell types over a third (mean=39.8%, sd=11.5%) of DEGs were shared across at least half of the protocols (protocol-common DEGs), suggesting that a substantial portion of the transcriptomic differences between organoid and primary cells was independent of organoid differentiation protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). To ensure that protocol-common DEGs are not an artifact of using a comprehensive, yet single reference data set of the developing human brain, we verified our results using an additional primary human cortex scRNA-seq data set43 and identified significant overlap with the previously identified protocol-common DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). We further aimed to identify differential transcriptional programs that were not just common across differentiation protocols but also shared across regional neural cell types. We identified a total of 994 ubiquitous DEGs (uDEGs) which were differentially expressed in at least half the differentiation protocols across at least 14 out of the 16 regional neural cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). When quantifying the level of consistency in uDEG fold changes across neuron types and protocols, we observed a correlation higher than 0.8 for over half the pairs, underscoring a highly aligned transcriptomic effect within the uDEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Out of all 994 uDEGs, 244 genes were consistently upregulated and 622 genes were consistently downregulated, leaving only 128 genes (14%) regulated in inconsistent direction across subtypes or protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To identify the biological pathways these three groups of uDEGs are involved in, we ran an enrichment analysis of the Gene Ontology Biological Pathways set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. For the downregulated uDEGs we identified a clear signature of neurodevelopmental processes including neuron cell-cell adhesion and synapse organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). In the up-regulated uDEGs, we observed an enrichment of multiple metabolism-associated terms including mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled electron transport, a term associated with the oxidative phosphorylation energy pathway, and canonical glycolysis, a metabolic pathway which can also function under anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Using our validation approach across multiple primary cortex reference data sets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, we were able to confirm these enriched terms. In contrast, only very few to no terms were enriched in the inconsistently differentially regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P12">An enrichment of energy-associated pathways has previously been associated with metabolic changes caused by the limitations of the current culture media as well as the supply of nutrients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. When scoring each of the two predominant upregulated gene sets across the HNOCA and the primary reference atlas12, we found that the canonical glycolysis term showed a more significant separation of organoid and primary cells while also being more unique to the organoid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Given that metabolic changes are thought to be a cell culture-related phenomenon34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>), we decided to use the canonical glycolysis score as the universal proxy for such stress effects in organoid cells.</p><p id="P13">Next, we wanted to explore the cell type specificity of increased glycolysis in organoids. Using the Kanton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and Braun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> data sets as representative examples, we identified a similar distribution of glycolysis scores across all neural cell types with an overall increased score in organoid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). Focusing on dorsal telencephalic neurons, which were present in organoids from a particularly large number of differentiation protocols, we compared the distribution of glycolysis scores across differentiation protocols and identified several protocol features that correlated with metabolic cell stress. For instance, the usage of maturation media, slicing/cutting of organoids and, to a lesser extent, shaking/spinning of organoids led to overall lower glycolysis scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>).</p><p id="P14">When comparing mean glycolysis scores and transcriptomic similarities of organoid and primary reference cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> across differentiation protocols, we observed an overall negative correlation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the correlation strength was significantly reduced when considering only variable transcription factors (TFs) in the transcriptomic similarity analysis, indicating that the metabolic changes in organoids has only limited impact on the core molecular identity of neuronal cell types as defined by TF activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P15">In order to quantify the transcriptomic similarity between organoid and primary reference cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> while avoiding the confounding effect of metabolic changes in organoids, we focused on the expression of 366 variable TFs to calculate the correlation between corresponding neuronal cell types in the HNOCA data sets and the primary reference atlas12. We found that both guided and unguided organoid differentiation protocols generated neuronal cell types with comparable similarity to the corresponding primary reference cell types. However, we observed brain region dependent differences in transcriptomic similarity between organoid and primary reference neuron types. For example, organoid neurons from the dorsal part of most brain regions such as the dorsal telencephalon, dorsal midbrain and cerebellum showed higher similarity to their primary counterparts across organoid data sets than cell types derived from the ventral part of most brain regions such as the hypothalamus, ventral midbrain and pons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The HNOCA facilitates evaluation of new neural organoid protocols</title><p id="P16">The integrated HNOCA, as well as the analytical pipeline we established to compare to the primary reference atlas in terms of cell type composition and transcriptomic fidelity, provide a framework to query novel neural organoid scRNA-seq data sets not included in the HNOCA. To showcase this application, we retrieved the scRNA-seq data of a recently published multiplexed neural organoid morphogen screen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and projected it to the same latent spaces as the HNOCA and the primary reference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, respectively, using scArches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Regional labels were predicted for query cells by label transfer from the primary reference using the same procedure as mentioned above. The predicted regional labels were highly consistent with the provided regional annotation, but with higher resolution within each of the broad brain sections of fore-brain, midbrain and hindbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Our transferred an-notation therefore allowed a more comprehensive assessment of the effects of different morphogen conditions on generating neurons of different brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). We further calculated presence scores for each primary reference cell in each of the screen conditions and compared the data of the different screen conditions with the 36 HNOCA data sets. We used hierarchical clustering on average presence scores of primary reference atlas clusters for this comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Many screen conditions showed distinct presence score patterns, suggesting the generation of organoids with regional cell type compositions that are distinct from the HNOCA data sets. Next, we summarized the max presence scores for the whole morphogen screen data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), and compared then to the max presence scores calculated for the HNOCA data to assess which primary reference cell types showed an increased presence in the screening data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). This analysis highlighted several reference cell clusters that showed a significant abundance increase under certain screen conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>).

In summary, the projection of the morphogen screen query data to the HNOCA and the primary reference atlas allowed a refined annotation of the morphogen screen data, as well as a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of the value of novel neural organoid protocols to generate neuronal cell types previously underrepresented or lacking in neural organoids.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">In this study, we built the first large-scale integrated cell atlas of human neural organoids, the HNOCA. To effectively integrate the 1.8 million cells spanning 36 scRNA-seq data sets generated by 15 different laboratories worldwide using 26 different differentiation protocols as well as diverse scRNA-seq technologies, we introduced a multi-step data integration procedure: 1) pre-integration using RSS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> ; 2) marker-based auto-annotation using snapseed; and 3) labelaware integration using scPoli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The resulting integrated atlas revealed the high complexity of neuronal, glial and non-neural cell types that can develop in neural organoids grown under existing protocol conditions. Mapping the HNOCA data to a recently published human developing brain cell reference atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> allowed comprehensive evaluation of neural organoid protocols to generate cell types of different brain regions, and revealed primary brain tissue cell types that are under-represented in organoids from currently available protocols. We performed differential expression analysis between organoid neuron types and their primary counterparts to evaluate the transcriptomic fidelity, and identified metabolic stress as a main factor that distinguishes organoid and primary cell states. Last, we showcased the mapping of a query data set, a recently published single-cell transcriptomic neural organoid morphogen screen, to the HNOCA and the primary reference, which enabled a refined cell type annotation, as well as a compositional comparison with existing neural organoid data sets. The integrated HNOCA, as well as the entire analytical pipeline, are publicly available, and the variational autoencoder (VAE) used for data integration flexibly enables incorporation of new data sets for future atlas expansion. This powerful framework will facilitate quantitative and comparative analysis of scRNA-seq data of human neural organoids, and for the benchmarking of novel neural organoid protocols.</p><p id="P18">Consistent with earlier reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, we find that unguided protocols generate neural cells with high brain regional variability, which is useful when studying broader fate determination during nervous system development. Guided protocols resulted in a strong enrichment of cell types of the targeted brain regions. We also note that guided protocols, particularly those targeting non-telencephalic regions such as the midbrain, show relatively low specificity and generate neural cells from the nearby brain regions. This issue of broader specification may be due to a differential response of neural stem cells in the organoid to the same morphogen cue, or to the lack of a full understanding of the timing, concentration and combinations of morphogens that would be required to precisely define cells of the deeper regions in the central nervous system. Further work is needed to fully understand which factors control the emergence of any given brain region.</p><p id="P19">Through comparison to primary developing human brain tissue, we found that metabolic changes related to the glycolysis pathway in in vitro versus primary tissue. Despite the negative effects of metabolic stress on overall transcriptomic fidelity, the molecular identity of regional cell types is maintained as evidenced by transcription factor co-expression patterns that are highly consistent with primary counterparts. We find that transcriptomic fidelity is higher for some neural cell types (e.g. telencephalic neurons) than others (e.g. cerebellar neurons). This could be due to the more distinct molecular signatures of telencephalic neurons relative to others, or the rostral telencephalic neurons being the default fate of early embryonic ectodermal cells as previously proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">Altogether, an integrated organoid atlas will enable us to assess the fidelity of organoids, characterize perturbed and diseased states and streamline protocol development in the future.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Metadata curation and harmonization of human neural organoid scRNA-seq data sets</title><p id="P21">We included 33 human neural organoid data from a total of 25 publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> plus three unpublished data sets in our atlas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

For quality control and filtering of HNOCA, we removed any cells with less than 200 genes expressed. We next removed outlier cells in terms of two quality control (QC) metrics: the number of expressed genes and percentage mitochondrial counts. To define outlier cells based on each QC metric, z-transformation is firstly applied to values across all cells. Cells with any z-transformed metric &lt; -1.96 or &gt; 1.96 are defined as outliers.

We furthermore subset the human developing brain atlas to cells that had been assigned a valid label in the “neuron_ntt_label” annotation column. We added an additional two data sets of fetal cortical cells from Camp et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and from Eze et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. For the data from Camp et al. we subset the data to cells labeled “fetal” and estimated transcripts per million reads (TPM) for each gene in each cell using RSEM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> given the STAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup> mapping results. We then computed a PCA, a kNN graph, UMAP and Leiden clustering (resolution 0.2) using scanpy.

For the data from Eze et al. we subset the data sets to cells annotated as “Neuronal” in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 5</xref> (“Cortex Annotations”) of their publication and computed a PCA, neighborhood graph and UMAP to visualize the data set.

We then subsetted the feature space to the intersection of features of all data sets and removed any cells with fewer than 200 genes expressed. We further removed any genes expressed in less than 1% of neurons in HNOCA and any genes located on the X and Y chromosomes. For each regional neural cell type, we removed any sample from the pseudobulk data which was associated with an organoid differentiation assay with less than two total samples or fewer than 100 total cells. We next used edgeR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup> to iteratively compute DE genes between each organoid differentiation protocol and primary cells of the matching regional neural cell types for every regional neural cell type while correcting for organoid age in days, number of cells per pseudobulk sample, median and standard deviation of the number of detected genes per pseudobulk sample. We used Braun et al.

For each HNOCA data set, only neural cell types with at least 20 cells were considered. Highly variable genes were identified across the neural cell types in the primary reference using a Chi-squared test-based variance ratio test on the generalized linear model with Gamma distribution (identity link), given coefficient of variance of transcript counts across neural cell types as the response, and the reciprocal of average transcript count across neural cell types as the independent variable. Genes with Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value less than 0.01 were considered as highly variable genes.

The top-left area is for glutamatergic neurons, while the bottom-right area is for GABAergic neurons. Neurons of different regions are colored differently. The x-axes show fractions of protocols, denoted as f. The y-axes show fractions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in at least f of all protocols generating the subtypes. The vertical dashed lines denote f=0.5. (c) Numbers of protocol-common DEGs, grouped by the number of neural cell types a gene is estimated to be common DEG. A common DEG in one neural cell type shows DE in at least half of protocols generating the subtype. The 994 genes showing common DE in at least 14 out of 16 neural cell types are defined as ubiquitous DEGs. (d) Distribution of correlation of ubiquitous DEGs log-transformed expression fold change in relative to primary (logFC), between different neural cell types as well as different protocols. (e) Ubiquitous DEGs are classified into three categories: inconsistent change (different subtypes show different DE direction), downregulated, and upregulated in organoids. (f) Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of downregulated (upper, blue) and upregulated (lower, red) ubiquitous DEGs. Sizes of the squares correlate with -log-transformed adjusted p-values. (g) Distribution of gene set (left: mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled electron transport, electron transport scores; right: canonical glycolysis, glycolysis scores) scores in primary neural cell types (upper, dark), and organoid counterparts (lower, light). P-values show significance of two-sided Wilcoxon test. Both scores are calculated with the score_genes function in scanpy. (h) Glycolysis score, as the proxy of cell stress, of dorsal telencephalic excitatory neurons (dTelen VGLUT-N), split by the three primary developing human brains and 27 organoid data sets with at least 20 dTelen VGLUT-N. Data sets are ordered by their glycolysis score medians. The lower panel shows selected features of differentiation protocols which may be relevant to cell stress.

(c) Proportions of cells in the screen data set assigned to different regions by projection to the primary reference. Every stacked bar represents one screened condition. (d) Clustering of HNOCA together with different conditions in the screen data sets, based on the average presence scores of clusters in the primary reference. The dendrogram on the left shows the hierarchical clustering result. The heatmap shows average presence scores per cluster in the primary reference (columns), given data of each protocol involved in HNOCA or the screen condition (rows).

(f) Gain of cell cluster coverage of the screen conditions relative to HNOCA data sets, defined as the difference of average max presence scores per cluster of the primary reference with negative values trimmed to zero, between the screen data set to HNOCA. The gray horizontal line shows the threshold (0.3) to define gained clusters in screen data. (g) UMAP of the primary reference, with gained clusters highlighted in shades of blue. Dashed circles highlight three clusters with the highest gain of coverage in telencephalon, midbrain and hindbrain, respectively.
