Using normal rat kidney fibroblasts, we investigated the reversible assembly/disassembly of the proton pumping V-ATPase when endolysosomes are formed by kissing and fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes and during the subsequent reformation of lysosomes. We took advantage of previous work showing that sucrosomes formed by the uptake of sucrose are swollen endolysosomes from which lysosomes are reformed after uptake of invertase. Using confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation of NRK cells stably expressing fluorescently tagged proteins, we found net recruitment of the V1 subcomplex during sucrosome formation and loss during lysosome reformation, with a similar time course to RAB7a loss. Addition of invertase did not alter mTORC1 signalling, suggesting that the regulation of reversible V-ATPase assembly/disassembly in continuously fed cells differs from that in cells subject to amino acid depletion/re-feeding. Using live cell microscopy, we demonstrated recruitment of a fluorescently tagged V1 subunit during endolysosome formation and a dynamic equilibrium and rapid exchange between the cytosolic and membrane bound pools of this subunit. We conclude that reversible V-ATPase assembly/disassembly plays a key role in regulating endolysosomal/lysosomal pH in continuously fed cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In mammalian cells, the delivery of endocytosed cargo to lysosomal acid hydrolases is achieved by kissing and fusion events between late endosomes (also known as MVBs, multi-vesicular bodies) and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bright et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bright et al., 2016</xref>). These events result in the formation of endolysosomes, which are hybrid organelles with characteristics of both late endosomes and lysosomes and from which re-usable, terminal storage lysosomes are regenerated. This lysosome regeneration cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>) is analogous to that occurring in the autophagic (i.e. macroautophagic) pathway when lysosomes fuse with autophagosomes to form autolysosomes from which lysosomes are reformed and in the phagocytic pathway in which lysosomes are reformed from phagolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bento et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Yang and Wang, 2021</xref>). In all three cases, lysosome reformation occurs after tubulation of the hybrid organelle, followed by scission and maturation events, which are best understood mechanistically in the case of autophagic lysosome reformation (ALR)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Chen and Yu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Yang and Wang, 2021</xref>). Formation of endolysosomes creates an acidic compartment, which acts as the principal site of lysosomal acid hydrolase activity within the cell and we have previously shown using live cell microscopy that acid hydrolase activity increases after content mixing between the kissing or fusing organelles, consistent with an increase in acidity. After endocytic lysosome reformation (ELR), the resulting lysosomes are not acid hydrolase active and have a more neutral pH. Variation in luminal pH of lysosomes/endolysosomes at different stages of the regeneration cycle is compatible with older reports that lysosomes within an individual cell exhibit a wide range of pH(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Yamashiro and Maxfield, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Butor et al., 1995</xref>) and with more recent data showing that less acidic lysosomes are preferentially distributed closer to the cell periphery in HeLa cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>), although this latter finding has been challenged(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Ponsford et al., 2021</xref>). The subcellular localization of lysosomes is determined by the balance between the small GTPases RAB7 and ARL8 which interact with kinesin and dynein microtubule motors via different effectors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Jordens et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Rosa-Ferreira and Munro, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Jongsma et al., 2020</xref>), as well as an ER-located ubiquitin ligase system that contributes to their immobilisation in the perinuclear region(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Jongsma et al., 2016</xref>). It has been shown that driving lysosomes to a peripheral location in HeLa cells, by experimentally manipulating the concentration and/or activity of ARL8b, RAB7a effectors and dynein, also results in luminal alkalinization(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The pH of individual endolysosomes and lysosomes is determined by the density and activity of the proton-pumping V-ATPase, counterion transport and passive proton leakage, likely via the TMEM175 channel(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Steinberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Mindell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Ishida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Maxson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). An active V-ATPase is essential for the low pH observed in many of these organelles and inhibition with the macrolide antibiotic bafilomycin A1 raises the mean pH of the organelles from 5.3 to 6.5(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Rennick et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, physiological regulation of the lysosomal V-ATPase in mammalian cells remains poorly understood. A mechanism of reversible assembly/disassembly of the V-ATPase V1 and Vo sub-complexes in response to different nutritional conditions has been described in yeast(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Parra and Kane, 1998</xref>), and increased assembly suggested as the basis of increasing acidification along the endocytic pathway in mammalian cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Lafourcade et al., 2008</xref>) as well as the increased acidification of lysosomes during dendritic cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Trombetta et al., 2003</xref>). Reversible V-ATPase assembly/disassembly also occurs in mammalian cells in response to amino acid starvation/re-feeding, where it is dependent on mTORC1 activity, such that when mTORC1 is active V1-ATPase subunits reside in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Stransky and Forgac, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ratto et al., 2022</xref>). It is notable that mTOR activity has also been shown to be necessary for ALR occurring in response to prolonged starvation or exogenous hydrogen peroxide(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In our present study we have explored the regulation of the V-ATPase during both endosome-lysosome fusion (ELF) and ELR in continuously fed cells by taking advantage of previous work in which we showed that the swollen sucrosomes formed after 24h fluid-phase uptake of sucrose are swollen endolysosomes which have recruited all of the terminal storage lysosomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bright et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bright et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequent fluid phase uptake of invertase initiates ELR, approximately synchronously, from all the sucrosomes. We have investigated whether V-ATPase assembly increases during ELF and if disassembly occurs during ELR. We have also examined whether disassembly is linked to the loss of RAB7 and whether changes in mTORC1 activity are required for alterations in the V-ATPase during ELR in continuously fed cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P5">Throughout our experiments, we have used NRK (normal rat kidney) fibroblasts, in which sucrosomes may be generated and lysosomes reformed, without activation of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bright et al., 2016</xref>). For many experiments we have used NRK cells transduced with retroviral vectors containing weak promoters to achieve stable expression of tagged proteins at mild levels of over-expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p><sec id="S3"><title>Sucrosomes are swollen endolysosomes containing active cathepsins in acidic lumens and from which less acidic lysosomes can be reformed</title><p id="P6">To study the localization of active cathepsins we used the cell-permeable pan-cathepsin activity-based probe BMV109, which is fluorescent after it covalently binds to cysteine cathepsins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Withana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Repnik et al., 2017</xref>), as well as membrane-permeable Magic Red cathepsin substrates, which liberate fluorescent cresyl violet after hydrolysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Creasy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bright et al., 2016</xref>). Using BMV109 avoided the problem of liberated cresyl violet potentially migrating to an acidic compartment other than its site of generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Ostrowski et al., 2016</xref>) and confirmed that in untreated NRK cells there is a population of late endocytic compartments observed by fluorescent dextran uptake that is cathepsin inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>), consistent with this population being reusable terminal lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bright et al., 2016</xref>). When NRK cells stably expressing LAMP1-EGFP were incubated with sucrose to form sucrosomes and treated with BMV109, the sucrosome lumens became fluorescent confirming that they contained active acid hydrolases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>), as previously shown with Magic Red cathepsin substrates and by acid phosphatase staining in EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bright 2016</xref>). Because the sucrosomes are swollen organelles it was possible, using confocal microscopy, to differentiate the luminal BMV109 fluorescence from the LAMP1-EGFP fluorescence on the limiting membrane, which was not achievable for the much smaller endolysosomes and lysosomes in control cells. Thus, we could monitor formation of sucrosomes and their collapse after invertase uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>) by measuring the colocalization (Pearson’s correlation coefficient) of BMV109 with LAMP1-EGFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1C</xref>). After invertase uptake, the Pearson’s coefficient returned to that in untreated cells by 2h, reflecting shrinkage of the sucrosomes rather than their complete loss, which was previously observed by EM in NRK cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bright et al., 1997</xref>), to be complete by ∼4 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bright et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To visualise the variation in pH of individual lysosomes, endolysosomes and sucrosomes, we used dual fluorochrome imaging after endocytic uptake of pH-sensitive dextran Oregon green (DexOG) together with pH-insensitive dextran Alexa (DexA) 647. In control, untreated NRK cells, less acidic organelles (green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>) were enriched at the cell periphery and more acidic organelles (cyan, turquoise and blue) enriched in the juxtanuclear region, as had previously been observed in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). When sucrosomes were formed, they were different shades of cyan and turquoise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig1D</xref>), consistent with them being cathepsin active(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bright et al., 2016</xref>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">FigS1A</xref> ie BMV pictures). After uptake of invertase for 8h, the peripheral, neutral lysosomes (green) had reappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig1D</xref>). Using cells in which the genetically encoded pH probe pHLARE(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Webb et al., 2021</xref>) was stably expressed, a shift to a higher proportion of organelles with pH &lt;4.5 was observed after formation of sucrosomes, which was reversed after invertase uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>). The lysosomal/endosomal compartment in control, untreated NRK cells expressing the probe had a mean pH of 5.18±0.04, in cells incubated with sucrose for 24h, 4.60±0.16 and in cells after subsequent 8h incubation with invertase, 5.11±0.12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1E</xref>).</p><p id="P8">In an initial experiment to test whether assembly/disassembly of V-ATPase may be responsible for the variation in pH observed, we generated a mixed cell population stably expressing EGFP-tagged V1G1, a ubiquitous isoform of the V1ATPase subunit G which is a peripheral stalk protein in the V-ATPase proton pump (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). A punctate distribution of V1G1-EGFP was observed as well as a cytosolic pool and the puncta colocalized well with Magic Red staining of cathepsin B activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1G</xref>). In addition, there was partial overlap of V1G1-EGFP-positive puncta with antibody staining of the endogenous Vo subunit Voa3 (TCIRG1), an isoform concentrated in late endosomes and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Toyomura et al., 2003</xref>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1H</xref>). It was noticeable that in the cell periphery there were many Voa3-positive puncta that were V1G1-EGFP-negative (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1H</xref>). Whilst this was consistent with V-ATPase disassembly being associated with an enrichment of alkalinized lysosomes towards the cell periphery, the variation in expression of V1G1-EGFP in different cells of the mixed population guided us towards studying the dynamics of V-ATPase subunits in clonal cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>V1 and Vo subunits of V-ATPase enter reformation tubules as ELR takes place from sucrosomes after addition of invertase</title><p id="P9">In clonal cell lines stably expressing either V1G1-EGFP or Voa3-EGFP and incubated with sucrose, clusters of sucrosomes were observed in which the EGFP-tagged proteins were localised to the rims of the organelles, the lumens of which were filled by cresyl violet when incubated with Magic Red cathepsin substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A, B</xref>). Following uptake of invertase, reformation tubules were formed as seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bright et al., 2016</xref>)and these were labelled with both the EGFP-tagged V-ATPase subunits when observed by live cell imaging in a confocal microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Video 1</xref>)). Confirmation that V1G1-EGFP was entering the tubules was obtained by correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) using thick sections from unroofed cells, which allowed more efficient immunolabelling than conventional immuno-EM on frozen thin sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A,B</xref>). Thus, disassembly of the V-ATPase does not occur as a reformation tubule is generated but could take place after scission as the reforming lysosome matures.</p><p id="P10">EM of unroofed cells also revealed that the clustered appearance of sucrosomes seen by fluorescence microscopy was due to filamentous tethers between the organelles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2C</xref>). Immunolocalization of the HOPS protein VPS18 by immunofluorescence microscopy showed its presence on sucrosomes and immuno-EM of unroofed cells showed sparse labelling close to/on the tethers suggesting that the tethering is mediated by the HOPS complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">FigS2D</xref>). The sparse labelling may be due to poor antibody access to epitopes in tightly packed tether arrays as previously discussed(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Davis et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Confocal microscopy demonstrated increased colocalization of RAB7a, RILP and the V1G1 subunit of V-ATPase during sucrosome formation and a decrease during lysosome reformation</title><p id="P11">To test if there was increased recruitment of the V-ATPase V1 subcomplex during sucrosome formation and loss during lysosome reformation and their relationship to the presence of RAB7a and RILP, we studied the colocalization of tagged proteins using confocal microscopy. Stably expressing mixed cell populations were generated by separately transducing a clonal cell line expressing LAMP1-mCherry with retroviral vectors encoding each of EGFP-tagged Voa3, V1G1, RAB7a, and ARL8b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">FigS2E</xref>). To avoid excessive perinuclear aggregation of endolysosomal organelles caused by overexpression of RILP ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cantalupo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Jordens et al., 2001</xref>), a clonal line of cells expressing LAMP1-mCherry and EGFP-RILP was generated and experiments were conducted after ∼85% depletion of endogenous RILP using siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2E, F</xref>). Colocalization of each EGFP-tagged construct with LAMP-mCherry was assessed by calculating Manders’ and Pearson’s coefficients in control, untreated NRK cells, cells after formation of sucrosomes and cells at different time points after incubation with invertase to initiate reformation of lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A-E</xref>). Colocalization of the EGFP-tagged integral membrane protein Voa3 and of ARL8b-EGFP with LAMP1-mCherry varied little throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). However, colocalization of the EGFP-tagged V1G1, RAB7a and RILP with LAMP1-mCherry increased when sucrosomes were formed and decreased after addition of invertase, with statistically significant decreases being observed at 4-8 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B-D,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3B-D</xref>). These data are consistent with reversible assembly/disassembly of the V-ATPase being associated respectively with gain/loss of RAB7a and RILP.</p><p id="P12">To study the colocalization of RAB7a with ARL8b, we generated a mixed cell population stably expressing EGFP tagged RAB7a and mCherry-tagged ARL8b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2E</xref>). We observed statistically significant changes in the colocalization coefficients for these two small GTPases during sucrosome formation and after 8h of lysosome reformation in these cells, which were greater for organelles in the outer ‘shell’ of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3F,G</xref>). The data were consistent with a reduced RAB7a density and an enrichment of ARL8b relative to RAB7a on peripheral lysosomes as observed previously in HeLa cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>), as well as the recruitment of these peripheral lysosomes into the sucrosomes and their reformation from the sucrosomes, although we did not pursue this further.</p><p id="P13">As was the case with V1G1-EGFP, RAB7a-EGFP also entered reformation tubules after invertase addition to cells containing sucrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3H</xref>), suggesting that its loss also occurs after scission as the reforming lysosome matures. Interestingly, the addition of the dynamin inhibitor dynasore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Macia et al., 2006</xref>), which has been shown to block dynamin-mediated cleavage of reformation tubules in ALR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Schulze et al., 2013</xref>), did not prevent the decrease in colocalization of V1G1-EGFP with LAMP1-mCherry after delivery of invertase to sucrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3H,I</xref>), although transmission EM showed the appearance of ‘daisy chains’ of swollen organelles with interconnected lumens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3J</xref>), consistent with the inhibition of fission of the reformation tubules, which we still observed forming and retracting in live cell microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Video 2</xref>). These colocalization date suggest that cleavage of reformation tubules is not necessary for the disassembly of the V-ATPase, even though disassembly most likely occurs post-cleavage in untreated cells. We also saw no effect of latrunculin A, which prevents actin polymerisation, on the decrease of the colocalization of V1G1-EGFP with LAMP1-mCherry after delivery of invertase to sucrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3H,I</xref>), despite actin polymerisation being implicated in V-ATPase sorting in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carnell et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Biochemical evidence that the V1 subcomplex of V-ATPase is recruited during sucrosome formation and lost during lysosome reformation</title><p id="P14">The data from the microscopy colocalization experiments were consistent with reversible assembly and disassembly of V-ATPase during sucrosome formation and lysosome reformation, but to measure this directly we carried out subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting of the LAMP1-mCherry/V1G1-EGFP cells. Immunoblotting of membrane fractions has previously been used to show the role of amino acid availability in modulating V-ATPase assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Stransky and Forgac, 2015</xref>), so we prepared 100,000g membrane pellets from control, untreated cells, cells with sucrosomes and cells in which lysosome reformation was occurring after invertase uptake. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting under conditions in which the loading of LAMP1-mCherry was equal for each membrane pellet, showed that the ratio of the Vo subunit Vod1 to LAMP1-mCherry was constant in each membrane pellet, but the ratio of V1G1-EGFP to Vod1 increased in membrane pellets from cells containing sucrosomes and decreased back to untreated cell levels after 8h incubation with invertase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A,B</xref>). These data strongly supported the hypothesis that there was reversible assembly and disassembly of V-ATPase during sucrosome formation and lysosome reformation. However, there was considerable variability between experiments and the 100,000g membrane pellets contain membranes from many organelles other than endolysosomes/sucrosomes and lysosomes.</p><p id="P15">To quantify the assembly/disassembly of V-ATPase on endolysosomes/sucrosomes and lysosomes more directly we modified previously published rapid magnetic isolation procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Rofe and Pryor, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Tharkeshwar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Prentzell et al., 2021</xref>), following uptake of magnetic dextran (DexoMAG, Mr 10,000) into our NRK cells. Our well characterised protocol for accumulating fluorescent dextran (Mr 10,000) and gold labelled bovine serum albumin in NRK lysosomes and endolysosomes after fluid phase endocytosis for 4h followed by a 20 h chase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bright et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bright et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bright et al., 2016</xref>) had to be modified because significant numbers of cells detached from the substrate after uptake of DexoMAG with this protocol. A shorter loading 1h uptake/2h chase protocol was therefore used after we confirmed, using fluorescent dextrans, that this resulted in the same intracellular colocalization with preloaded dextran (4h uptake/20h chase) as a 4h uptake/24h chase protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4A</xref>). Using rapid magnetic isolation, we were able to generate enriched fractions of endolysosomes/lysosomes (LysoPrep) from the untreated LAMP1-mCherry/V1G1-EGFP cells and also sucrosomes (SucroPrep) following uptake of sucrose. Transmission EM showed that the LysoPreps were enriched with electron dense lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>), which were labelled with anti-LAMP1 in immuno-EM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4B</xref>, whereas the SucroPreps had few, if any, electron dense lysosomes and were characterised by the presence of swollen electron lucent organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>), which were labelled on their limiting membrane with anti-LAMP1 in immuno-EM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4C</xref>).

Further SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of LysoPreps and SucroPreps from untreated cells, cells with sucrosomes and sucrososome-containing cells incubated with invertase for 4h, under conditions in which the loading of LAMP1-mCherry was equal for each, showed that whereas the ratio of the endogenous Vo subunit Vod1 to LAMP1-mcherry was constant in each preparation, the ratio of V1G1-EGFP and endogenous V1A1 to LAMP1-mCherry increased in the SucroPreps and decreased back towards control cell LysoPrep levels after incubation with invertase for 4 or 8h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4F,G</xref>).

We therefore examined whether V1G1-EGFP is dynamically associated with the sucrosome membrane, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. As was previously observed for GFP-tagged subunits on synaptic vesicles, the fluorescence signal from the V1G1-EGFP labelled sucrosomes rapidly recovered after photobleaching with, in this case, a t1/2 of ∼45s, suggesting that the pool of V1G1-EGFP on the membrane is in dynamic equilibrium with the cytosolic pool and rapidly exchanging with it (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Video 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C, D</xref>).

We did see a variable and non-significant reduction in phosphorylation after 30 min treatment, but did not investigate this further because it was not apparent after 24h, the starting point for our lysosome reformation experiments.

Our data add to previous evidence showing that reversible assembly/disassembly is a major mechanism of regulating V-ATPase activity and the luminal pH of endolysosomes/lysosomes in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Trombetta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Lafourcade et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Stransky and Forgac, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ratto et al., 2022</xref>). Our data, from continuously fed NRK cells, contrast, but are not incompatible, with previous reports of changes in nutrient status, specifically amino acid availability, resulting in mTORC1 regulation of V-ATPase assembly, such that when mTORC1 activity declines, the V1 sub-complex assembles with the Vo sub-complex to form functional protein pumps to acidify lysosomal organelles(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ratto et al., 2022</xref>). The finding that V-ATPase disassembly during ELR is not dependent on mTOR activation is consistent with a recent report suggesting that lysosome reformation in ELR in fed cells uses a mechanism that does not require mTOR activation to provide reformed lysosomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Rodgers et al., 2022</xref>). This mechanism, suggested to require a phosphoinositide pathway, differs from that underlying ALR, which has been shown to require activation of mTORC1 in cells subjected to prolonged serum starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Yu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Analysis of events occurring during ELR has proved challenging because budding, tubulation and scission can occur rapidly and are not synchronised throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bright et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bissig et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, an approach to circumventing these problems has been developed using spinning disc microscopy and a rapid imaging/analysis workflow to quantitate events(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Rodgers et al., 2022</xref>). Our approach was different, taking advantage of our previous observation that the generation of sucrosomes in NRK cells does not activate autophagy or result in TFEB translocation to the nucleus(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bright et al., 2016</xref>) unlike in many other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Sardiello et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Higuchi et al., 2015</xref>).

This was in contrast to the integral membrane protein Voa3 and also ARL8b, whose colocalization with LAMP1-mCherry did not alter significantly. That the changes in colocalization of GFP-tagged V1G1 represented reversible assembly and disassembly of the whole V-ATPase during sucrosome formation and lysosome reformation was confirmed by the immunoblotting of magnetically enriched lysosome and sucrosome preparations (LysoPrep and SucroPrep), including those made following invertase uptake. Further evidence of increased V-ATPase assembly during endolysosome formation was obtained from the live cell experiments demonstrating the recruitment of cytosolic V1G1 to the endolysosome limiting membrane soon after the commencement of luminal content mixing during endosome-lysosome kissing and fusion.</p><p id="P23">Our findings about the colocalization of RAB7a and ARL8b with each other and with LAMP1, during sucrosome formation and lysosome reformation, are consistent with previous reports in other cell types of reduced RAB7a density and an enrichment of ARL8b relative to RAB7a on peripheral lysosomes compared to juxtanuclear lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>)as well as the proposal that the ARL8b effector SKIP together with HOPS recruits the RAB7a GAP TBC1D15 resulting in what has been termed RAB7a to ARL8b conversion with microtubule plus-end mediated transport of organelles to the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Jongsma et al., 2020</xref>). Our colocalization data do not distinguish between either the increased colocalization of RAB7a with LAMP1 after formation of sucrosomes being simply a reflection of the recruitment of peripheral RAB7a-depleted/LAMP1-enriched lysosomes into the swollen sucrosomes as a result of fusion events with RAB7a-positive late endosomes or the direct recruitment from a cytosolic pool onto the sucrosomes, although we did not investigate this further. Nevertheless, the data support a model in which increased RAB7a on the endolysosomal membrane is involved in the recruitment of the V1 subcomplex and loss of RAB7a is linked to reversible V-ATPase disassembly during ELR, in continuously fed cells. Exactly where and when disassembly occurs during lysosome reformation is unclear. We observed that GFP-tagged V1G1 and RAB7a are present in the reformation tubules extending from sucrosomes after invertase uptake, but very depleted on the reformed, less acidic, peripheral lysosomes. This suggests that loss of the V1 ATPase subcomplex occurs after scission of the reformation tubules at a stage equivalent to the protolysosome in ALR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Yu et al., 2010</xref>) (Lenardo). However, scission itself is not absolutely necessary for loss of the V1 subcomplex, because we showed that the dynamin inhibitor dynasore, which had a profound morphological effect consistent with preventing scission, had no effect on the reduction in colocalization of GFP-tagged V1G1 with LAMP1-mCherry after invertase uptake into sucrosomes.</p><p id="P24">Our data suggest that it is unlikely that the previously well documented binding of the RAB7a effector RILP to the VIG1 subunit of the V-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">De Luca et al., 2014</xref>) is sufficient to explain fully the reversible assembly/disassembly of the V-ATPase. The published observation that over-expression of the dominant negative T22N mutant of RAB7a resulted in strongly reduced accumulation of the acidotropic probe LysoTracker Red, provided compelling evidence that RAB7a is directly involved in regulating endolysosomal/lysosomal pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bucci et al., 2000</xref>). However, for RILP, the situation is more confused with reports of RILP depletion causing increased organelle acidification (lysotracker intensity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">De Luca et al., 2014</xref>), having little or no effect (cresyl violet accumulation)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ratto et al., 2022</xref>) or causing alkalinization (ratiometric imaging) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). We saw no effect of RILP depletion on pH in NRK cells stably expressing the lysosomal pH probe pHLARE, on the increase of colocalization of EGFP-tagged V1G1with LAMP1-mCherry during formation of sucrosomes or on its decrease following invertase uptake. Further complexity is suggested by evidence that RILP remains bound to V1G1 in cells expressing the T22N mutant of RAB7a, but is no longer recruited to lysosomal membranes and that RILP also promotes VIG1 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">De Luca and Bucci, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">De Luca et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P25">It has been proposed that mTORC1-regulation of lysosomal acidification is mediated through reversible, DMXL1-dependent and not RILP-dependent, recruitment of the V1 subcomplex to lysosomal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ratto et al., 2022</xref>). In experiments supporting this proposal, genetic ablation of DMXL1 strongly suppressed lysosomal V1B2 levels as well as accumulation of the acidotropic dye cresyl violet under basal as well as mTORC1-inhibited conditions, consistent with it also being involved in V-ATPase assembly in untreated, continuously fed cells. Mammalian DMXL1 and WDR7 (also known as raboconnectin 3α and 3β) are related to components of the yeast V-ATPase assembly factor known as the RAVE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jaskolka et al., 2021</xref>). Intriguingly, both these proteins have been implicated as RAB7a interactors by proximity biotinylation. They were identified as ‘strong hits’ using proximity biotinylation with a mitochondrially-localised form (MitoID) of constitutively active (Q67L) RAB7a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gillingham et al., 2019</xref>) and were also identified as potential interactors of both wild type and constitutively active RAB7a, with greatly reduced interaction with dominant negative (T22N) RAB7a, using BioID (data set S1 in(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Yan et al., 2022</xref>)). Thus, given the dynamic equilibrium observed between V1 and Vo subunits, implied from the rapid recovery times in our FRAP experiments, it may be that the loss of RAB7A during lysosome reformation, and thereby the inability to recruit DMXL1/WDR7, is sufficient to result in net disassembly of the V-ATPase, although we have not tested this directly. We also cannot rule out the possible involvement of a variety of other reported factors that bind V-ATPase and have been suggested to regulate its assembly, disassembly, stability and/or activity, including several members of the TLDc (TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) LysM domain catalytic) family of proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Eaton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Tan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Wilkens et al., 2023</xref>), lysosomal STK11IP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Zi et al., 2022</xref>) and the cytosolic chaperonin tailless complex polypeptide 1 ring complex (TRiC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Merkulova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ratto et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P26">The lack of change in colocalization of ARL8b with LAMP1 throughout the lysosome fusion and regeneration cycle compared with the increase in colocalization of RAB7a with LAMP1 during sucrosome (swollen endolysosome) formation and decrease during ELR, raises a number of questions that require future investigation. These include whether RAB7a is recruited to the sucrosomes from the cytosol, despite this seeming unlikely because, as has been pointed out in a different context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Schleinitz et al., 2023</xref>), the presence of ARL8b on organelles, should counteract the recruitment of RAB7a, through ARL8b’s attraction of the RAB7a GAP TBC1D15.

Live cells were imaged using a x63 1.4 NA Plan Apochromat oil-immersion lens using an Argon laser line at 488 nm (used to excite EGFP) and a Diode laser line at 561 nm (used to excite cresyl violet). Laser power was attenuated to 2% of maximum to minimize photobleaching and phototoxicity. The detector pinholes were set to give a 0.5-0.9 μm optical slice. Pixel dwell times were 1.27μs using multitracking (line switching) with a line average of 4. Photobleaching of the EGFP in a region of interest (ROI) was achieved using 20 iterations of the 488 nm laser line at 100% intensity and post-bleach images were collected at 5-15s intervals to determine recovery of EGFP fluorescence into the bleached region. Cresyl violet fluorescence was used to identify the bleached organelle when an entire sucrosome was selected as the ROI. Acquisition and quantitation of the fluorescence intensity of the limiting membrane or tubules was performed using Zen software (Zen Black 2.3 SP1). Line scans were used to determine the peak membrane intensity at 8 points and the mean value recorded for each timepoint of the FRAP time-lapse series.
