Underlying molecular mechanisms remain, however, elusive. Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence for a BK<sub>Ca</sub> splice variant localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane of murine and human BC cells (mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>). Through a combination of genetic knockdown and knockout along with cell permeable BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel blocker, we show that mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> modulates overall cellular and mitochondrial energy production and mediates the metabolic rewiring referred to as the “Warburg effect”, thereby promoting BC cell proliferation in the presence and absence of oxygen. Additionally, we detect mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> and BK<sub>Ca</sub> transcripts in low or high abundance, respectively, in clinical BC specimens. Together, our results emphasize, that targeting mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> could represent a treatment strategy for selected BC patients in future.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>BK<sub>Ca</sub></kwd><kwd>biosensors</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>K<sup>+</sup></kwd><kwd>K<sup>+</sup> channels</kwd><kwd>metabolic reprogramming</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub></kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>Warburg effect</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cancer represents a complex disease characterized by unconstrained cell proliferation and the spread of malignant cells in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kalia, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Seyfried and Shelton, 2010</xref>). It is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with millions of new cases diagnosed each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Sung et al., 2021</xref>). Globally, the most prevalent form of cancer represents breast cancer (BC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Sung et al., 2021</xref>). Despite many available anti-cancer treatments which largely depend on the steroid and epidermal growth factor (HER2) receptor status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Dunnwald et al., 2007</xref>), cancer cells frequently escape from existing therapies due to adaptions (P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the identification of novel targets and therapeutic strategies that confer benefits for at least a subset of patients, whose cancer displays specific molecular or cellular features, is of utmost relevance.</p><p id="P3">Important factors that emerged as new cancer targets are ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Li and Xiong, 2011</xref>). Especially alterations in the expression levels and function of potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) channels are critically related to cancer malignancy and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Li et al., 2023</xref>, p. 0). One of these channels represents the calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and voltage-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel of large conductance (BK<sub>Ca</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>). Canonical BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels usually localize in the plasma membrane (PM) of cells, and contribute to the regulation of the cytosolic K<sup>+</sup> content, the PM potential (ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub>), cell cycle, and cell motility, as well as regulatory volume, changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Burgstaller et al., 2022a</xref>). Opening of BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels results in K<sup>+</sup> efflux, increasing the electrochemical driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the cancer cell and affecting pathological cell growth and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Ouadid-Ahidouch and Ahidouch, 2013</xref>). Accordingly, in BC cells (BCCs), an upregulation of BK<sub>Ca</sub> has been associated with increased malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Huang and Jan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Oeggerli et al., 2012</xref>). However, besides their localization in the PM, several K<sup>+</sup> channels, including BK<sub>Ca</sub>, have also been identified in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) (mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>), a topic which has been extensively reviewed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Checchetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kulawiak and Szewczyk, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Szabo and Szewczyk, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Szewczyk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Wrzosek et al., 2020</xref>). mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> was first described by Siemen et al. in a human glioma cell line more than 20 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Siemen et al., 1999</xref>). So far, mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> has further been found e.g. in bronchial epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dabrowska et al., 2022</xref>), neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Douglas et al., 2006</xref>), skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Skalska et al., 2008</xref>), and in cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Xu et al., 2002</xref>). In the latter, a splice variant, the BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC isoform containing a unique C-terminal exon of 50 amino acids forms the functional mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> channel at the IMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Singh et al., 2013</xref>). Little, however, is known about the molecular identity of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> in other cell types, and mitochondrial localization of BK<sub>Ca</sub> in BCCs has not been demonstrated so far.</p><p id="P4">Cancer cells show increased energy demands due to their high proliferation rates. Thus, tumor cells compensate for their elevated energy demand by increasing metabolic activities and adapting to nutrient-poor metabolic niches in the tumor microenvironment, allowing them to overcome oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)-dependent mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Eales et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gross et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Jang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Nazemi and Rainero, 2020</xref>). This metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, frequently referred to as the “Warburg effect”, describes the phenomenon that cancer cells rather secrete lactate to the extracellular matrix (ECM), instead of utilizing pyruvate to fuel the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Warburg, 1924</xref>). This lactate secretion towards the ECM was shown to promote multiple microenvironmental cues causing tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">de la Cruz-López et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, extracellular K<sup>+</sup> may also impair effector T-cell function, and, thus, the anti-tumor immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Eil et al., 2016</xref>), while, within the cancer cell, functions of several glycolytic enzymes rely on K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bischof et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gohara and Di Cera, 2016</xref>). Further, the presence of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> contributes to the K<sup>+</sup> entry into the mitochondrial matrix to interfere with mitochondrial volume changes and the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Krabbendam et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, (mito)/BK<sub>Ca</sub>-dependent mechanisms may severely affect energy production pathways and the resulting energy supply of cancer cells.</p><p id="P5">To elucidate how BK<sub>Ca</sub> contributes to increasing BCC malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Oeggerli et al., 2012</xref>), we utilized BK<sub>Ca</sub> pro- and deficient human BCC lines including MDA-MB-453 and MCF-7 cells, and primary murine BCCs derived from the mouse mammary tumor polyoma middle T-antigen (MMTV-PyMT)-induced wild type (WT) or BK<sub>Ca</sub> knock-out (BK-KO) BC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>). In these cells, either isoforms of BK<sub>Ca</sub> were expressed, or BK<sub>Ca</sub> was pharmacologically blocked by paxilline or iberiotoxin, two frequently used inhibitors of BK<sub>Ca</sub> that either penetrate the cell or act exclusively at PM localized channels, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Candia et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zhou and Lingle, 2014</xref>). These approaches were complemented by patch-clamp experiments, and by measuring the cellular ion homeostasis and metabolism with fluorescence live-cell imaging, extracellular flux analysis and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based approaches.</p><p id="P6">Our results emphasize that the presence of BK<sub>Ca</sub> in the IMM affects mitochondrial bioenergetics, thereby increasing BCC malignancy. This effect was specifically mediated by the DEC isoform of BK<sub>Ca</sub>, i.e., mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>. Functional expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC was validated by single-channel patch-clamp recordings BCC-derived mitoplasts. Importantly, we also identified BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC expression in a subset of BC patient biopsies using nanostring-based mRNA expression analysis. Finally, mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> crucially contributed to murine and human BCC proliferation and hypoxic resistance, and its activity increased lactate secretion resulting in higher extracellular acidification rates, even in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="P7">Combined, our analyses provide, for the first time, a mechanistic link between functionally relevant mitochondrial BK<sub>Ca</sub> isoforms in cancer cells and the promotion of the Warburg effect.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Functional characterization of BK<sub>Ca</sub> expression in BCCs</title><p id="P8">First, we assessed the functional expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub> in established human BCC lines by performing whole-cell patch-clamp experiments. Primary BCCs obtained from transgenic, BC-bearing MMTV-PyMT WT or BK-KO mice were used as positive or negative controls, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>). Patch-clamp experiments revealed that depolarizing stimuli delivered in 20 mV increments induced K<sup>+</sup> outward currents that were larger in MMTV-PyMT WT compared to BK-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1A and 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S1A and S1B</xref>). To validate that these increased currents were elicited by BK<sub>Ca</sub>, we pharmacologically inhibited the channel by using either paxilline or iberiotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Candia et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zhou and Lingle, 2014</xref>). While the current remained unaffected by these treatments in MMTV-PyMT BK-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>), peak currents (I<sub>max</sub>) were drastically reduced in MMTV-PyMT WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Further, we analyzed the plasma membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub>) in these cells using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye Dibac4(3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adams and Levin, 2012</xref>) as well as current clamp experiments. The ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub> was more polarized in MMTV-PyMT WT compared to BK-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>), as expected, due to the presence of hyperpolarizing BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels in WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">N’Gouemo, 2014</xref>). Current clamp experiments unveiled a basal ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub> of -44.0 ± 2.4 mV and -32.2 ± 2.1 mV for MMTV-PyMT WT and BK-KO cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Iberiotoxin treatment equalized the ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub> of the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). In line with these findings, using a recently developed, genetically encoded K<sup>+</sup> sensor, NES lc-LysM GEPII 1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bischof et al., 2017</xref>), we found reduced cytosolic K<sup>+</sup> concentrations ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>) in MMTV-PyMT WT cells under basal conditions (83.07 ± 5.8 mM for WT ctrl vs. 121.2 ± 7.1 mM for BK-KO ctrl), which increased to the BK-KO cell level in response to iberiotoxin treatment (109.8 ± 10.8 mM for WT + IBTX vs. 114.6 ± 9.8 mM for BK-KO + IBTX) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S1D and Fig. S1E</xref>), explaining the PM depolarization. Subsequently, we recorded current-voltage relationships using the human BCC lines MDA-MB-453 and MCF-7, expressing either high or low levels of BK<sub>Ca</sub> mRNA transcripts, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>). Analysis of the outward currents activated by depolarization demonstrated a paxilline- and iberiotoxin-sensitive current in MDA-MB-453 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1F</xref>), indicative for functional BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels in their PM, but not in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1G</xref>), which is well in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>). Based on the almost non-existent level of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-mediated PM currents in MCF-7 cells, we utilized these cells to express different BK<sub>Ca</sub> isoforms fused to a red fluorescent protein (RFP). Therefore, we either used an earlier identified mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Singh et al., 2013</xref>), namely BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>, or the same channel lacking C-terminal amino acids including the DEC exon, hereinafter referred to as BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). We hypothesized, that, in analogy to cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Singh et al., 2013</xref>), the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> in MCF-7 cells may yield a functional channel present in the IMM. To test this, MCF-7 cells were first transiently transfected either with RFP fused to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor (RFP-GPI) directing RFP to the PM, or linked to a cytochrome c oxidase subunit 8 (COX8) mitochondrial leading sequence, yielding a mitochondrial targeted fusion protein (mtRFP) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1H</xref> and grey dotted lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Analysis of the colocalization of mtRFP with MitoGREEN, a dye that specifically stains the mitochondrial matrix, resulted in high colocalization scores, while a low overlap was observed for RFP-GPI transfected MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>, grey dotted lines). Subsequently, the same experiments were performed with MCF-7 cells expressing BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup> or BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>. Although the mitochondrial localization score was lower for BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> compared to mtRFP (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1H</xref>), this BK<sub>Ca</sub> variant showed a significantly higher overlap with the mitochondrial dye than BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1I</xref>). Despite rather moderate colocalization scores of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> with MitoGREEN, on the level of single mitochondria, the RFP signal derived from BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> surrounded the MitoGREEN fluorescence signal originating from the mitochondrial matrix, as expected for a K<sup>+</sup> channel located in the IMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1I</xref>). As not all RFP signal in the BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> overexpressing MCF-7 originated from mitochondria, we investigated the PM localization of the two channel isoforms by patch-clamp. Compared to native MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>), both, BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup> and BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>, increased the PM outward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S1J and S1K</xref>). Despite comparable expression levels of the RFP signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1L</xref>), presence of BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup> caused significantly bigger currents across the PM compared to BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>), indicative either for i) higher intracellular abundance or ii) major functional differences of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>. Importantly, the conductance of both channels was sensitive to the BK<sub>Ca</sub> blockers paxilline and iberiotoxin, as treatment of the cells with both compounds resulted in PM conductance values comparable to those of native MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1E and 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs.

Interestingly, the elevated basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> of WT cells was reduced to the BK-KO cell level in response to paxilline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>), but not by iberiotoxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>), which is a peptide-based pore-blocking toxin that cannot pass the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Candia et al., 1992</xref>). To validate the observed basal differences in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>, we additionally performed ionomycin-based calibrations by chelating intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, followed by Fura-2 saturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F-H</xref>).

Since an accumulation of K<sup>+</sup> within the mitochondrial matrix may oppose mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Checchetto et al., 2021</xref>), we assessed the effects of functional BK<sub>Ca</sub> expression on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> utilizing 4mtD3cpV, a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor targeted to the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Palmer et al., 2006</xref>). Again, BCCs were treated with ATP to investigate the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> upon cell stimulation. In MMTV-PyMT WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>) as well as MDA-MB-453 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>), functional expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub> reduced basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub>.

Presumably, by facilitating K<sup>+</sup> fluxes across the IMM, BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> expression reduces the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and thus the resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the mitochondrial matrix. Basal differences in all of the utilized cell lines under the different conditions were additionally validated by ionomycin treatment, followed by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs.

These opposing effects are expected, as BK<sub>Ca</sub>-mediated uptake of K<sup>+</sup> into the ER should limit the Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake capacity of this subcellular compartment, while functional channel expression at the PM might increase the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to fuel [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>.

Hence, we analyzed the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as a measure of lactate secretion, i.e. glycolytic activity in MMTV-PyMT and MDA-MB-453 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Burgstaller et al., 2021a</xref>). ECAR measurements unveiled an increased basal ECAR of MMTV-PyMT WT compared to BK-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3A and 3B</xref>). Subsequently, we performed a mitochondrial stress test by injection of Oligomycin-A, FCCP, and Antimycin-A, which increased ECARs in both cell types due to ATP-synthase inhibition, mitochondrial uncoupling and complex III blockade, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Maximal ECAR, received upon FCCP injection, was elevated in WT compared to BK-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).

Moreover, in MDA-MB-453 cells iberiotoxin treatment did neither affect basal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D and 3E</xref>) nor maximal ECARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Contrary to MMTV-PyMT WT cells, however, paxilline increased basal and maximal ECAR in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3E and 3F</xref>), suggesting that the cell lines examined strongly differ in their metabolic settings or in other H<sup>+</sup> releasing processes contributing to extracellular acidification.</p><p id="P14">Next, we investigated the oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Burgstaller et al., 2021a</xref>).

Again, in MDA-MB-453 cells, paxilline treatment had an opposite effect to the observations that were made in MMTV-PyMT WT cells, as paxilline treatment increased the OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3J-L</xref>), potentially due to the increased supply of oxidative phosphorylation with glycolytic substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3D-F</xref>).

Mitochondrial ATP reportedly responds most dynamically to energy metabolism perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Depaoli et al., 2018</xref>).

Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesis is caused by uncoupling of the respiratory chain and it is considered as an indicator of mitochondrial stress, which, among other reasons, promotes mutagenesis and BCC progression. In this regard, mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> may serve as an “uncoupling” protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gałecka et al., 2021</xref>), triggering ATP synthase to operate in reverse mode to consume instead of producing ATP, thereby counteracting the dissipation of the proton gradient and consequently the loss of ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub>. Consequently, the lack of ATP must be compensated, e.g. by accelerating glycolysis. To investigate this assumption, we performed glucose uptake measurements using 2-NBDG, a fluorescent glucose analogue, which is taken up via glucose transporters (GLUTs), phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) isoforms to generate 2-NBDG-6-phosphate and subsequently remains within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bischof et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs.

Unexpectedly, we found that MMTV-PyMT BK-KO cells showed a higher rate of glucose uptake and phosphorylation compared to WT cells under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4N</xref>). To unravel the role of mitochondria in contributing to glucose uptake by supplying ATP to HKs, we next performed these experiments in the presence of FCCP, which disrupts mitochondrial ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Losano et al., 2017</xref>). If ATP-synthase works in forward mode, FCCP treatment should reduce or even prevent oxidative ATP production, and, subsequently, ATP-dependent 2-NBDG phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4H</xref>). Contrary, if ATP-synthase works in reverse mode, it may compete with HKs for ATP, and FCCP treatment should abolish this competition, leading to increased 2-NBDG phosphorylation in BCCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4I</xref>). Interestingly, our experiments unveiled increased 2-NBDG uptake in MMTV-PyMT WT and reduced uptake in BK-KO cells upon mitochondrial depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4N</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs.

These analyses revealed that mitochondria are less effective in assisting 2-NBDG uptake and phosphorylation in MMTV-PyMT WT cells, while they “support” these processes in BK-KO cells under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4O</xref>). To test whether the changes in 2-NBDG uptake are sensitive to pharmacological modulation of BK<sub>Ca</sub>, we performed a similar set of experiments in the presence of paxilline or iberiotoxin. While iberiotoxin treatment did not have any effect, paxilline treatment shifted the activity of the ATP-synthase to the ATP-supplying “forward” mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4O</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs.

Notably, mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> was detected at a frequency of 15% in 210 patches of MDA-MB-453 mitoplasts and at a lower frequency of 6% in 127 mitoplast patches of MMTV-PyMT WT cells. These numbers may, however, underestimate the actual abundance of the channel, as only a small area of the mitoplast is examined with each patch. Importantly, this channel was absent in 76 mitoplast patches from MMTV-PyMT BK-KO and 58 mitoplast patches from MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>). These findings provide evidence that the molecular entity for the K<sup>+</sup> channel derives from the nuclear <italic>Kcnma1</italic> gene, which is ablated in the MMTV-PyMT BK-KO.</p><p id="P22">These experiments were further corroborated by immunoblotting experiments using whole-cell lysates and sub-cellular homogenates of different purity. We detected BK<sub>Ca</sub>, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase as a marker of the PM, cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) as a marker of mitochondria and TMX1, which localizes to ER membranes in these samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5D</xref>). A protein band corresponding to BK<sub>Ca</sub> was identified not only in whole-cell lysates, but also in isolated mitochondria. Importantly, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase was absent in the latter protein fraction, confirming the purity of the mitochondrial preparation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5D</xref>). These data confirm the presence of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, potentially BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC, in the utilized BK<sub>Ca</sub> proficient BCCs.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> promotes the Warburg effect, triggers cellular O<sub>2</sub> independency and stimulates BCC proliferation</title><p id="P23">Based on the observed influence of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> on glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism, we addressed, whether the channel contributes to the Warburg effect, commonly observed in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bischof et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Warburg, 1924</xref>). Therefore, we assessed the Warburg index (WI) by investigating the cytosolic lactate concentration ([LAC]<sub>cyto</sub>) over-time using Laconic, a FRET-based lactate sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">San Martín et al., 2013</xref>). [LAC]<sub>cyto</sub> was followed in response to either inhibiting mitochondrial metabolism by administration of NaN<sub>3</sub>, a complex IV inhibitor, to stop pyruvate consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Leary et al., 1998</xref>), or upon subsequent inhibition of lactate secretion towards the ECM via monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1) using BAY-8002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Quanz et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6A and 6B</xref>). Indeed, MMTV-PyMT WT cells exhibited an increased WI compared to BK-KO cells under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>), indicating that the presence of BK<sub>Ca</sub> favors lactate secretion rather than TCA-dependent utilization of pyruvate. Paxilline, but not iberiotoxin treatment reduced the WI in WT cells to the BK-KO level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). The WI profiles of MDA-MB-453 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>) and MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>) showed the same sensitivity towards paxilline, while in the latter the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>, but not BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup>, stimulated the WI. To validate the contribution of the different BK<sub>Ca</sub> isoforms, endogenous BK<sub>Ca</sub> transcripts in MMTV-PyMT and MDA-MB-453 cells were targeted using specific siRNAs targeting either the major BK<sub>Ca</sub> isoforms or specifically the DEC exon of BK<sub>Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>). Cell treatment with the respective siRNAs reduced the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub> or BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B and S6C</xref>). Interestingly, the knockdown of BK<sub>Ca</sub> interfered with the WI in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6F and 6G</xref>). This effect was reproduced by specific silencing of the BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6F and 6G</xref>), indicating that BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC-derived mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> channels stimulate the Warburg effect in BCCs.</p><p id="P24">As glycolytic metabolites and ATP fuel cell proliferation, we investigated the proliferation rates of MMTV-PyMT WT, MMTV-PyMT BK-KO, and MDA-MB-453 cells over-time in the absence or presence of paxilline or iberiotoxin. Using MTT-assay, corroborating previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>), these analyses revealed faster proliferation of WT compared to BK-KO cells under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref>). Interestingly, paxilline, but not iberiotoxin treatment, reduced the proliferation of MMTV-PyMT WT to the level of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref>). These effects were also observed in MDA-MB-453 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I</xref>). Since the MTT assay is also a redout for mitochondrial function, we additionally performed immunofluorescence-based detection of Ki-67, a frequently used marker of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dowsett et al., 2011</xref>). This approach confirmed the MTT data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs.

Next, we studied whether the increased WI affects the proliferation rate of these BCCs at low O<sub>2</sub> tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Nazemi and Rainero, 2020</xref>). Colony formation assays (CFAs) revealed an increased hypoxic resistance of MMTV-PyMT WT compared to BK-KO cells, as the number and size of colonies lacking BK<sub>Ca</sub> was reduced upon O<sub>2</sub>-deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6G</xref>). In sum, these data demonstrate a malignancy-promoting effect of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> in BCC.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> is of potential clinical relevance</title><p id="P25">To determine the clinical relevance of our findings, we investigated whether BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC transcripts are present in primary BC tissue. Therefore, the mRNA expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub> and BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC was analyzed by nanostring analysis in bulk tumor biopsies isolated from 551 BC patients. Remarkably, all 551 samples tested positive for BK<sub>Ca</sub> mRNA expression, with 10 of the samples showing significant expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC above the log2 expression threshold of 5.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6K and 6L</xref>). Importantly, if BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC was expressed, the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub> well correlated with the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.6060, p = 0.008) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6M</xref>).</p><p id="P26">In sum, our experiments emphasize the presence of BK<sub>Ca</sub> in different intracellular organelles including the ER and vesicles of the secretory pathway, yielding its PM localization. At these sites, BK<sub>Ca</sub> modulates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and regulates ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub>. K<sup>+</sup> efflux across the PM may additionally affect glycolysis. Importantly, functionally relevant BK<sub>Ca</sub> also locates in the IMM of BCCs, promoting, presumably by the K<sup>+</sup> accumulation in the matrix following channel activation, ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub> depolarization and consequently ATP-synthase activity in reverse mode as well as a depletion of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub>. These profound ionic and bioenergetic changes ultimately trigger the proliferation of BCCs in a low oxygen environment, as found in solid tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6N</xref>). Taken together, functional expression of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> could possibly denote a prognostic or therapeutic marker for BC patients, and its pharmacologic modulation could represent a novel anti-cancer treatment strategy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">Here, we demonstrate for the first time that BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC (mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>) is functionally expressed in BCCs. BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC modulates BCC metabolism, stimulates the Warburg effect, and accelerates cell proliferation rates in the presence and absence of O<sub>2</sub>. These tumor- and malignancy-promoting effects were sensitive to BK<sub>Ca</sub> inhibition using the cell-permeable BK<sub>Ca</sub> inhibitor paxilline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zhou and Lingle, 2014</xref>), but not the cell-impermeable blocker iberiotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Candia et al., 1992</xref>), indicating that intracellular BK<sub>Ca</sub>, presumably mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, mediates malignant BCC behavior and tumor development.</p><p id="P28">In line with recent single-cell RNA sequencing data of 26 primary breast tumors (S. Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Wu et al., 2021</xref>), we found high transcript levels for BK<sub>Ca</sub> throughout the analyzed BC samples, in addition to BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC, albeit in a much smaller subset of BC. The analyzed BC samples were, however, all positive for hormone receptors. Whether BK<sub>Ca</sub> expression is different in hormone receptor negative specimens hence needs to be further investigated. Further, we confirmed functional BK<sub>Ca</sub> expression in the PM of MMTV-PyMT WT and MDA-MB-453 cells, while MMTV-PyMT BK-KO and MCF-7 cells showed no or very low PM BK<sub>Ca</sub> currents. Therefore, MCF-7 cells represented a suitable model to investigate the effects of BK<sub>Ca</sub> over-/expression on the metabolic homeostasis of human BCC. If the low BK<sub>Ca</sub> expression correlates with hormonal receptor status or alternatively with human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) expression levels must be clarified by future studies. Interestingly, however, recent data have shown that BK<sub>Ca</sub> is overexpressed in triple-negative BC, a fact that led the authors to draw similar conclusions to ours, that BK<sub>Ca</sub> may represent a novel anti-cancer treatment strategy for selected BC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Sizemore et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, similarly to cardiac myocytes (CM), expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC yielded mitochondrial localization of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC, although its abundance in the IMM appeared less pronounced compared to CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Singh et al., 2013</xref>). While a direct comparison is difficult as plasmid transfections may have caused unexpected effects, our finding that BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> caused significantly reduced currents across the PM compared to BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup> putatively confirm its increased intracellular abundance.</p><p id="P29">Based on the potential impact of BK<sub>Ca</sub> on the cellular ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub> and ion balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Burgstaller et al., 2022a</xref>), we conducted an in-depth investigation of the (sub)cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Across the BCCs examined, we observed that functional BK<sub>Ca</sub> expression modulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> dynamics. These alterations showed, however, differential sensitivities to BK<sub>Ca</sub> inhibitors in MMTV-PyMT WT and MDA-MB-453 cells. While basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> in MDA-MB-453 cells was reduced by both, paxilline and iberiotoxin treatment, MMTV-PyMT WT cells were only sensitive to paxilline. Examination of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> confirmed the results from [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>, as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> levels increased with paxilline and iberiotoxin in MDA-MB-453, but only upon paxilline exposure in MMTV-PyMT WT cells, suggesting differential effects of intracellular and PM-localized BK<sub>Ca</sub> on Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in these cells. Interestingly, in MCF-7 cells, both BK<sub>Ca</sub> splice variants mediated the opposing effects on the basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> levels, which either in- or decreased, respectively, upon transient BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup> or BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> expression. This is expected as the transitory hyperpolarization and the efflux of K<sup>+</sup> due to the opening of PM BK<sub>Ca</sub> provides the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into cytoplasm, while a BK<sub>Ca</sub>-mediated K<sup>+</sup> increase within the ER, presumably through PM-directed channels crossing the ER membrane in the secretory pathway, would oppose the Ca<sup>2+</sup> refiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Burgstaller et al., 2022a</xref>). Moreover, these results are in line with the higher proliferative capability of BK<sub>Ca</sub> proficient BCCs due to the manifold roles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as second messenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Burgstaller et al., 2022a</xref>). Importantly, however, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> of BK<sub>Ca</sub> proficient MMTV-PyMT WT and MDA-MB-453 cells was exclusively sensitive for paxilline, and it was specifically affected by the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>, but not by BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup>, in MCF-7 cells, suggesting that this Ca<sup>2+</sup> pool is exclusively controlled by intracellular BK<sub>Ca</sub>.</p><p id="P30">Subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> alterations could reportedly alter cellular bioenergetics, as Ca<sup>2+</sup> directly regulates metabolic enzymes and activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, extracellular flux analysis, LC-MS-based metabolomics and fluorescence-based live-cell imaging confirmed, that the observed alteration in sub-cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis caused by BK<sub>Ca</sub>, especially mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, has severe effects on cell metabolism. Our data further emphasize, that the presence of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, as confirmed by mitoplast patch-clamp and Western blot analysis of isolated mitochondria, depolarizes BCC mitochondria, which is in line with a previous study showing an impact of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> activation on ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kicinska et al., 2016</xref>). mitoBKCa-dependent depolarization of ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub> in turn triggers cellular glucose dependency and reverses the activity of the mitochondrial ATP-synthase to consume ATP for restoring ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub>. Finally, BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC-derived mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> channels promote the Warburg effect and ultimately stimulated proliferation rates of BCCs. Our data fit earlier findings from glioma cells, where an O<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> was observed, which probably increased the hypoxic resistance of these cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Gu et al., 2014</xref>). It may seem contradictory that mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> is highly expressed in CM, which are among one of the most oxidative cell types known. It is, however, important to mention, that CM, under physiologic conditions, do not show a metabolic Warburg setting, which is a common phenomenon of cancer cells propelling their O<sub>2</sub> independency, due to the hypoxic microenvironment. Moreover, it was demonstrated recently that the absence of (mito)BK<sub>Ca</sub> does not alter physiologic cardiac function. Only upon induction of ischemia and reperfusion injury, a lack of (mito)BK<sub>Ca</sub> promoted the susceptibility of the heart to cell death, resulting in increased infarction size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Frankenreiter et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, it can be concluded that (mito)BK<sub>Ca</sub> only played a role under conditions where mitochondria are, due to the absence of O<sub>2</sub>, not properly functioning. Taking this view into account, the results derived from CM are consistent with our findings in BCCs, as (mito)BK<sub>Ca</sub> mediates the resistance to hypoxic stress to BCC.</p><p id="P31">Excessive production and release of lactate, a hallmark of the Warburg effect, leads to extracellular acidification, subsequently creating a microenvironment that promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis as well as the resistance to anti-tumor immune responses and therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">de la Cruz-López et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Nazemi and Rainero, 2020</xref>; P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).

Although only a small proportion of patients was positive for BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC expression, this finding could be of considerable clinical relevance considering the link between mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> function and BCC metabolism. Importantly, the design of our study likely underestimates the incidental number of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC positive BC, as i.) only hormone-receptor positive BC specimens were included, and ii.) bulk-tumor mRNA was analyzed, hampering the detection of low-abundant or tightly regulated transcripts against a strong background of non-cancer cells present in bulk tumor tissues. Finally, due to the small number of positive hits (N=10 positive <italic>versus</italic> N=541 BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC negative specimens) and the lack of (sufficient) follow-up information in some of these cases, we are currently unable to correlate BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC expression with, for example, treatment response or survival. Thus, future studies are warranted to show how the tumor’s BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC status can help to predict or therapeutically improve standard chemo-endocrine treatments. The rather low abundance of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC in the clinical samples, however, is in agreement with our mitoplast patch clamp experiments with mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>-mediated K<sup>+</sup> currents being detected at frequencies between 6 to 15%, suggesting that either a small proportion of mitochondria express functional mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, or that the abundance of the channel per mitochondrion is low, requiring sensitive mechanistic approaches for its detection.</p><p id="P33">In summary, our data highlight a potentially druggable mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> isoform in BCCs, whose molecular entity is mainly formed by the <italic>Kcnma1</italic> encoded BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC splice variant.

After 7 days, cells were washed carefully 2x with PBS and fixed for 30 minutes on ice using 2% PFA in PBS. Meanwhile, a solution of crystal violet (0.01% w/v) was prepared in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, cells were washed 2x with PBS and incubated in the crystal violet solution (Sigma Aldrich Chemie GmbH) for 60 minutes after fixation, followed by excessive washing with ddH<sub>2</sub>O until a clear background was obtained. Plates were dried at room temperature for at least 12 hours before images were captured using an Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare UK Limited, Buckinghamshire, UK). Analysis was performed using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Breast cancer patient study</title><p id="P67">A subset of 551 primary tumor specimens with available archival tumor blocks were obtained from a prospective, observational multicenter adjuvant endocrine treatment study of 1286 post-menopausal HR-positive breast cancer patients recruited between 2005 and 2011 (German Clinical Trial Register DRKS 00000605, “IKP211” study). Study inclusion and exclusion criteria have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Schroth et al., 2020</xref>). Patients had received standard endocrine treatment, i.e. tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, or switch regimens between both. Ethics approval was obtained from the Medical Faculty of the University of Tuebingen and the local ethics committees of all participating centers in Germany. Informed patient consent was obtained from all participants as required by institutional review boards and research ethics committees. All patient data were de-identified prior inclusion in this study.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Nanostring nCounter gene expression analysis</title><p id="P68">Gene expression analysis was performed according to manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, total RNA from human primary tumors of the IKP211 study (Quick-DNA/RNA FFPE, ZymoResearch, Freiburg, Germany) was extracted from 10 µm sections of FFPE tissues with at least 20% tumor cell content. Samples were enriched for tumor tissue by microdissection. A total of 250 ng RNA was subsequently hybridized with target-specific capture and color-coded reporter probe sets in a pre-warmed thermal cycler at 65°C for 20 h. In the post-hybridization process, the total volume was increased to 32 µl with RNase-free water. Fluorescence count measurements were immediately conducted in the Nanostring nCounter System. Data were analyzed using nSolver 4.0 and normalized to housekeeping genes. ABCF1, NRDE2, POLR2A, PUM1 and SF3A1 served as housekeepers. Probes used for Nanostring nCounter gene expression analysis are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>.</p><sec id="S32"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P69">Statistical analysis was performed using Prism8 software (GraphPad Software, Boston, USA). All data were tested for normal distribution using D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test. A two-tailed Unpaired t-test or Welch’s t-test were used for statistical comparison of normally distributed data, depending on whether the variances of the populations were comparable or significantly different as tested by an F-test. A two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was used for pairwise comparison of non-normally distributed data. Comparison of &gt;2 data sets was done either using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison (MC) test or Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA test followed by Games-Howell’s MC test for normally distributed data, depending on whether the variances were comparable or significantly different. A Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s MC test was performed if data were not normally distributes. The statistical tests used are indicated in the figure legends. p-values of ≤0.05 were considered as significant, where * or #p≤0.05, ** or †p≤0.01 and *** or ‡p≤0.001. No priory sample size estimation was performed.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS189148-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d90aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S33"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) with individual grants to RL and LM.
