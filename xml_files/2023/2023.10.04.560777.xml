In naive mice, RBD-TM mRNA vaccines against ancestral SARS-CoV-2, Beta, Delta, Delta-plus, Kappa, Omicron BA.1 or BA.5, all induced strong humoral responses against the target RBD. Multiplex surrogate viral neutralization (sVNT) assays indicated broad neutralizing activity against a range of variant RBDs. In the setting of a heterologous boost, against the background of exposure to ancestral whole spike vaccines, sVNT studies suggested that RBD-TM vaccines were able to overcome the detrimental effects of immune imprinting. Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 RBD-TM booster vaccines induced serum antibodies with 12 and 22-fold higher neutralizing activity against the target RBD than their equivalent whole spike variants. Boosting with BA.1 or BA.5 RBD-TM provided good protection against more recent variants including XBB and XBB.1.5. Each RBD-TM mRNA is 28% of the length of its whole-spike equivalent. This advantage will enable tetravalent mRNA vaccines to be developed at well-tolerated doses of formulated mRNA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Waves of coronavirus infections resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic are caused by mutants of SARS-CoV-2 that evade humoral immunity previously acquired by way of either vaccination or viral infection. Although vaccination with an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 whole spike vaccine provides protection against serious illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), boosting immunity with ancestral vaccines is ineffective at preventing infection by Omicron variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). To address this shortcoming, bivalent mRNA spike vaccines have been introduced encoding BA.1, or more recently BA.5, spike proteins in addition to the ancestral spike protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Unfortunately, the effectiveness of existing whole spike vaccines to prevent infection by Omicron variants appears to be compromised by the phenomenon of immune imprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), a recognised problem which can limit the effectiveness of vaccination as viruses mutate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Evasive variant coronaviruses acquire mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which allow the virus to evade antibodies that bind strongly to the ancestral RBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Individuals who have been exposed to the ancestral spike protein are primed to produce antibodies that bind to a range of different epitopes within this large 1273-amino acid protein. Subsequent vaccination with mRNA, encoding Omicron variants of whole spike protein, results in a significant boost in production of antibodies against ancestral epitopes, rather than focussing the immune system on induction of new antibodies that improve the ability of polyclonal antiserum to neutralize the variant RBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p id="P3">To protect ageing and vulnerable populations from future infections by evasive mutants, next generation COVID vaccines will need to overcome the problem of immune imprinting. To address this need we developed a new platform (RBD-TM) designed to focus immune responses on new antigenic epitopes resulting from mutations in the RBD. The protein coding sequences of our RBD-TM mRNA vaccines are constructed by fusing a cDNA encoding the appropriate RBD domain by way of a short spacer to cDNA encoding the ancestral transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). The complete RBD-TM mRNAs have similar design features to those used in the approved whole spike vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), and are formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in an analogous manner.</p><p id="P4">In this manuscript we describe: (i) our initial preclinical studies comparing ancestral RBD-TM vaccine with ancestral whole spike vaccine; (ii) the development of a Beta variant (K417N, E484K, N501Y) RBD-TM vaccine which was later manufactured for human use and has undergone evaluation in a Phase 1 clinical trial; (iii) preclinical experiments in naïve mice to test immune responses to a range of variant RBD-TM vaccines, including Delta, Delta-plus, Kappa, Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 vaccines; and (iv) experiments in mice to simulate real-world vaccination against a background of exposure to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 whole spike protein. The study shows that RBD-TM mRNAs provide an adaptable platform for production of prophylactic vaccines with the potential to protect elderly and vulnerable individuals from infection by emerging coronavirus variants. A Phase 1 clinical study of the Beta RBD-TM mRNA as a fourth-dose booster vaccine has been completed. Interim data from the trial is available in preprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and has been submitted for publication in a separate manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Immunogenicity induced by ancestral RBD-TM and whole spike mRNA vaccines</title><p id="P5">The components of the RBD-TM mRNA COVID-19 vaccine platform are shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A-1D</xref> and are described in the methods section and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1</xref> and S2. The RBD-TM mRNA is 28% of the length of whole spike mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and is designed to be expressed as a membrane-anchored monomeric RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Unless otherwise described, this vaccine was delivered in an LNP with low content (0.15-0.25 mole%) of PEGylated lipid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). An initial prime and boost experiment was carried out at doses of 1, 3 or 10µg mRNA to determine whether the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 RBD-TM vaccine induced immunity in naïve BALB/c mice. Virus neutralization (VNT) studies using an early isolate of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus (VIC01) or a Beta variant virus indicated that strong antibody responses were induced at doses of mRNA above 1µg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Neutralization titres determined using the Beta variant virus were consistently lower at all three doses of mRNA. At the dose of 3µg, which we subsequently established is adequate for vaccination in mice, ID50 values were 1621 + 644 against VIC01 and 154 + 52 against the Beta isolate (mean + sem, n=5). When the mice were challenged (see methods) on day 65 with VIC2089, a SARS-CoV-2 variant that had acquired the N501Y mutation in common with the Alpha variant, all three doses of ancestral RBD-TM vaccine protected the lungs from infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). To compare the immune responses of mice vaccinated with either RBD-TM or whole spike mRNAs, we carried out prime and boost vaccination at either 1 or 5µg mRNA. Ancestral RBD-specific antibody titres determined three weeks after the prime or boost (i.e. day 21 or 42) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1G and 1H</xref>. VNT by serum samples collected on day 42 was evaluated using VIC01 or the Beta variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). At each dose the RBD-TM was more potent than whole spike although the antibody titres had reached a limiting value for either vaccine at the 5μg dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). The high potency of the RBD-TM is possibly because the RBD-TM mRNA encodes 3.6-fold more RBD units than the same mass of whole spike mRNA. ID50 values for neutralization of VIC01 after two 5μg doses of whole spike or RBD-TM mRNA were 1277 + 507 and 2693 + 714 (mean + sem, n = 5) respectively. This difference was not significant, probably a result of both vaccines being close to saturating the immune response against the target RBD at the 5μg dose. The higher activity of antisera against VIC01 after two doses of RBD-TM versus whole spike at the 1μg dose was significant (p &lt; 0.01, t-test) as were the differences in mean VNT50 values against the Beta virus at either dose (p &lt; 0.05 at both 5μg and 1μg doses, t-test). These differences were not significant when evaluated by ANOVA. The VNT studies suggested showed that a dose of 1μg whole spike mRNA failed to induce a robust neutralizing antibody response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). Surrogate sVNT studies were carried out in multiplex to evaluate the ability of mouse serum to inhibit of binding of a range of RBD variants to human ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1J and 1K</xref>). Details of the mutation in each RBD are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>. 5μg doses of whole spike vaccine induced sVNT50 values greater than 100 for all variants other than Mu and Omicron BA.1 and BA.2. The same mass of RBD-TM vaccine induced consistently higher sVNT50 values for all variants with titres above 100 for the two Omicron variants. Mean % neutralization data for four dilutions of serum samples are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Development of a Beta variant RBD-TM mRNA vaccine for clinical evaluation</title><p id="P6">In mid-2021 we began preparing for clinical evaluation of the RBD-TM platform by developing a vaccine against the Beta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Prior to the emergence of Omicron in late 2021, Beta was the VOC which had acquired the most consistent ability to evade immunity induced by ancestral vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> outlines the preclinical data supporting the development of the clinical Beta RBD-TM vaccine. Prime and boost studies were carried out in BALB/c mice vaccinated with doses between 0.1 and 10μg mRNA. Antibody titres on day 21 after the priming dose suggested that the dose-response relationship was close to linear over the range 0.1-3μg against the target Beta RBD or ancestral RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>). Titres were consistently higher against the target Beta variant and could be assessed using ELISA against either Beta RBD or ancestral RBD-coated plates. Antibody titre was below 103 after 0.1μg doses, even after the boost dose at day 42 or 56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C and 2D</xref>). Serum collected on day 56 was evaluated by VNT using ancestral VIC01 or the Beta variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). A 3μg dose induced adequate protection, producing mean VNTID50 values of 723 + 166 and 283 + 53 (mean + sem, n = 5) against Beta and VIC01 respectively. The higher activity against the target variant was not significantly different at n = 5 (p = 0.057). In a second study using a different batch of vaccine we extended the dose range to 10μg. Antibody titres and virus neutralization data at day 56 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2F and 2G</xref>.</p><p id="P7">The data are in good agreement with the earlier experiments and shows that antibody responses were not enhanced by increasing the dose from 3 to 10μg. Multiplex sVNT studies indicated that ACE2 binding of all RBD variants tested was strongly inhibited by serum samples collected on day 56 after 2x 3μg doses of Beta RBD-TM, suggesting that the Beta vaccine induced broad spectrum activity. The highest sVNT50 values were observed against the Beta, Gamma and Mu variant RBDs, all of which share the E484K mutation. Inspection of mean % neutralization data at various dilutions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>), revealed that although protection against Beta, ancestral and Alpha RBDs was similar at doses of 3 and 10μg, there was a noticeable increase in inhibition of ACE2-binding by other variants, including Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 at the higher dose, suggesting that broader spectrum activity could be gained by using higher doses of RBD-TM vaccines.</p><p id="P8">In preparation for manufacture of the clinical Beta RBD-TM vaccine, we considered whether our LNP formulation would perform adequately in comparison with those used in the approved mRNA vaccines (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">discussion</xref> for more detail). To evaluate this, we tested immunity induced by 3μg of our Beta RBD-TM mRNA in each of four alternative LNP formulations. The formulations differed in the choice of ionizable lipid (50 mole% MC3 or ALC-0315) and also in the mole% of PEGylated lipid used (1.5% or 0.15% DMG-PEG). Our mRNA vaccines were usually formulated using MC3 and 0.15 mole% DMG-PEG (see the discussion section). A more standard LNP formulation is MC3 with 1.5 mole% DMG-PEG. By swapping out MC3 for ALC-0315 we tested a formulation (50 mole% ALC-0315 and 1.5% DMG-PEG) which was closer to that used in the BioNTech/Pfizer COVID vaccine (Comirnaty), which contains 46.3 mole% ALC-0315 and 1.6 mole% of the PEGylated lipid ALC-0159. We also tested the 50 mole% ALC-0315 formulation with 0.15% DMG-PEG. A comparison of the four LNP formulations tested is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. All four formulations produced strong immune responses. Antibody titres for the ALC-0315/1.5% DMG-PEG formulation were significantly higher than for the corresponding 0.15% DMG-PEG formulation when tested against ancestral RBD-coated plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A, 3C and 3D</xref>). The antibody titres were not significantly different to those induced by the MC3 formulations when tested against target Beta RBD-coated plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B and 3D</xref>). VNT studies confirmed that all four formulations induced serum samples with ID50 values that were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). In all cases protection against viral infection was more effective against the target Beta strain. Mice were challenged with live Beta SARS-CoV-2 virus. Viral titres in the nasal turbinates or lungs were evaluated on day 3. All four vaccines protected mice from challenge by live virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3F and 3G</xref>). To extend our evaluation of alternative formulations and comparison of the RBD-TM vaccine with whole spike vaccines, we vaccinated mice with either ancestral RBD-TM mRNA or whole spike mRNA at doses of 1 or 5μg, but this time using LNPs containing ALC-0315, cholesterol, DSPC and DMG-PEG2000 in the mole ratio 46.3: 42.7: 9.4: 1.6. This formulation differs from the formulation used for Comirnaty only in the identity of the PEGylated lipid. Antibody titres and VNT data are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>. The data confirms the higher potency of the RBD-TM versus whole spike vaccine. Both antibody titres and VNT data compared favorably with the analogous data obtained after vaccination with our MC3 50 mole%/DMG-PEG 0.15 mole% formulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), again giving confidence that we could prepare an RBD-TM vaccine for clinical evaluation using the latter formulation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Activity of the Beta RBD-TM mRNA vaccine in Syrian hamsters and Sprague Dawley rats</title><p id="P9">A hamster challenge study was carried out according to the methods described in the Supplementary data file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). This study was carried out in parallel with the evaluation of a protein Beta RBD-Fc adjuvanted by coadministration with MF59 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). At doses of 3, 10 or 30μg, the RBD-TM vaccine was unable to induce full protection against infection with either ancestral or Beta SARS-CoV-2. A marginal reduction in viral titres in oropharyngeal swabs was observed but not in hamster lung tissue. With the protein Beta RBD-Fc vaccine we observed partial protection in hamsters rather than the complete protection seen in mice. These data suggest that hamsters may not respond well to RBD vaccines, on observation supported by Zhang et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). A toxicity study to support the development of the clinical Beta RBD-TM vaccine was carried out in Sprague-Dawley rats by an independent contract research organization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). For toxicity purposes the rats received three doses of 50μg Beta RBD-TM mRNA which was later used as the highest dose in the clinical study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). High mean antibody titres greater than 105 were present in the rat serum from after three doses of RBD-TM vaccine in either male (n = 15) or female (n = 15) rats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>VNTs and multiplex sVNTs reveal breadth of immunity induced by alternative RBD-TM vaccines</title><p id="P10">The RBD-TM platform can be rapidly tuned to target emerging variants with mutations in the RBD domain. We vaccinated naïve mice with a range of alternative RBD-TM vaccines targeting Delta, ‘Delta-plus’, Kappa or Omicron BA.1. Data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S8-10</xref>. The Delta variant vaccine induced serum with a spectrum of activity against other variants that were in accordance with our expectations. Mean % neutralization was greatest against the Delta RBD, strong against ancestral and Alpha, weaker against Beta, Gamma and Mu, and weaker still against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>). The Delta-plus vaccine showed tight er neutralization of early variants but was weaker than Delta against BA.1 and BA.2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The Kappa variant RBD-TM proved to be a remarkably broad-spectrum vaccine. After two doses of Kappa vaccine, the mouse serum samples strongly inhibited ACE2 binding of all variants, including BA.1 and BA.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast the BA.1 RBD-TM vaccine produced strong inhibition of BA.1 and BA.1 RBDs but weak activity against all other earlier variants. When Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 emerged, we tested these serum samples using BA.4 virus in VNT studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) and the BA.4/BA.5 RBD (which is identical) in sVNT studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). The data from these assays were aligned in that the BA.1 vaccine induced serum samples that could neutralize BA.1 and BA.2 but not BA.4/BA.5. The broader neutralizing capacity of higher doses of vaccine can be observed again in the estimates of neutralizing activity of serum from mice after two doses of 3 or 10μg BA.1 RBD-TM vaccine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>). No further increases in activities after doses of 10μg were evident against BA.1 or BA.2 RBDs, but mean % neutralization values at each dilution were higher against the early pre-Omicron variants after 10μg doses versus 3μg doses. Recently, our multiplex sVNT assay was extended to include beads coupled to the RBDs of XBB, XBB.1.5 and SARS-CoV-1. The remarkable breadth of activity of the Kappa RBD-TM was further demonstrated, showing induction of strong responses even at a dose of 0.3μg against BA.5, XBB, XBB.1.5 and encouraging activity against SARS-CoV-1 at 3μg (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Heterologous boost experiments in mice demonstrate that RBD-TM mRNA vaccines can overcome immune imprinting</title><p id="P12">In early heterologous boost experiments we vaccinated mice with two 5μg doses of ancestral whole spike mRNA, subsequently administering a third booster vaccine with 5μg doses of mRNA encoding either ancestral whole spike, Beta whole spike or Beta RBD-TM. The protocol for these experiments is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref> shows that all animals had consistent antibody titres after the first and second doses of ancestral whole spike. On day 91, three weeks after the boost, there was evidence of a slight elevation in titres of Beta RBD-specific antibodies after boosting with the Beta whole spike vaccine but a significantly elevation after boost with the Beta RBD-TM vaccine. This boost was maintained at day 125 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Omicron BA.1 RBD-specific antibody titre was also significantly elevated after boosting with the Beta RBD-TM. This boost may be explained in part by the 3.6-fold higher molar dose of RBD that is provided by an equal mass of RBD-TM vaccine. In more recent experiments to test boosting with Omicron variant vaccines we compared the RBD-TM vaccines as a function of mass equivalent or molar equivalent doses. As before, mice were administered doses of ancestral whole spike mRNA vaccine (8μg per dose in this experiment) on days 0 and 21. On day 56, whole spike and RBD-TM Omicron BA.1 vaccines were tested according to the booster protocol shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>. Group C mice received the equivalent mass of 8μg RBD-TM, group D received 2μg RBD-TM (90% of the equivalent molar dose of RBD). To investigate whether the reduced burden of LNP administered to group D could affect the immune response, we administered an additional 6μg irrelevant mRNA (encoding nanoluciferase), formulated in the same manner, to group E. The data from this experiment as assessed by sVNT is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5F-5K</xref>. The multiplex sVNT assay provides a rich set of data allowing comparison of neutralization titres across a range of variant RBDs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5F-5H</xref> show that enhanced immunity induced by Omicron BA.1 RBD-TM mRNA is not dependent on higher molar dose of RBD. The 2μg dose of RBD-TM was at least as effective as the 8μg dose, both of which produced elevated sVNT50 titres across the spectrum of variant RBDs.</p><p id="P13">In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5I-5K</xref> the data is arranged to allow direct comparison of the booster vaccines against specific RBDs, i.e. ancestral, Omicron BA.1 and the recently widespread variant, XBB.1.5. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref> shows that ancestral whole spike boost is more effective at neutralizing ancestral spike than the whole spike BA.1 vaccine. The RBD-TM vaccines are more effective, although in groups of 5 mice, the differences were not statistically different.

It is clear that the BA.1 RBD-TM vaccine is equally effective at 8μg or 2μg with or without the 6μg LNP-encapsulated nanoluciferase mRNA.</p><p id="P14">A similar heterologous boost experiment was carried out to evaluate BA.5 vaccines using doses of 5μg mRNA in all cases. The protocol for the experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>. Mice received two doses of ancestral whole spike on days 0 and 21, followed by boosts with either ancestral whole spike, BA.5 whole spike or BA.5 RBD-TM on day 56.

The fold enhancement over ancestral whole spike was 2.3 for BA.5 whole spike and 50 for BA.5 RBD-TM. With groups of 5 animals the mean sVNT50 values for BA.5 RBD binding were not statistically different (p=0.12), but as shown by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>, the same serum samples gave statistically significant differences when compared using XBB.1.5 RBD-coated beads.

In contrast, during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, many individuals required hospitalization. The whole-spike vaccines, combined with use of face-masks and social distancing measures, were effective in preventing hospital systems becoming overwhelmed with patients that required intensive care, or at least close monitoring. In late 2023, close to three years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mortality rate is considerably lower than it was during the first two years, but there are still many deaths occurring which are associated with COVID infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To reduce the incidence of COVID-related deaths, there is a need for broad-spectrum second-generation vaccines that can protect elderly and vulnerable individuals from infection by emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 or other known betacoronaviruses. Whole-spike mRNA booster vaccines have been modified over the past year to include mutations found in the RBD of Omicron variant BA.4/5. Initially, the updated vaccines were introduced as bivalent products including the ancestral spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The bivalent vaccines are more effective as boosters against Omicron than the ancestral spike alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), but the phenomenon of immune imprinting appears to limit the ability of variant whole-spike vaccines to induce high titres of new neutralizing antibodies against the emerging Omicron variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). The most recently updated whole-spike vaccines, which may offer more protection, target the XBB.1.5 variant, as recommended by the WHO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), however other variants such as EG.5 and BA.2.86 are currently increasing in prevalence.</p><p id="P18">The RBD-TM mRNA vaccine platform offers the opportunity to develop multivalent vaccines that can be adapted to combine relevant circulating variant SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to prevent infection as the virus mutates. The RBD-TM vaccine has several advantages. Most importantly, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, boosting with RBD-TM mRNAs, after two doses of ancestral whole spike vaccine, results in induction of new variant-specific antibodies, 20-50 times more effective in preventing binding of target RBDs to ACE2. Secondly, as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1G – 1K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>, on a mass basis the RBD-TM mRNA is more potent that its whole-spike equivalent. The two vaccine platforms are equipotent on a molar basis. This implies that it will be possible to administer tri- or tetra-valent RBD-TM vaccines without exceeding the 30-50μg doses of formulated mRNA that are currently in use. Data from our Phase 1 clinical study supported this hypothesis by confirming that 10μg RBD-TM mRNA provides an effective booster dose in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The reactogenicity of mRNA-LNP formulations is likely to limit any increase in total dose of mRNA beyond the current dose levels. Thirdly, in the setting of a real-world heterologous boost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), the RBD-TM induces antiserum which offers some protection against later RBD variants. For example, vaccination with 5μg BA.5 RBD-TM mRNA induced antisera with sVNT50 values greater than 1800 against the more recent Omicron variants, XBB (1825 + 673) and XBB.1.5 (5956 + 1465) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Experiments using the Beta RBD-TM vaccine indicated that VNTID50 values greater than 200-300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) were adequate to achieve full protection when the same mice were challenged with live virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3F and 3G</xref>). These data suggest that multivalent RBD-TM vaccines have the potential to protect against future escape variants. The design of multivalent vaccines is likely to improve when more data is available to help predict which RBD-TM variant vaccines have broad spectrum activity, as exemplified by the unexpected activity of the Kappa RBD-TM vaccine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S10</xref>).</p><p id="P20">The precise mechanisms of action of the RBD-TM and whole spike vaccines remain to be elucidated. We hypothesized that the presentation of the whole spike protein at the surface of cells might be an important determinant of the success of the approved mRNA vaccines. Hence, we decided to include the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the spike protein so that the translated protein would be expressed in an analogous manner as a membrane-anchored protein. We do not anticipate that RBD-TM trimers are formed, although we cannot rule out the possibility.</p><p id="P21">The tissues and cell types where protein translation occurs are critical to the induction of the immune response to whole-spike mRNA. It is known that muscle tissue translates the most protein after IM injection of mRNA formulated in LNPs, but the most important events may occur when LNPs interact with immune cells during their drainage to lymph nodes. This hypothesis is supported by our published work in which we studied the effect of LNP formulation and were able to correlate the translation of nanoluciferase reporter mRNA in lymphoid tissues with induction of immunity after IM injection of mRNA encoding ovalbumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We know from unpublished work that phagocytic cells (macrophages and DCs) take up LNPs and translate mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), but how this results in presentation to B cells or T cells is not known. We posit that, whichever cells are involved, the translation of RBD-TM mRNA occurs at the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum and the secretion signal sequence subsequently results in presentation of a plasma membrane-anchored RBD. We concluded early in our studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1G  – 1K</xref>) that, perhaps surprisingly, presentation of the RBD-TM in this way is equivalent, with respect to the molarity of RBD moieties, to presentation of RBD as a component of the trimeric whole-spike protein. This implies that the location of the RBD translated from RBD-TM mRNA and its subsequent processing by antigen-presenting cells is likely to be similar to the presentation of RBD antigens from whole-spike mRNA.</p><p id="P23">The LNP formulation used for the preclinical studies described here, and also for our Phase 1 clinical study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), made use of lipids that have been previously used in FDA-approved products for human use. The ionizable lipid, DLin-MC3-DMA, is used in Onpattro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), as are distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and cholesterol. The latter two ‘structural’ or ‘helper’ lipids are also used in the Moderna mRNA vaccine, <italic>Spikevax</italic>, as is the neutral PEGylated lipid, DMG-PEG<sub>2000</sub>, which we used throughout this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).</p><p id="P24">We used an LNP formulation with some differences to the ‘standard’ Onpattro formula, which uses ionizable lipid, cholesterol, DSPC and the PEGylated lipid, PEG<sub>2000</sub>-C-DMG, in the following ratio; 50:38.5:10:1.5 mole% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Firstly, we typically used a formula with reduced PEGylated lipid content, ie. 50: 39.85:10:0.15 mole%. Secondly, we reduced the total lipid content, usually characterized by an N/P ratio of 6, to a N/P ratio of 5, where N/P ratio denotes the molar ratio of DLin-MC3-DMA to nucleotide, i.e. the molar ratio of ionizable nitrogen atoms to anionic phosphate moieties. These changes have the effect of producing LNPs that are typically larger (in the 120-160nm range as compared to 60-100nm range) and which are more negatively charged than standard LNPs. By considering the available surface area and availability of PEGylated lipids, we estimate that, before administration, our LNPs have a reduced mantle of PEG at the LNP-water interface, which may affect uptake by phagocytic cells. However, we recognize that the surface properties of DMG-PEG<sub>2000</sub>-coated LNPs will be substantially changed, by interaction with lipoproteins and plasma proteins, when they reach the blood circulation after IM injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>).</p><p id="P25">The modifications in lipid molar ratios we made to the standard LNP formula were based on our previous, as yet unpublished, observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Prior to our work on the COVID vaccine we were investigating the effect of size, charge and PEGylated lipid content on biodistribution. We found that after intravenous (IV) injection, larger, more negatively charged particles are extracted to a lesser extent by the mouse liver. This results in a higher extent of mRNA translation in spleen versus liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). We posit that this redistribution, and reduction in liver uptake, is desirable for vaccination, in contrast with the aim of the Onpattro product which was designed for delivery of siRNA to the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p><p id="P26">The spleen/liver redistribution is evident when the PEGylated lipid content is reduced within the range 0.15-0.25 mole% PEGylated lipid and with N/P ratio = 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). We found that redistribution correlated with improved translation of reporter mRNA in phagocytic cells in the spleen and improved cell-mediated responses to vaccination of mice with mRNA encoding ovalbumin. The redistribution correlates with the observation by Siegwart and colleagues, who also showed that negative charge is associated with delivery to the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p><p id="P27">ELISAs and viral neutralization assays using serum from vaccinated naïve mice suggested that immunity against the target antigen was predictable, reproducible, and approximated to a linear function of dose of mRNA over the range 0.3 to 3μg. Antibody titres and VNTID50 titres were marginally higher at 10μg doses against the target variant, but the improvement in broad spectrum activity at higher doses was evident from the multiplex sVNT assays. This implies that design of multivalent RBD-TM vaccines will require careful analysis of the breadth of activity produced by specific mRNAs. The surprising strength and breadth of activity of the Kappa RBD-TM vaccine illustrates this point. Analysis of the data from multiplex sVNT assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) suggested that this is a precise and reliable approach for analyzing breadth of immune responses. The rank order of sVNT50 values was consistent with our expectations, based on the degree of similarity between target variant vaccine and each alternative RBD tested. When we were able to compare sVNT data with neutralization studies using viral infection of Vero cells, there was good agreement between the two assay methods. This supports data suggesting that neutralizing antibodies are predominantly bound to the RBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Consequently, we suggest that sVNT assays using serum from vaccinated mice will provide accurate predictions of protection induced by specific RBD-TM vaccines against emerging or pre-emergent RBD variants.</p><p id="P28">Since the onset of the COVID pandemic there has been interest in the potential of RBD-based vaccines, given the proportion of neutralizing antibodies that bind to the RBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). The majority of RBD vaccine candidates in clinical development are recombinant proteins, though there have been two notable mRNA candidates. A mRNA vaccine encoding secreted RBD (<italic>319-541</italic>), ARCoV-mRNA, was developed in China by Walvax/Abogen and is now approved for use in Indonesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Early in BioNTech/Pfizer’s clinical program, a secreted RBD fusion protein modified with the addition of a T4 fibritin-derived foldon domain, designed to form a trimeric complex (BNT162b1) was tested in a Phase 1 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). This candidate did not progress when the whole spike vaccine BNT162b2 was selected for its Phase 3 efficacy study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The RBD-TM platform described here has been evaluated in a joint Phase 1 clinical trial using the Beta variant RBD-TM in parallel with an adjuvanted Beta RBD-Fc protein vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Given that the ancestral vaccines offered comparatively good neutralization of the Beta variant, as compared to Omicron variants, it was not clear how well the RBD-TM vaccine was able to overcome immune imprinting in humans. A subsequent clinical efficacy study using a contemporary Omicron variant would be valuable.</p><p id="P29">How the membrane-anchored RBD-TM compares with secreted RBD vaccines in terms of mechanism of action and potency is not known but is currently under investigation. We were not aware of any other parallel developments of membrane-anchored mRNA RBD vaccines until a recent report of a Phase 1 clinical study of a self-amplifying RNA construct was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). The advantage of mRNA RBD-based vaccines is the speed with which the product can be modified as the virus mutates, and the potential for design of multivalent vaccines. The shorter RBD-TM design will allow multivalent vaccines to be produced without risking increased reactogenicity. The challenge will be to outflank the RBD mutation of the virus by anticipating the emergence of evasive mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), making use of the developing knowledge of likely hot-spots in the RBD, and deep scans that identify which mutations are tolerated without loss of ACE2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Study design</title><p id="P30">The objectives of the study were to determine: (i) whether RBD-TM mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were as effective as whole spike vaccines in mice; (ii) whether RBD-TM vaccines could be tailored to vaccinate against alternative variants of SARS-CoV-2 and produce broad spectrum vaccines; and, most importantly, (iii) to determine whether RBD-TM vaccines are able to induce new antibody production against new variants against a background of immune imprinting with ancestral whole spike protein. The preclinical studies also allowed us determine a suitable range of doses for a clinical study of an RBD-TM vaccine which was carried out in parallel with ongoing preclinical experiments. We used mice for the majority of the preclinical studies but also carried out some challenge tests in Syrian hamsters and a vaccine toxicity study in rats. For comparison of immune responses to vaccines, i.e. dose response studies, comparisons between RBD-TM and whole spike vaccines, or comparisons between formulations, the experiments were usually carried out using groups of five mice for each treatment. This number of mice per group was generally adequate to establish statistical significance and served to keep animal numbers within acceptable limits as approved by Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences animal ethics committee. Data were not excluded under any circumstances. To avoid investigator bias, serum samples from mice were coded so that the laboratory scientists carrying out ELISA and neutralization tests were unaware of which serum samples were under analysis. Biological variation of immune responses within groups of animals was generally greater than between experiments comparing replicate batches of vaccine formulations. Routine replicates using different batches were not carried out.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>RBD-TM mRNA production</title><p id="P31">The mRNAs used in this study were produced using HiScribe T7 mRNA synthesis kit (NEB, Australia) using linearized DNA produced by PCR amplification.

Plates were incubated at 37°C for four or five days before measuring cytopathic effect under an inverted phase contrast microscope. TCID50 was calculated using the Spearman and Krber method.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="P38">ANOVA tests with post-hoc multiple comparisons, and Student’s t tests, were calculated using GraphPad Prism</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS189418-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d157aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported primarily by grants from the Australian Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF), the Victorian State Government entity, mRNA Victoria.
