The G51D mutation causes early onset neurodegeneration with complex pathology. We used CRISPR/Cas9 in rats to introduce the G51D mutation into the endogenous <italic>Snca</italic> gene. Co-localisation immunostaining studies with synaptic proteins showed that αSyn<sup>G51D</sup> protein is no longer efficiently localised to synapses. Furthermore, biochemical isolation of synaptosomes from rat cortex demonstrated a significant depletion of αSyn in <italic>Snca<sup>G51D/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Snca<sup>G51D/G51D</sup></italic> rats. Unbiased proteomic investigation of the cortex identified significant synaptic dysregulation in <italic>Snca<sup>G51D/G51D</sup></italic> animals. Finally, we compared the propensity for Lewy-like pathology of <italic>Snca<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Snca<sup>G51D/G51D</sup></italic> rats by stereotaxically delivering αSyn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) into the pre-frontal cortex. At an early time-point, 6 weeks post-injection, we observed discrete Lewy-like structures positive for phosphoserine-129-αSyn (pS129-αSyn) only in <italic>Snca<sup>G51D/G51D</sup></italic> brains. At 26 weeks post-injection of PFFs <italic>Snca<sup>G51D/G51D</sup></italic> brains exhibited intense, discrete pS129-αSyn-positive structures, while <italic>Snca<sup>+/+</sup></italic> brains exhibited diffuse pS129-αSyn immunostaining. Quantification of discrete pS129-αSyn-positive structures revealed the striatum of <italic>Snca<sup>G51D/G51D</sup></italic> rats had significantly more Lewy-like pathology than <italic>Snca<sup>+/+</sup></italic> rats. In summary, this novel <italic>Snca<sup>G51D</sup></italic> rat model exhibits molecular characteristics of early synaptic dysfunction and is primed for αSyn pathology.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>α-synucleinopathies</kwd><kwd>G51D mutation</kwd><kwd>Lewy-like pathology</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>synaptic dysfunction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Most Parkinson’s disease cases are sporadic, and a relatively small number of cases are caused by <italic>SNCA</italic> multiplication or point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Singleton <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Chartier-Harlin <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).

The G51D point mutation, in exon 3 of <italic>SNCA</italic>, was discovered in 2013, and reported in a French, British and later a Japanese family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Kiely <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Lesage <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Tokutake <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). It is of particular interest, as the clinical manifestation of this mutation was that of early-onset and severe features of Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA), with clinical severity comparable to patients with a <italic>SNCA</italic> triplication mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Singleton <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, glial cell inclusions were observed in G51D patient brains on autopsy. The frontal cortex, hippocampus and posterior striatum were sites of observed pathology, in addition to the substantia nigra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kiely <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). The accelerated disease progression in G51D patients makes this an important mutation to study and to delineate the underlying pathological mechanisms of conditions linked with α-synucleinopathy.</p><p id="P3">Limited animal models incorporating the G51D mutation have been generated so far, and whilst data suggests that this mutation leads to dopaminergic cell loss and diminished survival in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Mohite <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>), this was not the case in a pig model (E46K, H50Q and G51D mutations combined, with H50Q no longer being regarded as pathogenic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). We generated a rat model of <italic>Snca<sup>G51D</sup></italic> using a CRISPR/Cas9 approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Morley <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). This overcomes limitations of other animal models incorporating transgenic overexpression, such as unknown transgene integration sites, variable transgene expression and pleiotropic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Nuber <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). We recently reported positron emission tomography data for our G51D rat model, showing an increase in dopamine turnover in the striatum in aged <italic>Snca<sup>G51D/G51D</sup></italic> rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Morley <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). However, there was no loss of dopamine production. This may suggest that in the rat, there are compensatory mechanisms mitigating the severity of dopamine loss observed in patients with the G51D mutation.</p><p id="P4">The first aim of this study was to characterise αSyn expression and its subcellular localisation in <italic>Snca<sup>G51D/G51D</sup></italic> and <italic>Snca<sup>+/+</sup></italic> rats. Based on the biophysical properties of αSyn<sup>G51D</sup> and its reluctance to form α-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Fares <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), we hypothesised mis-localisation of αSyn from the synapse. Secondly, we aimed to investigate if there is any dopaminergic cell loss and the presence of Lewy-like pathology. Finally, we show that pathology can be readily triggered in <italic>Snca<sup>G51D/G51D</sup></italic> and <italic>Snca<sup>+/+</sup></italic> rats using human wild-type αSyn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) injected stereotaxically into pre-frontal cortex, with mutant animals revealing an accelereated pattern of disease propagation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animals</title><p id="P5">All animal experiments were conducted under the Project Licence No. PC6C08D7D in accordance with Home Office regulations under the Animals Scientific Procedures Act (ASPA) 1986.

The combination of synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunction and the αSyn<sup>G51D</sup> mis-localisation from the synapse may be early events in the disease process, increasing the propensity for overt disease following a second disease trigger. Our disease-relevant model provided an opportunity to establish the underlying mechanism of the <italic>SNCA<sup>G51D</sup></italic> point mutation that exerts a severe clinical phenotype in patients. This may lead to new mechanistic insights and disease-modifying treatments for patients with conditions resulting from α-synucleinopathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary data</label><media xlink:href="EMS190410-supplement-Supplementary_data.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS190410-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d23aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS190410-supplement-Supplementary_Table_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d23aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr Emma Lane for assistance in setting up intracranial stereotactic injections, Lyndsey Boswell for immunostaining, Prof Patrik Brundin for experimental advice, Dr Samatha Eaton &amp; Prof Tom Wishart for advice and support of synaptosome isolation, William Mungall for rat husbandry and tissue collection, and the team in the Histology service at the Shared University Research Facilities (SuRF) at the University of Edinburgh.</p><sec id="S30"><title>Funding</title><p>S.W. was funded by the Wellcome Trust Tissue Repair PhD programme.
