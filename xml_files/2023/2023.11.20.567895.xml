As they are important candidates for microbiome-targeted interventions, the identification and characterization of keystones is a pressing research goal. Both empirical as well as computational approaches to identify keystones have been proposed, and in particular correlation network analysis is frequently utilized to interrogate sequencing-based microbiome data. Here, we apply an established method for identifying putative keystone taxa in correlation networks. We develop a robust workflow for network construction and systematically evaluate the effects of taxonomic resolution on network properties and the identification of keystone taxa. We are able to identify correlation network keystone species and genera, but could not detect taxa with high keystone potential at lower taxonomic resolution. Based on the correlation patterns observed, we hypothesize that the identified putative keystone taxa have a stabilizing effect that is exerted on correlated taxa. Correlation network analysis further revealed subcommunities present in the dataset that are remarkably similar to previously described patterns. The interrogation of available metatranscriptomes also revealed distinct transcriptional states present in all putative keystone taxa.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Microbiomes are characterized by diverse interspecific and microbe-environment interactions. The net outcome of microbial activities and interactions produces the observed community structure and function, and interactions are thought to be crucial for maintaining community stability and conferring resistance and resilience in the face of disturbance. Borrowing a concept from macro-ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), the idea of keystone species has intrigued many microbiologists as a potential ecological mechanism that facilitates community stability and resilience. Microbial keystones, whether defined at a species level or a higher taxonomic grouping, are characterized as highly interconnected taxa that exert a strong influence on the entire community, shaping the microbiome irrespective of their abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Loss of a keystone taxon from the community would be expected to disrupt the microbiome and cause major shifts in community composition and function. Their crucial role in maintaining community structure is what makes keystone taxa a particularly interesting target for human gut microbiome research.</p><p id="P3">The gut microbiome is essential for human physiological function and health by performing many important services including metabolizing complex food molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), training the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), and providing colonization resistance against pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Identifying keystone taxa in the healthy gut microbiome and understanding their role in the community could provide us with novel microbiome-targeted intervention strategies for dysbiosis-related diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular disease, and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Some species have been proposed as keystones in the human gut microbiome based on empirical evidence, such as <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) and <italic>Christensenella minuta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> was shown to facilitate the growth of butyrate producers by degrading host-derived mucosal sugars in a mucus-dependent cross-feeding community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). <italic>C. minuta</italic> showed protective properties against diet-induced obesity in mouse models and modulated the intestinal microbiota in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model inoculated with fecal samples from obese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). However, the experimental identification of keystone taxa in the human gut microbiome is challenging as intervention studies are difficult to conduct and animal and <italic>in vitro</italic> models can have limited translatability for the human gut microbiome. Consequently, researchers have moved towards bioinformatics and data analysis to identify putative keystone taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P4">A popular approach to identify keystone taxa in microbiomes is to use sequencing-based microbial abundance profiles to construct and analyze correlation or co-occurrence networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). The assumption is that positive or negative interspecific interactions, be they direct or indirect, lead to positive or negative correlations between the abundances of the respective taxa. It has been shown by Berry and Widder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) that in simulated communities certain network features, namely node degree, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and transitivity, are indicative of a taxon’s keystone potential and can be used to identify keystone taxa with 85% accuracy.</p><p id="P5">Several studies have identified putative keystone taxa based on correlation network analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) and proposed them as targets for subsequent experimental studies. However, we still lack an understanding of what ecological features these keystones share or which functional niches they occupy that lead to their observed characteristics in correlation networks. We can speculate that a keystone taxon provides a conserved, specific function in the gut microbiome that is not provided by other taxa and is therefore crucial in maintaining community structure and function. Alternatively, keystone taxa might be functionally versatile and able to fill available ecological niches, thereby providing the needed functional redundancy and resilience to microbial communities. One can also imagine a mixture of both functions, either provided by a single taxon or a keystone guild.</p><p id="P6">With this study, we aim to further our understanding of putative keystone taxa in the human gut microbiome. We establish a workflow to construct robust and statistically significant correlation networks with FastSpar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) and identify correlation network keystones based on their network features, as proposed by Berry and Widder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). We then utilize this workflow to interrogate publicly available metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from large human gut microbiome studies. We find that detection of network keystones is highly sensitive to taxonomic resolution and are able to identify putative keystone taxa only at species and genus level. Correlation network analysis further suggests a community stabilizing effect of putative keystone taxa and reveals co-occurring subcommunities present across gut microbiomes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Establishing a workflow to build significant and robust correlation networks</title><p id="P7">In this study, we established a workflow that results in correlation networks based on both highly significant as well as robust correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). A major concern when constructing correlation networks is the inherent compositionality of community abundance profiles derived from sequencing data, which can lead to spurious correlations. We utilized FastSpar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), a C++ implementation of the well established tool SparCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), which identifies significant correlations and excludes spurious correlations based on a bootstrapping algorithm. We constructed correlation networks with FastSpar on subsamples of our dataset and subsequently constructed a consensus network based only on correlations that were identified as significant in at least 20% of the individually constructed networks. This workflow ensures that correlations kept in the consensus network are representative of both the entire dataset as well as subsamples. We used this procedure to identify taxa that robustly exhibit correlation network keystone features in the gut microbiomes studied.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Community structure and species properties</title><p id="P8">In order to evaluate keystone taxa in the healthy human gut microbiome, we leveraged two large studies of healthy human adults, which included 580 paired metagenome and metatranscriptome samples from 131 individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). We first estimated whether the community compositions of the two datasets were similar enough to be combined by performing an ordination analysis and computing the similarity between communities on a species level. This revealed that while samples from the two datasets are somewhat separated, they still exhibit a strong overlap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1A</xref>). To ensure statistical independence between samples we randomly selected one sample per participant, resulting in an even larger overlap between the two datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1B</xref>). To further confirm the validity of combining datasets, we investigated the site similarity of the included samples by computing the overall Jaccard similarity between the communities (presence and absence of species), as suggested by Berry and Widder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Overall, the studied communities exhibit a similarity of 36%, exceeding the suggested lower limit of 20%. These results confirmed the suitability of combining the datasets for computing correlation networks and estimating keystone potential. To gain a better understanding of the data used for this study, we analyzed relative abundance, prevalence and transcriptional contribution of prevalent species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1C</xref>). We observed a large variance in relative abundance, both within and between species. As expected, several species of <italic>Bacteroides,</italic> such as <italic>Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides uniformis</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides stercoris,</italic> as well as <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic> and <italic>Prevotella copri</italic> are highly abundant in the dataset. More abundant species also tend to contribute more strongly to metatranscriptomes. This could reflect actual contribution to transcription, but may also be a result of better annotation quality in reference genomes from highly abundant species. While many highly abundant species are also highly prevalent across the dataset, there are multiple exceptions. Most notable and well known is the low prevalence of <italic>P. copri,</italic> a species that has previously been observed to be abundant in certain gut microbiomes while mostly absent in many others, particularly in cohorts from Europe and North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Focusing on taxa exhibiting a prevalence of at least 20% across all studied samples, we then constructed correlation networks as described above.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Correlation networks reveal a loss of structure and keystone potential at lower taxonomic resolution</title><p id="P9">Previous work has shown that closely related taxa can form networks to utilize complex substrates in the human gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), but stable interactions between distantly related taxa have been also observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). It is, however, poorly understood how taxonomic resolution affects correlation analysis and specifically the identification of putative keystones. We therefore computed correlation networks at different taxonomic resolutions (order, family, genus and species) and investigated their structure. Overall, networks showed reduced modularity with increased taxonomic resolution (genus and species), while cohesion decreased from species- to order-level networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). Modularity measures the extent to which a given network is divided into modules, with a higher modularity indicating greater divisions within the network. In contrast, the cohesion of a network estimates the minimum number of nodes that need to be removed to result in a weakly connected network, and a higher cohesion therefore indicates a more tightly connected network. Constructing correlation networks at low taxonomic resolution produced weakly connected networks while networks constructed at genus- and species-level are more cohesive and less modular. This observation is further confirmed by the observed distributions of network features, namely relative node degree (ND), transitivity (T) and betweenness centrality (BC). The relative degree of a node (= a taxon) is the number of edges a node has (correlations to another node) relative to the size of the network (total number of nodes). Transitivity indicates whether all nodes correlated with a given node are in turn correlated. The betweenness centrality of a node estimates how many shortest paths between two nodes (smallest number of edges connecting two nodes within a network) go through this given node. Correlation network keystones are characterized by high node degree, high transitivity and low betweenness centrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). The probability density functions of these network features, particularly transitivity and betweenness centrality, are flatter at lower taxonomic resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). In the node degree distribution we observe a slight flattening as well as a general shift towards a higher degree at lower taxonomic resolution. Flatter probability density functions, and therefore a more equal distribution of network features across all taxa, suggest that any one taxon is less likely to exhibit a high keystone potential. We confirm this by computing the keystone potential, using the formula <italic>keystone potential</italic> = <italic>(ND*T)/BC,</italic> and comparing it across taxonomic resolutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). As expected, we observe very low keystone potential at family and order level, indicating that such broad taxonomic groups are unlikely to exhibit structuring effects on the overall community. In contrast, we see both genera and species with a high potential to act as correlation network keystones. Interestingly, the pattern of keystone potential is not consistent from genus to species, with some taxa exhibiting a higher potential at genus level and seemingly losing it at species level and vice versa. In summary, these results suggest that correlation network keystones are solely found within genera or species, and we thus focused our downstream analyses on these two taxonomic levels.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Few taxa have a relatively high keystone potential</title><p id="P10">We next analyzed the distribution of keystone potential in genera and species to better understand the network properties of correlation network keystones. Both on genus as well as on species level the distribution of keystone potential is strongly skewed to the right, with a few taxa showing a relatively high keystone potential when compared to all other taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A and B</xref>, respectively). This aligns well with our understanding of keystones and is to be expected based on the probability density functions of the network features used to compute keystone potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). Specifically, we observe that the genera <italic>Methanobrevibacter, Agathobaculum, Bilophila</italic> and <italic>Holdemania</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) have a notably high potential to act as correlation network keystones. We also observe a group of unclassified <italic>Firmicutes</italic> with high keystone potential, but as this group of species is likely not phylogenetically coherent, we did not include it in further analyses. On species level, <italic>Firmicutes bacterium CAG</italic> 83<italic>, Eisenbergiella tayi, Veillonella atypica</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcus lactaris</italic> exhibit a high keystone potential (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). With the exception of the genera <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> and <italic>Bilophila</italic>, which belong to the phylum <italic>Euryarchaeota</italic> and <italic>Thermodesulfobacteriota,</italic> respectively, all of these taxa are <italic>Firmicutes.</italic> When we compare the keystone potential of each species with its respective keystone potential on genus level, there is no clear pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). This suggests that certain genera may act as a keystone towards other genera but lose this potential on species level, and vice versa. We observe this for <italic>Agathobaculum, Bilophila, Holdemania</italic> and <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic>. These four genera show a high keystone potential, but the respective species exhibit low keystone potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). This is a particularly surprising observation considering that only one species belonging to each of these genera is present in the datasets, namely <italic>Agathobaculum butyriciproducens, Bilophila wadsworthia, Holdemania filiformis</italic> and <italic>Methanobrevibacter smithii</italic>. These keystone genera are effectively keystone species that seem to have stronger network keystone properties when considering intergenic correlations. The correlations might be diluted on a species level and intergenic correlations may be distributed amongst multiple species with differing abundance patterns. Conversely, particular species have a high keystone potential that is diluted when observed on genus level, as can be seen for <italic>V. atypica</italic> and <italic>E. tayi.</italic> The species within one genus may rarely co-occur, resulting in opposing correlation patterns and leading to a low keystone potential on genus level. Ultimately, only few taxa in species and genus correlation networks exhibit a high potential to act as keystones, while the vast majority of taxa do not show the characteristics of putative keystones.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Correlation patterns indicate that keystone taxa may facilitate community stability</title><p id="P11">It has been suggested that in a highly diverse and functionally redundant system, such as the human gut microbiome, stability is facilitated by a high number of negative interactions, preventing the formation of positive feedback loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). However, we observe that more than 50% of correlations in the analyzed networks are positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). This is even more pronounced in species that belong to the same genus, where almost 75% of observed within-genus correlations are positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). Putative keystone genera show a contrasting pattern, with around 60% negative correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>) and genera that are strongly correlated with a keystone exhibit weaker within-genus correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>). These results suggest that single-species keystone genera might provide community stability by counteracting positive feedback loops within other genera and dampening correlations. We also observe that larger genera exhibit weaker positive correlations within a respective genus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2A</xref>) which may be a result of functional redundancy in these more closely related taxa. On both genus as well as species level we observe that taxa correlated with a keystone taxon (first neighbors of keystones) are in general correlated to more taxa than those not correlated to a keystone. First neighbors of keystones also tend to have weaker correlations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2B and C</xref>, respectively). These observations further point towards a potential stabilizing effect of putative keystone taxa.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Correlation patterns reveal co-occurring clusters of taxa</title><p id="P12">To gain a better understanding of the community assembly characteristics of putative keystone taxa, we investigated the co-occurrence patterns of all prevalent species and genera. We constructed positive correlation networks, taking into account only correlations with a correlation strength &gt; 0, and performed a clustering analysis on these networks. This analysis revealed four distinct clusters of species that are highly positively correlated with each other and that show fewer positive correlations to species of other clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). Each keystone species is a member of a different species cluster, indicating that keystone species are not highly correlated with each other. In contrast, keystone genera do not fall into separate clusters in the genus network, despite the presence of again four clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>). Specifically, <italic>Bilophila</italic> and <italic>Holdemania</italic> are part of one cluster while <italic>Agathobaculum</italic> and <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> are located in another. The remaining two clusters are a cluster including <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, a highly diverse and abundant genus, and a cluster including <italic>Prevotella,</italic> a genus with, as previously mentioned, distinct abundance patterns. It should further be noted that high abundance is not a necessity for a correlation network keystone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1C</xref>). In fact, amongst all prevalent taxa (at least 20% prevalence), keystones exhibit medium to low mean relative abundance. Examining the distribution of all network clusters across samples, we observe a gradient of community compositions both on species and genus level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3</xref>). At both taxonomic resolutions there are two dominant clusters that generally comprise the majority of the community. However, all four respective clusters co-occur in most samples and the composition ranges from heavily dominated by one cluster to almost equal contribution of each cluster. This observation is in accordance with recently described entersignatures of gut microbial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) and may point towards a modular gut microbiome composed of distinct groups of co-occurring taxa.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Keystone taxa are transcriptionally versatile and show distinct transcriptional states</title><p id="P13">In an effort to elucidate the functional role of putative keystone taxa, we investigated their genomic potential and transcriptional versatility. No genomic features were identified to be distinctive of keystone taxa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>), so we focused on analyzing their transcriptional versatility and potential transcriptional states. We estimated the transcriptional versatility of prevalent taxa by computing pairwise Sorensen similarities on the presence and absence of gene families in the metatranscriptomes. The average transcriptional similarity of keystone taxa ranges from fairly high (<italic>Holdemania:</italic> 0.7, <italic>R. lactaris:</italic> 0.64) to the lower end of the observed range (<italic>Bilophila</italic>: 0.22, <italic>E.tayi:</italic> 0.18) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5</xref>). However, as is the case for most of the prevalent taxa, transcriptional similarity within each keystone taxon varies strongly across all analyzed samples. This suggests that keystone taxa do not occupy a conserved ecological niche - as inferred by transcriptional profiles - but are rather functionally versatile and potentially occupy different ecological niches within different gut microbial communities. Based on these observations we performed clustering analyses on the transcriptional profiles of the keystone taxa to identify potentially differing transcriptional states. We were able to identify two to three discrete transcriptional states for most keystone taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), with the exceptions of <italic>Holdemania</italic> and <italic>V. atypica</italic>. In these two cases very few reads mapped to known gene families and fewer still could be grouped into known enzyme commission numbers (ECs), indicating low annotation rates in their reference genomes. Consequently, a clustering analysis based on transcriptional profiles could not be performed for these two taxa.</p><p id="P14">We next performed Random Forest machine-learning analyses to identify individual ECs that distinguish the transcriptional states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). For <italic>Bilophila</italic>, this revealed two ECs with contrasting transcription profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C and D</xref>). Taurine-pyruvate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.77), is involved in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism and shows higher relative transcription in the samples in transcriptional state 1. Taurine metabolism is well described in <italic>Bilophila</italic> and may be linked to disease phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.157), which shows higher relative transcription in transcriptional state 2, is involved in the metabolism of various amino sugars and nucleotide sugars, such as glucose or extracellular N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine. For <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic>, we could identify three transcriptional states that are likely related to methane metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6E</xref>). Coenzyme-B sulfoethylthiotransferase (EC 2.8.4.1), the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of methanogenesis, was the most important in distinguishing these states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6F</xref>). Our analysis revealed three additional ECs involved in methane metabolism (EC 2.3.1.101, Formylmethanofuran-tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferase, EC 1.17.1.9, Formate dehydrogenase and EC 4.1.2.43, 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase) as important in distinguishing transcriptional states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Two transcriptional states were identified in <italic>E. tayi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7C</xref>). Notably, all three ECs identified as important in distinguishing these transcriptional states are involved in the biosynthesis of lysine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7D</xref>). The proportion of <italic>E. tayi</italic> transcription dedicated to these enzymes seems to be higher in transcriptional state 2, pointing towards an upregulation of lysine biosynthesis. It is important to note that a large proportion of metatranscriptome reads could not be grouped into any known ECs. We chose the higher resolution of ECs over gene families to gain more insight into the function of the transcripts at the expense of losing a larger proportion of reads. Despite these limitations, the data point towards the presence of functionally versatile keystone taxa in the gut microbial community.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">The aim of the present study is to elucidate the potential ecological role of correlation network keystone taxa of the human gut microbiome and gain a better understanding of how these analyses tie into other avenues of human gut microbiome research. In order to identify correlation network keystones, we developed a workflow based on a bootstrapping approach and a subsampling regime that enables the construction of robust and statistically significant correlation networks. We performed network analysis at the taxonomic resolutions of order, family, genus and species and calculated the keystone potential of prevalent taxa combining their mean degree, transitivity and betweenness centrality. We only observe high keystone potential of any taxa in genus- and species-level networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>), in contrast to previous suggestions of higher-order keystones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). While we were able to identify taxa with a high keystone potential in the genus-level correlation network, they are interestingly all single-species genera, meaning that no other species belonging to these genera were detected in the analyzed samples. We therefore only identify putative keystone species rather than genera. A lower taxonomic resolution inevitably increases the functional potential of a taxon and broadens its ecological niche, which thereby likely weakens direct and indirect interactions between taxa. This would explain the more evenly distributed correlations between orders and families when compared to genera and species and the lower keystone potentials. Keystone taxa are of great interest for systematic microbiome engineering, for example for the restoration of a dysbiotic gut microbiome through the introduction or targeted manipulation of keystones. In applied fields a microbial species or genus may well present a more practical target, as opposed to broader taxonomic groups.</p><p id="P16">Overall, the correlation networks have a high percentage of positive correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). This is somewhat surprising, as work by Coyte and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) has suggested that a diverse microbial community can only be stable when the majority of interactions are negative. Interestingly, the single-species keystone genera identified through our analysis have a considerably higher percentage of negative correlations to other genera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). These high numbers of negative correlations with keystone taxa may provide stability to the microbial community, especially considering the particularly high percentage of positive correlations between species of the same genus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). The negative correlations with keystone genera potentially counteract these positive correlations that could otherwise result in positive feedback loops and lead to instability. Coyte and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) identify the dampening of these positive feedback loops as one mechanism for stabilization of a community. They furthermore suggest weaker ecological interactions as an additional stabilization mechanism. We indeed observe that the stronger the correlation of a keystone to a genus, the weaker the correlations between the species of the respective genus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>), suggesting that the keystone genera may be both dampening positive feedback loops and weakening intergenic correlations. We additionally find that species’ positive correlations tend to be weaker in larger genera (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2A</xref>). This result supports another observation by Coyte et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) that functional redundancy in closely related taxa provides stability by replacing few strong interactions with many weaker interactions. In general, taxa correlated to a keystone taxon tend to have more, but weaker correlations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2B and C</xref>), again indicating a stabilizing effect from keystone taxa.</p><p id="P17">In both the species- as well as genus-level network we identified four clusters of co-occurring taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>). Each of the four species-clusters contains exactly one putative keystone species, while only two of the genus-clusters contain two keystone genera each. These respective four clusters are in turn frequently co-occurring (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3</xref>). The analyzed gut microbiomes all consisted of more than one cluster, both on species as well as genus level, resulting in a compositional gradient ranging from strongly dominated by a particular cluster to a fairly even distribution of all four clusters. Frioux and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) recently described similar patterns in the genus composition of gut microbial communities. They identified five so-called enterosignatures (commonly co-occurring genera) that, in combination, can accurately describe most healthy gut microbiomes. These five enterosignatures show strong similarities to the genus clusters we were able to identify in our correlation network. Specifically, ES-Firm (enterosignature with a high contribution of various <italic>Firmicutes</italic>) and ES-Prev (dominated by <italic>Prevotella</italic>) correspond to cluster 3 and cluster 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, respectively. An enterosignature mainly found in the gut microbiome of infants, ES-Bifi, does not have a corresponding genus cluster in the cohort we analyzed, which consists solely of adults. However, the main genera of ES-Bifi, namely <italic>Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, Veillonella, Enterococcus</italic> and <italic>Haemophilus,</italic> are members of genus cluster 1, together with <italic>Bacteroides,</italic> one of the main genera in ES-Bact. The remaining cluster 2 includes <italic>Escherichia</italic>, the main contributor to ES-Esch, and <italic>Blautia</italic>, a strong contributor to ES-Firm, but most genera in this cluster were not reported as strongly contributing to an enterosignature. These differences may be due to differences in the applied methods (correlation analysis vs. non-negative matrix factorization) as well as size and diversity of the analyzed cohorts. While not a perfect match to the described enterosignatures, the genus clusters we identified are still remarkably similar in composition.</p><p id="P18">We observe distinct transcriptional states in all putative keystone taxa that can be attributed to differential transcription of particular ECs. In a small synthetic gut microbial community, Shetty and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) observed shifting functional roles of species in an otherwise compositionally and functionally fairly stable community. These observations suggest functional versatility that enables these taxa to adjust their metabolism to available resources and shifting ecological niches. Particularly striking is the high number of ECs from <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> involved in methane metabolism that we could identify as important in distinguishing the transcriptional states of <italic>Methanobrevibacter.</italic> In <italic>Bilophila,</italic> we identified an EC involved in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism as important in distinguishing transcriptional states and an EC potentially involved in host glycan degradation that shows an opposing transcription pattern, suggesting a metabolic shift. These findings are consistent with the idea that the gut microbiome needs to be able to accommodate a diverse and variable set of available resources as well as dynamic interplay with the host.</p><p id="P19">Together with the stabilizing effects previously discussed, functional versatility may be another mechanism enabling keystone taxa to exert their influence on the microbial community.</p><sec id="S11"><title>Limitations Of The Study</title><p id="P20">The present study has several limitations. We focused exclusively on the analysis of publicly available data and no experimental validation was carried out. Metagenome and metatranscriptome reads were mapped to reference genomes and analyzed on different taxonomic resolutions up to species. Consequently, strain-level variation has not been taken into account and the reliance on reference genomes further reduces the genetic variation represented in this study. We also acknowledge that correlation networks can reflect other ecological processes beyond interactions such as habitat filtering. Additionally, our analyses focused only on prevalent taxa and therefore would miss any less common keystone taxa. Our observations are furthermore limited to the distal colon, while community composition as well as functionality may differ in more proximal parts of the intestines. Lastly, the data we used for this study consisted of two cohorts with limited demographic diversity and different putative keystones may be present in other populations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P21">In this study we developed a pipeline for the robust construction and analysis of correlation networks and the identification of putative keystone taxa. Through a comprehensive analysis of the constructed correlation networks we are able to show that correlation networks and their properties are highly sensitive to taxonomic resolution. Furthermore, we identified signatures of potentially community stabilizing interaction patterns reflected in the correlation networks as well as co-occurring sub-communities in the human gut microbiome that show a high similarity to previously described enterosignatures. The ecological significance of correlation network keystones is still an open question. Nevertheless, we see indications that keystone taxa may have a local stabilizing effect on sub-communities of the gut microbiome. This suggests that it is unlikely that there are individual taxa that globally affect the entire community. We rather hypothesize that keystone taxa act as stabilizing agents in relatively independently co-occurring subsets of the microbiome.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Processing of raw data</title><p id="P22">We analyzed metagenome and metatranscriptome reads from two publicly available datasets, a cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease as well as healthy control patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) and a cohort of adult men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The raw reads were preprocessed with trimmomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) (with settings leading: 3, trailing: 3, slidingwindow: 4:15, minlen: 50). We removed samples with fewer than one million reads from further analyses and, in the Schirmer dataset, used only samples from participants not diagnosed with IBD. We then randomly selected one sample per participant to ensure statistical independence of the samples. The trimmed reads were processed using HUMAnN 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Briefly, HUMAnN 3 first estimates community composition with MetaphlAn 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), second it maps reads to a community pangenome with bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) and third it aligns unmapped reads to a protein database using DIAMOND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). This results in both taxonomic as well as functional profiles of the metagenome and metatranscriptome reads. We used the setting rel_ab_w_read_stats in MetaphlAn 3 to estimate both relative abundances and total reads mapped to a reference genome. In the functional profiles we further grouped reads mapped to gene families into enzyme commission numbers (ECs) using the HUMAnN 3 function humann_regroup_table with - -groups uniref90_level4ec.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Principal coordinate analysis of community profiles</title><p id="P23">In order to visualize community similarity and overlap between the two analyzed datasets, we computed the robust Aitchison distance between samples with the function vegandist in the R package vegan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), using the total estimated reads output from MetaphlAn 3 on species resolution. We then performed a principal coordinate analysis on these distances using the function cmdscale in the R package stats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Computation of correlation networks</title><p id="P24">We computed binary Jaccard similarities of community composition at species resolution between samples to estimate whether the communities were similar enough to compute correlation networks. Berry and Widder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) suggest an overall site similarity (Jaccard similarity) of at least 20% and we observed a mean Jaccard similarity of 36%. We computed correlations between taxa using FastSpar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) with the settings - -iterations 100 (corresponds to rounds of SparCC correlation estimations), - -exclude_iterations 20 (number of times highly correlated taxa pairs are discovered and excluded), - -threshold 0.1 (minimum threshold to exclude correlated taxa pairs) and - -number 1000 (number of bootstraps). FastSpar is a C++ implementation of the correlation network analysis algorithm SparCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). In short, these algorithms use log-transformed components to estimate linear Pearson correlations to account for the compositional nature of metagenomic data. In order to estimate the significance of observed correlations, FastSpar uses a permutation based approach to generate a null distribution that observed correlations are then compared against. We used the total estimated reads output from MetaphlAn 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) as abundance estimates for each taxon. We computed correlations between taxa at the taxonomic resolution of order, family, genus and species. To ensure robust results, we subsampled our combined datasets. Specifically, we used FastSpar to compute correlation networks on a random subsample of 50 samples and repeated this process 1000 times. We then built a consensus network using only correlations with a p-value &lt;= 0.05 in at least 200 iterations. The correlation strength in the consensus network was estimated as the mean correlation strength of significant correlations across all iterations. This workflow is visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. We calculated network features, namely modularity, cohesion, relative node degree, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and transitivity, using the R package igraph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Following the suggestion of Berry and Widder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) we estimated each taxon’s potential to act as a keystone using the network features relative node degree, betweenness centrality and transitivity. We excluded closeness centrality from our calculations in order to reduce collinearity of features as we saw strong linear relationships between relative node degree and closeness centrality at all taxonomic resolutions (data not shown). As shown by Berry and Widder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), correlation network keystone taxa show a high relative node degree and transitivity as well as low betweenness centrality. We therefore computed the keystone potential of each taxon as (relative node degree * transitivity) / betweenness centrality. We consider taxa a keystone if they show a particularly high keystone potential as compared to all other prevalent taxa (taxa present in at least 20% of samples). Namely, we chose a cut-off of median + 5x median absolute deviation of keystone potential after visually examining the entire distribution. We furthermore grouped the prevalent taxa into clusters using the function cluster_fast_greedy with default settings in the R package igraph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) on positive correlation networks, in which only correlations with a correlation strength &gt; 0 are considered. We visualized correlation networks using Cytoscape version 3.8.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Functional potential of keystone taxa</title><p id="P25">We investigated the functional potential of keystone taxa using the pathabundances output from HUMAnN 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).

We performed k-means clustering to further analyze the functional profiles of the keystone taxa and identify different transcriptional states. For this analysis we opted to use the functional resolution of ECs provided by HUMAnN 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) (function humann_regroup_table with - - groups uniref90_level4ec) and normalized copies per million to the total transcription attributed to each taxon per sample. We use the function fviz_nbclust in the R package factoextra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) to choose the optimal number of clusters (with a k.max - maximum number of clusters - of 10) by computing the average silhouette width for each number of clusters and choosing the highest score. For this number of clusters we then performed k-means clustering using the function kmeans in the R packages stats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). However, if we observed clusters containing only 1 or 2 samples, we excluded these samples from the analysis and repeated the process. In order to gain some insights into which ECs are particularly important for distinguishing the observed transcriptional states, we performed random forest analyses. A random forest analysis is a classifying algorithm based on decision trees that calculates importance metrics for the features used to cluster a dataset. In order to estimate the significance of these importance metrics we used the function rfPermute in the R package rfPermute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). This function computes a null distribution of importance metrics by permuting the response variable and calculates p-values for the observed importances. We used the mean decrease in accuracy as the importance metric for our analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS191472-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d31aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by ERC starting grant 714623 “FunKeyGut”.

ecological significance. By employing a robust workflow based on bootstrapping and subsampling techniques, we identify putative keystone species at the genus and species level. This emphasizes the importance of considering taxonomic resolution when investigating correlations. The potential impact of keystones on community stability provides valuable insights for systematic microbiome manipulation. Furthermore, the observed clusters of co-occurring taxa align well with recent findings and emphasize the reproducibility and relevance of the identified patterns in microbial community composition. We are able to add a functional dimension to the analysis with the identification of distinct transcriptional states in putative keystone taxa, highlighting their functional versatility and adaptability.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIG 1</label><caption><p>Workflow for the construction of robust and significant correlation networks.
