Here, we leveraged TurboID-based proximity labeling coupled with affinity purification-mass spectrometry to comprehensively map the proximal proteomes of all seven canonical human type I IFN signaling cascade members under basal and IFN-stimulated conditions. This established a network of 103 proteins in close proximity to the core members IFNAR1, IFNAR2, JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9. We validated several known constitutive protein assemblies, while also revealing novel stimulus-dependent and -independent associations between key signaling molecules. Functional screening further identified PJA2 as a negative regulator of IFN signaling via its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Mechanistically, PJA2 interacts with the Janus kinases, TYK2 and JAK1, and promotes their non-lysine and non-degradative ubiquitination, resulting in restrained downstream STAT signaling. Our high-resolution proximal protein landscapes provide global insights into the type I IFN signaling network, and serve as a valuable resource for future exploration of its functional complexities.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Virus-recognition by infected cells triggers the production of multiple cytokines, including the antiviral type I interferons (IFNs). These type I IFNs (e.g. IFN-α or IFN-β) act by upregulating the expression of antiviral genes (IFN-Stimulated Genes; ISGs) to restrict virus replication, but they also act to balance the innate immune system and to promote the adaptive immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. IFNα/β receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and IFNAR2 form a heterodimeric complex on the surface of cells to recognize secreted type I IFNs and to signal via the classical Janus kinase / Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway to induce antiviral effects. More precisely, high affinity binding of type I IFNs to IFNAR2 promotes the dimerization of both receptor chains and permits activation of the receptor-associated intracellular kinases Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. These kinases trans-/auto-phosphorylate, and in turn phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2 on specific tyrosine residues, leading to STAT1/2 translocation into the nucleus where they assemble with Interferon Regulatory Factor 9 (IRF9) to form the IFN-Stimulated Gene Factor 3 (ISGF3) complex. This transcription factor complex then binds to IFN-Stimulated Response Elements (ISREs) in ISG promoter regions and, with the coordinated action of chromatin-remodeling complexes, activates the expression of many hundreds of ISGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The protein products of ISGs play key roles in limiting virus spread by various potent antiviral mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Dysregulation of the type I IFN signaling cascade is associated with a variety of pathological conditions in humans. For instance, autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus) can be caused by IFN system overactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, while increased susceptibility to severe viral diseases or chronic viral infections can be caused by IFN defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Thus, type I IFN signaling has to be tightly and intricately regulated with multiple redundant mechanisms, which together help to limit potential overactivation while still being able to react rapidly and effectively against invading viral pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. While we do not have a full understanding of the complexities of type I IFN signaling network regulation, it is clear that protein post-translational modifications, such as (de-)phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and acetylation can be key players<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. For example, IFNAR1 is phosphorylated by the IFN-inducible Protein Kinase D2 (PKD2) on a degron motif leading to its ubiquitination, internalization and lysosomal degradation in order to prevent hyperstimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, phosphatases, including T Cell Protein Tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP) and Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), have been reported to dephosphorylate and inhibit JAK1 and TYK2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the Suppressors Of Cytokine Signaling 1/3 (SOCS1/3) are negative regulatory proteins that inhibit JAK1/TYK2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> by sterically hindering their kinase activities by blocking substrate binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, but have also been described to induce their ubiquitin-mediated degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Similarly, Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 18 (USP18) interacts with IFNAR2/STAT2 and reduces JAK1 phosphorylation and activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. At a different level, the Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT (PIAS) proteins use diverse mechanisms to inhibit IFN signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. A notable example is PIAS1, an E3-type Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) ligase, that interferes with STAT1 by SUMOylating it and preventing STAT1 from binding to the promoter region of specific ISGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Finally, STAT2 and IRF9 can be acetylated by CREB-binding protein (CBP) in their DNA-binding domains in response to IFN stimulation to ensure proper ISGF3 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The identification and molecular characterization of cellular factors that regulate type I IFN signaling has therefore proven to be invaluable in unraveling the functionality of this system. Such work has also previously provided key insights into potential therapeutic targets to treat diseases associated with dysregulation of the IFN system, with key examples being approved drugs such as JAK inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Our current knowledge on type I IFN signaling regulation mainly comes from factor-specific protein interaction studies (e.g. yeast two-hybrid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> screens and immunoprecipitations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>), or from genetic studies using chemical mutagenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, siRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> or CRISPR/Cas9-based<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> methods. However, conventional biochemical interaction studies can suffer from biases towards the enrichment of very strong interactors, and may miss weak, transient, or even cell context-dependent factors. Gene depletion studies also favor the identification of genes non-essential for cell viability at the expense of equally important factors that may have additional critical cellular roles. In this regard, recent advances in proximity labeling technologies have revealed their potential as powerful tools for deciphering the complex protein environments that underpin cellular signaling networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. A major benefit is the possibility to uncover cell context-dependent low-affinity interactions and stimulus-dependent transient interactions in minute-scale temporal resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. In this study, we therefore aimed to leverage TurboID-based proximity labeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, coupled with affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), to produce an unprecedented global glimpse into the dynamic proximal proteomes associated with the seven core members of the human type I IFN signaling cascade: IFNAR1, IFNAR2, JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9. By attempting to capture temporal changes in protein interactions following type I IFN stimulation, we sought to unveil novel regulatory mechanisms and transient associations that help to orchestrate type I IFN signaling precision. Here, we present high-resolution landscapes that include 103 proteins closely associated with the core type I IFN signaling machinery, revealing both known protein assemblies and novel unappreciated complexes. By integrating results from a functional screening approach, we focused on dissecting the role of PJA2 as a previously unrecognized negative regulator of IFN signaling through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. PJA2 could promote the non-lysine and non-degradative ubiquitination of Janus kinases to limit downstream STAT signaling. Thus, our study offers a comprehensive exploration of the individual proximal proteomes associated with the type I IFN signaling cascade and provides an enriched framework to expand our current understanding of this pathway.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>System-wide identification of the type I IFN signaling proximal proteome</title><p id="P5">Rapid promiscuous biotinylation of proximal (∼ 35 nm) proteins within minutes makes TurboID an ideal enzyme to study cell signaling events involving low affinity or temporally regulated transient interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. We therefore sought to apply TurboID-based proximity labeling and AP-MS analysis to identify proteins in proximity to each of the seven canonical human type I IFN signaling cascade components during IFN-α2 stimulation. Using lentiviral vectors, we engineered eleven independent hTERT-immortalized human lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cell lines to stably express TurboID-tagged IFNAR1, IFNAR2, JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, STAT2 or IRF9, as well as TurboID-tagged localization controls based on GFP alone or fused to the Lyn11 plasma membrane localization signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> or classical nuclear export<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> or nuclear localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> signal sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the homogenous expression and correct intracellular localization of each TurboID-tagged protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Furthermore, endogenous IFN signaling component depletion revealed the functionalities of each TurboID-tagged IFN signaling member, with all TurboID-tagged components retaining appreciable activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). Kinetic analysis of IFN-α2 signaling in MRC-5 cells revealed that critical events such as STAT1/STAT2 phosphorylation and STAT1 nuclear translocation all occurred between 10 min and 120 min post IFN-α2 stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d, e</xref>), suggesting that timepoints within this window are suitable to identify functionally relevant proteins in proximity to each IFN signaling component. We consequently stimulated each of our engineered cell lines with IFN-α2 for various times (20 – 120 min) and supplemented the culture medium with exogenous biotin 15 min prior to harvesting in order to biotinylate proximal proteins. After affinity purification of the biotinylated proteins, enriched factors were detected and quantified by label-free mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Proteins with high probability of being proximal to each IFN signaling component at each timepoint post IFN-α2 stimulation were identified by comparing label-free protein quantities against the similarly localized GFP control across three independent replicates with Significance Analysis of Interactome (SAINT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Using stringent selection criteria (4-fold enrichment over the similarly localized GFP control, 2-fold enrichment over all other GFP controls, and an interaction probability of at least 70%), our analyses yielded a total of 103 proteins in proximity to IFNAR1/2, JAK1, TYK2, STAT1/2, and IRF9, which does not include the seven canonical IFN signaling components themselves that were also identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Consistent with previous literature, our data confirmed the constitutive interaction between STAT1 and STAT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, and the establishment of a specific STAT2-IRF9 complex lacking STAT1 in unstimulated cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Additionally, our method highlighted the transient IFN-α2 stimulated interaction between TYK2 and STAT1/STAT2, as well as between STAT1 and IRF9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Further supporting the overall validity of our newly-identified type I IFN signaling proximal proteome, several of the proximal proteins could be confirmed by immunoblot analysis of independent small-scale proximity labeling experiments: e.g. the proximity of IL6ST with JAK1 and TYK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), DNAJA2 with STAT1 and STAT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), CNOT1 with IRF9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), and the IFN-α2-stimulated proximity of Kinesin Light Chain 2 (KLC2) with STAT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Thus, our TurboID-based study has generated a robust dataset of &gt;100 proteins with high probability of being in proximity to the seven canonical IFN signaling cascade components. This dataset will be an essential resource for future exploration of novel functional aspects of this system.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Global analysis of the type I IFN signaling proximal proteome</title><p id="P6">Bioinformatic analysis of our type I IFN signaling proximal proteome revealed an interconnected network of factors linked both physically and functionally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Striking proportions of the factors we identified have previously been associated with components of the type I IFN signaling response (16%, 16 of 103; according to BioGRID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> and/or STRING<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>). In addition, 13% (13 of 103) are known to be involved in viral processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, and 12% (12 of 103) are annotated as ISGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Notably, 83% of these ISGs identified in our study are in close proximity to the transcription factor components, STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9. Among the 16 proximal proteins that have been previously linked to type I IFN signaling were STAM and STAM2, which we identified in proximity to IFNAR1 and that have very recently been shown to inhibit IFNAR1-associated TYK2 function in unstimulated cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. In addition, ELAVL1, which we found in proximity to STAT1, is an RNA-binding protein that stabilizes the mRNAs of ISGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Furthermore, ABRAXAS2, which we identified proximal to IRF9, is a subunit of the BRCC36 isopeptidase complex (BRISC), and is important for ensuring proper STAT1 phosphorylation in response to herpes simplex virus infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. Another factor we identified proximal to IRF9, GIGYF2, appears to be a repressor of ISG activation in the absence of IFN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Additional gene ontology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> analysis of the proteins we identified in proximity to type I IFN signaling components using DAVID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> revealed significant enrichment in factors associated with plausibly relevant biological processes for IFN signaling, such as ‘protein transport’, ‘cytokine-mediated signaling’ and ‘protein import into nucleus’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). In this context, it is tempting to speculate on the possible trafficking role of factors such as KLC2, which we could clearly validate as a protein in close proximity to STAT2 after IFN-α2 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>), given its known function in binding specific cargoes that have stimulus-dependent cytosol to nucleus signaling activity via microtubules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>siRNA screening identifies proximal proteins that functionally regulate type I IFN signaling</title><p id="P7">To prioritize the newly identified proximal proteins that influence type I IFN signaling, we used siRNA pools to deplete MRC-5 cells of 50 high confidence candidates one by one, and subsequently assessed IFN-α2-stimulated (4 h and 16 h) antiviral activity against the IFN-sensitive VSV-GFP reporter virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). As controls, we depleted IFNAR2 and IRF9 (two positive regulators of type I IFN signaling), as well as USP18 and SOCS3 (two negative regulators of type I IFN signaling). We initially classified factors as important for type I IFN signaling if their depletion increased or decreased IFN-α2-stimulated antiviral activity by at least 2-fold compared to the non-targeting control siRNA (NTC) in two independent screening runs. Using these criteria, we could confirm IFNAR2 and IRF9 as positive regulators of type I IFN signaling, and SOCS3 and USP18 as negative regulators of type I IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, c, d</xref>). In addition, depletion of 16 out of the 50 candidates reproducibly increased the sensitivity of VSV-GFP to 4 h and/or 16 h IFN-α2 stimulation, similar to USP18 and SOCS3 depletion, suggesting that they may also act as negative regulators of type I IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>).</p><p id="P8">These regulators included USP9X, which we identified in proximity to STAT2 in our proteomics screen, and that has not previously been associated with type I IFN signaling, but has been reported to play a role in the closely related JAK2-dependent JAK/STAT signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. To assess whether any of the newly identified candidate regulators altered the ability of IFN-α2 to stimulate antiviral gene expression directly, we again used siRNA pools to deplete a subset of the candidates in MRC-5 cells, and assessed IFN-α2-stimulated <italic>ISG54</italic> and <italic>MX1</italic> mRNA expression levels at 4 and 16 h respectively, which were the peak timepoints for individual expression of these two ISGs. As expected, depletion of IFNAR2 or IRF9 led to significant decreases in IFN-α2-stimulated expression of these ISGs, while depletion of USP18 and SOCS3 led to increases in their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e, f</xref>). Out of the candidates tested in this assay, depletion of three (CNOT1, PJA2, and IGF2BP3) led to a significant and robust increase in IFN-α2-stimulated expression of <italic>ISG54</italic> or <italic>MX1</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e, f</xref>), further confirming their role as negative regulators with likely direct effects on type I IFN signaling.

However, these effects did not reach statistical significance in the assays we employed. Interestingly, of the significant factors, CNOT1 (which we identified in proximity to IRF9) is part of the CCR4-NOT complex that has previously been reported to negatively regulate type I IFN signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>.

PJA2 has since been described to be involved in other signaling pathways such as the Hippo cascade or Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and has been reported to act either by inducing target degradation or by adding atypical ubiquitin chain linkages to regulate target function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. PJA2 currently has no known associations with IFN signaling, but we identified it in proximity to TYK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>), and our siRNA-mediated depletion studies identified it as a potential negative regulator of IFN-α2-stimulated gene expression and antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d, e</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). We confirmed that these functional effects were not limited to MRC-5 cells by performing similar PJA2 depletion studies in human A549 cells, and found that PJA2 depletion (similar to depletion of SOCS3) enhanced IFN-α2-stimulated antiviral activity in this cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In addition, we investigated whether the identified proximity of PJA2 with TYK2 could be due to a physical interaction by performing co-immunoprecipitation experiments with tagged forms of TYK2 and PJA2. A V5-tagged TYK2 construct could specifically precipitate endogenous PJA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), while a Flag-tagged PJA2 construct could specifically precipitate endogenous TYK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). These data reveal that TYK2 and PJA2 can physically associate with one another in the same complex, suggesting a relatively stable interaction had been identified in the TurboID-based screen. Interestingly, we found that only the related kinase, JAK1, was additionally able to co-precipitate PJA2 when all seven tagged type I IFN signaling components were tested for their interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>), revealing specificity of PJA2 interaction with the Janus kinases TYK2 and JAK1.</p><p id="P10">We next sought to determine whether the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of PJA2 contributes to its negative regulation of type I IFN signaling. In an orthogonal approach to our siRNA-based depletion studies, we found that overexpression of wild type (WT) Flag-tagged PJA2 led to a dose-dependent reduction in IFN-α2-induced ISRE activity in two separate (MX1 and ISG54) luciferase-based reporter assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e, f</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of a previously described PJA2 RING domain mutant (C634A, C671A that lacks E3 ubiquitin ligase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>; PJA2-rm) was unable to reduce IFN-α2-induced ISRE activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e, f</xref>), revealing the importance of PJA2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity for the negative regulation of type I IFN signaling. Given that JAK1 plays an essential role in both type I and type II IFN signaling, while TYK2 activity is restricted to type I IFN signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, we also assessed the impact of PJA2 overexpression on IFN-γ-induced gamma-activated site (GAS) luciferase reporter activity. Consistent with the observation that PJA2 can interact with JAK1, overexpression of PJA2-WT led to a dose-dependent reduction in IFN-γ-induced GAS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Surprisingly, the catalytically inactive PJA2-rm also displayed a dose-dependent reduction of GAS activity, albeit to a weaker extent than PJA2-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that PJA2-WT and the catalytically inactive PJA2-rm expressed to similar levels in these assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>), suggesting that differences in abundance do not account for observed functional effects. These data reveal the ability of PJA2 to physically interact with the Janus kinases, JAK1 and TYK2, and identify a negative regulatory role for PJA2 during type I and type II IFN signaling processes. The ability of PJA2 to inhibit type I IFN signaling is strongly dependent on its E3 ubiquitin ligase function.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>PJA2 promotes ubiquitination of TYK2 in a lysine-independent manner</title><p id="P11">To further understand the molecular mechanism by which PJA2 negatively regulates IFN signaling, we investigated whether PJA2 could promote ubiquitination of JAK1 and/or TYK2. In cell-based ubiquitination assays, we found that V5-tagged JAK1 and TYK2 were more strongly ubiquitinated in the presence of PJA2-WT than in the presence of PJA2-rm, while a similarly tagged control protein (GST-V5) was not ubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-c</xref>). We also verified that untagged TYK2 is more strongly ubiquitinated in the presence of PJA2-WT than in the presence of PJA2-rm to exclude any artefactual effects arising from the use of an N-terminal V5 tag on the Janus kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). These data suggest that PJA2 can indeed promote ubiquitination of JAK1 and TYK2. In support of a possible direct effect, we found that both PJA2-WT and PJA2-rm maintain their interactions with TYK2 and JAK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), indicating that loss of target ubiquitination by PJA2-rm is not due to impaired target recruitment. Furthermore, using a variety of truncation mutants, we determined that the RING domain of PJA2 is not required for its interaction with TYK2, and instead PJA2 requires a region from amino acids 531 to 630 for a strong interaction with TYK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e, f</xref>). This region was previously published to be required for its interaction with the regulatory subunit of another kinase, PKA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">TYK2 and JAK1 contain four domains: the N-terminal FERM and SH2 domains, which are both required for their interaction with IFNAR1/IFNAR2, and the C-terminal pseudo-kinase and kinase domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. The TYK2 N-terminal FERM and SH2 domains together (residues 1-588) were sufficient to interact with PJA2 in truncation-based mapping studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g, h</xref>). Furthermore, enhanced ubiquitination of this TYK2(1-588) construct, as well as the similar JAK1(1-582) construct, could occur in the presence of PJA2-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>), suggesting that these domains are the predominant ubiquitination targets for PJA2. Canonical ubiquitination occurs on lysine residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. To start mapping the ubiquitination site(s) on TYK2, we initially designed a TYK2(1-588) construct that completely lacks any lysine residues (including in the V5-tag) by substituting all 19 TYK2 lysines in this construct (as well as 1 lysine in the V5 tag) with arginine residues. Surprisingly, this lysine-less construct still exhibited enhanced ubiquitination in the presence of PJA2-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5j</xref>), indicating that the ubiquitination site(s) on TYK2 are likely formed via a non-canonical ubiquitination of non-lysine residues, such as serine, threonine, and cysteine; or even to the N-terminal α-amino group of TYK2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>. Overall, these data reveal that PJA2 can promote lysine-independent ubiquitination of TYK2, and likely JAK1, on its N-terminal FERM and SH2 domains.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>PJA2 promotes non-degradative ubiquitination of JAK1 and TYK2 and interferes with downstream STAT phosphorylation to negatively regulate type I IFN signaling</title><p id="P13">Ubiquitination is typically thought to lead to target protein degradation via the proteasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. However, we found that siRNA-mediated depletion of PJA2 did not increase JAK1 or TYK2 protein levels following IFN-α2 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a, b</xref>). Similarly, overexpression of PJA2 did not reduce JAK1 or TYK2 protein levels following IFN-α2 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>), nor lead to decreased levels of the Janus kinases when co-overexpressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). We therefore reasoned that the non-lysine ubiquitination of TYK2 (and JAK1) promoted by PJA2 is probably via an atypical ubiquitin chain linkage (i.e. not via ubiquitin residue K48). This would be consistent with previous studies on PJA2 E3 ligase function, which have characterized it as forming non-degradative atypical polyubiquitin chains on some targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. To understand mechanistically how PJA2 may negatively regulate IFN signaling without degrading TYK2/JAK1, we next assessed the impact of PJA2 on two well-described critical functions of these Janus kinases: regulation of IFN-α/β receptor levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>, and downstream STAT phosphorylation following IFN stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>. More precisely, TYK2 has previously been shown to stabilize IFNAR1 on the surface of unstimulated cells by preventing its internalization and turn-over via endocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup>. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated several independent HEK293T-based TYK2 knockout (KO) cell lines and could confirm that lack of TYK2 reduces total levels of IFNAR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c, d</xref>). Furthermore, re-expression of TYK2 could partially restore IFNAR1 protein levels, but the further expression of PJA2-WT was unable to reverse this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c, e</xref>), suggesting that the ubiquitination of TYK2 promoted by PJA2 does not interfere with the ability of TYK2 to stabilize IFNAR1 levels. In contrast, we observed that siRNA-mediated depletion of PJA2 significantly increased the early IFN-α2-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT1 in both A549 and MRC-5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f-i</xref>). Overall, these data are consistent with a working model whereby PJA2 interacts with the Janus kinases and acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to promote their non-lysine and non-degradative ubiquitination at N-terminal domains that functions to limit downstream signaling via the STATs to limit the response of cells to IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6j</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">Type I IFN signaling is an essential component of innate defenses against viral pathogens. This signaling cascade must be tightly regulated to prevent aberrant hyperactivation, yet still be able to react efficiently to limit viral disease. While key regulators of IFN signaling have previously been identified with different large-scale interaction or genetic approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, our current study describes the comprehensive system-wide application of TurboID-based proximity labeling and AP-MS to identify 103 proteins in close proximity to all seven core members of the human type I IFN signaling cascade: IFNAR1, IFNAR2, JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9. Importantly, analysis of this new proximal proteome unveiled an interconnected physical and functional network of factors and revealed previously unappreciated regulatory contributions to the human type I IFN pathway. Our approach is highly complementary to a similar BioID-based proximity labeling screen that was focused on identifying the proximal proteomes of murine STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 in murine macrophage-like cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. While species’ and cell-type differences likely explain the limited overlap in proximal proteins identified for STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 in the two screens, it is striking that both screens did identify CNOT1 in proximity to the ISGF3 components. This factor is a member of the CCR4-NOT complex that negatively regulates type I IFN signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. Interestingly, two more components of the CCR4-NOT complex, CNOT2 and CNOT3, came up as repressors of ISG activation in a genetic screen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. As TurboID is a much more rapidly acting enzyme than BioID, allowing biotinylation within minutes rather than hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, we were able to apply our system to study IFN-stimulated changes to the human signaling cascade at a very high temporal resolution, thereby providing new insights into the kinetics transient nature of the proximal factors we identified. Considering that the dataset we present here is the result of a comprehensive proximity labeling screen performed on all seven core members of the human type I IFN signaling cascade at the same time, and includes detailed information on interactions of known and unappreciated factors within this system, it should serve as a valuable future resource for characterizing novel effector mechanisms regulating this signaling cascade.</p><p id="P15">In our own follow up studies, we characterized the E3 ubiquitin ligase, PJA2, as a negative regulator of IFN signaling. PJA2 interacts with TYK2 and JAK1 and can promote their ubiquitination, strongly inhibiting IFN signaling by a mechanism that is not fully resolved, but which appears to at least include a partial limitation of downstream STAT1 phosphorylation. Ubiquitination of substrates by PJA2 often leads to their proteasomal degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>. However, there are also reports of PJA2 ubiquitinating proteins and impacting their functions without degradation. For example, PJA2 can ubiquitinate the HIV-1 Tat protein to stabilize Tat protein levels and to activate viral transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>, and the PJA2-mediated ubiquitination of MFHAS1 can promote TLR2-mediated signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. Notably, we found that the ubiquitination of JAK1 and TYK2 promoted by PJA2 is independent of lysine residues in the Janus kinases and does not appear to lead to TYK2/JAK1 degradation. Recently, our knowledge on non-lysine ubiquitination events has greatly advanced and it is now a more broadly recognized mechanism to regulate protein functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup>. The non-lysine and non-degradative ubiquitination of TYK2/JAK1 could plausibly impact their conformation and/or interaction with other proteins. Indeed, given our observation that IFN-stimulated STAT1 phosphorylation increases following PJA2 depletion, it is likely that the ubiquitination of JAK1 and TYK2 at least partially impacts their conformation-dependent kinase activity. Janus kinases are known to switch between an autoinhibited (closed) and an open conformation in resting cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup>. Following IFN binding to its receptor, the open conformation is required for JAK dimerization and activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that PJA2-mediated ubiquitination of JAK1 and TYK2 could stabilize their autoinhibited conformations or could act sterically to prevent (or limit) the kinases from dimerizing, thereby restraining their full activity.</p><p id="P16">We found PJA2 to be a constitutive interactor of TYK2 and JAK1, which opens up the question of whether, and how, the negative regulatory action of PJA2 itself may get activated. PJA2 does not appear to be an ISG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, unlike several other negative regulators of type I IFN signaling, such as USP18<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup> and SOCS1/3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref></sup>. A previous study has shown that PJA2 can be activated by serine/threonine phosphorylation in its N-terminal region (S342/T389)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. It is possible that an unknown kinase can induce this phosphorylation as part of the IFN signaling response to activate a negative feedback loop. It is further possible that PJA2 acts constitutively to promote low-level ubiquitination of JAK1 and TYK2 to limit hyperactivity of the IFN system, and that this inhibitory ubiquitination must therefore be overcome to unleash the full signaling potential of the Janus kinases following IFN stimulation.</p><p id="P17">JAK1 and TYK2 are involved in JAK/STAT signaling pathways other than type I IFN signaling. Prominent examples are the other IFN signaling pathways, type II and type III IFN signaling, as well as IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 cytokine signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref></sup>. Here, we have already shown that PJA2 can affect not only type I, but also type II IFN signaling. Correspondingly, the ubiquitination of Janus kinases promoted by PJA2 might also play a broader role in several different signaling events. Interestingly, we identified one IL-6 family cytokine receptor complex, IL6ST/OSMR, proximal to both JAK1 and TYK2 in our TurboID screen, indicating that we might already have identified additional factors that are involved in other JAK/STAT signaling pathways. This may broaden the applicability of the dataset we provide here.</p><p id="P18">In summary, our comprehensive TurboID-based study has generated a robust dataset of &gt; 100 proteins with high probability of being in close proximity to the core components of the human type I IFN signaling cascade, including IFNAR1, IFNAR2, JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9. This dynamic IFN-stimulated map of proteins in the proximity of these key signaling molecules led us to characterize an intriguing new mechanism by which non-lysine mediated ubiquitination may fine-tune the IFN pathway and its antiviral action. Our validated dataset should therefore form a solid basis for future investigations aimed at unraveling novel functional or regulatory intricacies of type I IFN signaling.</p><sec id="S10"><title>Methods Cell culture</title><p id="P19">Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells and human lung epithelial A549 cells (both</p><p id="P20">originally from ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/mL of penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco Life Technologies). hTERT-immortalized human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5/hTERT; a gift from Chris Boutell, University of Glasgow, UK) were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 U/mL of penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mM GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 % Non-Essential Amino Acids (NEAA; Thermo Fisher Scientific).
