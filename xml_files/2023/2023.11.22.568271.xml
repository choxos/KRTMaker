We found that most of OTergic innervation of the central amygdala (CeA) originated from the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON). While no differences in the numbers of SON→CeA OTertic neurons (or their OT content) was observed between sham and HF rats, we did observe a blunted content and release of OT from axonal terminals within the CeA.

It is estimated that over 64 million people worldwide suffer from heart failure, and this number is expected to rise in the coming years <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Numerous studies in the past decades have focused on identifying genetic and lifestyle risk factors for HF, as well as peripheral and central consequences of myocardial infarction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Conversely, much less is known about HF-associated impairments in cognitive function and emotional control, and the underlying brain circuits involved. Given the high incidence of depression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and cognitive impairment in HF patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms is paramount for the development of adequate therapeutic interventions.</p><p id="P6">Different HF-based studies and methodological approaches revealed numerous mechanisms and signals that contribute to neurohumoral and cardiovascular alterations in HF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Among the identified molecules and potential contributors, the hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin (OT), traditionally known for its role in social and reproductive behavior, has recently been implicated in the onset and pathophysiology of HF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. For example, recent work from our group has shown increased excitability of magnocellular neurosecretory OT neurons in rats with HF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, activation of medullar-projecting hypothalamic OT neurons have been shown to contribute to cardiac sympathetic nerve activation and cardiac arrhythmias following acute myocardial infarction in rats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Within the medulla, OT also modulates parasympathetic outflow <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, and a recent study demonstrated that chronic activation of OT neurons improved cardiac function during the chronic stages of HF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, OT has been shown to play pleiotropic roles in autonomic regulation of cardiac functions both in the acute and chronic phases of HF. Still question remain whether OT contributes also to cognitive/mood disorders in HF, and if so, what the cellular mechanisms and neuronal substrates are.</p><p id="P7">The central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) is critical for the processing of emotional and social cues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and is composed of distinct subnuclei, including the central medial (CeM) and central lateral amygdala (CeL). Various studies highlighted that OT release within the CeA is critical for the acquisition, expression and extinction of contextual fear, as well as for the modulation of emotional components of fear experiences in both rats and humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Recent studies have shown that within the CeA, OT release from hypothalamic inputs activates oxytocin receptor (OTR)-expressing GABAergic interneurons located in the CeL. This effect resulted in an increased GABAergic inhibition of neurons located in the CeM, decreasing their firing output to the brainstem. Thus, OT indirectly inhibited GABAergic CeM neurons, supporting the idea that OT directly regulates the activity of local inhibitory CeA circuits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. The functional implication of these actions is further supported by our previous work showing that OT activation of GABAergic CeL interneurons mediates a powerful anxiolytic effect <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and that OT release within the CeL is necessary for the extinction of fearful memories <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. More recently, we have demonstrated that not only neurons, but also OTR-expressing astrocytes contribute to OT actions within the CeL→CeM circuit, influencing neuronal activity via activity-dependent release of D-serine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Taken together, these studies support a major role of OT in the CeA GABAergic synaptic activity modulating normal emotional responses and mood. Still, whether changes in OT signaling within the CeA occurs in rats with HF failure, and whether this constitutes a potential mechanism contributing to mood disorders in this disease, remains unknown. To address this question, we used a well-established rat myocardial-infarction HF model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, in which we have previously identified signals and mechanisms contributing to neurogenic component of humoral and cardiac components of this disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Importantly, we previously demonstrated an impaired mood and cognitive phenotype in this rat model including increased anxiety and anhedonia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, and provided evidence for the CeA as a potential neuronal substrate mediating these effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Based on this evidence, we aimed here to investigate the impact of HF on hypothalamic CeA-projecting OT neurons, OTR mRNA and protein levels, as well as the OT-mediated functional connectivity of the local CeL→CeM circuit. Thus, we utilized patch-clamp electrophysiology, immunohistochemical analysis, RNAScope assessment of OTR mRNA, brain region-specific stereotaxic injections of viral vectors and retrograde tracing, optogenetic stimulation and OT biosensors in the rat ischemic HF model to study these possibilities. In our HF rats, we observed depletion of OT from OTergic axon terminals within the CeA, alterations in OT trafficking and release, a reduction of neuronal and astrocytic OTRs and perturbations in the OT-sensitive, neuronal GABAergic CeL→CeM circuit, which potentially underlie the increased fear and anxiety in rats and patients with chronic heart failure.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S6"><title>The hypothalamic SON is a major source of OT innervation to the CeL in male rats</title><p id="P9">It has previously been demonstrated that the SON is the major source of OTergic innervation to the CeL in female Wistar rats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. To validate whether this is also the case in male Wistar rats, we injected rats with OT cell type specific recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV_OT<sub>p</sub>-Venus) into the SON and PVN, two of the major OT outputs in the brain (n=6 rats, left hemisphere SON, right hemisphere PVN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and subsequently analyzed OT fiber density within the CeA on the ipsilateral side of each injection. As show in in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B, C</xref> we found that the SON provided a significantly denser OT innervation to the CeL compared to the PVN. To rule out a significant contribution of contralateral CeL-projecting fibers originating from the PVN, we injected 2 rats unilaterally into the PVN and analyzed the contralateral CeL (not shown). Here, we observed only sparse OT fibers, a finding that is in line with the previously reported data on female Wistar rats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Thus, we concluded that similar to females, the ipsilateral SON is the primary source of OT innervation to the CeL in male rats, and thus exclusively focused on the SON<sub>OT</sub>-CeL pathway.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>SON<sub>OT</sub>-CeL-projecting neuron numbers or excitability is not altered in rats with HF</title><p id="P10">We next asked whether the numbers and/or electrophysiological properties of SON<sub>OT</sub>-CeL projecting neurons were altered in rats with HF (cardiac parameters assessed via echocardiography can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). To this end, rats were injected with CAV2-Cre <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> into the CeL and AAV_OT<sub>p</sub>-DIO-GFP into the SON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). This approach allowed us to selectively label SON OT neurons projecting to the CeL. Representative examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>. This complementary approach further confirms the SON as a source of OT innervation of the CeL, and indicated that approximately 15% of SON OT neurons provide innervation to the CeL, a proportion that was not different from that observed in HF rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To determine whether the intrinsic excitability and repetitive firing properties of SONOT-CeL-projecting neurons were altered in HF, we used acute <italic>ex vivo</italic> slices from rats that received the double injection protocol described above, to whole-cell patch clamp recordings from identified SON<sub>OT</sub>-CeL-projecting neurons in sham and HF rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G-I</xref>). For this, neurons were held at a hyperpolarized membrane potential (Vm = -80 mV) and subjected to depolarizing pulses of increasing magnitude. A plot of the number of evoked action potentials (APs) per current pulse was built (e.g., input-output function (I/O)) for both sham and HF rats. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>, our results showed no differences in the I/O function between sham and HF rats (2-way ANOVA, F= 0.44, P= 0.52, n=10 and 8 in sham and HF rats, respectively). In addition, no differences in mean input resistance were observed between the two groups (sham: 540.1 ± 60.8 MΩ, HF: 616.2 ± 53.7 MΩ, unpaired t test, p= 0.36).</p><p id="P12">Taken together, our data suggest that neither the numbers nor the overall excitability and repetitive firing properties of SON<sub>OT</sub>-CeL-projecting neurons were affected in rats with HF.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Reduced SON<sub>OT</sub>-CeL innervation and OT axonal release in rats with HF</title><p id="P13">To determine whether the degree of OT innervation of the CeL was altered in HF rats, we stained CeL-containing brain sections of sham and HF rats with an OT antibody (PS38, Neurophysin-I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). Intriguingly, we found a significant reduction of OT immunoreactivity in fibers located within the CeL of HF rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). However, when we assessed OT fiber densities following injection of AAV_OT<sub>p</sub>-Venus into the SON (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), a similar degree of OT fiber densities were observed between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). These findings suggest a reduction in OT content in SON<sub>OT</sub>-CeL axonal terminals, rather than a decrease in the density of OT innervation in the CeL of HF rats.</p><p id="P14">To further confirm a decreased OT-immunoreactive axonal content in the CeL of HF rats we used a complementary approach in which we directly measured activity-dependent OT release from SON<sub>OT</sub>-CeL-projecting fibers in sham and HF rats. To this end, we used CHO cells transfected with human OT receptor (Sniffer<sup>OT</sup>) and a red-shifted fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (R-GECO), an approach we recently show to detect endogenous release of neuropeptides with extremely high sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolutions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Sniffer<sup>OT</sup> cells were platted into <italic>ex vivo</italic> slices containing the CeA that were obtained from sham and HF rats that received an injection of AAV_OT<sub>p</sub>-Chr2mCherry in the SON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). Laser stimulation of SON<sub>OT</sub>-CeL fibers expressing ChR2 in the CeL resulted in local release of OT that was efficiently detected by the surrounding Sniffer<sup>OT</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). While we found that the proportion of responsive Sniffer<sup>OT</sup> cells was lower in slices derived from HF rats (19.7%) compared to sham controls (24.5%), this difference did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, p&gt;0.05, chi-square test). In contrast, quantitative Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses of Sniffer<sup>OT</sup> differed significantly in HF compared to sham controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E, F</xref>). Indeed Sniffer<sup>OT</sup> displayed longer response latency (p&lt;0.01), shorter duration (p&lt;0.05), and smaller integrated area Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (p&lt;0.05) in HF compared to sham (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude was not different between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>; p&gt;0.05). Together, these results support a blunted activity-dependent release of OT from SON<sub>OT</sub>-CeL terminals in rats with HF.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Decreased OTR expression in the CeL of HF rats</title><p id="P15">We next wanted to determine whether in addition to changes in OT fiber content and release, there were also changes in the expression of OTRs within the CeA.

As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>, we found a significant decrease in OTR mRNA in the CeL of HF rats relative to sham rats. We have previously shown that functional OTRs are expressed both in neurons and astrocytes in the CeA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. To address cell-type specific changes in OTR mRNA, we performed an approach combining simultaneously RNAScope hybridization against OTR mRNA with immunohistochemical staining against the astrocyte marker glutamine synthetase (GS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A,B</xref>).

To determine whether the anatomical and molecular changes in the SON<sub>OT</sub>-CeL pathway in HF rats had functional implications and affected local circuitry activity within the CeA, we performed electrophysiological whole-cell patch recordings from neurons in the CeM from sham and HF rats that received an injection of AAV_OT<sub>p</sub>-Channelrhorodopsin2 (Chr2)mCherry into the SON. Resting membrane potential was not different between sham and HF rats (sham: -63.3 ± 1.0 mV, HF: -62.7 ± 0.5 mV, n= 8 and 11, respectively, p= 0.6 unpaired t test). Optogenetic stimulation of SON<sub>OT</sub>-CeL fibers in sham rats resulted in a robust hyperpolarization (~7 mV on average) and silencing of CeM neurons (p&lt; 0.0001, paired t test).

Prior research has underscored the crucial role of the hypothalamic OT pathway in modulating this intricate circuitry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

Building upon these findings, we put forth the hypothesis that perturbations in the OT-sensitive CeL→CeM GABAergic pathway could potentially serve as a contributing substrate to the development of mood disorders within the context of heart failure. When studying perturbations to OT signaling in HF, three major aspects need to be considered: i) the source of OT, ii) the involved OT-ergic pathway and iii) the target structures and involved cell types, which we discuss below.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Source of OT in the CeA</title><p id="P24">Previous studies have established the SON and PVN as the primary sources of OT synthesis within the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. Our investigation employed a comprehensive approach, combining viral tracing and nucleus-specific anatomical analyses, which reaffirmed the SON’s role as the principal contributor of OT to the CeL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a-c</xref>). In the context of our present study, meticulous examination of the CeA-projecting OTergic neurons revealed an absence of any alterations in the number of OT neurons in HF rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d-f</xref>). Further augmenting these findings, our employment of pharmacological techniques in tandem with electrophysiological assessments directly evaluated the excitability of these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These studies indicated that the fundamental intrinsic properties of these neurons, along with their repetitive firing patterns, remained unaltered, thereby corroborating the absence of changes in their excitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g-i</xref>). However, it’s worth acknowledging some limitations inherent to slice preparation, including the removal of peripheral inputs, and the absence of physiological variables. Yet, our prior utilization of slice preparations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>, coupled with our animal model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, lends support to the notion that maladaptive plastic changes can indeed be translated from <italic>in vivo</italic> to <italic>ex vivo</italic> settings.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>OTergic SON→CeA pathway</title><p id="P25">Our anatomical investigations have revealed a notable decrease in OT content within the axonal terminals connecting the SON to the CeL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). However, our findings negate the possibility that this decline in OT immunoreactivity arises from a reduction in the number of terminals, as our results using AAV_OT<sub>p</sub>-Venus consistently demonstrate a similar fiber count between sham and HF rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). While intriguing, these results become even more perplexing in light of the absence of alterations in OT expression/content within the somata of SON-CeL neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). One potential interpretation could be that the transport of OT to the terminals is compromised. Alternatively, these outcomes might signify the depletion of OT content due to heightened terminal activity during early HF stages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Clearly, further experiments are warranted to unravel the precise underlying mechanism responsible for the diminished OT content at the terminals. Irrespective of these potential mechanisms, these anatomical findings hold functional significance, as evidenced by our observation of a dampened activity-dependent release of OT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This was convincingly illustrated through our combined employment of optogenetic techniques and sniffer cell analysis, which unveiled reduced frequency, magnitude, and delayed responses of OT-sniffer cells following optical and selective activation of SON→CeL OTergic fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Notably, the utilization of sniffer cells has been efficiently implemented to monitor both axon terminal and dendritic release of OT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup> and VP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, boasting high sensitivity (nM detection) and spatiotemporal resolution, rendering them valuable tools for detecting endogenous neuropeptide release in the brain. Importantly, this approach has previously discerned differences in brainstem OT signaling in a different model of HF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. In sum, our comprehensive anatomical and functional studies converge to support the notion of diminished OT levels in SON-CeL terminals and impaired activity-dependent neuropeptide release in the context of HF rats.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Cellular targets of OT in the CeA</title><p id="P26">Our investigation delves into the multifaceted impact of OT on the CeL→CeM GABAergic microcircuit and its alterations in HF. Our findings go beyond compromised activity-dependent OT release from afferent terminals into the CeA, extending to a significant reduction in OTR expression. Anatomical changes in OTR expression were evident in both neurons and astrocytes, as we report a dichotomy of HF-induced changes on neuronal and astrocytic OTR expression in the CeA: While the percentage of OTR-positive neurons was not affected, we observed a ≈45% reduction of OTR expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). On the other hand, we observed a ≈35% reduction in OTR-positive astrocytes, but individual expression levels seemed unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Intriguingly, only neuronal OTR downregulation was found to be physiologically relevant in our experimental context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). To elucidate the functional implications of these molecular shifts, patch clamp recordings from CeM neurons were conducted. These neurons receive inputs from OTR-expressing CeL GABAergic neurons, known to be influenced by OT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. As anticipated, in sham rats, both endogenous OT and the OTR agonist substantially suppressed CeM neuron firing activity. In stark contrast, HF rats exhibited a blunted response to both manipulations, underscoring the combined effect of reduced presynaptic OT release and diminished OTR expression on the CeL→CeM microcircuit. To further dissect this phenomenon, we monitored GABAergic synaptic activity in CeM neurons through direct measurement of GABA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in voltage-clamp mode. In sham rats, OTR activation with TGOT led to increased frequency and amplitude of spontaneous IPSCs, effects largely absent in HF rats. This corroborated an overall compromised action of OT on the CeL→CeM GABAergic microcircuit in HF. Interestingly, we found a tendency for a higher basal GABAergic activity in CeM neurons in HF rats. This could seem in principle counterintuitive to the results described above. However, spontaneous activity represents all the GABAergic inputs into these neurons, not specifically those originating from OT-sensitive CeL neurons. Thus, it remains unclear at present whether changes in the basal degree of activity of CeL GABAergic neurons contribute to this effect. Nonetheless, our results compellingly show a blunted activation of the CeL→ CeM inhibitory circuit in response to OTR activation.</p><p id="P27">Building on previous findings regarding the role of astrocytes in OT-mediated GABA function regulation, our study also revealed reduced OTR expression in these glial cells. We recently described the existence of an OT-sensitive astrocyte population within the CeL, which forms an astrocyte syncytium with neighboring astrocytes through gap junctions, and releases the gliotransmitter d-serine to activate nearby neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Thus, to ascertain the involvement of astrocytes, we repeated experiments in the presence of the NMDAR blocker APV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Interestingly, while the effect of the OT agonist on GABAergic activity was diminished in sham rats, the blunted OT effect in HF persisted, indicating a limited contribution of astrocytes to the observed modulation in the CeL→CeM GABAergic circuit. This finding suggests that the HF-induced changes in transmission are a result of impaired OT signaling through neurons, but not astrocytes. In line with this, we recently proposed that OT release within the CeA might inhibit neuronal Na<sup>+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> leak channels and that the coordinated dual activation of both NMDA and OTR could result in a potentiated neural response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. In sum, our study presents a comprehensive view of the intricate OT-mediated regulatory mechanisms in this circuit, revealing significant alterations in HF, and strongly indicate HF-induced pathological alterations to the OT-sensitive CeL→CeM GABAergic circuit.

We recently demonstrated that microglial activation, neuroinflammation, neuronal deterioration and apoptosis in the hippocampus of HF rats is predominantly driven by microglial AngII signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. While future studies are warranted to address the triggering factors in HF, our data suggests that there is no single underlying mechanism that drives the HF-induced changes to the CeL→CeM GABAergic microcircuit, given the multiple and varied levels of compromised reported herein. Another important caveat is that we performed all of our experiments at the established stage of HF (5-7 weeks after surgery).

Axon terminals containing AAV_OT<sub>p</sub>-Chr2mCherry were stimulated using an Andor Mosaic at 488 nm with 25 ms pulses at 8Hz. Imaging data were analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH). All data was background subtracted. For quantitative measurements, fractional fluorescence (F/F<sub>0</sub>) was determined by dividing the fluorescence intensity (F) within a region of interest by a baseline fluorescence value (F<sub>0</sub>) determined from 30 frames before stimulation. Peak calcium amplitude was the maximum F/F<sub>0</sub> achieved after Chr2 stimulation. Latency (s) to the response was determined as the time between the end of the Chr2 stimulation and the start of the calcium response of each sniffer cell. Response duration (s) was the duration from the start of the response to the return baseline. The area under the curve (F/F<sub>0</sub>*s) was calculated using the integrated area for the duration of the response. Response rates are the number of cells that responded to both optogenetic Chr2 stimulation and an OT bolus divided by all cells that responded to the OT bolus. The OT bolus was delivered through the perfusion line via syringe (1 mL 0.1 μM; 0.1 mL s<sup>-1</sup>). Sniffer<sup>OT</sup> cells that showed intrinsic oscillatory calcium activity were excluded from the analysis. To better display changes in fluorescence levels, images were pseudocolored using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Patch-clamp electrophysiology in ex-vivo slices</title><p id="P38">Conventional patch-clamp recordings from neurons in the CeM were obtained from acutely obtained coronal slices from Sham and HF rats as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup>. Extended optic tract and anatomical location of the stria terminalis were used as landmarks to identify the CeL region. These neurons were typically surrounded by mCherry-labeled, Chr2 containing fibers. Briefly, whole-cell current clamp recordings were obtained with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and digitized using an Axon 1440B Digitizer (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). For current-clamp recordings, a conventional potassium gluconate-based internal solution was used. A similar approach was used to record from identified SON<sub>OT</sub>-CeL-projecting neurons. Input/output plots were generated from square pulses of 0pA to +180pA current injections in 20 pA increments, each lasting 1 sec. The spike frequency and counts were measured at each level and plotted as a function of the amount of current injected. For voltage-clamp recordings of GABAergic IPSCs, a high-chloride internal solution was used (in which potassium gluconate was replaced with KCl) to better detect IPSCs, as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup>. In this condition, and at the holding potential at which neurons were clamped (-70 mV), IPSCs appeared as large inward currents. IPSCs were detected and analyzed using MiniAnalysis. A detection threshold was set at -35 pA for IPSC peak, to extract IPSCs without contamination with glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup>..
