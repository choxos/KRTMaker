These ‘rate’ and ‘temporal’ codes have primarily been characterized in low-dimensional environments under limited cognitive demands; but how is coding configured in complex environments when individual place cells signal several locations, individual locations contribute to multiple routes and functional demands vary? Quantifying rat CA1 population dynamics during a decision-making task, we show that the phase of individual place cells’ spikes relative to the local theta rhythm shifts to differentiate activity in different place fields. Theta phase coding also disambiguates repeated visits to the same location during different routes, particularly preceding spatial decisions. Using unsupervised detection of cell assemblies alongside theoretical simulation, we show that integrating rate and phase coding mechanisms dynamically recruits units to different assemblies, generating spiking sequences that disambiguate episodes of experience and multiplexing spatial information with cognitive context.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cell assemblies</kwd><kwd>precession</kwd><kwd>temporal coding</kwd><kwd>rate coding</kwd><kwd>CA1</kwd><kwd>theta phase</kwd><kwd>theta sequences</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Hippocampal coding multiplexes over broad temporal scales incorporating prior, current, and future contextual information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Among pyramidal cells of hippocampal CA1, transient firing rate increases lasting from hundreds to thousands of milliseconds encode the position of an animal within the environment (‘place cells’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]), routes through paths with overlapping segments (‘splitter cells’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]), signal goal-locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], mark time intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], respond to specific odors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], sounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], objects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] and, in humans, to other people’s identities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The information required to form these multimodal representations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], converges on the hippocampus from cortical and subcortical regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], building context-specific cognitive rate-maps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P3">In conjunction with rate coding, hippocampal units also coordinate at much faster timescales, entrained to the dominant state-dependent oscillations of the local field potential (LFP): 5-10 Hz theta rhythms during active exploration and REM sleep, and sharp wave-ripples (SWR) during immobility and non-REM sleep. Theta phase precession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], theta sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], and SWR-associated replay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] produce single- or multi-unit activity patterns with temporal precision on the order of tens of milliseconds. During phase precession, the spike times of a place cell with respect to the ongoing theta oscillation shift to earlier phases in the cycle as the animal moves through that unit’s spatial receptive field (‘place field’). At the population level, the temporally ordered, sequential activation of place cells within a theta cycle gives rise to characteristic theta sequences. Both processes provide a temporal code for spatial information: during phase precession, the position of the animal within a cell’s place field correlates with the theta phase of that cell’s spikes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], while theta sequences reflect past and imminent trajectories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. In addition to spatial information, recent studies have uncovered theta sequences reflecting sequences of events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], current goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], and hypothetical future experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], suggesting contributions of hippocampal temporal coding to planning and speculation. There is also growing evidence that spikes fired during different relative phases of local theta cycles may encode different aspects of past and future experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Despite their different timescales, the information content and processes governing hippocampal rate and temporal coding are not independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Firstly, the order in which units activate during theta cycles and replays typically reflects the sequences in which place fields are crossed by the animal during exploration (but see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]), or sequences in which sensory cues are encountered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Mechanistically, interplay between fast somatic inhibition and slow dendritic depolarization as the animal crosses the respective neuron’s place field has been proposed as a possible mechanism linking firing rate with phase precession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] that may be tuned by local inhibitory interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Whatever their mechanisms, despite prevailing evidence for cross-temporal dependencies, the functional implications of interactions between rate and phase coding for hippocampal information processing remain equivocal.</p><p id="P5">Here, we investigate and quantify the extent to which flexible and transient activation of place cell assemblies affects both firing rate and phase/temporal coding modalities of individual place cells, enabling the discrimination of different visits to the same locations under varied cognitive demands. We therefore used a method for unsupervised detection of functional assemblies that is able to identify the composition of detected assemblies alongside their characteristic coordination timescales. In particular, we aimed to quantify how the information encoded by rate assemblies at 100 ms - 1 s timescales can affect the &lt; 100 ms temporal coding of their constituent units in the CA1 region of rats performing a spatial memory and decision-making task on a complex maze. Under these conditions, we found that both theta phase and firing rate of place cells shift when the cell activates within different assemblies recruited according to task trial demands. Rate and temporal codes therefore interact, allowing CA1 populations to parse repeated visits to the same locations into different cognitive contexts.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P6">Six adult male Long Evans rats were trained to perform a spatial working memory decision-making task on an end-to-end T-maze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. During each trial, rats learned to run from one side of the maze to the opposite to collect 0.1 ml of sucrose solution at reward locations. Trials were subdivided into free choice and guided runs. During choice runs, rats started from one of the two reward locations marked with ‘G’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and were directed by a moveable door to turn right (from G1) or left (from G2) into the central arm of the maze. Having traversed the central arm, rats had to choose whether to turn right or left at the open T-junction to continue towards the reward locations in ‘C’. A correct choice required rats to leave the central arm by turning in the same direction as they entered it (i.e. correct runs were from G1-C1 or G2-C2). Reward was delivered only upon correct trials. Choice trials were followed by guided trials that led the rats back to the ‘G’ side of the maze via a pair of predetermined turns guided by motorized moveable doors. All guided runs ended with reward. Data presented here are from rats that had learned task rules over between 16-23 days of habituation and training, and were performing 40 trials per recording session at between 71-90% correct. A total of 322 units was recorded from the dorsal CA1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) during 24 recording sessions from 6 rats. Among these, we isolated putative place cells by selecting units with a mean, on-maze firing rate between 0.2 Hz and 4 Hz and with spatial information above 0.5 bits/s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. The following analyses focus exclusively on the 218 units identified as putative place cells (with a median of 7, a minimum of 2, and a maximum of 20 putative place cells per session).</p><p id="P7">Cell assemblies were identified with an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for Cell Assembly Detection (CAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. CAD detects and tests arbitrary multi-unit activity patterns that re-occur more frequently than chance in parallel single-unit recordings. The algorithm automatically corrects for non-stationarity in the units’ activities and scans spike count time series at multiple temporal resolutions, returning the characteristic timescales at which individual assembly patterns coordinate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Thanks to a flexible agglomeration algorithm, CAD can detect assemblies with any activity pattern, avoiding <italic>a priori</italic> suppositions about the characteristics of the detected motifs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). We use the term cell assemblies without making any assumptions about the anatomical connectivity between assembly units, which are identified solely based on their co-activation. Here we thus refer to a ‘functional cell assembly’ as any group of units whose activation coordinates with temporal precision between 5 msec and 5 sec, and arbitrary time lags between the unit activations, in a consistently reoccurring pattern.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>The two predominant timescales of hippocampal assemblies</title><p id="P8">As expected based on extensive previous analyses of place cell physiology, the temporal precision of hippocampal assemblies active during the task ranged from milliseconds to seconds and is bimodally distributed (Hartigan’s dip test for unimodality, n. bootstrap samples = 10<sup>5</sup>, dip=0.03, p = 0) into two major groups. We found: (1) 137 sharp spike patterns involving on average about 17% units per session per pattern (with a maximum of a 3-unit assembly in a 20-unit set) and a temporal precision in the range of 0.006 - 0.06 sec centered around 0.028 sec (<italic>spike-assemblies</italic>) and (2) 204 broader firing rate patterns with on average 28% units per session per pattern (with a maximum of an 11-unit assembly in a 19-unit set) and temporal precision between 0.07 - 5 sec (<italic>rate-assemblies</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). This segregation into different timescales did not, however, correspond to different hippocampal cell populations; rather, spike- and rate-assemblies were composed of largely overlapping populations. About 83% of all assembly units participated in assemblies at both timescales. Moreover, two units taking part in the same spike-assembly were more likely to join the same rate-assembly than expected by chance (average probability of 0.9 against a chance level of 0.6, p &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup> computed by bootstrap, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). Consistent with previous place cell analyses, this indicates that the same sets of hippocampal units coordinated at temporal precisions of both tens and hundreds of milliseconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>].</p><p id="P9">In order to understand the origin of these two characteristic timescales, we examined assembly activations in space and time. Assemblies are considered active whenever all units composing the assembly fire spikes matching the assembly activation pattern identified by the algorithm. The assembly is considered to have an activation of <italic>n</italic>, when all units composing the assembly fire at least <italic>n</italic> spikes in the bins matching the assembly pattern. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows representative examples of activity patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1d, e</xref>) and activation maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1f, g</xref>) for both assembly groups. Rate-assemblies reflected the simultaneous or sequential activation of the place fields of their constituent units in specific maze locations and/or along task-relevant trajectories, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Their characteristic temporal scale, ranging from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds, was indeed compatible with the time needed by the animal to traverse the place field of a unit. Spike-assemblies, whose timescale is compatible with replay events or theta sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], had a more localized activation (with average spatial information of 2.67±0.09 in contrast to 1.91±0.07 for rate-assemblies, general linear mixed-effects model of the spatial information of assemblies according to the assembly type, spike-vs rate-assembly, F(1, 419) = 70.55, p = 7.0 10<sup>-16</sup>) which often appeared to be coordinated with the theta rhythm of the local field potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). To understand whether the observed coordination at short timescales was related specifically to replay events, we repeated the assembly detection but excluding epochs in correspondence of SWRs. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, the temporal resolution of the detected assemblies was conserved, showing that SWRs were not the prevailing source of fast coordination under these conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Spike-assemblies fire spikes phase-locked to the local theta rhythm</title><p id="P10">To quantify the relationships between assembly activations and the theta rhythm, we isolated the spikes fired by a unit while participating in assembly activations (<italic>assembly-spikes</italic>, in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) and compared their theta phase preference with the overall firing phase preference of that unit (in black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We found that both spike- and rate-assemblies were similarly phase modulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, generalized linear mixed-effects model of the probability of a unit phase-locking when firing within an assembly according to the assembly type, spike- vs rate-assembly; with binary dependent variable for significant phase locking and logit link function: F(1,1805) = 0.15, p = 0.70. The model accounts for rat identity and recording session as covariates. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref> for the same analysis excluding spikes fired during SWR), with about 70% of assembly-units phase-locked when active within an assembly configuration (all fractions presented here are computed after Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons, <italic>α</italic> = 0.05, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref> for Hodges-Ajne test on phase locking). Yet, of these, the fraction of units with a stronger phase modulation during assembly activity when compared to their overall activity was significantly higher for spike-assemblies (75%) than for rate-assemblies (30%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2c,d</xref>, generalized linear mixed-effects model of the probability of a unit increasing phase modulation when firing within an assembly according to the assembly type, spike- vs rate-assembly; with binary dependent variable for significant increases in phase modulation and logit link function: F(1,1310) = 134.15, p = 1.3 10<sup>-29</sup>. The model accounts for rat identity and recording session as covariates. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref> for the same analysis excluding spikes fired during SWR). Thus, while theta-modulated units contribute to both spike- and rate-assemblies, rate-assembly activations did not specifically coincide with temporal windows of high theta modulation. On the other hand, the higher temporal precision of spike-assemblies was associated with enhanced phase-locking of their contributing members when active within the assembly configuration.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Individual units change phase preference when active in different assemblies</title><p id="P11">As single units were often contributors to multiple assemblies (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) and assemblies activated with a characteristic phase preference (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), we wondered whether the phase preference of hippocampal units is an assembly-specific property rather than a unit-specific one. In other words, do hippocampal units change their phase preference when active in different assemblies? We found that among all units taking part in at least two phase-locked assemblies (n = 64 in spike-assemblies and n = 169 in rate-assemblies) an average of 27% (fraction computed after Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons, <italic>α</italic> = 0.05) changed their phase preference when active in different assemblies of the same temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3a, b</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref> for nonparametric test on equality of median phase). This relative <italic>phase-shift</italic> was found both in spike- and rate-assemblies, with a higher proportion of units with significant phase-shift in spike-assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, generalized linear mixed-effects model of the probability of a unit to phase-shift when firing in different assemblies according to the assembly type, spike- vs rate-assembly; with binary dependent variable for significant phase shift and logit link function: F(1,231) = 12.54, p = 4.8 10<sup>-4</sup>. The model accounts for rat identity and recording session as covariates. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref> for the same analysis excluding spikes fired during SWR).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Phase coding of hippocampal assemblies</title><p id="P12">To investigate whether such shifts in phase encoded spatial or contextual information, we focused the analysis on those units changing phase when active in different contexts, comparing their activation during task epochs corresponding to different locations and cognitive demands on the end-to-end T-maze. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref> show the activation along the maze of some typical units and the assemblies they joined. While single units fired in multiple locations, assembly activations were more selective (resulting in average spatial information of 2.25 ± 0.06 when compared with 1.52 ± 0.05 for single putative place cells), typically signaling one of the place fields of their constituent units and/or only a particular run type or direction.</p><p id="P13">This enhanced selectivity suggests that theta phase coding in hippocampal units extends beyond phase precession: while phase precession relative to the ongoing theta oscillation correlates with the distance covered by the animal within a unit’s place field, here we observed a phase preference disambiguating the activation of different assemblies in disjoined locations. We therefore hypothesized that theta phase coding of hippocampal units is not limited to the animal’s position within a place field, but is also associated with different locations or contexts in the environment.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The theta firing phase of place cells can discriminate between distinct place fields of the same unit</title><p id="P14">A possible confound for the presence of contextual phase-shift coding in different assemblies comes from the fact that the spikes fired within an assembly might not uniformly sample the place field of a unit. Thus, if two assemblies systematically sampled the initial and final part of a phase-precessing unit’s place field respectively, this could result in an assembly-specific change in phase preference. To rule out this possibility, we analyzed the phase preference of single units, this time separating their spikes according to their own place fields instead of by assembly membership. In single units with multiple place fields, different rate-assemblies often activated in correspondence to different place fields of the unit (e.g. cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). As single units changed their phase preference when active in different rate-assemblies (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), separating unit spikes by place field could reveal similar shifts in phase to those observed when separating them by rate-assembly.</p><p id="P15">Accordingly, we selected all units with multiple place fields and clustered their spikes according to their firing location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). We included in the analysis all recorded putative place cells, and not only those detected as participating in assemblies, as we assume that all CA1 place cells do participate in some assembly, but that sparse electrophysiological sampling of the CA1 population precludes the detection of all potential assemblies. In our dataset, putative place cells had more than one place field with a median of four fields per unit. Such a high number of place fields per unit was due to the relatively large size of the maze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>] and, critically, to its compartmentalization in clearly identifiable segments. Comparing the phase preference with respect to place field location, we found that 43% of the tested units changed firing phase when active in different place fields (value obtained as mean across sessions weighted by the number of units tested per session, 208 units among 24 sessions. Fraction computed after Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons, <italic>α</italic> = 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Note that for this test we included all spikes fired within a place field and compared them with all spikes fired in another place field of the same unit. Thus, the observed phase-shift cannot be explained by a biased sampling of different subregions of the place fields.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The firing phase of place cells can encode distinct task-related information within the same place field</title><p id="P16">Beyond encoding spatial information, the hippocampus has been shown to carry information about episodic memories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>] and abstract relations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Thus, hippocampal assemblies may encode task-relevant information beyond purely spatial parameters. We can therefore expect the recruitment of different assemblies when the animal has to remember, for example, a left turn rather than a right turn, or has to perform a guided turn rather than a choice turn. At the single-unit level, this should be reflected by a change in a unit’s phase preference for different trial types, even within the same location.</p><p id="P17">Separating unit spikes according to place field as in the previous analysis, we further divided the spikes according to the type of trial in which they occurred. Trials were divided into: left and right choice runs, when the animal had to choose between left and right turn; and four different types of guided runs, in which the sequence of turns was predetermined by the experimenter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). We found that 36% of units changed their phase preference when active in different trial types above chance level, despite overlapping place-field locations (value obtained as mean across sessions weighted by the number of units tested per session, 160 units among 23 sessions. Fraction computed after Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons, <italic>α</italic> = 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref> for same analysis with place fields identified with different methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref> for same analysis with spikes fired only in epochs of high theta-power and no SWR). In fact, separating a unit’s spikes not just by place field but according to the task epoch during which they occurred resulted in narrower and more coherent phase distributions of a unit’s spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). This observation was corroborated by training a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the phase of spikes fired in an individual place field to distinguish between trial types. We found that for 32% of units at least two trial types could be distinguished above chance level within at least one of the unit place fields (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref> for details).

Such phase coding goes beyond what would be expected by phase precession. Nevertheless, phase-shifting and phase precession could share common underlying mechanisms.

This suggests a possible interpretation of the phase-shift phenomena: spatial exploration or cognitive tasks recruit specific and diverse cell (rate-)assemblies; each assembly is characterized by a set of synaptic connections that provides the assembly-units with a characteristic level of excitation whenever the assembly is activated upon a specific task event; this assembly-specific degree of depolarization, combined with an oscillatory somatic inhibition, would thereby generate a phase preference, or phase-range preference, typical and specific for the activity of the unit within that assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). In line with this hypothesis, we found that differences in average phase preference between two sets of spikes also co-occurred with differences in the average instantaneous firing rate (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref> for methodological details). This was true when comparing spikes from different place-field locations, within the same location but from different trial types, or spikes occurring as part of different spike- or rate-assemblies (chi-square test of independence on pairs of spike-sets with p-value &gt; or &lt; 0.05 when testing phase and instantaneous firing rate differences: different place fields: <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1,<italic>N</italic> = 2165) = 28.9, <italic>p</italic> = 7.5 10<sup>–8</sup>, same location different trial types: <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1,<italic>N</italic> = 1004) = 20.5, <italic>p</italic> = 5.9 10<sup>–6</sup>, spike-assemblies: <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1,<italic>N</italic> = 318) = 4.9,<italic>p</italic> = 0.027, rate-assemblies: <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1,<italic>N</italic> = 5078) = 63.2, <italic>p</italic> = 2.0 10<sup>–15</sup>).</p><p id="P21">Finally, as for phase precession, the fine coordination of neuron firing with the theta oscillation will generate, at the network level, a stereotypical sequence of unit activations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. In the case of phase-shift coding however, the sequence of active units during a theta cycle will be determined not only by the spatial proximity of their place fields, but will also be affected by the identity of the assembly recruited at the time. This implies that the lag between the activation of two units within the theta cycle, and consequently the sequence order and composition, could vary according to the cognitive demand. We investigated this hypothesis by testing if the lag of maximal cross-correlation between two units within a theta cycle changed in different trial types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). To make sure that such a change was not due to occasional outliers but was consistent across trials, we selected the lag of maximal cross-correlation for each trial and compared the set of lags so obtained by trial type. We performed the analysis for each place field of each unit and found that changes in cross-correlation lags occurred with higher probability in place fields where units displayed phase-shift coding across trials (chi-square test of independence performed on place fields according to DBSCAN + GMM, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 11305) = 95.8, <italic>p</italic> = 0; DBSCAN, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 11305) = 63.6, <italic>p</italic> = 1.6 10<sup>−15</sup>; RM + GMM, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 8844) = 172.7, <italic>p</italic> = 0; RM, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 9747) = 113.1, <italic>p</italic> = 0; also confirmed when excluding spikes fired during SWR and low theta-power epochs: DBSCAN + GMM, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 11305) = 62.9, <italic>p</italic> = 2.2 10<sup>−15</sup>; DBSCAN, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 11305) = 69.2, <italic>p</italic> = 1.1 10<sup>−16</sup>; RM + GMM, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 8844) = 84.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0; RM, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 9747) = 25.3, <italic>p</italic> = 4.8 10<sup>−7</sup>).</p><p id="P22">To explore how the activation of different rate assemblies can produce different activation sequences along the theta cycle even within the same set of units, we simulated the phenomenon with an adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref> for formal description of the model)). As observed in the experimental data, single units could participate in multiple assemblies (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) and respond at different, but context-consistent, average firing rates (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). We simulated three units taking part in two rate assemblies. During the assembly activation, each unit received an assembly-specific degree of depolarization. Assembly retrieval was modeled by the synchronous and transient depolarization of its constituent units, while inhibition was on average constant over time, and identical for all units and both assemblies. Similarly to soma-dendritic interference models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>], we captured the interplay between the oscillatory inputs to units by sinusoidally modulating both excitatory and inhibitory conductances with a relative offset of <italic>π</italic> rad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref> <bold>top</bold>). As expected, assembly activations produced a broad increase in unit firing rate punctuated by faster temporal coordination with the theta oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref> <bold>bottom</bold>). This coordination was assembly-dependent and the simulated units changed their phase preference of firing, here computed with respect to the timecourse of the excitatory depolarization, when active in the two assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref> <bold>right</bold>). To formally detect multi-unit activity patterns generated by the assembly activations, we simulated multiple retrievals of the two assemblies and analyzed the obtained spike trains with CAD<italic>opti</italic> assembly detection algorithm, as previously done with our experimental dataset (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for simulation details and CAD<italic>opti</italic> parameters). The activation of both assemblies produced, at a fine temporal scale, sequential activity patterns with a mean lag of 0.06 ± 0.005 sec and 0.07 ± 0.005 sec of the second and the third unit from the first active. Despite the similarity in pattern structure, the two assemblies triggered a different activation order of their constituent units. In 98% of the simulations (n = 100 simulations performed with different noise realizations), the detected activation sequence reflected the assembly-specific degree of depolarization provided to each unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref> <bold>inset</bold>).

We detected place cell assemblies using an unsupervised algorithm able to extract coordinated activity from the data without pre-defining timescales of interest. This corroborated extensive evidence that hippocampal coding is characterized by two predominant time scales: a rate scale (‘rate-assemblies’) reflecting place field firing rate modulation, and a sub-second temporal scale (‘spike-assemblies’) compatible with the entrainment of spikes by theta rhythms and during SWR-associated replay events. The relatively broad timescale characteristic of rate-assemblies suggests that their coordination is not solely imposed by the shared modulation of their composing units by the local theta rhythm, in agreement with their robustness to degradation of cholinergic signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. Nevertheless, spikes fired within either spike- and rate-assemblies coordinated with the theta rhythm, in line with previous literature reporting theta phase-locking of CA1 neurons when active in an assembly configuration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. We show that such theta locking is most pronounced for spike-assemblies, but present in rate-assemblies as well. A possible explanation for this enhanced phase locking is that isolating spikes fired within an assembly configuration effectively separates a specific mode from the otherwise multimodal phase distribution of the unit firing. In fact, the enhanced phase modulation of hippocampal units during assembly activations also revealed that units taking part in multiple assemblies changed their preferred spiking phase according to the assembly active at the time. This shift often coincided with a change in the location of place-field of activation of the unit when active in one or the other assembly. The observed higher specificity of information coding by assemblies with respect to that of the participating units therefore agreed with the higher specificity in phase preference exhibited by single units when active as part of the assembly. This was true both for rate- and, more frequently, spike-assemblies, and was not induced by SWR-associated replay events.</p><p id="P25">The enhanced phase modulation of hippocampal units during assembly activations also revealed that units taking part in multiple assemblies changed their preferred spiking phase according to the assembly active at the time. This modulation, not attributable to replay events, was validated at the single-unit level by grouping spikes by the place fields in which they occurred, rather than by assemblies. In the dorsal CA1’s deep sublayers, place cells can exhibit dual theta-phase firing preferences as the animal crosses the cell’s place field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. Here we show that changes in preferred firing phase can distinguish between distinct place fields or between different visits to overlapping locations on alternative routes, particularly under conditions that require active use of spatial memory and/or decision-making. These changes were fast and reversible, in line with the hypothesis that they were generated by the transient activation of different cell assemblies.</p><p id="P26">Our findings may reflect mechanisms related to those driving theta phase precession in CA1 place cells. Although unanimous agreement about those mechanisms is yet to be reached, models fall into three broad categories: interference between oscillations of the somatic membrane potential and of dendritic potentials at a slightly higher frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]; progressive dendritic depolarization coupled with somatic oscillatory inhibition discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]; and patterns of synaptic transmission delays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. To test these various hypotheses, numerous experimental efforts have been made to elucidate the relationship between cell depolarization and spiking phase. Spatially uniform inhibitory conductance has been shown to enhance the range of phase precession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. It has been observed that while the animal moves towards the center of a cell’s place field, rate and phase of spiking strongly correlate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. This correlation is, however, lost as the rate peak is passed and the animal leaves the cell’s place field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. In vivo whole-cell recordings have shown that, during phase precession, the baseline membrane potential of CA1 pyramidal neurons undergoes a ramp-like depolarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]. In vitro, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from dendrites and somata showed that an increase in dendritic excitation, coupled with phasic somatic inhibition, causes an increase in the neuron’s firing and the advancement of the spiking phase with respect to the somatic modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Similar results were observed when progressively depolarizing the membrane potential of hippocampal cells in anesthetized animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p><p id="P27">In line with this evidence that changes in depolarization lead to changes in discharge phase, we found in our data that the changes in phase preference of individual units also co-occurred with changes in the instantaneous firing rate. While a recent study has shown that anatomically distinct place cell subpopulations in superficial and deep sublayers of dorsal CA1 pyramidal cell layer bias towards rate and phase coding of spatial information respectively, as the richness of sensory cues in the local environment is experimentally manipulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>], our results suggest an integration of rate and phase coding <italic>within</italic> a population to supports coding of complex information. This was also replicated through a model of adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire units similar in spirit to the soma-dendritic interference models ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]; c.f. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). The model confirmed that the activation of an assembly imposed an assembly-specific rate and phase preference on each assembly unit, thus producing, at the population level, assembly-specific theta sequences. Thus, while correlation between rate and phase changes has been observed during rate remapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>], our findings demonstrate that phase-shift coding extends beyond rate remapping and occurs also between distinct place fields or assemblies, frequently coinciding with changes in instantaneous firing rate, similar to those observed for splitter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The model predictions are also in line with recent work showing that individual place cells quickly switch between the encoding of alternative future locations or heading directions on alternate theta cycles, with lower firing rates for non-preferred directions occurring in later theta phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. The mechanism highlighted by our analysis and model is not the sole modulator of firing of CA1 cells, as the timing of specific inputs from Schaffer collaterals and the perforant path also plays a role in their phase of discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. Nevertheless, it captures the role played by various depolarization settings in inducing a modulation and discretization of phase preference of hippocampal CA1 place cells. We therefore propose that phase-shift coding may be a consequence of the different levels of depolarization generated by the specific constellations of synaptic input resulting from the activation of different assemblies as the animal encounters different cognitive or environmental contexts (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>).</p><p id="P28">The fine temporal coordination of unit activities imposed by phase precession is commensurate with the induction of plasticity mechanisms for binding episodic information that, otherwise, would be separated by seconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. For this reason, phase precession has been proposed as a network mechanism for episodic sequence learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>]. In support of this hypothesis, degradation of the temporal coordination of hippocampal units with the theta rhythm, e.g. by the administration of the cannabinoid receptor agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>] or by muscimol injection into the medial septum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>], led to reduced performance in memory tasks despite leaving place-field representations intact. Degraded phase precession caused by the passive transportation of rats during spatial exploration also drastically reduced replay during subsequent sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>], potentially reflecting impaired memory consolidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>]. The changes in assembly-specific phase preference of hippocampal units reported here allow rapid reconfiguration of different theta sequences within the same neural population, differentiating distinct maze locations or distinct mnemonic information. This could contribute to the formation of context-dependent theta sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>], supporting the formation of episodic memories and planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><p id="P29">Goal-dependent theta sequences have been observed during decision-making tasks, where the theta sequences terminated with the activation of cells encoding distant goal locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. The process by which goal-related theta sequences form is still unclear, as is the causal relation between phase precession and theta sequences (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>] for review). One hypothesis is that during the early stages of learning, inter-regional assemblies (e.g. prefrontal-hippocampal assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>] or medial-septum-hippocampal assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>]), recruited at each theta cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>], modulate the depolarization of hippocampal units thereby dynamically producing goal-dependent cycling activity. In particular, as suggested by our theoretical model (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>), a low-level generalized depolarization of the cells encoding the current goal location could explain their spiking at the end of theta sequences, even when the animal is far from that location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Similarly, the cognitive segmentation of a task-induced by the presence of landmarks and corners within a maze, could induce a shared enhanced depolarization to all the cells involved in the same ‘cognitive segment’, also in those with place field far from the animal but within the traveled maze segment. This could give rise to the observed space chucking of hippocampal theta sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Finally, similar mechanisms as observed here for assembly-dependent phase preference of CA1 units may also play roles in organizing phase preferences of neurons across other brain regions, consistent with evidence for phase precession in the dentate gyrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>], CA3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>], entorhinal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>], subiculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>], ventral striatum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>] and in the medial prefrontal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Such distributed processing would therefore support the integration of spatial and temporal information into cognitive contexts at a timescale commensurate with rapid adaptive behaviors, dynamically aligning different hippocampal assemblies with different subsets of neocortical and subcortical neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Animals and husbandry</title><p id="P30">All procedures were conducted in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and approved by the University of Bristol Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board.

All guided trials began at the ‘C’ end of the maze and ended at the ‘G’ end, while the interleaved choice trials ran in the opposite direction. Rats were allowed to perform up to 40/40 guided/choice trials. Learning of the task rule was assessed by the percentage of correct choices made (&gt;70% correct trials over at least 3 consecutive days). In this manuscript, we analyzed recordings from four days (for a total of 24 sessions) after the performance criterion was reached.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Histology</title><p id="P34">At the end of each experiment, the rat was deeply anesthetized with intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital and a small electrolytic was lesion made at the tip of each tetrode (positive current of 0.3 mA for 10s).

CAD detects recurrent activity patterns of arbitrary structure and temporal precision in multivariate time series. The algorithm is based on a recursive agglomeration scheme, at each step of which it detects and tests assemblies of progressively larger size. As the first step of the algorithm, CAD scans the activity of all possible pairs of units in the recorded set to select the most common shared (potentially lagged) activation pattern, and test if this reoccurs more frequently than expected by chance. If the test is significant, a new time series is created to reflect the activation of the detected assembly-pattern. In the second step of the algorithm, the new assembly activation time series are tested in turn including the remaining recorded units. If the test is significant the unit becomes part of the assembly and a new assembly activation time series is generated. The algorithm stops when no more units can be added to the assemblies detected in the previous agglomeration step (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] for a more detailed description of the algorithm). It follows that the hypothetical inclusion of supplementary units beyond those actually recorded would affect the number and size of the detected assemblies but it would not alter the coordination patterns already detected in the existing set. In this manuscript, the detection of paired assemblies was performed stopping the agglomeration at the initial pairwise step, while full-size assemblies were detected letting the algorithm agglomerate until completion.</p><p id="P37">To uncover the temporal scales most represented in the hippocampal spike trains we ran CAD on a broad spectrum of temporal resolutions sampled with a logarithmic scale in the interval [0.005 - 5.0] sec. CAD tests multiple temporal resolutions and if the same sets of units coordinate at multiple timescales the algorithm will return all of them. This analysis revealed the presence of two distinct timescales: one between 0.005 and 0.06 sec (spike-assemblies) and a second between 0.07 and 5.0 sec (rate-assemblies). To compare the extent of phase-locking and phase shift-coding within the two assembly groups we repeated the assembly detection separately for the two time windows using CAD<italic>opti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>] (algorithm available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/DurstewitzLab/CADopti">https://github.com/DurstewitzLab/CADopti</ext-link>).

Thus, each assembly was unique within each window but could be detected in both time windows. This pruning procedure allowed a fair comparison between the two timescales, without the distortion given by considering as independent assemblies the same set of units detected at neighboring temporal resolutions. Finally, we want to note that the detected assemblies cannot result from the detection of spike sorting mistakes. In such a case, in fact, assemblies would have been detected at the highest temporal precision (binning of 0.0058 sec), which is not the case as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>.</p><p id="P38">For all the analysis of this manuscript the reference lag was set at 2.

In guided trials the animal runs in direction C→G, following a predetermined path guided by motorized moveable doors; (b) The distribution of the temporal precision of the assemblies detected during the spatial working memory task shows the presence of two predominant timescales: one peaked around 28 ms and one on the second scale.

The grayscale indicates the temporal resolution at which assemblies are detected; the color scale shows the lag between the activation of each assembly-unit with respect to the unit first active in the assembly. Units marked in dark blue (lag of 0) are the first to activate within the assembly, units marked in dark red the last (2 bins after the activation of the first assembly-unit).
