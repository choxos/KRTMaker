Neurological impairments can reduce the degree of foot placement control. For individuals with such impairments, interventions that could improve foot placement control could thus contribute to improved gait stability. In this study we aimed to better understand two potential interventions, by investigating their effect in neurologically intact individuals. The degree of foot placement control can be quantified based on a foot placement model, in which the CoM position and velocity during swing predict subsequent foot placement. Previously, perturbing foot placement with a force-field resulted in an enhanced degree of foot placement control as an after-effect. Moreover, muscle vibration enhanced the degree of foot placement control through sensory augmentation whilst the vibration was applied. Here, we replicated these two findings and further investigated whether Q1) sensory augmentation leads to an after-effect and Q2) whether combining sensory augmentation with force-field perturbations leads to a larger after-effect, as compared to force-field perturbations only. In addition, we evaluated several potential contributors to the degree of foot placement control, by considering foot placement errors, CoM variability and the CoM position gain (β<sub>pos</sub>) of the foot placement model, next to the R<sup>2</sup> measure as the degree of foot placement control. Sensory augmentation led to a higher degree of foot placement control as an after-effect (Q1). However, combining sensory augmentation and force-field perturbations did not lead to a larger after-effect, as compared to following force-field perturbations only (Q2). Furthermore, we showed that, the improved degree of foot placement control following force-field perturbations and during/following muscle vibration, did not reflect diminished foot placement errors. Rather, participants demonstrated a stronger active response (higher β<sub>pos</sub>) as well as higher CoM variability.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Controlling where we place our feet mediolaterally from our center-of-mass (CoM) ensures stability during (steady-state) walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Healthy individuals actively steer their swing leg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] to enact this mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. However, in older adults and individuals with neurological impairments the coordination of the CoM kinematic state (during swing) and subsequent foot placement can be diminished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P3">For stroke patients classified as at high fall risk, the coordination of CoM kinematic state and foot placement is clearly disrupted, whereas stroke patients at low fall risk still coordinate foot placement similarly to healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Thus, training the relationship between foot placement and CoM kinematic state (hereafter referred to as “the degree of foot placement control”) may improve mediolateral gait stability and prevent falls. A linear model has been demonstrated to describe the relationship between the CoM kinematic state during swing and subsequent foot placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Since perturbing sensory information elicits responses predictably according to this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], we consider this linear foot placement model to reflect an internal model, defining target foot placement. That the target foot placement defined by this control strategy is aimed at maintaining gait stability followed from external lateral stabilization studies, showing less foot placement control when externally stabilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Measures of the explained variance of this model, such as R<sup>2</sup> and partial correlation measures can as such be considered “the degree of foot placement control” with respect to the CoM. In turn, the unexplained variance of the foot placement model (i.e. the residuals) can be considered as “foot placement errors”; emerging from motor noise, loose control or sensorimotor impairments.</p><p id="P4">The degree of foot placement control has been shown to increase as an after-effect following training sessions within a perturbing force-field, both in stroke patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], and in neurologically intact individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Even in neurologically intact individuals, CoM variations are not entirely accounted for by subsequent modulation in foot placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Foot placement errors persist, which are only partially accounted for by ankle moment control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. It thus seems that the remainder of these foot placement errors, is small enough for healthy, young individuals to remain stable. However, a perturbing force-field may increase the foot placement errors to such an extent that even healthy individuals are driven to tighten their foot placement control to minimize the error. Consequently, error-based learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] may underlie the adaptations to a perturbing force-field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The force-field perturbs foot placement, as such changing the outcome of the motor plan actuating muscles to steer the swing leg towards the target location. Assuming we perceive the resulting foot placement errors as a motor execution error, rather than having aimed for a wrong target foot placement, participants would adapt this motor plan to improve foot placement control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Furthermore, the degree of foot placement control can be improved whilst walking with augmented proprioception, provided through muscle vibration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Applying muscle vibration to either the stance leg or the swing leg hip adductors, caused more medial or more lateral foot placement, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Controlling vibration based on step-by-step pelvis displacement (as a proxy for step-by-step CoM displacement) strengthened the relationship between the CoM kinematic state and foot placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. These improvements in foot placement control have been attributed to sensory augmentation. In other words, the ratio between detected relevant sensory information, in this case the CoM kinematic state (stance leg vibration) or the swing leg’s mechanical state (swing leg vibration), and sensory noise is thought to be improved by the timed muscle vibration. Consequently, as a result of better sensory detection, the degree of foot placement control increased whilst the muscle vibration was active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P6">It remains to be investigated whether sensory augmentation has long lasting effects. Since timed muscle vibration is thought to improve sensory detection of the CoM kinematic state, as well as swing leg mechanical state, we considered it unlikely that sensory augmentation by itself would induce any after-effects. Improved foot placement control due to sensory augmentation would require the vibration to be active. To test the assumption that sensory augmentation only affects foot placement control whilst muscle vibration is applied, we tested Q1) whether sensory augmentation leads to an after-effect.</p><p id="P7">If sensory augmentation does lead to an after-effect, it would prove our assumption outlined above wrong. It would mean that apart from an immediate sensory augmentation effect, muscle vibration may facilitate motor adaptation. Perhaps, an improved sensory signal to noise ratio, may allow for a more accurate update of the motor plan, following better detection of erroneous motor execution of foot placement.</p><p id="P8">If so, sensory augmentation may especially enhance error-based motor learning, when applied during foot placement perturbations. To investigate this possibility, we tested Q2) whether adding sensory augmentation to perturbing force-field training enhances its positive effects on the degree of foot placement control.</p><p id="P9">In addition, we replicated that R1) a perturbing force field results in an increased degree of foot placement control as an after-effect and R2) that augmented proprioception enhances the degree of foot placement control during muscle vibration. Lastly, we checked whether, in line with our assumptions regarding error-based learning, force field perturbations increased foot placement errors.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P10">The research proposal and hypotheses have been preregistered on OSF: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FDCHU">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FDCHU</ext-link>. We have deviated from the preregistered research proposal, by changing our introduction, to improve focus and clarity of the manuscript. In addition, we have checked one of our assumptions, namely that the force-field would induce larger foot placement errors, through an additional statistical test. Furthermore, although we retained our preregistered main outcome measure, we now support this main outcome measure with different secondary outcome measures than preregistered. In doing so, we could gain better insight into what changes in our main outcome measure reflected.</p><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P11">Neurologically intact adults (18-40 years old) were recruited. The final sample size was partly determined by a Bayesian sequential sampling approach (i.e. sampling until a threshold of meaningful evidence was reached) and partly by collecting sufficient data to explore order effects of the three training types (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary material A</xref>). We initially aimed for recruiting 18 participants (i.e. 3 participants for each order of training types), yet planned to continue to add participants until we reached a BF<sub>10</sub> of 10 or a BF<sub>01</sub> of 0.1 (indicative of strong relative evidence respectively for the alternative or the null hypothesis) or a preset maximum of 24 participants. As preregistered, the sequential sampling approach was based on the Bayes Factors of both R1 and R2.</p><p id="P12">Since, for our main outcome measure, we did not reach a Bayes Factor indicating strong relative evidence for R1 and R2, we ended up with the predetermined maximum of 24 participants (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref> for participant characteristics). All participants signed an informed consent form prior to participating in the experiment, and ethical approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the Medical University of South Carolina.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Experimental protocol</title><p id="P13">Participants visited the lab for one session, in which they were asked to walk on a treadmill at a speed of 1.2 m/s, in one familiarization and three training conditions. During all walking conditions, participants wore a harness and were instructed to look forward as much as possible. As a safety precaution, one experimenter was always standing next to the treadmill, chatting to them and making sure they were comfortable throughout the experiment.</p><p id="P14">During familiarization participants walked for ten minutes in a transparent force-field set-up, (i.e. the leg cuffs of the force-field were mounted, but the force-field produced minimal force on the legs). During familiarization no sensory augmentation was applied. In the training conditions participants walked an eight-minute episode either in a perturbing force-field, with sensory augmentation or with sensory augmentation whilst in the perturbing force field. Before and after each training episode participants walked for two minutes again within a transparent force field and without sensory augmentation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Data collection and experimental set-up</title><sec id="S6"><title>Kinematics</title><p id="P15">Kinematics of the pelvis and feet (heel marker) were recorded using PhaseSpace, sampled at 120 Hz.

Participants wore a cuff on both calves, with two bars on the lateral side of each cuff for the force-field wire to run through. The force-field wires were attached to sliders in the front and back of the treadmill, which, during the trial were actuated to slide in mediolateral direction, and as such perturb foot placement in the mediolateral direction. Prior to the walking conditions, we aimed to tension this wire until the same value for each participant (180 N/m), which was earlier determined to be an appropriate stiffness to induce clear effects on step width [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The force-field’s responses were triggered by the heel markers (phase of the gait cycle) and the perturbation magnitude was determined based on how far the pelvis marker deviated from its median mediolateral displacement, as computed for the final 50 strides of T1.</p><p id="P17">In this way, the perturbing force-field was controlled based on individual stepping characteristics. The perturbations aimed at pushing the leg towards taking a wide step when a narrow step was warranted to maintain gait stability, and vice-versa. For the final 50 steps of the T1 period, we quantified the step width and the mediolateral displacement of the pelvis from the stance foot at the start of the step (defined as the instance where the heel marker switched from moving posterior to moving anterior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]). We then sorted the step width values in descending order and the pelvis displacement values in ascending order, and calculated the best-fit linear relationship between the sorted variables. This relationship is the basis for our force-field control. It perturbs the normal positive correlation between pelvis displacement and step width, whilst ensuring that participant step widths approximately spanned their normal range. For example, if for a given step, the pelvis displacement is at the very low end of the range seen in this participant, the force-field will push the swing leg toward a mediolateral location corresponding to a step width at the high end of the range in this participant and vice versa. If the pelvis displacement is around the median value for a participant however, the force-field will push the swing leg toward approximately the median step width value for this participant. Thus, the farther the pelvis is from the median pelvis displacement in T1, the larger the perturbation magnitude will be.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Sensory augmentation</title><p id="P18">Sensory augmentation was achieved by applying muscle vibration using tactors as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. A tactor was placed across each m. gluteus medius, i.e. between the trochanter major and the iliac crest. The tactors were triggered based on the pelvis displacement at the start of the step. Depending on whether this pelvis displacement was smaller or larger than the median pelvis displacement during the final 50 steps of the corresponding T1 episode, either the stance or the swing leg muscle vibrator was activated during that step. The further from the median pelvis displacement, the higher the vibration frequency (ranging between 34 and 74 Hz). The vibration was turned on at the start of the step and lasted for a duration of the mean step period during the final 50 steps of T1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Data processing</title><sec id="S10"><title>Gait event detection</title><p id="P19">For the data analysis, gait event detection was based on the heel markers.

Challenging our current understanding of its underlying mechanisms, sensory augmentation itself led to a higher degree of foot placement control as an after-effect.</p><sec id="S21"><title>Perturbation induced error-based learning?</title><p id="P44">As expected, the force-field perturbations caused foot placement errors to increase whilst the perturbations were applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Adapting to these errors could result in a gradual increase of the degree of foot placement control during perturbed walking, as was reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], and as an after-effect, as was found before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and replicated here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Although error-based learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] may have occurred, the current results show that the after-effect comes with an increase in foot placement errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> panel A). Thus, the adaptations to the force-field did not result in more precise foot placement once the perturbations were stopped. Instead, participants walked with a higher variation in their CoM kinematic state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5</xref>, panel B) and with a higher gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, panel C) of the foot placement model (Model 1, β<sub>pos</sub>). It seems that participants adapted their motor plan to generate stronger active responses (as reflected by the higher gain), in response to deviations in their CoM kinematic state. This would favor the aim of placing the foot closer to the target position whilst the perturbations are still active. However, this adaptation will likely cause foot placement to overshoot a stable position once the perturbations stop. This can lead to larger deviations in CoM kinematic state. With a higher variation in CoM kinematic state, participants will have to place their feet at the wider end of the range that they usually walk at (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, Panel C), so that relatively their degree of foot placement control (R<sup>2</sup>) will improve, even though in absolute terms they stepped less precisely (higher foot placement errors).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Replication: Sensory augmentation enhances the degree of foot placement control during muscle vibration</title><p id="P45">Improved sensory detection has demonstrated potential to enhance gait stability control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Muscle vibration studies showed that vibration of the hip abductor muscles causes responses in foot placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], and when timed in accordance with deviations of the CoM kinematic state, can enhance the degree of foot placement control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Here, we have replicated earlier findings showing an enhanced degree of foot placement control whilst the vibration is applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Our secondary outcome measures provide more insight into what this improved degree of foot placement control reflects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p id="P46">The degree of foot placement control did not improve as a result of a reduction in foot placement error magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, panel A). We found only anecdotal evidence to support a change in foot placement errors, and this change tended towards an increase as opposed to a decrease in foot placement error magnitude. Instead, a higher CoM variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, panel B), accompanied by a higher gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, Panel C), seem to underlie the higher degree of foot placement control. Based on the immediate effects only, this can be explained either in the context of the muscle vibration resulting in illusory sensory information, or in the context of muscle vibration improving the signal to noise ratio.</p><p id="P47">In the introduction, we proposed that timed muscle vibration, as sensory augmentation, may improve the sensory signal to noise ratio. However, perhaps the muscle vibration did not improve the signal to noise ratio, but rather created an illusion of a larger CoM deviation, or a more adducted swing leg respectively, that merely led to a stronger (higher gain) rather than to a more accurate response (no reduction in foot placement errors). In turn, these larger responses, based on “unreliable” sensory information, could have led to higher CoM variability.</p><p id="P48">Alternatively, the stronger response could be the result of sensory augmentation, improving the signal to noise ratio. With more certainty about the mechanical state, one may adopt less conservative foot placement control. With sensory augmentation, noise is less likely to result in a target position in the wrong direction and thus strong responses may pose less of a risk. More reliable sensory information due to sensory augmentation could therefore trigger recalibration of the internal model (Model 1) defining the targeted relationship between the CoM kinematic state during swing and subsequent foot placement. In this context, the increased CoM variability could characterize a gait pattern which is more dependent on foot placement control.</p><p id="P49">The latter explanation, i.e. in the context of sensory augmentation effects, would allow for better understanding of the after-effect we found following the training with muscle vibration.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Sensory augmentation results in an after-effect</title><p id="P50">Against our initial assumption that muscle vibration had to be continuously applied for sensory augmentation to affect the gait pattern, after-effects were found following the timed muscle vibration. The degree of foot placement control increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>), not due to a decrease in foot placement errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, panel A) but rather due to increased deviations in CoM mediolateral position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, panel B) and its gain in Model 1(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, panel C).</p><p id="P51">Following the rationale outlined for the immediate sensory augmentation effects of muscle vibration, the changes in CoM variability and foot placement gain, may reflect a recalibrated internal foot placement model, as well as a gait pattern in which one chooses to rely more on foot placement control. The higher gain in the after-effect condition supports that the muscle vibration induced sensory augmentation rather than an unreliable illusion. If participants would have recalibrated the internal foot placement model (Model 1) due to a “perturbing” illusion, one would expect a lower gain in the after-effect condition. For example, an illusory more medial sensing of the CoM, will provoke too medial (i.e. with respect to the actual CoM position) foot placement, and participants would likely start to respond less strongly to the sensed (illusory) CoM kinematic state deviations. Thus, over time, resulting in a lower gain of Model 1. However, if participants were triggered to recalibrate their internal foot placement model due to sensory augmentation (i.e. more certainty of foot placement direction), the larger gain could be explained.</p><p id="P52">Since foot placement errors did not decrease, it is unlikely that the sensory augmentation improved error-based learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], as we had proposed earlier in the introduction. Rather, sensory augmentation may cause increased gains of the internal foot placement model (Model 1), if the sensory information can be considered more reliable. Since foot placement perturbations will lead to less predictable sensory outcomes, combining foot placement perturbations and sensory augmentation may mitigate sensory augmentation effects. Moreover, since sensory augmentation does not seem to improve error-based learning, it can be understood why we did not find an enhanced perturbation after-effect when adding muscle vibration to perturbation-based training.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Combining force field perturbations and sensory augmentation does not lead to a larger after-effect</title><p id="P53">In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref> it can be observed that combining the force field with sensory augmentation did not yield a larger positive after-effect as compared to force-field perturbations alone. As discussed above, although force-field perturbations seem to trigger error-based learning, sensory augmentation does not seem to affect the error-based learning process.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P54">For the current study, a proper familiarization period was important, to avoid training effects to be confounded by familiarization effects. The ten minutes for familiarization were based on the recommendation of having at least six to seven minutes (or about 425 strides) for treadmill familiarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. However, in the latter study, they did not test whether the specific outcome measures used in the current study, would stabilize after this time period. The degree of foot placement control has been found to change during a ten-minute familiarization period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], and older adults still demonstrated changes in related outcome measures after multiple sessions of treadmill walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Yet, given the consistency of our findings with earlier work, as well as an absence of clear order effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary material A</xref>), it is unlikely that the adaptation effects found reflect familiarization effects. Moreover, we ensured that each training condition had its own baseline (T1) trial, to limit the possibility of detecting effects due to walking duration only. Still, the absence of a control group, walking on the treadmill within a transparent force-field only, makes it that we cannot completely rule out effects of walking duration.</p><p id="P55">Another important factor we had to consider was to make sure that the training period was long enough to induce adaptation effects. Therefore, the eight-minute duration of the training episodes was based on earlier findings by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], for which immediate effects of the force-field on the coordination between CoM kinematic state and foot placement appear to plateau after approximately eight minutes of force-field exposure. Since we replicated earlier findings of the effects of sensory augmentation and force-field perturbations, we may assume that, for the questions of this study, the training period was long enough.</p><p id="P56">By our choice of outcome measures we limited ourselves to a description of foot placement control. Although it has been established that foot placement control with respect to the CoM contributes to mediolateral gait stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], we did not include a direct measure of gait stability, and can thus not make direct inferences on how force-field perturbations and sensory augmentation affect gait stability. Since the current study aims at giving better insight into what earlier found improvements in the degree of foot placement control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] reflect, as well as whether the effects of sensory augmentation and force-field perturbations could complement each other, further investigating the relationship with gait stability is beyond the scope of this study. Another study, has already established a link between foot placement outcome measures and clinical outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Future work is needed to gain more insight into which (foot placement) outcome measures should improve for a gait stability training to be effective. Moreover, it remains to be investigated whether patient populations respond in the same way to these interventions, as the healthy adults in the current study. Future research should also focus on whether adaptation effects as measured on the treadmill translate to over ground walking.</p><p id="P57">Lastly, we admit that our current measures do not allow us to distinguish between adaptations to the internal foot placement model (Model 1), defining the target position, versus adaptations of the motor execution plan, defining the muscle activity to execute the foot placement response. For now, we speculate that the force-field operates at the level of the motor execution plan, likely leading to adaptations of the motor execution plan. Sensory augmentation on the other hand, may trigger adaptations of the internal foot placement model, updating desired target foot placement positions. Further experimental and modelling studies are required to untangle at which level the adaptations truly take place.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Clinical perspectives</title><p id="P58">The training interventions studied here did not result in smaller foot placement errors, yet promoted stronger foot placement responses to deviations in CoM kinematic state. In stroke patients for whom foot placement control is disrupted to such an extent that the gains of the foot placement model (Model 1) tend to change sign [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], this may be a favorable adaptation. Perhaps, they can adapt to actively control their foot placement with a gain in the appropriate direction. However, for patients who aim to reduce CoM variability, such adaptations may be less desirable.</p></sec><sec id="S27" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P59">We conclude that both sensory augmentation and force-field perturbations enhance the degree of foot placement control. Both methods result in a higher degree of foot placement control as an after-effect, but do not diminish foot placement errors. Instead, stronger active responses seem to be the result of both interventions. Combining the two interventions does not lead to augmented after-effects.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS189772-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d98aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S28"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors like to thank everyone that helped making the execution of this experiment possible in the short time that Moira visited Charleston.
