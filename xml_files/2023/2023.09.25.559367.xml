We leveraged detailed phenotypic and genomic data of nearly all living kākāpō to understand the evolution of its remarkable feather color polymorphism. The kākāpō is an endangered and culturally significant parrot endemic to Aotearoa New Zealand, and the green and olive feather colorations are present at similar frequencies in the population. The presence of such a neatly balanced color polymorphism is remarkable because the entire population currently numbers less than 250 birds, which means it has been exposed to severe genetic drift. We dissected the color phenotype, demonstrating that the two colors differ in their light reflectance patterns due to differential feather structure. We used quantitative genomics methods to identify two genetic variants whose epistatic interaction can fully explain the species’ color phenotype. Our genomic forward simulations show that balancing selection might have been pivotal to establish the polymorphism in the ancestrally large population, and to maintain it during population declines that involved a severe bottleneck. We hypothesize that an extinct apex predator was the likely agent of balancing selection, making the color polymorphism in the kākāpō a “ghost of selection past”.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>evolutionary genomics</kwd><kwd>conservation genomics</kwd><kwd>genomic simulations</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">About a century ago, population geneticists began to study the evolution of polymorphisms at genetic loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. We have now reached a milestone where we can examine nucleotide variation across the entire genome of every single individual of a species. This remarkable feat has been accomplished for the kākāpō <italic>(Strigops habroptilus)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>,</italic> a critically endangered flightless parrot species endemic to Aotearoa New Zealand that is considered a taonga (treasure) of Ngāi Tahu, a Māori iwi (tribe) of Te Wai Pounamu (the South Island of Aotearoa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The genomic data that has been generated for this species now enables us to study population genomics at an unprecedented resolution, improving our understanding of the evolutionary forces impacting this threatened species with the potential to inform their conservation and recovery in partnership with Ngāi Tahu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">In this study, we explore the puzzling phenomenon of the kākāpō feather color polymorphism (“green” and “olive” phenotypes) and how this severely bottlenecked species managed to retain its phenotypic diversity. The kākāpō has experienced a population decline and significant genetic drift over the past 30,000 years (30 KYA), followed by a sharp, anthropogenically induced population bottleneck resulting in just 51 surviving individuals in 1995<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Under the close management of the Aotearoa New Zealand Department of Conservation Te Papa Atawhai Kākāpō Recovery Programme in partnership with Ngāi Tahu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, the population size has increased to 247 birds located on several predator-free islands [as of September 1<sup>st</sup> 2023]. Despite these severe bottleneck events, the population exhibits a relatively balanced distribution of green and olive individuals; to understand the evolution of this color polymorphism, we here assess the phenotype’s genomic basis and how the genetic polymorphism was first established and has since been maintained in the population.</p><p id="P4">Population genetic theory hereby stipulates that newly emerged genetic variants (i.e., mutations), are rarely expected to reach appreciable allele frequencies when they evolve neutrally since they often get lost through genetic drift<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Kimura’s neutral theory of molecular evolution suggests that most genetic polymorphisms are neutral (or slightly deleterious) because if a mutation conferred selective advantage, it would be expected to rise to fixation, replacing the ancestral allele<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> − unless the frequency rise of such beneficial variants is halted by one or more counteracting evolutionary forces. Balancing selection can theoretically balance allele frequencies and produce stable genetic polymorphisms, for example through negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), overdominance, antagonistic selection, or temporally and spatially varying selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. To understand the establishment and maintenance of genetic polymorphisms, we therefore need to first reject the null hypothesis of neutral evolution, and then describe the evolutionary forces that help maintain the genetic polymorphism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In the case of the kākāpō’s genetic polymorphism that underlies its color polymorphism, we therefore have to assess how the genetic polymorphism was not randomly lost in the species’ large ancestral population, and how it has since been maintained despite population decline and a severe population bottleneck.</p><p id="P5">Understanding the establishment and maintenance of the kākāpō polymorphism might be of importance for ongoing conservation efforts since the significant majority (nearly 70%) of the wild founder population from 1995 were of green color. Whether the color polymorphism is likely to impact fitness in the absence of current intensive conservation management is therefore of potential conservation relevance − especially given the long-term plans of the Kākāpō Recovery Programme and Ngāi Tahu to restore this critically endangered species beyond predator-free islands. Why the kākāpō species has maintained the green and olive phenotype has so far remained elusive. Before the arrival of tūpuna Māori in AD 1280<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, the only predators of the kākāpō were avian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, the vast majority of which hunt by sight. While the apex predators, the Haast’s eagle (<italic>Hieraaetus moorei</italic>) and the Eyles’ harrier (<italic>Circus teauteensis</italic>), went extinct approximately 600 years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, we hypothesize that the kākāpō color polymorphism could be a consequence of selective pressures through this past predation. For example, NFDS through search image formation in the avian predators can theoretically maintain such polymorphisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">To explore which hypothesis best explains the kākāpō color polymorphism, we created and analyzed detailed phenotypic data of kākāpō plumage together with high-coverage genomic data of nearly the entire kākāpō species (n=169; as of January 1<sup>st</sup> 2018)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. We found that two epistatically interacting single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the end of chromosome 8 can explain the color polymorphism of all individuals. A candidate gene analysis in this genomic region allowed us to hypothesize a structural color polymorphism, which we explored with subsequent optical analyses. The nucleotide divergence between the two indicator haplotypes predicted that the color polymorphism evolved circa 1.93 MYA, around the time when the avian kākāpō predators evolved. Using genomic forward simulations, we determined that the polymorphism’s establishment is highly unlikely under neutral evolution, while any selective advantage of the novel color morphology would have likely led to its rapid fixation. We show that the effects of balancing selection would have been sufficient to establish the polymorphism in the large ancestral population. Our simulations show that the polymorphism could have subsequently been maintained despite declining population size and a severe kākāpō population bottleneck, and despite dramatic ecological changes in Aotearoa New Zealand approximately 600 years ago when several indigenous bird species including the major natural kākāpō predator species became extinct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Based on this evidence, we propose that now-extinct apex predators were the likely agent of balancing selection, which would make the color polymorphism in the kākāpō a “ghost of selection past”.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Quantitative Genomics</title><sec id="S4"><title>Phenotypic data</title><p id="P7">We firstly created a catalog of the feather color polymorphism of the kākāpō species. Wherever possible, we did so through standardized photography of living birds followed by manual annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Material and methods</xref>); in the case of deceased birds, we used historical photographs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <italic>Photography</italic> sheet). As green and olive individuals are not always easy to distinguish, we used Commission on Illumination <italic>L*a*b*</italic> (CIELAB) color space analysis, which projects any color into a two-dimensional color space <italic>a*b</italic> that is perpendicular to and therefore independent of luminance <italic>L</italic> to define objective criteria of green and olive colors (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Material and methods</xref>).

We then leveraged this CIELAB analysis to annotate all kākāpō individuals for which we had any doubt in terms of their phenotypic classification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <italic>CIELAB</italic> sheet).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Genomic data</title><p id="P8">Our previous population genomic analyses identified 2,102,449 SNPs in Illumina short-read sequencing data across 169 kākāpō individuals using the reference genome bStrHab1.2.pri (NCBI RefSeq assembly accession number GCF_004027225.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and the genetic variant calling tool DeepVariant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. We subsequently excluded the kākāpō individual Konini 3-4-16 since this bird died at 26 days of age, i.e. before its feather color could be determined (kākāpō only possess white down when hatching and adult plumage color becomes apparent at about 50 days of age). We filtered the SNP set according to sequencing depth, quality, minor allele frequency (MAF), genotype missingness, biallelicity, and extreme deviations from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) to obtain a final set of 1,211,090 high-quality SNPs (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Material and methods</xref>). We visualized this genomic data through principal component analysis (PCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, whose first ten axes did not show any obvious genome-wide difference between green and olive individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Material and methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Genome-Phenome associations</title><p id="P9">We used Bayesian multiple regression modelling as implemented in BayesR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> to estimate the heritability of the kākāpō color polymorphism at 77.7% (95% credible interval of 59.9–89.2%; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Material and methods</xref>). The chromosome partitioning analysis, which calculates heritability per chromosome, shows that nearly the entire genetic variance (&gt; 99%) lies on chromosome 8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Material and methods</xref>). Within-population genomic prediction of color using ten-fold cross-validation in BayesR resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU-ROC) of 0.99 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Material and methods</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We then used RepeatABEL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> to perform a mixed-model Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) across all 168 kākāpō individuals while accounting for relatedness and other random as well as fixed effects (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Material and methods</xref>). We identified one genomic region strongly associated with color polymorphism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>) that contained the top-hit SNP Chr8_63055688 (p=10<sup>-40</sup>). As RepeatABEL is based on linear mixed-effect models which do not directly account for binary dependent variables, we confirmed this result using PLINK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, which only considers fixed effects, but directly models binary phenotypes through logistic regression; we further did not identify any genome-wide significant associations with a dataset of small insertions and deletions (indels) generated by Guhlin <italic>et al.</italic> (2023)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Material and methods</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The top SNP for both the heritability test and the GWAS, Chr8_63055688 (A|T alleles), explains the color polymorphism of nearly the entire extant kākāpō population; only the phenotypes of five individuals (Egilsay, Elliott, Percy, Dusky and Te Atapō) were misclassified when assuming a dominant effect of the alternative T allele encoding the olive color morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <italic>GWAS</italic> sheet). For example, Te Atapō is heterozygous but of green color. We therefore applied a genetic algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> to 1100 SNPs located in or close (within 400k nucleotides) to the significantly associated genomic region to find combinations of SNPs that can fully describe the phenotypic distribution (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Material and methods</xref>). This test identified a dominant-epistatic interaction with a second SNP as the most probable genomic architecture of the color polymorphism. This SNP, Chr8_63098195 (T|G alleles), was the second-best GWAS hit (p=10<sup>-31</sup>). While the phenotype of the kākāpō individuals Egilsay and Elliott could first not be explained correctly by the suggested dominant-epistatic interaction, we investigated our data further and identified a genomic sample swap between these two individuals. Taking this sample swap into account, the color polymorphism of every kākāpō individual can be explained by the genetic rule that olive individuals must carry at least one alternative T allele at Chr8_63055688 and at least one alternative G allele at Chr8_63098195 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <italic>GWAS</italic> sheet). These two indicator SNPs are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r<sup>2</sup>=0.696) but are interspersed with genomic regions of low LD (r<sup>2</sup>&lt;0.1; Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig 2A</xref>); therefore, the entire genomic region containing both SNPs is not under strong linkage (i.e., undergoes recombination). To discard the impact of any large genomic rearrangements such as inversions or of other uncalled genetic variants, we investigated the mean sequencing depth across individuals in this genomic region. The mean depth as captured through a sliding-window approach remains stable across the genomic region, with a few decreases in depth at individual genetic sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Material and methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Out-of-sample predictions</title><p id="P12">We next validated the epistatic effect of the two indicator SNPs on the color morphology (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Material and methods</xref>), again assuming the genetic rule that olive individuals must carry at least one alternative T allele at Chr8_63055688 and at least one alternative G allele at Chr8_63098195 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <italic>GWAS</italic> sheet). As Te Atapō was the only kākāpō whose green phenotype could be explained by reference homozygosity at Chr8_63098195 (TT) while heterozygosity at the top SNP Chr8_63055688 (AT) would have predicted an olive phenotype, we analyzed the genomic and phenotypic data of all offspring of Te Atapō to confirm our predicted epistatic effect: Te Atapō (genotypes for Chr8_63055688 and Chr8_63098195 and phenotype: AT, TT, green) had offspring with Pura (AT, TG, olive) and Tumeke (AA, TT, green).

While the probability of establishment is therefore overall low and requires a selective advantage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig 3A-B</xref>), our simulations also show that − once established − the newly evolved color morphology would have rapidly swept to fixation under pure adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>).

As the longest time for any establishment event in our simulations was 8000 generations (mean=5182; sd=500), our empirical estimate that the polymorphism has arisen 128,500 generations ago would have given plenty of time for the polymorphism to be established in the population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig 4</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Finally, we modelled the dynamics of the maintenance of the color polymorphism during the last 1000 generations of the declining demographic history of the kākāpō, including the severe bottleneck before 1995 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Material and methods</xref>).

We tested the following competing scenarios using computer simulations: (1) NFDS was completely removed for all 1000 generations (as negative control); (2) NFDS was removed for the last 40 generations (modelling the extinction of the kākāpō’s natural predators); or (3) NFDS was removed for the last 40 generations, but genetic load accumulated in alternative color haplotypes to mimic the effect of associative overdominance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>).

We describe the putative genomic architecture of this phenotype and establish that a dominance epistatic interaction of two biallelic single-nucleotide genetic variants can explain the phenotype of all 168 birds, which had paired genomic and phenotypic data. Integrating this genomic architecture with genomic forward simulations, we explain the likely evolution and puzzling maintenance of this balanced polymorphism in the heavily bottlenecked kākāpō population.</p><p id="P23">Established genetic polymorphisms are rare and challenging to identify due to the need to rule out neutral evolution and determine the evolutionary forces maintaining them, such as balancing selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Rejecting neutral evolution requires assessing the genetic basis, fitness consequences, and potential selective agents of the phenotype. If directly measuring fitness effects is not feasible, balancing selection can still be inferred by rejecting neutral evolution and positive selection as explanations. Here we estimated that the kākāpō feather color polymorphism was roughly established around 1.93 million years ago as an oligogenic trait, with green as the likely ancestral phenotype. Through genomic simulations, we found that neutral and positive evolution were highly unlikely, suggesting balancing selection through NFDS as a possible driver in establishing this polymorphism.</p><p id="P24">We hypothesize that the selective agent of such balancing selection could have been the two only natural kākāpō predators, the Haast’s eagle and Eyles’ harrier, which evolved at roughly the same time as our observed genetic polymorphism, approximately two million years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and went extinct approximately 600 years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The Haast’s eagle evolved in the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene when it diverged from the little eagle 2.22 MYA (95% credibility interval of 1.41-3.25 MYA), coinciding with the increase of open woodlands and grasslands at the onset of Pleistocene glaciations in Aotearoa New Zealand about 2.5 MYA. The Eyles’ harrier diverged from the spotted harrier around 2.4 million years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Our hypothesis is that the kākāpō color phenotypes were maintained by balancing selection, i.e. NFDS, through the search image formation of these avian predators who are known to mainly hunt by sight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. This mechanism allows predators to detect cues associated with the prey species, and in this sense being the rarer phenotypes confers an adaptive advantage. Our simulations further show that after the extinction of both predator species circa 600 years ago, the genetic polymorphism could have been maintained due to the inherent inertia in allele frequency changes. The genomic signature of the color polymorphism and the dating of its origin and evolutionary trajectory therefore provide the first evidence that the color polymorphism in the kākāpō might be a relic, or “ghost”, of balancing selection by now-extinct apex predators.</p><p id="P25">We emphasize that other mechanisms of balancing selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, or other selective agents than predation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, could have led to historical and/or ongoing balancing selection in the kākāpō population. For example, mutualism and parasitism are well-known mechanisms of NFDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We, however, argue that the color polymorphism as a visual target of NFDS makes predation a likely selective agent (as opposed to, e.g., host-parasite interactions), especially in combination with the roughly coinciding evolutionary timeframe of color polymorphism establishment and evolution of the only two natural kākāpō predators.</p><p id="P26">NFDS due to predation might hereby stem from differences between green and olive feathers in the visible or UV spectrum. Our potential candidate gene <italic>LHX8</italic> and its known role in tissue differentiation and tooth morphogenesis led us to suggest a structural morphology as the source of the kākāpō color polymorphism: Structural colors are prevalent in birds and have evolved numerous independent times, and, different to simple pigmentation colors, are produced by nanometer-scale biological structures that differentially scatter, or reflect, wavelengths of light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Interestingly, Dyck (1978) noted many years ago that in particular UV-modulating green and olive colors in parrots are produced by structural differences in feather barbs and barbules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. While we were only able to assess the photoreflectometry of one green and one olive feather, respectively, this analysis provided some evidence of differential UV reflectance between green and olive feathers, which might be explained by the relatively smoother barbule surface of green feathers according to our SEM image analysis of altogether six feathers. This differential UV reflectance could potentially explain how the derived olive phenotype could have become established by providing an initial evolutionary advantage through reduced UV reflectance, before balancing selection would have maintained the established color polymorphism. We, however, note that while there is some evidence for widespread UV sensitivity across bird species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, the inference of UV sensitivity from phylogeny is complex in the avian clade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, so that we cannot assume with certainty that the kākāpō’s two naturally predators, the Haast’s eagle and Eyles’ harrier, were able to see light in the UV spectrum.</p><p id="P27">With respect to the identified candidate gene, we emphasize that no functional experimental validation of the genomic architecture or of the potential candidate gene is possible in this taonga and highly protected species. We, therefore, acknowledge that it remains a possibility that we have failed to identify the actual causal genetic variation. While the mean sequencing depth is stable across our genomic region of interest, several individual genetic sites show a sudden drop in coverage; we could therefore have potentially missed short causal genetic variants such as SNPs and indels in our analysis. As our genetic algorithm that predicts the potential dominant-epistatic interaction between our two indicator SNPs is computationally expensive, we further only focused on our genomic region of interest (at the end of chromosome 8). This means that we ignored the potentially modulating effects of genetic variants outside of this genomic region. Because of the reliance on short-read sequencing data, we might have further missed the impact of structural variation, which could be assessed more robustly using long-read sequencing technology in the future. When it comes to the functional annotation of our genomic region of interest, we have further found that the gene annotation of the utilized kākāpō reference genome lacks the annotation of some open reading frames<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. An inadequate annotation at the end of chromosome 8 could therefore have prevented us from identifying the correct causal gene or gene pathway.</p><p id="P28">Our understanding of the evolution and maintenance of the kākāpō color polymorphism could potentially inform ongoing conservation efforts. Especially given that the significant majority of the wild founder population from 1995 were of green color, the color polymorphism might impact fitness in the absence of current intensive conservation management. Assuming that balancing selection has regulated the polymorphism through now-extinct apex predators, we contend that its loss would probably not confer a negative fitness effect or cost to population viability in the present-day environment. Without predator-mediated NFDS or any other form of balancing selection and without any intense conservation management, we predict that the polymorphism is likely to be lost by drift within the next 33 generations (95% confidence interval of 10-94 generations). In view of the aim of the kākāpō conservation management to re-establish the species on a future predator free Aotearoa New Zealand mainland, our results might suggest that the feather polymorphism is not necessarily a trait that has to be prioritized by the conservation programme for the new founding population. As this re-establishment has just taken its first step with the historic release of ten kākāpō to Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari, Waikato (a fenced reserve on the mainland) in 2023, we are hopeful that our and others’ genomic analyses might play a role in future kākāpō conservation efforts in partnership with Ngāi Tahu.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>materials | methods</title><sec id="S15"><title>Phenotypic analyses</title><p id="P29">As part of the Department of Conservation Kākāpō Recovery Programme in partnership with Ngāi Tahu, we assessed the color polymorphisms of the extant kākāpō population.

The algorithm uses a matrix of predictor variables (i.e., the 1100 SNPs) placed in columns, with the sample sequences in rows. An additional column that contains the binary codes for the phenotype (0 for green, 1 for olive) acts as a target value. The genetic algorithm starts by generating a set of <italic>n</italic> (where <italic>n</italic> is user-defined) random expressions of the form SNP001 = “C”, which are then evaluated against each sequence as true or false.

We then used a binomial cumulative distribution and an estimated generation time of 15 years to estimate the likely age of the polymorphism.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Genomic simulations</title><p id="P40">We performed individual-based, forward in time simulations with a Wright-Fisher implementation in SLiM3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. We simulated a genomic region of 50k nucleotides around our two indicator SNPs. We scored the color phenotype of all simulated individuals based on the putative epistatic interaction of the two indicator SNPs, using information based on the empirical data that specifies that an individual is olive if it has at least one derived allele at both genetic loci.</p><sec id="S21"><title>Demographic trajectory</title><p id="P41">To simulate the demographic trajectory of the kākāpō population we first reconstructed its effective population size Ne trajectory during the last 1000 generations by combining an existing PSMC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> estimate based on the kākāpō reference genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, and a LD-based estimate with GONE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> with our population genomic dataset of 168 individuals (recombination rate of 2cM/Mb). While GONE can reliably estimate Ne until approximately 200 generations into the past or 3 KYA, PSMC analyses are restricted to making inferences between approximately 20 KYA and 1 MYA ago. To connect the recent and ancient Ne trajectories, we assumed that the estimated trajectory of steady decline of the kākāpō population continued between 20 and 3 KYA.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Establishment simulations</title><p id="P42">We modelled the conditions required to establish a novel olive polymorphism in a large ancestral population. The size of the simulated ancestral population of 36,000 birds was determined as the largest historical population size by PSMC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, at approximately 2 MYA which was when we estimated the color polymorphism to have evolved. We assumed one variant (SNP1) was segregating at a low frequency of 0.4% in the population before the second SNP (SNP2) occurred as a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation. We chose the initial frequency of SNP1 (0.4%) by performing a set of simulations with neutral mutations for the same large ancestral population size and took the median MAF at equilibrium. To assess the impact of different MAFs at SNP1, we ensured that rerunning our simulations assuming a gradually increasing MAF (up to 10%) would result in similar conclusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig 4</xref>). We further assumed that SNP2 appeared because of a random point mutation in this genomic background. If the polymorphism was lost, we would restart the simulation with a new seed number. Otherwise, we ran each simulation for a maximum of 133,000 generations or 2 MYA. We tracked the dynamics of the polymorphism every 500 generations and if the polymorphism was either balanced (proportion of 0.4-0.6) or (nearly) fixed (proportion &gt; 0.95) for ten consecutive times (5000 generations), we stopped the run and considered the polymorphism as established.</p><p id="P43">We tested three alternative hypotheses for the establishment of the color polymorphism: (1) a neutral model, where being either green or olive color had no selective advantage or disadvantage; (2) a positive selection model, where the novel olive phenotype had a selective advantage ranging between 1% and 20%; and (3) a balancing selection model, where being the rarest phenotype had a selective advantage ranging between 1% and 20% (i.e., NFDS). We ran 10,000 replicates per scenario.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Maintenance simulations</title><p id="P44">Starting from an established balanced polymorphism in the ancestral population (proportion of 0.4-0.6 of olive individuals), we tested which conditions could lead to the maintenance of such a polymorphism whilst considering the declining demographic history of the kākāpō population, ecological changes, and the impact of genetic drift for the last 1000 generations. We seeded the maintenance simulations with the output of the previous step (i.e., establishment simulations) that included a large ancestral population with a balanced color polymorphism. A total of 100 starting input files were sampled at random to seed the maintenance simulations to account for a range of starting variation. Since balancing selection (NFDS) is required to establish the polymorphism, we tested whether the polymorphism could be maintained as observed in the extant kākāpō population when removing the effect of NFDS.</p><p id="P45">We simulated three competing scenarios: (1) NFDS was completely removed for all 1000 generations leaving the polymorphism to drift, representing a control treatment where only drift is at play; (2) NFDS was removed for only the last 40 generations (i.e., the approximate time of predator extinction), leaving the polymorphism to drift just at the very end of the simulation; (3) NFDS was removed for the last 40 generations as before, and additionally genetic load accumulated in alternative color haplotypes to mimic the effect of associative overdominance. In this last scenario, the assumption is that the alternative color haplotypes accumulated recessive highly deleterious mutations (s=0.2) at different loci. Selection would then act against individuals that are homozygous and expressing the deleterious effects of these mutations, and this would maintain a balanced polymorphism.</p><p id="P46">To compare the simulated and empirical data, we first calculated a metric to express the level of the balanced polymorphism (BP) as BP = 2 - 2(G<sup>2</sup> + O<sup>2</sup>), where G is the proportion of green individuals and O is the proportion of olive individuals. The value of BP ranges between 0 (no polymorphism, with one phenotype being lost and the other fixed) and 1 (completely balanced polymorphism with equal numbers of green and olive). The BP in the empirical data is 0.992, reflecting a value close to a perfect balanced equilibrium. Then, we compared the BP of the last step of the simulation (i.e., the extant population) to that of the empirical data. We ran 10,000 replicates per scenario.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Functional analyses</title><p id="P47">We subjected green (n=3) and olive (n=3) feather tips to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to study their morphology in detail; we worked with uncoated samples to not destroy the culturally valuable feathers. The feathers were attached to the SEM stage using double sided carbon tape. They were then imaged in a JEOL 6700F field emission SEM. We used an accelerating voltage of 3 kV, and the lower secondary detector for imaging. This detector mixes secondary and backscatter electrons together, which lessens the charging effect for some uncoated samples. We iteratively increased our SEM resolution from 40x to 5,500x, which allowed us to focus on individual barbules. To quantitatively assess the smoothness of the feather barbules, we used Phyton’s OpenCV (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/opencv/opencv">https://github.com/opencv/opencv</ext-link>; v4.9.0) function <italic>quantify_smoothness</italic> to calculate the average gradient magnitude: A lower gradient magnitude hereby describes higher smoothness. We first converted the SEM pictures to greyscale, chose a rectangle of the barbule of each feather at 5,500x resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>), and then computed the gradient magnitude via the Sobel operator by taking the square root of the sum of squares of the gradients in horizontal and vertical directions.</p><p id="P48">We further subjected the feather tips of one green and olive feather to near-infrared/visible photoreflectometry. We used a dual-beam photospectrometer of the model Shimadzu UV-3101PC with MPC-3100 reflectometry accessory. The machine shines light of a single wavelength on the sample, measures how much of it is reflected, and then changes the wavelength and repeats. Briefly, feathers were clamped against the side of the integrating sphere of the spectrometer to then record the reflectance as the scanned wavelength. The measurements were standardized against a white reference (Barium Sulphate; BaSO<sub>4</sub>) so that 100% reflectance means that all light is being reflected and 0% reflectance means that no light is being reflected. The beam size was a rectangle of 15 mm x 5 mm.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Table</label><media xlink:href="EMS188643-supplement-Supplementary_Table.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d13aAcGbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS188643-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d13aAcGcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS188643-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d13aAcGdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgments and funding sources</title><p>This work has arisen from a partnership between Ngāi Tahu and the Aotearoa New Zealand Department of Conservation Te Papa Atawhai (DOC), the Kākāpō Recovery Programme, and the involved researchers.
