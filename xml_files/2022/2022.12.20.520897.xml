It is characterized by the formation of subcutaneous tumour-like swellings and grains that spread to deep tissues and skin. The extremities are affected most, but no body part is exempted. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Grains are biofilm-like structures in which the causative agent resides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The disease progression is gradual, and symptoms develop over the course of months to years. Although mycetoma can be caused by several causative agents, in more than 40% of all published cases, the fungus <italic>Madurella mycetomatis</italic> was the causative agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Although mycetoma grain formation is one of the hallmarks of mycetoma, currently there is little known about their function and formation. Some studies demonstrated that grain components could protect the causative organism against the host immune response and antifungal therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Others have demonstrated that these grains consist of a cement-like material, mainly composed of heavy metals, melanin, lipids and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Grains can only be formed in <italic>in vivo</italic> models. The simplest model in which grain formation can be studied is the <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> grain model developed in larvae of the invertebrate <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). <italic>G. mellonella</italic> has been widely accepted as a model organism as the larvae are easy to use, inexpensive, have an innate immune system which is comparable to that of mammals, are free of the legal/ethical restrictions associated with the use of mammals, and most importantly the obtained results closely correlate with those obtained in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). In <italic>G. mellonella, M. mycetomatis</italic> grains can be formed which resemble the grains in mouse models and human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). In a previous study using this model, we demonstrated that this model can be used to follow grain formation over time and that differences in protein abundance could be demonstrated by using a label-free quantitative LC-MS/MS proteomic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). However, which transcriptional responses are important in the process of grain formation are currently unknown.</p><p id="P8">In this study, we aimed to profile the transcriptomic changes of both the larval host and the <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> pathogen during grain formation to enhance our understanding of grain formation.

After two weeks, the mycelia were separated and washed by vacuum filtration (Nalgene, Abcoude, the Netherlands using a 22 micron filter (Whatman)). The mycelial biomass was scraped from the filter, the wet weight was determined, and a suspension was prepared containing 100 mg mycelial biomass per ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The suspension was sonicated at 28 micron for 2 minutes (Soniprep 150, Beun de Ronde, the Netherlands), the resulting homogeneous suspension was washed once in PBS and again diluted to a concentration of 4 mg per 40 μL PBS, corresponding to 600-850 CFU/larvae.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Infection of G. mellonella larvae with M. mycetomatis and RNA isolation</title><p id="P10"><italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae were obtained from Terra Equipment Voedseldieren (Cuijk, The Netherlands) and kept in the dark on wood shaving at room temperature until use. Within five days of receipt, larvae of approximately 300-500mg were selected for experimental use. The selected larvae were divided over Petri dishes containing 90mm Whatman filter paper and five larvae per dish. 40 μL of the prepared inoculum of <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> strain MM55 was injected in the last left proleg of the larvae using an insulin 29G U-100 needle (BD diagnostics, Sparsk, USA), resulting in a final concentration of 4 mg fungal biomass/mL. To monitor the course of the infection, a separate group consisting of 15 larvae was infected, and survival was recorded daily for the duration of ten days. During all experiments, Pupa were removed from the equation, and non-infected larvae were included as control. At 4, 24, 72 and 168 hours post-infection, the contents of three larvae were pooled and flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen, followed by mechanical crushing using a pestle and mortar. The resulting powder was suspended in RLT buffer (supplemented with 1% β-Mercaptoethanol), provided in the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany), and incubated at 57°C for 3 minutes. RNA isolation was further continued according to the manufacturer's instructions. The presence and quality of RNA were assessed by NanoDrop and gel-electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Determination of the fungal burden in G. mellonella</title><p id="P11">At 4, 24, 72 and 168 hours post-infection, larvae were sacrificed, and haemolymph was harvested. Melanisation of haemolymph was determined by diluting the haemolymph 1:1 in (IPS). The optical density was measured at 405 nm using the Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, USA). To fixate the larvae, 100 μL 10% buffered formalin was injected into the larvae. The larvae were moved into 15 mL Greiner tubes containing 5 mL 10% buffered formalin. After 24 hours of fixation, whole larvae were longitudinally dissected into two halves using a scalpel and fixated in 10% buffered formalin for another 48 hours before further routine histological processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).

Based on the grain size, the total number of grains and the melanisation of the hemolymph, the maximum burden of the infection was observed 72 hours after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). All larvae died within 192 hours after infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). During infection, mycetoma grains developed over time. Early grains, which were small in size and loosely structured, were observed at 4 hours post-inoculation. After 24 hours, more mature grains were observed. The hyphae formed within the grain and the immune cells (hemocytes) were present in the cement material. At the maximum burden of infection, mature grains were present and surrounded by a capsule and immune cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In the late grain, present at 168 hours, disintegration of both the capsule and grain was observed, and immune cells were entering the grain.</p><p id="P20">We noted that 88.8% of the total RNA-Seq reads in the grains originate from the <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae (Host), while only 0.01% of the RNA-Seq reads originate from <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> (Pathogen) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).

The enrichment analysis shows that several DEGs are significantly enriched in biological processes and molecular functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Several GO terms are enriched at each time point. At 0h vs 4h, most of the enriched GO terms are linked to oxidative phosphorylation (GO:0006119), ATP metabolic process (GO:0046034), energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds (GO:0015980), generation of precursor metabolites and energy (GO:0006091). All these terms are linked to energy pathways. The 0h vs 24 and 0h vs. 72 were mostly enriched in the nucleobase metabolic process, purine nucleotide biosynthetic process, and ion and cation transport. Among the latter, genes linked to iron homeostasis such as melanotransferrin, cytochrome b561-like isoforms, aconitate hydratase and proton-coupled folate transporters were differentially expressed. At the late-stage grain development (0h vs 168h), mostly enriched GO terms are related to aerobic electron transport chain and energy pathways.

For the host DEGs (3,498), we observed a set of host genes start to gradually respond to the infection by either upregulation or downregulation after 0h. We classified those genes as gradual response genes. The second set of DEGs were classified as early response genes, which immediately change the expression pattern upon infection. Most of the genes in this category change their expression either up or down at 24h. The third set of DEGs were the early-long response patterns in which the immediate change in transcription at 4h-24h remains longer during the course of infection. The last pattern of the response was the late response genes, these genes start to change their expression at 24h. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref> shows an example of a gene for each expression pattern category.

With a PPI network enrichment <italic>p-value</italic> of 0.00312, strong functional interaction is indicated between the following genes: Ferritin 1 Heavy Chain Homologue (Fer1HCH), Ferritin 2 Light Chain Homologue (Fer2LCH), Transferrin (Tsf1), Iron regulatory protein 1A (Irp-1A), Iron regulatory protein 1B (Irp-1B) and Malvolio (Mvl).

Therefore, we postulated that the presence of one or multiple translational regulatory mechanisms might explain the difference between the proteomic and transcriptomic findings. This is strengthened by our PPI analysis and gene expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>), showing the expression of multiple aconitate hydratases (Irp-1A and Irp-1B), genes encoding for iron-regulatory proteins which regulate translation by binding to iron-responsive elements (IRE) in the 5` UTR region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).

To further validate the functional similarity with known iron regulatory processes, we identified the IRE regions present in mRNA transcripts. These IRE regions manifest in the form of a hairpin loop, containing a conserved CAGUGU at the end of the hairpin loop. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref> shows the identified IRE hairpin structures of the ferritin subunit and ferritin lower subunit in the 5` UTR region. The IRE of the lower ferritin subunit was identical to the one earlier described for the 32 kDa <italic>G. mellonella</italic> subunit, while the IREs for the upper ferritin subunit differed in a few amino-acids from the one described for the 26 kDa ferritin subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>).

Generally, in insects, iron sequestering, transport and storage are regulated by both ferritin and transferrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).</p><p id="P38">In our study, we did find expression of the ferritin subunit (LOC113510018), ferritin lower subunit (LOC113510017) and transferrin (LOC113509694) at all time points investigated. However, in contrast to what was seen in other fungal infections, expression levels did not significantly alter during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Transferrin and ferritin protein levels previously measured in the same <italic>G. mellonella</italic> infection model, on the other hand, were differentially abundant. In that study, a 5 to 12-fold decrease in transferrin protein levels and a 3-fold increase in ferritin protein levels were noted during <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> grain formation in <italic>G. mellonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). For ferritin, this difference can be explained by the process of iron regulation via iron regulatory proteins (IRP). In <italic>G. mellonella,</italic> these IRPs are encoded by aconitate hydratases, and <italic>G. mellonella</italic> aconitate hydratases LOC113516537, LOC113511518 and LOC113522652 were differentially expressed during <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> infection. IRPs bind IREs under low iron conditions to repress the translation of ferritin. A process well studied in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). In mammals, IRPs respond to low iron by binding to IREs present in the 5`UTR of the mRNAs of ferritin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). This results in translational repression of ferritin. In contrast, in the presence of enough iron, the enzyme aconitate hydratase will form a [4Fe-4S] cluster, which prevents the IRP binding to the IRE. This in turn, results in translational activation of ferritin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Since we and others identified IREs in the 5’UTR regions of ferritin from <italic>G. mellonella</italic> and in <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> and it was described that IRP1 was able to bind to the ferritin IRE to regulate translation, we postulate that in <italic>G. mellonella</italic> the regulation of ferritin is similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>).</p><p id="P39">Due to the lack of IRE in the transferrin UTR regions, the discrepancy between transferrin expression levels and protein levels cannot be due to IRP/IRE regulation.

Furthermore, in the current study, we also demonstrated that in our <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> larval infection model, the genes involved in the siderophore biosynthetic pathway were differentially expressed during infection. After 24h infection, a strong increase in the expression of especially SidA, SidD and SidI was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), coinciding with the decrease in transferrin protein abundancy; this indicates that a similar system could exist in <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> during infection.</p><p id="P40">Next to obtaining iron from transferrin, fungal siderophores can also obtain iron from other sources surrounding the fungus.

context</title></caption><sec id="S27"><title>Evidence before this study</title><p>Mycetoma is a chronic, neglected tropical infectious disease, characterised by a large subcutaneous mass and the formation of black grains in the affected tissue. Treatment for mycetoma is disappointing as in 25-50% of the patients recurrences are noted and up to 15% of patients will have to undergo amputation. The main reason behind this poor treatment response is the formation of protective structures by the pathogen upon entering the human body. These structures are called grains and provide a strong barrier for antifungal agents. Although grains are the hallmark of mycetoma, it is currently not known how these grains are formed. To improve the current therapy, it is important to gain insights in grain formation.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Added value of this study</title><p>We unravel the processes leading to grain formation and development in an invertebrate model of <italic>Madurella mycetomatis</italic> grain. We were able to build a model of grain formation and demonstrated that iron sequestering plays an important role in this process. Our findings were an important milestone in understanding the pathogenesis of mycetoma which has been a mystery for decades.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p>The findings, will provide leads for future drug development of mycetoma treatment and therefore, improve patients live and end the need for amputations.</p></sec></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Mycetoma of the foot with characteristic mycetoma grains.</title><p><bold>A.</bold> An extensive case of mycetoma on the foot. <bold>B.</bold> Black grains of <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> are clearly visible inside the infected tissue. <bold>C.</bold> A histopathological picture of the <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> black grain, with <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> hyphae embedded in cement material (H&amp;E staining, 40 times magnified using H&amp;E staining).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS158929-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Experimental workflow, burden of infection on <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae, and quality of transcriptomics data.</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Schematic illustration of the time course experiment design and transcriptomic assays used for high throughput RNA profiling.

The highest values are noted at t=72h (the maximum burden of infection). <bold>C.</bold> Grain formation in the host was visualized 40 times magnified using H&amp;E staining and light microscopy. Yellow arrows point towards the grain inside the capsule. Based on the characteristics of the grain development observed at each time point, the grains were defined as early, pre-mature, mature, and late grains. In the early grains, the cement material is not formed, and hemocytes are present between hyphae. In the pre-mature grains, hemolymph is forming, but still, individual hemocytes can be noted within the forming cement material. In the mature grain the cement material is completely formed and a capsule surrounds the grain. In the late grain, you see the capsule disappearing and an influx of hemocytes towards the grain. <bold>D.</bold> Quality of the RNA sequencing and LQ-ssCAGE dataset.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). The pathway starts with mevalonate converted to anhydromevalonyl-CoA by SidI and SidH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). A. fumigatus uses three hydroxamate-type siderophores for iron uptake. The extracellular triacetylfusarinine C (TAFC), hyphal ferricrocin (FC) and conidial hydroxyferricrocin (HFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). N°-hydroxyornithine generated from ornithine by SidA. The SidG gene has no homologues gene in <italic>M. mycetomatis,</italic> and the gene marked as (?) is not characterized yet in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. In the PPI, SidF and SidL are annotated to the same gene in <italic>M. Mycetomatis</italic> (N(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>)-hydroxylysine O-acetyltransferase). No significant similarity was found for SidG in <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic>. All siderophore genes except SidG are differentially expressed in RNA-Seq data, as shown in the bar plot. *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001, ****P &lt; 0.0001, and n.s., not significant by two-way ANOVA test; Data in the bar chart are represented as expression ± SEM.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS158929-f007"/></fig><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Proposed model of Iron regulation in <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> during infection with <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic>.</title><p><bold>A.</bold> In healthy larvae, in the absence of iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>), the IRP1 and IRP2 form a complex, which can bind to Iron Responsive Elements (IRE) in the 5` prime UTR region of the ferritin subunits coding transcripts LOC13510017 and LOC13510018, preventing translation of the mRNA to form ferritin. In the presence of iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>), 4Fe-4S is formed, binding to IRP1. The IRP1/4Fe-4S complex prevents binding to the IRE, enabling translation of both LOC13510017 and LOC13510018, forming ferritin. Ferritin will bind Fe<sup>2+</sup> for transportation and storage. <bold>B.</bold> During infection, increased expression of aconitate hydratase results in increased formation of the 4Fe-4S complex, binding of IRP1 and thus the translation of both subunits of ferritin for the binding of Fe<sup>2+</sup>, creating an iron-derived environment. In response to the limited available iron, the fungus shows significantly increased expression of the siderophore-related biosynthesis pathway for the production of siderophores needed for sequestering Fe<sup>2+</sup>, which is essential for the survival of the fungus.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS158929-f008"/></fig></floats-group></article>
