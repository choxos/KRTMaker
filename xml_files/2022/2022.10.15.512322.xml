These new variants exhibit reduced fusogenicity and increased endosomal entry pathway utilization compared to the ancestral D614G variant, the underlying mechanisms of which remain elusive. Here we show that the C-terminal S1 mutations of the BA.1.1 subvariant, H655Y and T547K, critically govern the low fusogenicity of Omicron. Notably, H655Y also dictates the enhanced endosome entry pathway utilization. Mechanistically, T547K and H655Y likely stabilize the spike trimer conformation, as shown by increased molecular interactions in structural modeling as well as reduced S1 shedding. Importantly, the H655Y mutation also determines the low fusogenicity and high dependence on the endosomal entry pathway of other Omicron subvariants, including BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4/5 and BA.2.75. These results uncover mechanisms governing Omicron subvariant entry and provide insights into altered Omicron tissue tropism and pathogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The emergence and rapid spread of the Omicron subvariants of SARS-CoV-2 around the world has caused serious concern about vaccine efficacy because of the large numbers of mutations present in this lineage, with more than 30 substitutions in the Spike (S) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Viana et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, many recent studies have shown that Omicron is resistant to neutralization by antibodies induced by two-dose mRNA vaccination that is greatly restored by booster vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Carreno et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Evans et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Liu et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Perez-Then et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Planas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Xia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). Consequently, Omicron led to a global surge of COVID-19 cases. BA.1.1 and BA.1 were responsible for the initial Omicron wave, but were replaced by the BA.2 subvariant, which was more transmissible and caused reinfection in patients who previously were infected by BA.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Marc Stegger et al., 2022</xref>). Remarkably, derivatives of BA.2, including BA.2.12.1 which subsequently became predominant in the US, and the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants bearing identical S proteins (referred to as BA.4/5 hereafter), which are currently dominant in the world, are driving a new surge in cases as both have stronger immune escape ability, especially the BA.4/5 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Cao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hachmann et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Qu et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Despite the gradually improved virus transmissibility observed in these subvariants, they appear to cause milder disease compared to Delta and other previous variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Diamond et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Halfmann et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">McMahan et al., 2022</xref>). The mechanism underlying the reduced pathogenicity of Omicron is currently unclear but has been under intense investigation.</p><p id="P3">The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a typical class I viral fusion protein that utilizes the cognate receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for binding and cellular entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hoffmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). It has a furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction of S, which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry at the plasma membrane, viral replication in human lung epithelial cells, as well as transmission in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mykytyn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Peacock et al., 2021</xref>). As SARS-CoV-2 evolves, its S has gained a large number of mutations and possibly undergone recombination, resulting in the emergence of the initial D614G variant and several major variants of concern (VOCs) such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, some of which directly or indirectly increase S cleavage to enhance fusogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Escalera et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Liu et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Saito et al., 2022</xref>). Intriguingly, results from many groups including ours have shown that the Omicron subvariants exhibit substantially impaired cell-cell fusion capacity and tend to use the endosomal entry pathway mediated by cathepsin L/B (Cat L/B), rather than the plasma membrane entry pathway mediated by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) which is preferred by other previous variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Du et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Meng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Qu et al., 2022b</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Currently, the underlying molecular mechanism by which Omicron subvariants use endosomal entry more efficiently than plasma membrane entry is unclear. Herein, we provide evidence that some key mutations in S1 and/or the S1/S2 junction region of BA.1.1 S, such as T547K and H655Y, especially the latter, dictate its intrinsically low fusogenicity and endosomal entry. Mechanically, we find that T547K and H655Y restrict BA.1.1 S-mediated cell-cell fusion possibly through stabilizing the S trimer conformation. Remarkably, H655Y, but not T547K which is only carried by BA.1.1 and BA.1 of Omicron subvariants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Qu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022a</xref>), governs the entry preference and fusion capability of all predominant Omicron subvariants. Together, our results reveal that mutations in S1 around the furin cleavage site of Omicron S critically modulate the unique biology of Omicron entry and are potentially associated with pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Critical amino acid residues dictating the differential entry patterns of Omicron subvariant BA.1.1 in HEK293T-ACE2 and Calu-3 cells</title><p id="P5">Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 entry is cell-type dependent, depending on the efficiency of furin cleavage of the virus S protein and also the levels of TMPRSS2 expression on the plasma membrane of target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bestle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Peacock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). In low TMPRSS2-expressing 293T-ACE2 and Vero cells, the endosomal entry pathway is predominant; however, in Calu-3 and other cells expressing high levels of TMPRRS2, SARS-CoV-2 primarily uses the plasma membrane for entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hoffmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). We hypothesized that mutations at the C-terminus of S1, or near the furin cleavage site of Omicron S, potentially govern its endosomal entry. To test this hypothesis, we created reversion mutations specific to residues T547K, H655Y, N679K, and P681H of the Omicron subvariant BA.1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), and examined their impact on the entry of BA.1.1 into HEK293T-ACE2, HEK293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 and Calu-3 cells using our previously reported HIV lentiviral pseudotyping system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Zeng et al., 2020</xref>). In parallel, the entry in these cell types was tested for the corresponding forward mutations, i.e., T547K, H655Y, N679K, and P681H made in the backbone of the ancestral D614G construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We found that, compared with parental BA.1.1, the reversion mutation Y655H exhibited a profound reduction of entry efficiency in HEK293T-ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), and in HEK93T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells, albeit to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), yet apparently enhanced entry in Calu-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), suggesting that H655Y is the most critical change in BA.1.1 S that distinguishes its entry in these different cell types. Consistent with this, we observed that the forward mutation H655Y exhibited reduced entry efficiency in Calu-3 cells, but increased entry in 293T-ACE2 and 293T-ACE-TMPRRS2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1e-f</xref>). While similar results were also observed for the BA.1.1 K547T mutation, the impact on entry was not as dramatic as that of H655Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1b-g</xref>). Surprisingly, two other mutations of BA.1.1, N679K and P681H, which are in close proximity to the furin cleavage site, did not seem to obviously affect viral entry in these cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1b-g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>H655Y governs the endosomal entry pathway of BA.1.1 – differential effects of E64d and Camostat</title><p id="P6">Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 entry in HEK293T-ACE2 cells is predominantly endosomal whereas in Calu-3 cells entry is primarily through the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Peacock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). We thus decided to use HEK293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells, which allow entry through both endosomal and plasma membrane routs, to determine the impact of these BA.1.1 mutants on entry in the presence of the endosomal Cat L/B inhibitor E64d or the TMPRSS2 inhibitor Camostat. While BA.1.1 was more sensitive to treatment by E64d but less sensitive to treatment by Camostat compared to D614G, BA.1.1-Y655H was less sensitive to E64d than BA.1.1, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of &gt; 25 μM versus an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.4 μM for the parental BA.1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2a and 2g</xref>). Additionally, BA.1.1-Y655H was more sensitive to Camostat than BA.1.1, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 10.3 μM versus IC<sub>50</sub> &gt;150 μM for BA.1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2b and 2g</xref>). Convincingly, the forward mutant D614G-H655Y was more sensitive to E64d, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.8 μM versus 23.5 μM for the parental D614G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2c and 2g</xref>), but less sensitive to Camostat, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 91.3 μM versus 11.6 μM for the parental D614G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2d and 2g</xref>). Overall, we discovered that the BA.1.1 reversion mutant Y655H had a more than 14.6-fold decreased IC<sub>50</sub> for Camostat and an over 62.5-fold increased IC<sub>50</sub> for E64d compared to the parental BA.1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Further, the forward mutant H655Y has a 7.9-fold increased IC<sub>50</sub> for Camostat and a 29.4-fold decreased IC<sub>50</sub> for E64d relative to the parental D614G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Of note, the T547K mutation of BA.1.1 did not seem to have a dramatic impact on the sensitivity to these drug treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2a-d, and 2g</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To confirm the above pseudotype lentivirus results in an authentic SARS-CoV-2 system, we engineered the complete BA.1 full length (FL) spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Pitts et al., 2022</xref>) into the infectious cDNA clone of USA-WA1/2020 with mNeonGreen (Viana et al.) reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Xie et al., 2020</xref>) to obtain BA.1-FL mNG SARS-CoV-2 and then generated the individual reversion mutations of spike K547T or Y655H in this background. Using these infectious viruses, we determined the impact of these two mutations on BA.1 entry into Vero-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells using the inhibitors E64d or Camostat. The results showed that the parental BA.1-FL mNG SARS-CoV-2 was the most sensitive to E64d with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 19.9 μM among the three viruses, followed by BA.1-FLmNG-K547T and then BA.1-FL mNG-Y655H, although these variants were generally much less sensitive to E64d compared to that in 293T-ACE2 cells, with no exact IC<sub>50</sub> value calculated for the two mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2e, 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1a</xref>). In contrast, compared to the parental BA.1-FL mNG which was resistant to Camostat treatment with an IC<sub>50</sub> of more than 150 μM, BA.1-FL mNG-K547T was sensitive to Camostat with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 19.1 μM, a more than 7.9-fold reduction in IC<sub>50</sub> relative to BA.1-FL mNG; BA.1-FL mNG-Y655H was more sensitive to Camostat, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 3.7 μM, approximately &gt; 40.5-fold decreased IC<sub>50</sub> relative to BA.1.1 FL mNG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2f, 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1b</xref>). These results together indicated T547K and H655Y mutations, especially the latter, greatly contribute to the altered entry preference of BA.1 in target cells. Overall, the results of pseudotyped as well as authentic viruses highlight the essential of role of H655Y mutation in dictating the Omicron BA.1 subvariant S-mediated endosomal entry compared to the ancestral D614G, which enters target cells predominantly through the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>H655Y critically controls the low fusogenicity of BA.1.1 Spike</title><p id="P8">To investigate the underlying mechanism of the T547K and H655Y mutations in modulating BA.1.1 entry preference, we examined the role of these two mutants along with N679K, P681H and parental BA.1.1 in S expression and S-mediated membrane fusion. In parallel, the impacts of the corresponding forward mutants were also investigated. Flow cytometric analysis of the S surface expression in HEK293T cells used to produce pseudotyped lentivirus showed that all these reversion mutants had approximately comparable levels of expression to each other and the parental BA.1.1, except for the reversion mutant K547T, which had modestly reduced surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3a-b</xref>), while all the forward mutants had similar levels of expression to D614G (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a-b</xref>). We then conducted syncytia formation assays in HEK293T-ACE2 cells transfected to express GFP and the individual S constructs and observed that K547T and Y655H substantially promoted the S-mediated cell-cell fusion, whereas K679N and H681P had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3c-d</xref>). Surprisingly, while forward mutations H655Y and T547K slightly reduced the D614G S-induced syncytia, two other mutations N679K and P681H enhanced D614G S-mediated fusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S2c-d</xref>), similar to some previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Rajah et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Reversion of H655Y to Y655H results in increased BA.1.1 S1 shedding</title><p id="P9">The efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 S cleavage by furin is known to be associated with membrane fusogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Saito et al., 2022</xref>). We next examined how these mutations might influence BA.1.1 S processing by analyzing the ratio of S1/S and S2/S in viral producer cells and purified viral particles. In cell lysates, while K547T exhibited a slightly increased or comparable ratio of S1/S and S2/S, H681P exhibited a decreased S1/S ratio but not S2/S ratio, Y655H and K679N showed a decreased ratio of both S1/S and S2/S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3e-g</xref>). However, none of the four forward mutants showed obvious change in S1/S1 or S2/S ratios in the cell lysates, except for N679K which exhibited a modestly increased S2/S ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S3a-c</xref>), suggesting that these four mutations do not appear to significantly modulate BA.1.1 furin cleavage in viral producer cells. Interestingly, we found that all four reversion mutants, most notably Y655H, showed a decreased level of S1 and S2 compared to the parental BA.1.1 in viral particles after being normalized by p24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3h-j</xref>). Additionally, the corresponding forward mutations T547K and H655Y, especially the latter, substantially increased the S1/p24 and S2/p24 ratios in viral particles relative to D614G (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S3d-f</xref>). The drastically decreased level of S1 for Y655H in viral particles corresponded to its significantly reduced infectivity in HEK293T-ACE2 and HEK293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells, potentially due to premature inactivation by high level expression of ACE2 in these cells, despite apparently increased infectivity in Calu-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1b-d</xref>). These results, along with the increased fusogenicity of Y655H, suggest that the H655Y mutation in BA.1.1 critically governs its low fusion activity and differential entry between HEK293T-ACE2 and Calu-3 cells.</p><p id="P10">The comparable or modestly increased efficiency of furin cleavage in viral producer cells of K547T and Y655H reversion mutants, in contrast to their decreased levels of S1 in the virions, especially Y655H, were indeed surprising, especially given their significantly increased cell-cell fusion activity observed in HEK293T-ACE2 cells. One possibility is that the S1 subunit of these two reversion mutants, especially Y655H, was shed into culture media during virus production. Indeed, we found that, compared to the parental BA.1.1, K547T and Y655H exhibited increased levels of S1 shedding into culture media in the presence of treatment by soluble ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3k and l</xref>). Of note, S1 shedding of two other reversion mutants, K679N and H681P, was decreased compared to the parental BA.1.1, which appeared to correlate with their relatively low furin cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4k and l</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that the T547K and H655Y mutations in BA.1.1, especially the latter, stabilize the spike conformation, contributing to decreased fusogenicity and entry in Calu-3 cells.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>H655Y dictates the endosomal entry and low fusogenicity of other Omicron subvariants</title><p id="P11">As in BA.1.1, all previously or currently circulating Omicron subvariants contain the H655Y substitution, but not T547K (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). We therefore predicted that the H655Y mutation also governs the entry preference and low fusogenicity of other variants. To this end, we introduced the H655Y reversion mutation into these Omicron subvariants, i.e., BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4/5 and BA.2.75, and examined their impact on entry of these subvariants in HEK293T-ACE2 and Calu-3 cells using the same HIV lentiviral pseudotyping system. We observed that the reversion mutation Y655H significantly reduced the entry efficiency of all these Omicron subvariants in HEK293T-ACE2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), but substantially promoted their entry in Calu-3 cells, although the increase in Calu-3 cells was generally modest or not seen in some cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). We also examined the influence of the reversion mutation Y655H on the fusogenicity of these Omicron subvariants using the syncytia formation assay described above. Again, we found that similar to BA.1.1, Y655H also significantly promoted the S-mediated syncytia formation of BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4/5, and BA.2.75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4c-d</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To provide molecular insight into how T547K and H655Y might dictate the low fusogenicity and endosomal entry of the Omicron subvariants, we performed molecular modeling of Omicron BA.1.1 spike protein. Indeed, we found that the T547K mutation could establish a salt-bridge interaction with the residue D389 located on the base of the receptor binding domain (RBD), as well as an inter-protomer hydrogen bond with the residue S982 on S2 domain, thus stabilizing its closed conformation and prevent S1 shedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The mutation H655Y located in the proximity to the furin cleavage site in S could reduce local structural flexibility by forming hydrophobic interactions with residues F643, I670 and A694, which may interfere with or decrease the accessibility of furin to the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">Omicron exhibits exceptional immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Garcia-Beltran et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kuhlmann et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Planas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Pulliam et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Viana <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>) because of the presence of large numbers of mutations in the S protein.

However, the molecular mechanisms of these distinct features of the Omicron subvariants remain elusive. In this study, we interrogated key mutations that govern the Omicron S-mediated low fusogenicity and endosomal entry. We determined H655Y, and to lesser extent T547K, as the key mutation on the S protein of Omicron that critically governs its preferential endosomal entry route and impaired fusion activity, including for the recently emerged BA.4/5, BA.2.12.1 and BA.2.75 subvariants. Moreover, through molecular modelling, we provide evidence that these mutations likely stabilize the S trimer conformation by forming new molecular interactions. Together, these results provide insights for understanding the altered cellular tropism and pathogenicity for Omicron.</p><p id="P14">The most important finding of this study is that the altered entry route preference of Omicron is largely determined by the key H655Y mutations. It is well established that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of utilizing either endosomal entry mediated by Cat L/B or plasma membrane entry mediated by TMPRSS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bestle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hoffmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Peacock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). However, SARS-CoV-2 entry in primary lung epithelial cells and lung-derived cell lines such as Calu-3 cell is largely TMPRSS2 dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Peacock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>), likely occurring on the plasma membrane. Following its emergence, the Omicron variant BA.1 has been shown to have a distinct entry profile, utilizing predominantly the endosomal entry pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Pia and Rowland-Jones, 2022</xref>), exhibiting poor replication in lower airway derived primary cells and Calu-3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gupta, 2022</xref>), as well as displaying reduced disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Halfmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). We found that the H655Y mutation governs BA.1.1 entry through endosomes, as suggested by the significant increase in viral infectivity observed in HEK293T-ACE2 cells but substantial reduction in viral infectivity in Calu-3 cells, and by the increased sensitivity of H655Y bearing variants to E64d, yet with decreased sensitivity to Camostat, which are also supported by other recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Yamamoto et al., 2022</xref>). However, the impact of H655Y on <italic>in vivo</italic> virus tropism and pathogenicity remains to be investigated. If the altered entry route preference introduced by the H655Y mutation is responsible for the enhanced nasopharynx tropism and reduced pathogenicity of the Omicron subvariants, any reversion of the H655Y mutation in future variants would be of great concern, as such a variant may exhibit enhanced pathogenicity. Careful monitoring this reversion mutation in the pandemic is warranted.</p><p id="P15">Membrane fusion is critical for entry of all enveloped viruses. We found that reversion mutations K547T and Y655H significantly promoted BA.1.1 S-mediated cell-cell fusion whereas forward mutations T547K and H655Y slightly impaired the D614G S-mediated cell-cell fusion, indicating that these two residues critically determine the low fusogenicity of BA.1.1. Quite unexpectedly, we found no evidence that T547K and H655Y affect S processing of BA.1.1 in cell lysates. Rather, reversion mutations K547T and Y655H strongly promote S1 shedding in the presence of sACE2, indicating that T547K and H655Y mutations, especially the latter, critically stabilize the BA.1.1 S conformation. This result is correlated with our structural modelling that T547K appears to stabilize the close conformation of S protein, which is also supported by a recent study reporting an extra hydrogen bond between the tyrosine residue at position 655 in S1 and the threonine residue at position 696 in S2 of BA.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Yamamoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). Further structural analyses, including comparisons between K547T/Y655H reversion mutants and the parental BA.1.1 or other Omicron subvariants by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) or crystallography, are needed to further elucidate the role of T547K and/or H655Y in Omicron subvariant S conformation.</p><p id="P16">It is important to note that H655Y mutation has been found to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in index cats and minks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">BraunID et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Escalera et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, the H655Y mutation appears to have arisen independently multiple times in human population, and is a lineage-defining mutation for the Gamma (P.1) SARS-CoV-2 variant in addition to the Omicron subvariants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Escalera <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). Importantly, H655Y is present in all predominant Omicron sublineages, including BA.1.1, BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1 and more recent BA.4/5 and BA.2.75, indicating that H655Y likely improves fitness and the ability to adapt to new hosts, including humans, cats, minks, and others. This is supported by a recent report demonstrating an enhancement of virus infectivity in mice for H655Y-containing viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Our findings in this work, along with other recent reports, together suggest that the occurrence of mutations at position 655 in S protein of current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants needs to be closely monitored. Additionally, <italic>in vivo</italic> examinations of the impact of the H655Y mutation on virus tropism and pathogenicity are critical and need to be investigated, as any reversion of the H655Y mutation could generate new concern for the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as novel Omicron subvariants continue to emerge.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell Lines and Maintenance</title><p id="P18">HEK293T (ATCC CRL-11268, research resource identifier [RRID]: CVCL_1926), HEK293T-ACE2 (BEI NR-52511, RRID: CVCL_A7UK) and Vero E6 expressing high endogenous ACE2 (Vero-ACE2) (BEI NR-53726, RRID:CVCL_A7UJ) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (MilliporeSigma, P4333) and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 26140-079).
