To improve walking speed and reduce metabolic cost of transport (mCoT), patients with plantar flexor weakness are provided dorsal-leaf spring ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs). The mCoT during gait depends on the AFO stiffness where an optimal AFO stiffness exists that minimizes mCoT. The biomechanics of why and how there exists a unique optimal stiffness for individuals with plantar flexor weakness are not well understood. To help understand why, we hypothesized that gait adaptations can be predicted by mCoT minimization. To explain how, we hypothesized that the AFO would reduce the required support moment and, hence, metabolic costs from the ankle plantar flexor and knee extensor muscles during stance and reduce hip flexor metabolic cost to initiate swing.</p><p id="P2">To test these hypotheses, we generated neuromusculoskeletal simulations to represent gait of an individual with bilateral plantar flexor weakness wearing an AFO with varying stiffness. Predictions were predicated on the goal of minimizing mCoT at each stiffness level, and the motor patterns were determined via dynamic optimization. The simulation results were compared to experimental data from subjects with bilateral plantar flexor weakness walking with varying AFO-stiffness.</p><p id="P3">Our simulations demonstrated that minimization of mCoT predicts gait adaptations in response to varying AFO stiffness levels in individuals with bilateral plantar flexor weakness. Initial reductions in mCoT with increasing stiffness were attributed to reductions in quadriceps metabolic cost during midstance. Increases in mCoT above optimum stiffness were attributed to the increasing metabolic cost of both hip flexor and hamstrings muscles.</p><p id="P4">The insights gained from our simulations could inform clinicians on the prescription of personalized AFOs.

To improve walking speed and reduce energy demand, patients with calf muscle weakness are frequently provided ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs). The energy demand of walking is affected by the AFO’s stiffness and there is a stiffness that minimizes the energy demand for an individual with calf weakness. To uncover the optimal stiffness, we generated simulations of an individual with calf muscle weakness walking with an AFO over a range of stiffnesses. Stable walking patterns were generated that minimized the energy demand for a given stiffness. We found that the initial reductions in energy demand as stiffness increased, were attributed to reductions in quadriceps muscle energy. Increases in energy demand as stiffness increased above the optimum were attributed to the increased energetic cost of both hip flexor and hamstrings muscles. With further model individualization, we believe that simulations based on minimizing the energy demand of movement can sufficiently predict adaptations to an AFO. Simulations can enable the prescription of personalized AFOs for individuals with neuromuscular disorders that help them walk with sufficient speed and efficiency to keep up with their peers.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P6">The plantar flexor muscles, consisting of soleus and the gastrocnemius, are often weakened in persons with neuromuscular disorders, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and poliomyelitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Weakness of the plantar flexors results in an altered gait pattern, characterized by reduced push-off power, and excessive ankle dorsiflexion and knee flexion during stance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. These gait deviations lead to a lower walking speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] and an elevated metabolic cost of transport (mCoT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], which limits daily physical mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Dorsal leaf spring (DLS) ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) are often prescribed to provide mechanical support during stance, augment push-off, and hence to reduce mCoT. In a DLS-AFO, a leaf spring connects a footplate to a calf casing posterior of the ankle and passively restricts ankle dorsiflexion by producing an external plantarflexion moment when the ankle is dorsiflexed. As a spring, the AFO can store energy when moving into dorsiflexion and release this energy as the ankle moves towards plantarflexion, thereby providing additional positive work during push-off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P7">In individuals with plantar flexor weakness, the effects of an AFO on improving gait kinematics and kinetics and reducing mCoT have been shown to depend on the stiffness of the leaf spring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Beginning at low and with increasing AFO stiffnesses, the mCoT first decreases, before increasing at higher stiffness levels, demonstrating a convex relation between AFO stiffness and mCoT with an optimum stiffness where mCoT is minimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. As demonstrated in healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], minimizing mCoT is prioritized during gait. As such, it can be expected that patients with gait disorders prefer walking with the stiffness that minimizes their metabolic energy cost. In case of plantar flexor weakness, the initial reduction in mCoT is thought to be the result of normalizing ankle and knee angles and moments which requires adequate AFO stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Normalization of the ankle and knee biomechanics is hypothesized to lead to a decrease in the metabolic cost of the quadriceps muscles and thereby reduce mCoT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. The initial decrease in mCoT may be further explained by a reduction in the metabolic cost of the plantar flexors as the AFO replaces the biological ankle plantarflexion moment during stance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. However, at higher stiffnesses, as the AFO restricts the ankle range of motion (RoM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], it limits active biological ankle power generation and energy storage and release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] of the AFO during push-off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The reduced ankle push-off work may result in higher energy losses at contralateral heel-strike and lead to compensatory hip flexion work to initiate the swing phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], which are potential causes for the increased mCoT at higher AFO stiffness levels. However, how each of these factors contribute to the relation between AFO stiffness and mCoT in people with plantar flexor weakness is unknown.</p><p id="P8">The aim of this study was to gain insights into why and how mCoT is affected by AFO stiffness variation in individuals with plantar flexor weakness by using predictive musculoskeletal simulations. First, based on the assumption that mCoT is a predictor for gait pattern changes in healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], we hypothesized that minimization of mCoT is a predictor of kinematic, kinetic, and mCoT changes to varying AFO stiffness in individuals with bilateral plantar flexor weakness. Second, we tested whether initial reductions in mCoT with increasing stiffness are explained by i) decreasing metabolic cost of the quadriceps as the knee moments are normalized, and ii) decreasing metabolic cost of the plantar flexors as the AFO replaces the ankle plantar-flexion moment during stance phase. Third, we hypothesized that increases in mCoT as stiffnesses exceed the optimum stiffness are caused by the increasing metabolic cost of hip flexor muscles to initiate the swing phase as total push-off power decreases.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P9">We created a planar musculoskeletal model of an individual with bilateral plantar flexor weakness, similar to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] using OpenSim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], and implemented an AFO with varying stiffness.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], we created a model with 9 degrees of freedom (3 around the pelvis and 1 around the hip, knee and ankle of each leg), actuated by 9 Hill-type muscles per leg (tibialis anterior, soleus, gastrocnemius, vasti, rectus femoris, biceps femoris short head, biarticular hamstrings, iliopsoas, gluteus maximus) in OpenSim 3.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. We set the maximum isometric muscle strength of the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles of both legs to 40% of normal healthy values (i.e. 60% muscle weakness), to induce bilateral plantar flexor weakness. Additionally, we restricted the ability to activate the plantar flexor muscles to 50%, to take into account that the weakened muscles would completely fatigue if they would be maximally activated for 10-20% of the gait cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].

We set the force parameters (stiffness, dissipation and friction) according to Veerkamp et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], and modelled the knee ligaments using a rotational spring (2 Nm/deg) and damper (0.2 Nm/deg/s) around the knee joint if the knee angles were outside the 5-120 deg flexion range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p id="P12">We modelled each AFO as two rigid parts, including a calf casing and a footplate with their experimental mass (calf casing: 0.2 kg, footplate and shoe: 0.5 kg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. We attached the AFO parts rigidly to the tibia and calcaneus, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). We modelled the stiffness of the AFO as two linear torsional springs for ankle dorsiflexion and for plantarflexion. In order to match experimental movement of the ankle within the AFO, the AFO did not deliver a moment in the neutral angle range, i.e. between 4.5 deg plantarflexion and 2 deg dorsiflexion. In DLS-AFOs, this small range depends on the material and manufactured geometry of the AFO, and its fit on the subject’s leg. The neutral angle range was defined from the ankle angle range during swing phase of the subject because in swing phase the AFO exerts only small moments on the ankle joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Simulation framework</title><p id="P13">We used SCONE (v1.6.0), a simulation, control, and dynamic optimization framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], to simulate gait of 10 seconds in duration.

Increases in mCoT above the optimum AFO stiffness were attributed to the increasing metabolic cost of both hip flexor muscles and hamstrings muscles.</p><p id="P34">The mCoT appears to be a good predictor of gait changes in individuals with bilateral plantar flexor weakness wearing AFOs with varying stiffness. Our forward simulations predicted changes in lower extremity kinematics and kinetics due to AFO stiffness variations within 1.2 SD of the experimentally observed changes. Although mCoT was not the only factor within our objective function, it had by far the largest contribution as it was responsible for 90% of the final objective function values. These findings support the claims that humans tend to minimize mCoT when walking as previously demonstrated in healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and in simulations of patients walking without assistive devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>].</p><p id="P35">Differences between simulated and experimental data were found in the knee joint angle and moment curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). Although the effects of varying AFO stiffness on specific gait features at midstance were predicted reasonably well, in early stance the knee angle and moment became more extended with increasing AFO stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This effect is likely explained by the fact that more extended knees in early stance are linked to decreased mCoT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. The human likely minimizes or is subjected to other factors, such as muscle fatigue and loading rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], which may cause the knee flexion in loading response instead of the metabolically more efficient straight knee. Although loading rates were penalized in our simulations, loading rates still increased up to twice as much as found in healthy subjects as AFO stiffness increased (S1 Fig), which could increase the risk of lower limb stress fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>].</p><p id="P36">The convex mCoT trend with respect to AFO stiffness can be explained by the metabolic cost changes in the quadriceps (vasti), hip flexor (iliopsoas) and hamstrings muscles. This parabolic trend was also present in the individual experimental data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). As hypothesized, initial reductions in mCoT starting at low and with increasing AFO stiffness were due to a decrease in the metabolic cost of the quadriceps (vasti) muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>). From low to medium AFO stiffnesses, the knee angle and moment normalized, reducing the metabolic cost of the vasti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. At higher stiffness levels, the knee became increasingly extended, which minimized mCoT but might cause knee pain in real life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. Contradicting our hypothesis and experimental data in healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>], metabolic cost of the plantar flexor muscles did not decrease with increasing AFO stiffness. As muscle activation and metabolic cost changes are related factors, our simulation result was also contrary to the findings of Harper et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] who found reductions in medial gastrocnemius muscle activation with increasing AFO stiffness in lower limb salvage patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. We likely did not observe reductions in plantar flexor metabolic cost, because the low muscle strength in the model resulted in proportionally low muscle mass, which reduces the muscle’s contribution to metabolic cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], and hence, even without an AFO the plantar flexors did not contribute substantially to mCoT.</p><p id="P37">In agreement with our hypothesis, increases in mCoT above the optimum stiffness were partly due to increases in the metabolic cost of the hip flexor (iliopsoas) muscles. Iliopsoas metabolic cost increased at the end of midstance before the start of push-off, potentially as a pre-activation to help initiate the swing phase. Increased hip work was also shown in an experimental study in patients with chronic stroke or multiple sclerosis where 0.5-5.4 Nm/deg AFO stiffnesses were tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Additionally, an increase in metabolic cost of the hamstrings muscles added to the increase in mCoT above the optimum stiffness. This metabolic cost increase can be seen during early stance where slightly more extended hip joint angles, larger hip extension moments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>) and decreasing negative hip joint work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8</xref>) can also be observed as AFO stiffness increases. At high stiffness levels, the hip is more extended at initial contact, and hip flexion is reduced during loading response that further contributes to the increased knee joint loading rates at high stiffness.</p><sec id="S12"><title>Limitations and future work</title><p id="P38">To test our hypotheses, we used a simplified, planar musculoskeletal model where medio-lateral stabilization was excluded, which could explain why our mCoT results were ∼10% lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] than in the experiments. With suboptimal AFO settings, the out-of-plane compensation, such as trunk motions, are known to be more extreme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>], hence the sensitivity of the mCoT trend to AFO stiffness could be higher in reality than in our simulations.</p><p id="P39">In the experimental study that was used for comparison, only AFOs with a stiffness in the range of 2.8-6.6 Nm/deg were tested. Hence, we were unable to verify the validity of our prediction with low stiffness levels.</p><p id="P40">In the future, simulations might be used to predict the individual optimal AFO properties, for which improving our understanding of the underlying mechanisms in this study was an essential first step. To be able to accurately predict adaptations to an AFO at the level of an individual, out-of-plane degrees of freedom and muscle actions should be investigated to understand the affects out-of-plane compensations. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses should be performed to evaluate the effect of patient and device characteristics, such as body weight, muscle weakness and muscle spasticity, and the neutral angle range of the AFO, have on the optimal AFO stiffness. With individualized models, our forward simulations could help predict the individual adaptations of patients to an AFO and improve the prescription of AFO settings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P41">We showed that adaptations in gait mechanics due to varying AFO stiffness, in individuals with bilateral plantar flexor weakness, can be predicted by minimization of mCoT. Our simulation results demonstrate the convex relation between mCoT and AFO stiffness, and are able to explain this shape by decreases in quadriceps metabolic cost in midstance, and increases in metabolic cost of the hamstrings during loading response and iliopsoas in mid-to-late stance as AFO stiffness increases above the optimal. In the future, mCoT minimization may enable predictions for individualized gait adaptations to an AFO for people with bilateral plantar flexor weakness and facilitate optimal AFO prescriptions.

The mCoT values of the subjects were shifted by their minimum mCoT value and the AFO stiffness values were shifted by the subject’s optimal stiffness value. The shifted individual experimental subject data is shown in different shades of grey. One quadratic curve was fitted to all shifted experimental subject data (dotted line), the goodness of fit is indicated by the Rsq number on the plot (Rsq = 0.634).
