Differentiation of MCCs requires the sequential action of the Geminin family transcriptional activators, GEMC1 and MCIDAS, that both interact with E2F4/5-DP1. How these factors activate transcription and the extent to which they play redundant functions remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the transcriptional targets and proximal proteomes of GEMC1 and MCIDAS are highly similar. However, we identified distinct interactions with SWI/SNF subcomplexes; GEMC1 interacts primarily with the ARID1A containing BAF complex while MCIDAS interacts primarily with BRD9 containing ncBAF complexes. Treatment with a BRD9 inhibitor impaired MCIDAS-mediated activation of several target genes and compromised the MCC differentiation program in multiple cell based models. Our data suggest that the differential engagement of distinct SWI/SNF subcomplexes by GEMC1 and MCIDAS is required for MCC-specific transcriptional regulation and mediated by their distinct C-terminal domains.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P6">In most cell types, DNA replication is limited to once per cell cycle to avoid endoreduplication that can trigger polyploidy, replication stress and cell death. Several mechanisms restrain re-replication, including the phosphorylation or proteolytic regulation of pre-replication complex (Pre-RC) components, the activity of checkpoint kinases and the inhibition of CDT1-dependent origin licensing by physical interactions with Geminin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Geminin contains a central coiled-coil (CC) domain that is required for its dimerization and interaction with CDT1. Similar CC domains were identified in the Geminin coiled-coil containing protein 1 (GEMC1, encoded by <italic>GMNC</italic>) and MCIDAS/Multicilin (encoded by <italic>MCIDAS</italic>) and shown to be critical for their functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Both GEMC1 and MCIDAS have been implicated in the regulation of DNA replication through antagonistic interactions with Geminin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">GEMC1 and MCIDAS also play critical roles in the transcriptional differentiation of multiciliated cells (MCCs), specialized epithelial cells that project dozens to hundreds of motile cilia from their apical surfaces and play crucial roles in the olfactory/respiratory, reproductive, renal and central nervous systems of many vertebrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. To activate transcription of this unique pathway, both proteins interact with E2F4/5-DP1 through a conserved C-terminal domain absent in Geminin, dubbed the TIRT domain due to a repeating amino acid motif in MCIDAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. This domain is required for the transcriptional activity of both GEMC1 and MCIDAS, and mutations in the TIRT domain of MCIDAS have been implicated in the rare ciliopathy Reduced Generation of Multiple Motile Cilia (RGMC) that is characterized by the loss or dysfunction of motile cilia on MCCs, causing hydrocephaly, defects in respiratory physiology and infertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The TIRT domains of GEMC1 and MCIDAS convey differential affinity for E2F proteins, with GEMC1 binding preferentially to E2F5 and MCIDAS to both E2F4 and E2F5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">The expression of <italic>Gemc1</italic> precedes that of <italic>Mcidas</italic> in the developing mouse brain, suggesting that GEMC1 acts upstream of MCIDAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Supporting this, mice lacking GEMC1 have no identifiable MCCs in any tissues, while mice lacking MCIDAS have columnar MCC-like cells that are positive for MCC markers, including FOXJ1 and TP73, but fail to amplify centrioles and generate motile cilia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. GEMC1 activates several genes critical for MCC generation, including <italic>MCIDAS, CDC20B</italic> and <italic>CCNO</italic> that reside in the same chromosomal region, as well as key transcription factors such as MYB, FOXJ1 and TP73<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Both GEMC1 and MCIDAS share numerous protein-protein interactions and play similar roles in MCC differentiation, but their level of redundancy remains unclear. To understand their relative molecular functions, we compared the transcriptional targets and proximal interactomes of GEMC1 and MCIDAS. Our results revealed that both proteins activate a core set of overlapping genes, but also have distinct transcriptional targets. The proximal interactomes of each protein were strikingly similar and composed almost exclusively of proteins related to transcription, including almost all transcription factors implicated in multiciliogenesis to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Notable among these is the SWI/SNF (switching/sucrose non-fermenting) chromatin remodeling complex that functions with E2F4/5 in transcriptional regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. We demonstrate that TIRT domains of GEMC1 and MCIDAS confer preferential interactions with distinct SWI/SNF sub-complexes and the depletion or inhibition of SWI/SNF components impairs their ability to activate transcription. Finally, inhibition of BRD9, a specific subunit of the ncBAF SWI/SNF complex impaired multiciliogenesis in mouse tracheal epithelial cells (mTECs) cultured at air liquid interface (ALI), as well as glioma cells overexpressing MCIDAS. Together, our results provide an overview of the core transcriptional machinery associated with GEMC1 and MCIDAS and demonstrate a critical role for SWI/SNF in GEMC1/MCIDAS-mediated transcriptional regulation during multiciliogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p id="P10">AD-293 (Agilent), HEK-293T, cells and Hela cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco) with 10% FBS (Hyclone).

This indicated that in the context of the CC and TIRT domains of GEMC1, the maintenance of this region is critical for efficient BAF/ARID1A complex interactions. However, the insertion of the corresponding MCIDAS region was not sufficient to alter the specificity towards ncBAF binding. Finally, we created another hybrid protein, MC-GEM-S, that contained the N-terminus of MCIDAS until the end of the CC, as well as the MCIDAS TIRT domain, with the intervening sequence from GEMC1 inserted between them. This construct efficiently labeled BRD9, indicating that the distinct MCIDAS TIRT domain was able to facilitate ncBAF interactions and that the additional MCIDAS sequence between the CC and TIRT, including the predicted structured region, was not required for the proximal interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p id="P36">To validate these results further in cells, we used the Proximity ligation assay (PLA) to examine the subcellular localization of GEMC1, MCIDAS or the hybrid proteins, all tagged with FLAG, relative to BRD9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F and 3G</xref>).

In addition, there was a dose-dependent reduction in cells exhibiting centriole amplification (inferred by staining for Centrin and Deup1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A, D, E</xref>) and multiciliogenesis (inferred by staining with Acetylated tubulin antibodies (Ac-tubulin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A, F</xref>). Together these data indicated that ncBAF function is essential for multiciliogenesis in murine ALI mTEC cultures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P42">MCCs have an intriguing developmental program in which post-mitotic MCC precursors support the explosive generation of numerous centrioles that mature into basal bodies for multiciliation. In addition, the direct involvement of MCC dysfunction in the etiology of a broad spectrum of human pathologies like respiratory disorders, fertility issues and hydrocephalus, has led to a significant degree of interest in the biology of this specialized ciliated cell-type. We and others have previously established that the two Geminin family members, GEMC1 and MCIDAS, are key factors that organize the transcriptional regulation of MCC differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Yet, several lines of evidence point to distinct functions for GEMC1 and MCIDAS in MCC differentiation that is not adequately explained by our current understanding of their molecular interactions. In this work, we compared their transcriptional targets and proximal interactions and found that, while their targets and interactomes were highly similar, they also had distinct molecular interactions and transcriptional effects. The BioID approach identified nearly every protein previously implicated in the transcriptional regulation of MCC differentiation to date, including E2F4/5-DP1, TRRAP, AHR, MYB, TP73, and CDK2, as well as many additional proteins implicated in their regulation, demonstrating the suitability of this strategy for interrogating transcriptional complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. These results also indicated that the proposed role of GEMC1 and MCIDAS in DNA replication is likely limited to their interactions with Geminin/CDT1, as nearly all of the proteins identified in BioID were related to transcriptional regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P43">Previous work showed that the E2F4/E2F5-DP1 transcription factors are required for MCC differentiation in every tissue where MCCs are present<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Our data suggests that E2F3, as well as DP-2 (TFDP2), may also influence the transcriptional response, particularly with MCIDAS, that has higher affinity for E2F4 and E2F5 through its distinct C-terminal TIRT domain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Associations of GEMC1 and MCIDAS with the DREAM/MuvB complex are also potentially relevant, as this complex functions with the E2F program to control cell cycle-specific transcriptional programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Finally, we identified RB and p107 of the pocket protein family, that presumably must be removed from repressive E2F4/5 complexes to activate transcription of their target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. GEMC1 specifically associated with CCNA2/CDK2, that are known to phosphorylate and dissociate RB/p107 during normal cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). An attractive hypothesis is that the delivery of CDK2 activity to RB/p107 via E2F-GEMC1-TIRT domain interactions could facilitate this activation step.</p><p id="P44">Multiciliated cells utilize canonical cell cycle regulators, including CDK2, CDK1/CCNB1, PLK1 and APC/C<sup>CDC20</sup>, as well as MCC-specific paralogs of cell cycle regulators, such as CCNA1, CCNO and CDC20B, to facilitate centriole amplification, although their precise roles remain largely unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. GEMC1 was shown to be a target of CCNA2/CDK2 kinase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and previous work suggested that GEMC1 was negatively regulated by the poorly characterized Cyclin, CCNO (Cyclin O), potentially connecting CDK activity to its transcriptional functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. We also note that several G2/M specific factors, including PLK1 and CDC20 (a component of the APC/C), proximally associated with MCIDAS but not GEMC1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). MCIDAS promotes the nuclear localization of GEMININ, and both GEMININ and MCIDAS are targets for mitotic degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. In the case of GEMININ, and likely MCIDAS, this requires APC/C<sup>CDC20 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. The emerging picture suggests that GEMC1 and MCIDAS are both likely targets of cell cycle-specific regulation, providing an elegant mechanism to facilitate their stepwise actions and fine tune transcriptional output with massive centriole amplification.</p><p id="P45">Recent biochemical work established the major SWI/SNF subcomplexes and demonstrated that their DNA binding and activity is largely dictated by histone modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Previously, a disordered, acidic region of GEMININ, C-terminal to the CC domain, was shown to facilitate interactions with BRG1 (SMARCA4), an ATPase that can be a component of any of the SWI/SNF subcomplexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Swapping the GEMC1 and MCIDAS C-terminal domains revealed that the sequence that confers specificity for ncBAF lies within the TIRT domain of MCIDAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). GEMC1 showed almost exclusive interactions with BRG1 containing complexes, compared to MCIDAS that labeled both BRG1 and BRM (SMARCA2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). However, moving the C-terminus of GEMC1 to MCIDAS (MC-C1) eliminated interactions with complex-specific subunits, indicating additional intricacy in the SWI/SNF interactions. The predicted structures of GEMC1 and MCIDAS generated by Alphafold appear divergent in the E2F4/5-DP1 binding TIRT domain, and in the case of MCIDAS, additional structured domains are predicted, including one directly upstream of the TIRT domain. Our analysis with a large panel of hybrid proteins indicated that this domain was not required to influence TIRT-dependent interactions with BRD9 containing ncBAF complexes, although it could still potentially influence protein function and should be investigated further in future work.</p><p id="P46">ARID1A containing BAF complexes bind more predominantly to H3K4 monomethylated enhancer regions, while ncBAF binds preferentially to H3K4-trimethylated promoter regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. As both GEMC1 and MCIDAS identified multiple SWI/SNF complexes, one possibility is that they work together at some of the same genes through distinct enhancer/promoter interactions. This is supported by the identification of common transcription factors that bind enhancer and promoter elements with both proteins in BioID experiments, as well as their similar labeling of the Mediator complex that bridges promoter and enhancer elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. We unfortunately cannot discriminate the direct and indirect targets of GEMC1 and MCIDAS, an issue that is confounded by the fact that GEMC1 activates <italic>MCIDAS,</italic> influencing the level of activation of some common targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In our hands, extensive attempts to ChIP either GEMC1 or MCIDAS to identify direct targets were unsuccessful. As neither protein has an identifiable DNA binding domain, their target gene specificity is likely dictated by multivalent protein interactions rather than specific contact with DNA motifs. Our data provide a number of leads to pursue this possibility in future work, in order to better understand the mechanisms that confer transcriptional specificity.</p><p id="P47">While the majority of proteins identified by GEMC1 and MCIDAS were common, there were several proteins aside from SWI/SNF components that were strongly enriched or exclusive with one of the baits. Two of these, ELMSAN1/MIDEAS and DNTTIP1, are defining components of the mitotic deacetylase (MiDAC) complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. This complex recruits histone deacetylases 1 and 2, that were not identified in the BioID experiments, to regulate cell type-specific transcriptional programs during development and exhibits its highest activity in mitotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. The MiDAC complex has been proposed to function in transcriptional activation in neurodevelopment through the deacetylation of H4K20<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Notably, cBAF and ncBAF activity was shown to be differentially regulated by acetylation of H4K20, as well as other residues in the H4 tail, indicating that the interaction of GEMC1 with MiDAC could be relevant to a transition from GEMC1-cBAF to MCIDAS-ncBAF binding. While the influence of MiDAC on the transcriptional program of multiciliated cells remains unknown, it represents another interesting proximal interaction for further analysis.</p><p id="P48">We identified distinct SWI/SNF subcomplexes that influence the transcriptional outputs of GEMC1 and MCIDAS and inhibition of BRD9 impaired multiciliogenesis in 2 distinct systems. This observation may suggest direct effects on ependymal MCC differentiation in mice or human patients with SWI/SNF mutations and hydrocephaly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. Despite the limitation that our proteomic study was performed by overexpressing GEMC1 or MCIDAS in cycling AD-293 cells, our approach is strongly validated by its ability to identify most of the factors known to be involved in MCC transcription and the fact that multiple BRD9 inhibitors impair the MCC pathway. Notably absent from our proteomic results were the RFX2/3 transcription factors, that are expressed at low levels in HEK-293 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org">http://www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>). This may explain why overexpression of GEMC1 and MCIDAS is incapable of driving efficient multiciliation in this cell type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, we were able to drive multiciliogenesis in the glioblastoma cell line DBTRG-05MG, that expresses both factors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.depmap.org">www.depmap.org</ext-link>). This new cell line system may help facilitate future work in defining the machinery involved in multiciliation, as it can potentially be more easily scaled up and genetically manipulated than systems relying on primary cells. In conclusion, our work provides new insights into the transcriptional machinery used by GEMC1 and MCIDAS in MCC differentiation and provides resources for further investigation into the molecular functions of these non-canonical transcriptional activators.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary material</label><media xlink:href="EMS158140-supplement-Supplementary_material.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d77aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank F.
