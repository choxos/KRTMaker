However, this task is difficult mainly due to the myriad of vascular risk factors and comorbidities that influence it, and the low specificity and sensitivity of the image intensities and textures alone for predicting WMH evolution. Given the predominantly vascular nature of WMH, in this study, we evaluate the impact of incorporating stroke lesion information to a probabilistic deep learning model to predict the evolution of WMH 1-year after the baseline image acquisition, taken soon after a mild stroke event, using T2-FLAIR brain MRI. The Probabilistic U-Net was chosen for this study due to its capability of simulating and quantifying the uncertainties involved in the prediction of WMH evolution. We propose to use an additional loss called volume loss to train our model, and incorporate stroke lesions information, an influential factor in WMH evolution. Our experiments showed that jointly segmenting the disease evolution map (DEM) of WMH and stroke lesions, improved the accuracy of the DEM representing WMH evolution. The combination of introducing the volume loss and joint segmentation of DEM of WMH and stroke lesions outperformed other model configurations with mean volumetric absolute error of 0.0092 <italic>ml</italic> (down from 1.7739 <italic>ml</italic>) and 0.47% improvement on average Dice similarity coefficient in shrinking, growing and stable WMH.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="S2"><title>White matter hyperintensities and their progression</title><p id="P2">White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are one of the main neuroradiological features of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and have been commonly associated with stroke, aging, and dementia progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. They are often observed in T2-weighted and T2-fluid attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) brain magnetic resonance images (MRI), appearing as bright regions. Small subcortical infarcts may be indistinguishable from WMH on structural MRI in absence of intravenous contrast due to sharing similar image intensity characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, and if mistaken for WMH could negatively impact the design of clinical research trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Clinical studies have indicated that some patients exhibit WMH progression over time (i.e., increasing in volume)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> while some show WMH regression over time (i.e., shrinking in volume)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, although these are fewer in proportion compared to those reporting an increase in volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Another study indicated that WMH dynamically change over time with clusters of WMH individually shrinking, staying unchanged (i.e., stable), or growing, these being observed at the same time point within the same individual<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. These variations have been associated with patients’ comorbidities and clinical outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. A meta-analysis on rate and risk factors for WMH volume growth specifically, concluded that these vary with the characteristics of the sample, although hypertension, age, baseline WMH volume and smoking seemed to be the main contributors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. And a growing number of clinical studies have indicated that, in addition to age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, previous strokes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and genetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> also influence the rate and direction of WMH evolution. But, as one clinical study and another meta-analysis acknowledged, current knowledge about factors influencing WMH evolution is still incomplete and poorly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Interestingly, despite increasing evidence on WMH burden at baseline being the determinant factor on the rate and magnitude of WMH progression (and regression)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, increase in WMH volume has been found to be a better predictor of persistent cognitive impairment (i.e., a potential precursor to Alzheimer or vascular dementia) than baseline WMH burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. However, evidence that overall reduction of WMH volume over time can prevent functional decline is scarce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.

But despite evidence on the importance and benefit of studying WMH spatial distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, there are limited approaches to predict spatial WMH evolution. Predicting the evolution of WMH is crucial for understanding the dynamics of small vessel disease and ultimately provide better care and prognosis for individual patients, but it remains a difficult task because of the different rate and direction of the evolution of individual WMH clusters and their interplay with other imaging features of vascular disease and brain parenchymal changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Specifically, 1 year after stroke, reported WMH changes are mild<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, thus posing an additional challenge for their accurate identification.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Precedent work in estimating WMH evolution</title><p id="P5">Despite the high accuracy displayed by several fully-automatic deep learning schemes segmenting WMH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, most of the algorithms applied in longitudinal studies on WMH evolution have been so far semi-automatic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Various deep learning models have been proposed to predict the spatial evolution of WMH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. These studies, have represented WMH spatial evolution by a map called <italic>disease evolution map</italic> (DEM) which indicates the WMH voxels that shrink, grow, or remain stable at a further time point. DEM can be generated by subtracting images of manually labeled WMH from different time points. Previous studies generated the DEM by subtracting a baseline image of semi- or fully-automatically labeled WMH of a patient (Visit 1, V1) from a follow-up image of semi- or fully-automatically labeled WMH from the same patient one year after (Visit 2, V2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.

Another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> used radiomic signatures of the normal-appearing tissue as auxiliary variables to vascular risk factors in a logistic regression model to predict general “progression” vs. “no progression” of WMH, and reported that radiomics improved the accuracy of the model by approximately 10%, but did not analyse the spatial change of WMH. Thus, incorporating clinically associated factors into the predictive model remains a challenge for estimating the spatial evolution of WMH.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Related Approaches</title><p id="P8">Studies that develop predictive models for disease progression from medical image modalities using machine/deep learning can be categorised, generally, into the three different approaches listed below. <list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P9"><bold>Approaches predicting the outcomes of a disease</bold>.

In this study, the U-Net was used as segmentation network for predicting the DEM. Meanwhile, Prior Net and Posterior Net were used for variational inference so that uncertainty in predicting future WMH evolution is modeled probabilistically. Prior Net estimates a low-dimensional Gaussian distribution called prior latent space by producing its mean(s) and variance(s) from T2-FLAIR MRI at baseline (i.e., V1, denoted <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>V</italic>1</sub>).

This correlation slightly improved (i.e., to Spearman rho = 0.42) when attention was incorporated in the scheme.

The ground truth showed the worst correlation with Prins in terms of shrinkage (Spearman rho = 0.45), followed by PUnet-wSL (Spearman rho = 0.47 without attention and 0.50 with it). The highest correlation values in shrinkage were achieved with PUNet-vol without attention (Spearman rho = 0.59), and PUNet with attention (Spearman rho = 0.60).

There were more patients with net growing WMH than with net shrinking WMH in the dataset, thus hinting to a possible bias by the other models towards growing WMH. Reduction in WMH volume was mainly observed in patients with high WMH volume (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P53">As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> shows, the average progression of WMH volume from V1 to V2 (in <italic>ml</italic>) was well estimated by PUNet-wSL-vol (i.e., brown dashed line representing PUNet-wSL-vol is coincident with the red line representing the ground truth). In general, as expected, models trained using volume loss (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD3">Equation 3</xref>) (i.e., PUNet-vol (green line), Att-PUNet-vol (orange line), PUNet-wSL-vol (brown line), and Att-PUNet-wSL-vol (grey line)) produced more accurate progression of WMH volume from V1 to V2 than those which did not use volume loss during training. Of note, however, PUNet-wSL (yellow line) and Att-PUNet-wSL (pink line), had lines close to the red line of the ground truth. Overall, models jointly segmenting stroke lesions and WMH improved the estimation of future volume of WMH at V2.</p><p id="P54">To further analyse the accuracy of the winner scheme in estimating the WMH volume change, we grouped the patients in quintiles according to their WMH volume at baseline and calculated the WMH change produced by the reference (i.e., ground truth) segmentation, and the PUNet model using volume loss with and without jointly segmenting the DEM and the stroke lesions. As can be appreciated from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, the scheme that jointly segmented the stroke lesions and the DEM of WMH change produced mean, median and a distribution of WMH volume change values across the sample more similar to those from the reference segmentation, than the scheme that only segmented the DEM of WMH change for all but the highest quintile.</p><p id="P55">We also divided the reference WMH segmentations into intense and less intense WMH as per<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, and considered an ‘extended’ WMH volume that included the WMH surrounding lacunes, thought to be reminiscences of old small subcortical infarcts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). It can be observed that the volume output from the scheme that jointly segmented the stroke lesions with the DEM of WMH change resulted strikingly similar to the one produced by this ‘extended’ WMH segmentation (see gray and yellow box plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B and 3C</xref>, respectively), especially for patients in the highest quintile. Patients in this quintile exhibit a high burden of WMH surrounding lacunes and coalescing with previous strokes. Therefore, it is expected that not only AI schemes, but also experts would consider all hyperintensities as part of the white matter disease in absence of any other sequence or clinical information from this patient group. It can be also seen that the reference WMH change (i.e., blue box plot in the same figure) is mainly determined by the less intense WMH change (i.e., pale green box plot), therefore explaining the difficulty in obtaining accurate growth and shrinking spatial estimates and putting into question the accuracy in the spatial estimates of the ground truth segmentations given the degree of observer-dependent manual input they had.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Spatial agreement evaluation</title><p id="P56">Spatial agreement evaluation was performed to see whether closer predicted future volumes of WMH to the reference future WMH volumes is followed by higher spatial agreements between predicted DEM and ground truth DEM or not. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows performances of all tested configurations using DSC (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD12">Equation 12</xref>).

Furthermore, we can see that joint segmentation of DEM and stroke lesions by PUNet-wSL (i.e., without volume loss) and PUNet-wSL-vol (i.e., with volume loss) produced either the best or second best DSC values for all categories of DEM, except for ‘Growing’ and ‘Stable’ WMH (achieved by the original models of PUNet and PUNet-vol). On the other hand, models with auxiliary input of probabilistic maps of WMH change, (i.e., Att-PUNet, Att-PUNet-vol, Att-PUNet-wSL, and Att-PUNet-wSL-vol) failed to improve the performance of the DEM segmentation while improved the performance of ‘Stroke Lesions’ segmentation. Furthermore, models trained using volume loss (i.e., PUNet-vol, Att-PUNet-vol, PUNet-wSL-vol, and Att-PUNet-wSL-vol) produced better DSC values on ‘Average’, which indicates that the volume loss impacted positively in the task of estimating the DEM of WMH.</p><p id="P58">DSC is influenced by TP, FP, and FN counts between ground truth mask and predicted segmentation, but TP, FP, and FN counts are highly imbalance in the segmentation of brain lesions.

PUNet-wSL-vol and PUNet-vol were chosen for qualitative/visual evaluation as they produced the best and second best DSC values on ‘Average’ (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> shows that PUNet-wSL-vol, which jointly segments WMH DEM and stroke lesions, produced better segmentation results than PUNet-vol, which exhibits a high level of uncertainty in predicting shrinking and growing WMH. Confusion matrices in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> show that PUNet-wSL-vol lowered this uncertainty by producing lower rates of <italic>fnr</italic> (and their corresponding FN counts (<italic>n</italic>)) for shrinking and growing WMH) in most cases. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref> illustrates cases where low DSC values of predicted WMH DEM were caused mostly by two reasons: low WMH volume at V1 (patient and MSSB172) and brain MRI artefacts (patient MSSB211). Based on our observations, these two problems were relevant throughout the sample in our evaluations.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Uncertainty quantification</title><p id="P62">As all configurations evaluated are based on the Probabilistic U-Net, uncertainty for each label in the DEM was quantified by predicting DEM for each subject multiple times. In this study 30 different DEM predictions were generated from 30 samples of <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>prior</italic></sub> from Prior Net for each input data/patient. From these 30 DEM predictions per patient data, uncertainty was calculated as the Cross Entropy (CE) between probability values from all DEM predictions and its average as written in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD13">Equation 13</xref>.</p><p id="P63"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> shows the uncertainty maps for all DEM labels produced by the model that generated the best DSC ‘Average’ value, PUNet-wSL-vol, for the whole brain and inside the predicted DEM for a patient. From the uncertainty maps for the whole brain, we can see that the uncertainties for shrinking and growing WMH encompass larger brain areas than for stable WMH. This finding supports results from evaluating the spatial agreement between ground truth and the models’ outputs, indicating lower accuracy in the predictions of changing WMH (i.e., shrinking and growing) compared to the predictions of stable WMH. The example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref> has incorrect areas showing uncertainty in the ‘Shrinking’ label (e.g., in the frontal cortex and in the septum), owed mainly to hyperintense flow artefacts.</p><p id="P64">Interestingly, in the uncertainty maps, the uncertainty values inside DEM labels of shrinking and growing WMH are higher than those inside stable WMH, a consistent finding from this evaluation. This is in-line with a previous analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> that showed WMH progression and disappearance being associated with the areas of ill-defined subtle or “less intense” WMH, largely identified as indicative of pre- (and post-) lesional changes. As expected, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref> shows, the uncertainty values inside the predicted DEMs and the DSC values produced by PUNet-wSL-vol are negatively correlated for each DEM label (i.e., shrinking, growing and stable WMH). However, only for stable WMH (r=0.75) higher DSC values of DEM labels can be predicted by having lower uncertainty values inside the predicted DEM and vice versa. Plots of the correspondence in shrinking and growing labels show a wide spread in DSC values especially among those with uncertainty values between 0.7 and 0.98, that would make any inference of the predictive power of one magnitude over the other inaccurate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S28" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P65">This study proposed deep learning models based on the Probabilistic U-Net<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> architecture trained incorporating stroke lesions information into the models and using volume loss as additional loss for improving the quality of predicted future volume of WMH and disease evolution map (DEM) of WMH. Probabilistic U-Net was chosen as the baseline method because a preliminary study showed that it performed better than the U-Net<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P66">We proposed three different approaches for incorporating stroke lesions information into Probabilistic U-Net models. These are <bold>(1)</bold> joint segmentation of DEM and stroke lesions, <bold>(2)</bold> use of probabilistic maps of WMH change in relation to stroke lesions’ locations, and <bold>(3)</bold> combination of <bold>(1)</bold> and <bold>(2)</bold>. We proposed to incorporate stroke lesions information into deep learning models to predict WMH evolution because stroke is commonly associated with the evolution of WMH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Based on the results from the various experiments, joint segmentation of DEM and stroke lesions (approach <bold>(1)</bold>) was the most effective approach to improve the quality of predicted DEM of WMH in all evaluations, while being also simpler and more straightforward than the other approaches evaluated in this study. The introduction of a volume loss as an additional loss to the scheme substantially improved the quality in predicting the DEM of WMH in terms of volume, correlation with clinical scores of WMH progression, and in terms of spatial agreement.</p><p id="P67">This study shows that 1) incorporating factors that have been commonly associated with WMH progression (i.e., stroke lesions information) is crucial to produce better prediction of DEM for WMH from brain MRI; 2) the best method for incorporating associated factors that can be extracted from the same data/image modality involves performing multi-task learning; and 3) in patients with vascular pathology, a multi-class segmentation of brain features resulting from symptomatic (i.e. stroke) and asymptomatic (i.e., WMH) vascular events generates better results consistent with clinical research. In this study, as stroke lesions appear on the same T2-FLAIR MRI sequence as WMH, we performed joint segmentation of DEM for WMH and stroke lesions. However, previous clinical studies have shown that there are other non-image risk factors and brain features that have been commonly associated with the progression and evolution of WMH, like age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, ventricular enlargement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, and brain atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Thus, more (image and non-image) factors could be incorporated in future studies to further improve the quality of predicted DEM of WMH, although the best way to incorporate non-image factors to the prediction model remains to be found.</p><p id="P68">This study also has limitations to overcome in future works. The dataset was small in size impeding a quantitative in-depth analysis of the models’ performance in different patient subgroups, e.g., patients stratified by age and sex, patients grouped by stroke subtype, etc. Thus, subgroup analyses were carried out visually and volumetrically, not spatially. By using only data from patients presenting to a clinic with a mild-to-moderate stroke, the generalisability of the proposed approach can be questioned. Therefore, further evaluation in a wider and more heterogeneous sample will be needed. The use of DSC in the evaluation needed the binarisation of the probabilistic outputs from the models. Limitations in the use of DSC have been recently acknowledged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. However, it must be noted that ground truth segmentations are also binary, and observer-dependent. By using different quality control metrics in a comprehensive analysis we have overcome the limitations that the analysis of the spatial agreement using DSC poses. A probabilistic metric allowing spatial analyses of segmentation results is needed. Also, we used probabilistic maps of WMH change for strokes in the lentiform nucleus and centrum semiovale based on findings from a clinical study. However, the same clinical study specified that it was not possible to ascertain WMH evolution and distribution for patients with the stroke in other regions like thalami and midbrain or brain stem due to the limited sample of patients with infarcts in those regions. Incorporating findings for more powered studies would be necessary to conclude about the usefulness of incorporating attention maps to the AI schemes. Finally, various schemes for estimating uncertainty in segmentation/classification tasks have recently emerged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, which would be worth exploring in the future for estimating WMH evolution.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Funds from JSPS (Kakenhi Grant-in-Aid for Research Activity Start-up, Project No. 20K23356) (MFR); RIKEN’s Special Postdoctoral Researchers (SPDR) program (MFR); Row Fogo Charitable Trust (Grant No. BRO-D.FID3668413) (MCVH); Wellcome Trust (patient recruitment, scanning, primary study Ref No. WT088134/Z/09/A); Fondation Leducq (Perivascular Spaces Transatlantic Network of Excellence); EU Horizon 2020 (SVDs@Target); and the MRC UK Dementia Research Institute at the University of Edinburgh (Wardlaw programme) are gratefully acknowledged.
