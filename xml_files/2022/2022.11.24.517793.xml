Changes in the environment can expose cryptic genetic variations, generating new phenotypes on which selection can act, and promoting the success of phenotypes adaptive to the new conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Phenotypic plasticity may be particularly important in plants because, as sessile organisms, they need to constantly adjust to the changing environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. For example, in response to attacks from herbivores, plants often increase the biosynthesis of defensive metabolites that deter herbivores from feeding, reduce their performance, or attract herbivores' natural enemies (e.g., flavonoids and phenolic compounds)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Although previous studies have shown that the evolution of defensive metabolites can be driven by herbivore selection, direct evidence demonstrating the role of induced responses in adaptive evolution to herbivores remains scarce, as most current studies have not disentangled the effects of evolution and induced responses. Indeed, considering that herbivory-induced responses are often confounded by other ecological interactions and trade-offs between growth and defenses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, it remains unclear whether herbivory-induced responses can contribute to the rapid adaptive evolution of herbivores.</p><p id="P3">In addition to inducing changes in plant phenotypes, herbivory affects the composition and function of plant-associated microbial communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. This is non-trivial, considering that plant microbiomes are, in turn, able to modulate the phenotype of their hosts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, including traits related to defense against herbivores <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> that can directly or indirectly affect plant growth and resistance against herbivory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, phenotypic responses caused by herbivory-induced microbiome changes may also influence plant adaptation to herbivores <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. However, direct experimental evidence to support this hypothesis is scarce. This is largely due to difficulties in assessing the effects of changes in the microbiota on plant resistance in its native environment, as microbiome communities are highly dynamic and sensitive to abiotic environments.</p><p id="P4">To address these challenges, we used the duckweed <italic>Spirodela polyrhiza</italic> and its natural herbivore <italic>Lymnaea stagnalis</italic> (a freshwater snail) as a model system. <italic>Spirodela polyrhiza</italic> predominately reproduces via clonal propagation, with an asexual generation time of ~3-5 days outdoors during the growing season. <italic>Spirodela polyrhiza</italic> has a small size, a small genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, and a very low genetic diversity and mutation rate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, making it an excellent model for real-time tracking of evolutionary processes through outdoor multigenerational experimental evolution. By experimentally evolving plant populations to multigenerational herbivory outdoors, we tested whether herbivory drives rapid adaptive evolution in plant populations. We then performed both indoor and outdoor bioassays to disentangle the role of induced responses and changes in genotype frequencies in rapid adaptation to herbivory in <italic>S. polyrhiza.</italic></p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Snail herbivory drives rapid adaptation in S. polyrhiza outdoors</title><p id="P5">We experimentally evolved replicated populations of a mixture of four genotypes of <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic> (Sp21, Sp56, Sp58, and Sp65; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tab.

These four genotypes were used since they represent the genetic variation typically found in natural populations in Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We replicated experimental populations over ten ponds outdoors, each hosting two cages with fine nets separating the two treatments (with or without herbivores) while maintaining plants in a common water body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). While tracking changes in plant morphology over the course of two growing seasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a and 1b</xref>), we performed a series of experiments to test whether multigenerational herbivory can drive rapid adaptive evolution in plant populations.</p><p id="P6">To test the effect of herbivory on changes in plant growth rate, we measured the growth rates of the mixed populations outdoors in the control and herbivory treatments. Populations of <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic> that had previously been exposed to herbivory grew slower in terms of number of fronds (F= 36.72; df = 1; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a</xref>), biomass (F= 972.74; df = 1; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2b</xref>), and area (F = 28132; df = 1; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2c</xref>) compared to populations that did not experience herbivory. Cross-sections of representative fronds revealed that herbivory altered plant morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Together, these results show that <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic> populations grew smaller, slower, and heavier under multigenerational snail herbivory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Nutrient levels and pH were similar in both cages within each pond throughout the first season (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tab.

Although marginal differences were detected, the effect size was small (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tab.

We found that snails consumed fewer fronds (F = 35.71; df = 1; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), less biomass (F =277.36; df = 1; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), and less surface area of fronds (F = 633.54; df = 1; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>) from the populations that had previously experienced herbivory compared to the control populations. In addition, we found that herbivory altered the production of putative defensive plant metabolites during the two consecutive growing seasons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>), including consistently increased production of tyramine. Taken together, these results suggest that multigenerational herbivory reduces growth rate, alters plant morphology and metabolism, and increases herbivore resistance in <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic> populations.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Evolution of herbivory-induced responses contributed to the rapid adaptation</title><p id="P8">We tested whether the observed rapid phenotypic changes were due to changes in genotype frequency or phenotypic plasticity by quantifying the frequencies of each genotype in the mixed populations outdoors, using a pool-seq approach on samples collected after 8 and 12 weeks of experimental evolution. We found that the genotype frequency was influenced by the treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tab. S3</xref>). In comparison to the starting population (25% of each genotype), herbivory significantly altered the genotype frequencies of Sp21 and Sp65 in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), while but did not influence the frequency of genotypes Sp56 and Sp58. At week 12, in comparison to controls, while herbivory reduced the frequency of genotype Sp21 (control 33.9±2.4%, herbivory 24.5±1.8%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0004) and increased the frequency of genotype Sp65 (control 19.3±1.6%, herbivory 27.1±2.1%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0006), suggesting that herbivory rapidly altered genotype frequencies in the duckweed populations outdoors.</p><p id="P9">We then tested whether the observed adaptive changes were caused by intrinsic differences in growth and resistance among genotypes. To this end, we grew each genotype under sterile indoor conditions using plants directly from the sterile collection and measured their growth rate and resistance to herbivory (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref> for further detail). Growth rate differed among the genotypes (F<sub>3, 35</sub> = 3.51, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4a</xref>), although the post hoc contrasts did not show pairwise differences between them, suggesting that the overall differences were marginal. Herbivory resistance assays showed that the four genotypes differed in their intrinsic resistance (F<sub>3, 44</sub> = 58.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S4b</xref>), mainly due to the genotype Sp56, which is more susceptible to herbivory than the other genotypes (p &lt; 0.0001). No differences were found in Sp21 and Sp65, the frequency of which was altered by herbivory in outdoor ponds, suggesting that neither the intrinsic growth rate nor resistance contributed to the rapid changes in resistance observed after outdoor experimental evolution.</p><p id="P10">We then investigated whether herbivory-induced plasticity <italic>per se</italic> can contribute to the observed phenotypic changes by experimentally subjecting each genotype separately to the snail’s attack or control conditions in indoor microcosms. After eight weeks of growth, we found that the fronds of all genotypes grown under herbivory were smaller (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tab. S4</xref>), indicating that phenotypic plasticity could contribute to the observed morphological changes.</p><p id="P11">To further investigate the effects of phenotypic plasticity and changes in genotype frequency, we assembled four different artificial populations in our greenhouse ponds using a full factorial design and quantified the levels of resistance to herbivory. We found clear interaction effects between induced responses and evolutionary changes in genotype composition (plasticity × evolution F = 4.47; df = 1; <italic>p</italic> = 0.039; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Although the changes in genotype frequency did not alter plant resistance in populations assembled using control plants (<italic>p</italic> = 0.914; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), they increased resistance to herbivory when plants were previously induced by herbivory (<italic>p</italic> = 0.006; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4</xref>). Together, these results suggest that both herbivory-induced phenotypic plasticity and evolution contribute to the rapid increase in resistance of <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic> outdoors.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Herbivory-induced microbiota changes contributed to the increased resistance to herbivory</title><p id="P12">In addition to directly inducing changes in plant metabolism, herbivory can also induce changes in the plant microbiota, which might alter plant growth and resistance. Therefore, we characterized the duckweed-associated microbiota of mixed outdoor populations after 8 and 12 weeks of experimental evolution using the pool-seq data. We found that herbivory altered the structure of microbial communities associated with <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table. S5</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We tested whether changes in microbiota might have caused changes in plant growth and resistance by growing individual genotypes within each treatment cage of our experimental setup outdoors. These plants were kept separate from direct herbivory using floating boxes with a fine net, so they were only exposed to the microbiota, either induced by herbivory or control, in the native environment of the experimental cages. After eight weeks outdoors, we measured the growth rate and resistance to snail herbivory of these individual genotypes outdoors. We observed that only genotype Sp65 showed increased resistance to herbivory (F = 3.66; df = 1; <italic>p</italic> = 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), but not biomass or surface area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tab. S6</xref>), when fronds were exposed to the indirect effects of herbivory, including the herbivory-induced changes in microbiota. No differences were observed among the other three genotypes (p &gt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tab. S7</xref>). Because herbivory-induced microbiota had different effects on resistance levels in Sp21 and Sp65, we characterized the plant-associated microbial community of genotypes Sp21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>) and Sp65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>), in which genotype frequency was altered by herbivory, using an amplicon metagenomics approach. No differences between the two treatments were found when investigating the structure of the eukaryotic community associated with genotypes Sp21 (F<sub>1, 12</sub> = 0.73; <italic>p</italic> = 0.29) and Sp65 (F<sub>1, 12</sub> = 0.52; <italic>p</italic> = 0.42). However, herbivory induced little change in the bacterial microbiota associated with Sp21 (F<sub>1, 12</sub> = 1.40; <italic>p</italic> = 0.06; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table. S8</xref>), and significantly altered the bacterial microbiota of Sp65 (F<sub>1, 12</sub> = 1.58; <italic>p</italic> = 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table. S8</xref>), which was consistent with the observed differences in resistance between the two genotypes. These results suggest that herbivory-induced changes in plant microbiota might have contributed to the rapid changes in resistance to herbivory in <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic> outdoors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">Induced responses are widespread in nature and are thought to contribute to adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. However, direct evidence of their effects on adaptive evolution remains scarce. Here, by carrying out experimental evolution outdoors, we demonstrated that induced responses contribute to rapid adaptive evolution of <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic>. We found that snail feeding rapidly reduced the size and growth rate of the mixed <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic> populations. Although the four genotypes differed in size, the observed morphological changes in the populations were likely due to induced responses (phenotypic plasticity) but not the changes in genotype frequencies. This is because size differences were mostly found between Sp56 and the other three genotypes, whereas the frequency of Sp56 was not altered by herbivory. Furthermore, such morphological changes were not likely to be due to herbivory-induced microbiota, as individuals of the same genotype growing in the two different microbial communities (herbivore-induced and control) had similar frond sizes and growth rates. Instead, the morphological changes were likely due to direct herbivory-induced phenotypic plasticity. When individual genotypes were attacked by snail herbivory indoors, similar morphological changes (smaller fronds) were observed in all four genotypes. Similarly, grazing herbivores can also induce phenotypic responses in other plant species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, indicating a conserved response (either active or passive) in plants.</p><p id="P15">In addition to the observed morphological changes, herbivory also increased resistance to snails in <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic> populations. Through pool-seq analysis and bioassays using synthetic populations, we found that increased resistance to herbivory was likely caused by both induced responses (phenotypic plasticity) and changes in genotype frequencies (evolution), suggesting that herbivore-imposed selection acted on herbivory-induced traits in <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic>, supporting the existence of conditional neutrality for these traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, our results support the importance of phenotypic plasticity in unveiling cryptic genetic variation – a trait unveiled under specific conditions – in the rapid adaptive evolution to environmental factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">Using a targeted metabolomics approach, we observed various changes in primary and secondary metabolites. Among them where several putative defensive metabolites such as luteolin, coumaric acid, cyanidin glycosides, shikimic acid, sucrose, and apigenin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. However, the changes varied significantly between the two analyzed time points. Most metabolites can be affected by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors, and during the time frame of the experiment, plants experienced a highly dynamic environment. Additionally, differences between short- and long-term responses to herbivory, differences in damage level, and changes in genotype frequency might causally contribute to the observed dynamics. A change that was observed under herbivory across both growing seasons was an increased abundance of tyramine, a response also observed in other plant-herbivore systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Tyramine has been reported in other plants to have the potential to directly affect plant-animal interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, to be a precursor for herbivory-inducible secondary metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, and to be incorporated into cell walls, where it can influence cell wall digestibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. However, for our plant-herbivore system, information on metabolic responses to herbivory and their effects on herbivores is scarce, and further experimental support is needed to draw clear conclusions. Additionally, it is also possible that the increased resistance might be due to thickened cell walls or other unknown mechanisms that alter the feeding choice of herbivores.</p><p id="P17">Our results also showed that herbivory altered the structure of the plant microbiome, both within the mixed population and in one of the genotypes used. While the effect of herbivory on the plant microbiome has been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, we found that herbivory altered the microbiome of only one of the two assessed genotypes, genotype Sp65, which in the outdoors experimental evolution ponds increased in frequency under the herbivory group. This suggests that herbivory-induced changes in the microbiota are genotype-specific, and that the outcome might influence phenotypic plasticity. For instance, a previous study focusing on another duckweed species (<italic>Lemna minor</italic>) found that plant-associated microbial communities can alter plant phenotypes, and the magnitude of this effect varies across genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Although several microbial taxa were specifically altered by herbivory in Sp65, it remains unclear whether a particular bacterial taxa caused the observed changes in resistance.</p><p id="P18">One caveat of this study is that we included only four genotypes to represent the relatively low genetic variations found in natural populations of <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, which might limit the ability to generalize our findings to other systems that harbor more genetic variations. In contrast, populations with low genetic variation, such as many invasive species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, might still rapidly adapt to the new environment through the plasticity of phenotypic traits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. The extent to which our findings apply to populations with higher genetic variation remains to be tested in the future. It is also important to acknowledge that the model species we selected reproduces solely asexually, and while <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic> allowed us to provide strong evidence that induced responses can be subjected to selection in plant populations, this might limit the generalization of our results to a wider proportion of plant species that reproduce sexually.</p><p id="P19">Taken together, this study provides direct evidence supporting the long-standing hypothesis that herbivory-induced responses are under selection and contribute to rapid adaptive evolution in plant populations. We were able to observe the adaptive role of induced responses in a relatively short timeframe owing to the short generation time of the study species. Although we believe that our findings are also applicable to other organisms that have longer life cycles, future long-term outdoor evolution experiments are required to provide further experimental support.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Outdoor experimental evolution</title><p id="P20">We used an outdoor experimental evolution approach to study herbivory-driven evolution of plants.

Seven weeks before the beginning of the experiment, the water body from the previous season (in which we had grown the same four genotypes without snails) was thoroughly cleaned of all floating organic residues using a scoop. We added 40L of commercial potting soil (~ 100 mg/L each of organic N, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>O, ~160 mg/L Mg, pH (CaCl<sub>2</sub>)= 4.2, salts 1.0 g/L; Floragard, Germany), and 550 mL of commercial liquid fertilizer (organic NPK 3.1-0,5-4.1; COMPO BIO, Compo GmbH, Germany) to each pond to provide sufficient nutrients for plant growth throughout the season. To prevent algal growth, we covered the ponds with white foil. A few days before beginning the experiment, we removed the covering foil and approximately 10% of the water body from each pond. The remaining water bodies were homogenized between all ponds, re-adding the removed 10% volume with tap water, thereby homogenizing the initial growing conditions between all replicates. Each pond was then divided into two compartments using two cages (105 (L) × 74 (W) × 44 (D) cm) with sides, and the bottom covered with a fine metal net (mesh 0.14 mm). Each pond was covered with a metal grid lined with a shading net, allowing for optimal growth conditions, and preventing large debris and small animals from falling inside the pond.</p><p id="P23">The experimental evolution of our plant populations was initiated on June 9<sup>th</sup>, 2021, by adding 500 fronds of each of the four <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic> genotypes to each cage, resulting in a mix of 2000 individuals per cage, referred to as mixed genotypes. Thus, each pond served as a paired unit to compare the effects of herbivory on the evolution of the aquatic plant populations. On the starting day of the experimental evolution, we collected 150 fronds of each genotype individually (in triplicate) for use as a reference to estimate the genotype frequencies (see below). We also measured the surface area and dry weight of 30 fronds of each genotype. In addition, we created artificially mixed populations using 500 fronds of each genotype, mixed them into a bucket, and sampled 400 fronds (in triplicate). This artificial mix (with three replicates) was later processed for pool-seq, and the data were used to normalize genotype frequencies to reduce sampling bias (see below).</p><p id="P24">We randomly assigned one cage to each pond as either a control (n = 10) or herbivory treatment (n = 10). Cages assigned to the herbivory treatment were inoculated with 12 snails (<italic>L. stagnalis,</italic> 18-22 mm shell length), gradually added to groups of four over a period of three weeks to avoid the issue that adding them together would lead to the collapse of the entire plant population. Snail populations were allowed to propagate freely within herbivory cages for over two years. The entire experiment lasted 58 weeks (approximately 60 asexual generations of <italic>S. polyrhiza),</italic> including two summer seasons and one winter season. During the winter season, some of <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic> fronds remained on the water surface, and some of the fronds formed turions that sunk to the bottom (partly re-emerged during the following spring).</p><p id="P25">To test the indirect effects of herbivory on the resistance to herbivores and microbiome of individual genotypes <italic>in situ,</italic> we added four floating boxes (11.5 (L) × 11.5 (W) × 7.5 (D) cm, framed with Styrofoam, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) to each cage on June 9<sup>th</sup>, 2021. Floating boxes had a fine metal net at the bottom to prevent herbivore to feed, but allowed nutrients and phytoplankton communities to pass through. Each box received 150 fronds of one of the four genotypes, referred to as single genotypes.</p><p id="P26">To test whether herbivory influenced the morphology (surface area and dry weight), genotype frequency, microbiome, and metabolites of the <italic>S. polyrhiza</italic> mixed populations, we sampled fronds from cages after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of experimental evolution. Two sets of 500 undamaged fronds were collected from each cage. Each set was used to measure the surface area per frond and dry weight and was processed for (i) pool-seq or (ii) metabolite analysis (see below). We continued sampling in the second season (2022) from the mixed population at weeks 42, 46, 50, 55, and 58 to test the robustness of herbivory-associated changes in plant morphology. The samples collected from week 58 were also used for metabolite analyses.

To this end, we reduced the number of previously grown fronds to 100 in each floating box and added a single snail (from our laboratory population) that had been starved in the respective pond water for 24 h before starting the herbivore assay (total n=10 per genotype and treatment, respectively). After 24 h of herbivory, all snails were removed, and all undamaged fronds were collected, counted, photographed to estimate the surface area, and freeze-dried to measure their dry weight.

Fronds were allowed to grow in floating boxes (screened for herbivores) for 10 days. All fronds were harvested, counted, photographed to estimate the surface area, and freeze-dried to measure the dry weight. The relative changes in frond biomass and area were estimated by permutation (<italic>n</italic> = 999) using data from mixed-population monitoring (see above) before the beginning of this bioassay.

Then, we tested this pipeline on the samples where we mixed fronds from each genotype in equal numbers, and we found that the relative abundance of individual genotypes was different from 25 % each.

Given that the sampling itself might have added an error in the frequency estimates, we used reference samples (where we mixed an equal number of fronds from each genotype and then mixed them before subsampling) to calibrate the genotype frequencies for the experimental samples.
