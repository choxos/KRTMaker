CNS drug candidates often show promising results in all stages of preclinical tests, but fail in human clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kesselheim et al., 2015</xref>). The low success rate in clinical trials shows that current preclinical CNS drug testing systems are not suitable to efficiently screen for new candidate molecules. Animal models, which are widely used in preclinical tests, often lack predictive value of efficacy in humans and fail to recapitulate relevant CNS disease phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gribkoff and Kaczmarek, 2017</xref>). There is a clear need for the development of versatile <italic>in vitro</italic> test platforms incorporating relevant, disease-specific CNS cells, along with a suitable functional readout to identify effective drug candidates. A potential approach to build such a drug testing platform is to use the technical tools recently developed in the field of “bottom-up” neuroscience, in combination with disease-relevant cell types such as human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. Bottom-up neuroscience focuses on building and studying elementary circuits of neurons to infer the principles of more complex assemblies, with the main goal of getting a better understanding of the mechanisms behind information processing in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aebersold et al., 2016</xref>). Bottom-up neuroscience tools allow to build multiple, topologically-controlled circuits of tens to hundreds of neurons, which can be electrically stimulated and recorded from in parallel using microelectrode arrays (MEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Forró et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Ihle et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Duru et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Girardin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Besides the more and more refined technological tools to engineer <italic>in vitro</italic> neural networks, recent advances in the field of human iPSCs are another promising step towards improving drug testing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Xu and Zhong, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Little et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Farkhondeh et al., 2019</xref>). iPSC-derived neurons are a scalable source of genetically relevant cells for <italic>in vitro</italic> models. They can potentially replace the cells of animal origin, which are often poor predictors of efficacy and adverse side effects in humans. Networks of randomly connected iPSC-derived neurons have also been grown on MEAs to characterize their electrical activity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Keller and Frega (2019)</xref>), for example in neurotoxicity testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kasteel and Westerink, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Tukker et al., 2018</xref>) and to study neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Mossink et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Several CNS drug screening platforms based on iPSC-derived neurons have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ahfeldt et al., 2017</xref>), but they usually rely exclusively on imaging assays. For example, two platforms based on random iPSC-derived neurons could successfully be used to identify Alzheimer’s disease drug candidates, using an imaging-based quantification of tau aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Medda et al., 2016</xref>) and of amyloid beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kondo et al., 2017</xref>). A few platforms tailored to other neurological diseases have been reported, such as the use of iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons for Parkinson’s disease drug screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Moreno et al., 2015</xref>) or the use of iPSC-derived motoneurons with the potential to be used to study amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Mo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wainger et al., 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Fantuzzo et al. (2020)</xref> developed a platform based on a 96-well plate, where each well is divided into two compartments. Compartments were seeded with excitatory and inhibitory iPSC-derived neurons. Electrical activity was screened using calcium imaging. While calcium imaging can provide relevant information for functional screenings, an advantage of MEAs is the possibility to electrically stimulate the neuronal cultures, giving access to information-rich readouts. MEAs can also record the extracellular neural activity of a culture at multiple locations with higher temporal resolution. MEAs are particularly suitable for drug discovery, because repeated measurements can be performed on the same array over time, for example to measure the effect of adding a pharmacological molecule on the spontaneous and stimulation-induced electrical activity of a cultured network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Johnstone et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P5">A reliable, fast, and efficient method to differentiate human iPSCs into neurons is through the overexpression of the gene neurogenin-2 (NGN2) as first reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Zhang et al. (2013)</xref>. Human iPSC-derived neurons obtained through the overexpression of NGN2, termed “induced” neurons or iNeurons, mostly exhibit properties typical of excitatory cortical neurons. However, compared to primary neurons of animal origin, human iPSC-derived neurons often suffer from poor survival after differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). In spite of this challenge, human NGN2 iNeurons have been successfully used with bottom-up neuroscience tools to build in <italic>vitro</italic> circuits composed of very few cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Girardin et al., 2022</xref>). Human NGN2 iNeurons are routinely co-cultured with mice or rat primary astrocytes to support their maturation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Frega et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fernandopulle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Rhee et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Astrocytes have received a lot of scientific attention in the past two decades thanks to a still growing body of evidence on the central roles that this glial cell type plays in brain development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Chandrasekaran et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to ensuring homeostasis and providing metabolic support to neurons, astrocytes are also involved in the facilitation of synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Ullian et al., 2001</xref>), the regulation of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fields and Stevens-Graham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dallérac et al., 2013</xref>), and the clearance of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Weber and Barros, 2015</xref>). Dysfunctions of astrocytes contribute to the initiation and the propagation of many neurological diseases, while healthy astrocytes can help disease recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Verkhratsky et al., 2012</xref>). Besides astrocytes, primary glial cell preparations often contain microglia, another type of glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Uliasz et al., 2012</xref>). As the resident macrophages of the CNS, microglia play a key role in CNS disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Perry et al., 2010</xref>). Because of their prominent role in CNS diseases, we decided to integrate rat primary glial cells to our <italic>in vitro</italic> system and test their effect on human iNeurons.</p><p id="P7">Here we present the use of a versatile platform to build multiple small circuits of different ratios of human iNeurons and rat primary glial cells, initially seeded as either dissociated cells or spheroids. We compare cultures of dissociated cells to cells aggregated into spheroids, as three-dimensional (3D) culture systems have received a lot of interest for drug testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jensen and Teng, 2020</xref>). Spheroids consist of glial cells and neurons pre-assembled into spherical co-cultures using commercially available microwells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cvetkovic et al., 2018</xref>). We investigate the electrophysiological properties of such circuits, in particular their stimulation-evoked activity for more than 50 days in <italic>vitro</italic> (DIV). To show the potential of such a platform for drug testing, we evaluate the effect of the sequential addition of magnesium chloride to the cell medium. Our approach is highly versatile and provides the readout of neural activity with high signal-to-noise-ratio from 15 circuits in parallel. Furthermore, it is possible to measure the response to electrical stimulation over weeks or even months. We believe that such a system has the potential to be used for screening pharmacological compounds in the early stages of drug discovery.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>PDMS microstructures</title><p id="P8">Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microstructures were based on a previously published design and prepared as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Girardin et al.

Importantly, the primary glia cultures had to be neuron-free to avoid seeding rat neurons in the PDMS microstructures along with the glial cells. To verify this, we performed an immunofluorescent staining on a confluent culture of glial cells passaged once, using antibodies against MAP2 (a neuronal marker) and GFAP (an astrocyte marker), as well as the nucleus marker Hoechst.

In the Hoechst phase, the morphology of the nuclei of the two types of astrocytes is also clearly recognizable, with a rounder, smaller, and brighter nucleus for the star-shaped astrocytes, and a bigger, dimmer, and more oval nucleus for flat astrocytes. Some bright nuclei without a surrounding GFAP-positive region were also visible in the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, pink arrows).

These are mostly iNeurons which recovered poorly from the post-cryopreservation thawing process and died during the first week of culture. iNeuron survival at low densities in PDMS microstructures was extensively discussed in a previous work, where it was shown that despite the presence of dead cells, circuits of iNeurons can survive over months, form synapses and have stable neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Girardin et al., 2022</xref>). We did not investigate iNeuron survival again in the present work. Since the iNeurons-to-glia ratios “5:1” and “2:1” refer to the initially seeded ratios, the true iNeurons-to-glia ratio can deviate over time due to difference in viability of iNeurons and glial cells over the life cycle of a culture.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S34"><label>3.2</label><title>An antifouling coating is necessary to prevent axons from growing on top of the PDMS</title><p id="P43">We built circuits of human iNeurons and rat glial cells in PDMS microstructures at different ratios and with two different seeding modalities (as dissociated cells or as spheroids) and labeled them with a live-dead and nuclei stain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). While they could successfully be built, cultured over weeks and imaged, these circuits presented a major flaw: in addition to growing inside of the microchannels, axons also grew along the vertical walls of the PDMS nodes and onto the top surface of the PDMS microstructures. As a result, in less than a week, most of the 15 circuits of a microstructure ceased to be physically separated. This is not desirable, as it goes against the efforts of constraining the topology and compartmentalization of the neuronal circuits.</p><p id="P44">To prevent neurites from growing on top of the PDMS, the top surface of the microstructure can be coated with a neuron-repellent molecule. iNeurons can survive for months in PDMS microstructures. As we are interested in recording their electrical activity over several weeks, it is necessary to use a coating that is resistant over similar time spans. We thus selected the antifouling molecule PVP, which can be attached to the PDMS using a PAAm-<italic>g</italic>-PFPA adhesion layer, a surface functionalization method that was reported to be stable over several weeks when used in cultures of rat primary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Weydert et al., 2019</xref>). The long-term adhesion of the coating relies on the UV-sensitive molecule PFPA, an aromatic compound with an azide (N<sub>3</sub>) functional group. Upon exposure to UV-C light (254 nm), the azide group reacts with carbon double bonds, carbon rings, methyl groups, or amine groups, effectively forming covalent bonds with any organic molecule containing one of these groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Liu and Yan, 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P45">We thus used PAAm-g-PFPA/PVP (referred to as “PFPA-PVP” from now on) to coat the top surface of the PDMS microstructures. The PDMS was coated while located on a sacrificial glass slide, so that the bottom surface of the PDMS did not get functionalized and could still reliably adhere to the coverslip or MEA glass surface after coating. We compared the growth of axons on top of 12 PFPA-PVP coated PDMS microstructures and 12 non-coated PDMS microstructures. The samples were seeded with red fluorescent protein-expressing iNeurons (RFP iNeurons) and glial cells at an initial ratio of 5:1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref> show the top surface of a non-coated and of a PFPA-PVP coated PDMS microstructure after DIV 35, with the network of neurites visible in red. Such fluorescent images were taken every week for five weeks and used to assess the presence of axon growth on the top surface of the PDMS for each circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). In the non-coated microstructures, 80% of the circuits had axons growing on top at DIV 7 and 100% of them had axons on top at DIV 35. The slight decrease in axon overgrowth in non-coated samples between DIV 7 and DIV 13 is due to the fact that in the early days, the network of axons at the top of the PDMS is fragile and medium exchange is sometimes sufficient to disturb some of the axons.</p><p id="P46">The PFPA-PVP coating effectively prevented 90% of the growth at all timepoints, with a slight decrease of performance over time.

These were probably due to a non-perfect coating on the edges and to a rather thin microstructure edge (&lt; 100 μm). For the MEA experiments presented below, slightly thicker microstructures were used (120 μm) and care was given to properly coat also the edge of the microstructures.

The seeding ratio of neurons-to-glia of 2:1 was selected as it roughly corresponds to the ratio that is present in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">von Bartheld et al., 2016</xref>). Since only part of the initially seeded iNeurons survive, the ratio of 5:1 was picked as an intermediary point of comparison (16.7% of glia instead of 33.3% of glia).

Therefore, an example image of the spheroids in the microwells is shown before DIV2.</p><p id="P50">Several observations can be made from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>. First, the time needed for all four nodes to be connected by axons varies by condition: it takes 3 days for the dissociated iNeurons, 3 to 5 days for the 5:1 dissociated iNeurons-to-glia, more than 5 for the 2:1 dissociated iNeurons-to-glia, and more than 3 days for the spheroid conditions (counting from the day of seeding the spheroids into the PDMS microstructures). At DIV 3, the dissociated glia-containing circuits have a denser network of neurites inside a node, suggesting that at this stage neurites grow inside of the nodes more than along the microchannels. Dissociated iNeurons have less dense neurite growth inside of the nodes, but axons grow faster along the microchannels.</p><p id="P51">Second, comparing the phase contrast images over time and especially at DIV 50, lines appeared over time along the outline of the PDMS structure and the MEA tracks (an example is highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref> with a yellow arrow). This is likely due to the PDMS slightly detaching from the surface. Unlike the lines that appear over time, lines visible in early days phase contrast images (<italic>e.g.</italic> pink arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>) are mostly due to a previous use of the MEA. MEAs are typically reused across up to three experiments, but their PDMS structure is replaced with a new one every time. Removing the old PDMS structure might leave a thin residual layer on the MEA’s surface, which is then visible in the phase contrast images.</p><p id="P52">Third, there is a difference in the amount of dead cells visible between glia and non-glia circuits at later DIVs. On the phase-contrast images of the dissociated iNeurons and iNeuron spheroid circuits, there are many dead cells around and on top of the live cells at all DIVs (e.g. dark blue arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). In the glia-containing conditions, there are also a lot of dead cells in the nodes up to DIV 5, but most of them are gone at DIV 17 and 50 (e.g. light blue arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). The two nodes indicated by the blue arrows can be found in a zoomed-in version in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>. The removal of dead cells is likely due to the microglia present among the glial cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S32">Section 3.1.1</xref>). Microglia are immune cells, which can perform phagocytosis to remove necrotic cells. Most of the phagocytosis seems to have taken place between DIV 5 and DIV 17. At DIV 17 and 50, some vacuole-containing, large, flat cells are visible in some of the nodes of the glia-containing circuits (<italic>e.g.</italic> light green arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). This is a typical morphology for activated microglia <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Georgieva et al., 2018</xref>).

The glial cells spread around the node and the remaining iNeurons appear to sit on top of them.

Two additional observations can be made: in some circuits, axons inserted themselves under the PDMS; and the glia-containing spheroid circuits had fewer nodes with live iNeurons than the other four conditions. Neurites growing under the PDMS structures often led to a circuit not being compartmentalized anymore, causing it to have potential connections with its neighbor or to the cells located outside of the PDMS microstructures. We termed such circuits “non-independent” (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A and B</xref> for examples of independent and non-independent circuits). Images taken at DIV 50 were visually inspected to determine the percentage of independent circuits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>), as well as the percentage of circuits with at least one live iNeuron per node (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref>).</p><p id="P55">In non-independent circuits, axons could insert themselves and grow under the PDMS microstructures due to a compromised adhesion of the microstructure to the MEA. This happened in particular along the tracks of the electrodes of the MEA, as can for example be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>. The MEAs used in this work have titanium tracks embedded in a glass carrier substrate and are electrically isolated with a 500 nm layer of silicon nitride deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Multi Channel Systems, 2019</xref>). Due to the microfabrication process, the tracks are slightly protruding from the surface of the MEA, which is likely the reason why the PDMS microstructures showed poor adhesion around the tracks, leaving space for axons to insert themselves there.</p><p id="P56">The MEAs seeded with 2:1 iNeuron-glia spheroids mostly had non-independent circuits: only 13 out of 45 circuits (28.9%) did not get connected through axons growing under the PDMS. Two out of three samples had the PDMS microstructures detached over large portions, leading to all but a few of the circuits getting connected together (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6F</xref>). In the 5:1 iNeuron-glia spheroid samples, axons also grew under the PDMS in most circuits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6E</xref>), but this only resulted in connecting neighboring circuits in 20% of the circuits. In the 3 samples containing spheroids of only iNeurons, there were only a few cases of axons growing under the PDMS, most of which were located at the edge of the PDMS. In addition to the frequent PDMS lifting, glia-containing spheroids had more nodes with no live iNeurons than the other conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A</xref>).

Based on the observation of hundreds of images of single iNeurons growing in such structures, axons were reported to grow in the clockwise direction between the two nodes of a stomach-shaped circuit in 90.6% of the cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Girardin et al., 2022</xref>). As axons usually transmit action potentials from the axon initial segment to the post-synaptic terminals, controlling the direction of axon growth is expected to influence the main direction of action potential propagation in a network. We thus hypothesize that clockwise axon growth between the four nodes of a circuit should lead to action potentials predominantly propagating clockwise along the four electrodes of a circuit. We verified this hypothesis by analyzing the spike propagation along the electrodes of the circuits.</p><p id="P61">To analyze the direction of spike propagation in our circuits, we extracted the timestamps of the spikes detected on all four electrodes of each circuit during the weekly spontaneous activity recordings. Only independent and “closed” circuits, with an axon bundle passing on each of the four electrodes (visually assessed), were used in this analysis. Two consecutive spikes were considered to be related, if they were detected within 5 ms of each other on any of the pairs of electrodes in a circuit. Out of four electrodes, there are 16 possible combinations of pairs of “pre-electrode” (where the first spike is detected) and “post-electrode” (where the second spike is detected).

It is also likely that new synaptic connections form between nodes over time, leading to more complex networks.

Therefore, one set of stimuli consisted of 480 repeats of the stimulus on one electrode. Between two sets of stimuli, 30 sec of idle time was left for the circuit to settle.

The percentage of activity-inducing electrodes increases over time for all conditions. At all time points, the two glia-containing spheroid conditions have a lower percentage of activity-inducing electrodes than the iNeuron-only spheroids, which is consistent with their low percentage of spontaneously active electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>). For all conditions, the percentage of activity-inducing electrodes at DIV 49 is comparable to the percentage of spontaneously active electrodes at DIV 49 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A and B</xref>), but stimulation-induced activity has a later onset (between DIV 14 and 21) than spontaneous activity (between DIV 7 and 14). This is likely due to the fact that spontaneous activity can take place in immature circuits, but stimulation-induced activity is only sustained if functional synapses are present to propagate action potentials between the different neurons of a circuit.

Extracellular magnesium ion (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) concentration is known to affect neuronal excitability both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Due to its high charge density, Mg<sup>2+</sup> blocks cation channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Politi and Preston, 2003</xref>), which has two main effects.

Second, it impairs the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, in particular by blocking voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cuciureanu and Vink, 2011</xref>).

This was done for one MEA for each of our six culturing conditions.

It is possible that the glial cells, in particular the astrocytes, play a buffering or a protective role in the presence of elevated Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="S45"><label>3.5.2</label><title>Stimulation-induced activity</title><p id="P74">The stimulation-induced activity is also affected by the increase in extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>.

The glia-containing sample had a higher number of induced spikes at all concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. This was verified by quantifying the average number of stimulation-induced spikes over all the independent, activity-inducing electrodes of each of the 6 MEAs. Results can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 13C</xref>, with the empty circles representing the mean number of induced spikes after the final medium change. The post-magnesium recovered activity was lower than the initial activity for all conditions. Generally, the response to increased extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations followed a similar trend in the two iNeurons samples (dissociated and spheroid), in the two glia-containing dissociated samples (5:1 and 2:1), and in the two glia-containing spheroid samples (5:1 and 2:1). Measurements were performed over 3 days, recording from two samples per day.</p><p id="P75">In the two iNeuron samples and in the two glia-containing spheroid samples, the induced activity was almost fully suppressed with an extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration of 8.3 mM. In general, stimulating the neurons rather than merely recording their spontaneous activity shifted the threshold of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> necessary to shut down all electrical activity in the circuits. This is to be expected, since stimulation should elicit action potentials in the close proximity of the stimulated electrode at a much higher rate than when relying on spontaneous activity. Stimulation seems to partially overcome the magnesium-induced decrease in spontaneous activity. Consistent with what was observed in the spontaneous activity recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>), the presence of glial cells in the two spheroid samples made the cultures less sensitive to the presence of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> upon stimulation-induced activity. Overall, the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref> both support the hypothesis that the presence of glial cells decreases the sensitivity of the cultures to extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p id="P76">In the two dissociated glia-containing samples, spikes were still induced in the first few ms after stimulation even at the highest concentration of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> (10.81 mM), as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 13B</xref> and in the zoom-in of the first 20 ms of response after stimulus shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>. This suggests that in these samples, the presence of glial cells allows for sustained activity even at high Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. The spikes suppressed by the presence of increased Mg<sup>2+</sup> are the ‘late’ spikes, taking place later than 15 ms after the stimulus and likely mediated by synaptic connections between the neurons of a circuit. Synaptic transmission is blocked in the presence of high Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The ‘early’ spikes visible in the first 15 ms post-stimulus might either be a direct consequence of the stimulus, or rely on synaptic connections that are not fully inhibited by the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The dissociated glial-containing samples respond differently than the spheroid glial-containing samples to the presence of magnesium. The level of stimulation-induced activity was lower in the spheroid samples even without added Mg<sup>2+</sup> and the samples usually had more circuits with empty nodes, which might explain the observed differences.</p></sec><sec id="S46"><label>3.5.3</label><title>Comparing the spontaneous and stimulation-induced activities</title><p id="P77">The MFR is known to be sensitive to several environmental factors, such as a temperature or humidity change, moving the cultures, or differences in ionic concentrations. A culture left in the incubator for a few days will undergo medium evaporation, leading to a slightly increased ionic concentration. In general, the vulnerability of the MFR to environmental factors is a limitation of that measure. To inspect the stability of the MFR compared to the stimulation-induced activity, we sequentially measured the spontaneous and stimulation-induced activity in two samples after four medium changes and after addition of a small volume (5 μL) of ultrapure water and DMSO. Results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>. The spontaneous MFR was very sensitive to medium changes, with a coefficient of variation of around 45 %, whereas the stimulation-induced activity was more stable, with a coefficient of variation of about 11 %.

Primary cells might not be a suitable cell type to form spheroids. Therefore, replacing them with iPSC-derived astrocytes could improve the efficiency of the protocol. Better nutrient diffusion could be addressed by redesigning the PDMS microstructure to have larger node diameters (currently 170 μm) and wider microchannels (currently 10 μm) to allow for proper nutrient diffusion.

The tendency of iNeuron axons to grow to the top of the PDMS and to form networks of axons there, is an indication that they need more space.

Astrocytes were reported to accelerate the onset and number of synapses when co-cultured with iPSC-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). In our circuits, while the presence of glial cells did not have a visibly high impact on the onset of spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8C and D</xref>), it increased the stimulation-induced activity in dissociated circuits from 3 weeks in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>).

Finally, the presence of glial cells lowered the sensitivity of iNeurons to high extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>, suggesting that they may provide a buffering or a protective effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S59"><label>4.3</label><title>A platform with drug screening potential</title><p id="P89">This work provides a proof-of-concept that PDMS microstructure-constrained small circuits of neurons on MEAs can be used to test the effect of soluble compounds on the spiking activity of the circuits, which could in turn be used for drug screening applications. The compatibility of the platform with imaging assays such as live-dead staining would also allow to test for the toxicity of a molecule added to the culture. Here we discuss how the PDMS microstructure-constrained circuits compare to random networks, the potential of spheroids for drug screening applications, and the use of stimulation-induced activity as a readout.</p><sec id="S60"><label>4.3.1</label><title>PDMS-constrained networks vs random networks</title><p id="P90"><italic>In vitro</italic> random networks of neurons have been used in combination with MEAs for drug screening applications, in particular using multi-well MEAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). We propose to use PDMS microstructures to constrain neurons into small networks, as this approach presents several advantages compared to random networks of neurons. First, there is no cell detachment over time and circuits are stable over months. This gives the possibility to use the platform with cell types that need time to mature, <italic>e.g.</italic> to recapitulate disease-specific phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Odawara et al., 2016</xref>). Second, the microchannels improve the electrical recordings, which have high signal-to-noise ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">FitzGerald et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pan et al., 2014</xref>) and can be linked to the group of neurons from which they arose. The electrical stimulation is also specifically targeted to the bundle of axons located on top of the electrodes, giving the possibility to measure specific stimulation-evoked responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>). Third, medium can be changed with relatively little disturbance to cells compared to random cultures, as they are protected from turbulent flow by the thickness of the PDMS microstructures. With a diameter of 170 μm and a height of 120 μm, each node contains roughly 2.7 nL. The cell medium volume used in a typical MEA is 1 mL. Upon complete medium change, the entire medium is aspirated from the MEA, except for a thin film of liquid of a few μL. In comparison, the volume left in the nodes is negligible. Overall, we estimate that a careful medium change should allow for a rapid dilution of at least 1:1000 of the compound added to the medium, while leaving the circuits mostly undisturbed. Fourth, unlike in random cultures, a very small number of cells is needed to build circuits, making it compatible with the use of rare or expensive cell types, as long as survival at low cell density is possible. Each sample is composed of 15 circuits produced under similar conditions, which allows to compare parallel repeats of the circuits. The main disadvantage of the PDMS microstructure platform compared to a multi-well MEA is its lower throughput. Given the advantages presented with regards to random cultures, but considering the lower throughput in comparison with multi-well MEAs, the platform could for example be used in combination with drugs that were found to have an effect on neural cultures on multi-well MEAs, in order to study the compounds in more detail.</p></sec><sec id="S61"><label>4.3.2</label><title>Spheroids</title><p id="P91">Given the interest in 3D systems for drug testing, we hypothesized that the use of spheroids in our platform would be a better approach than the use of dissociated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jensen and Teng, 2020</xref>). We expected functional differences between dissociated and spheroid conditions, as spheroids should allow for cell-cell interactions that are normally more constrained in 2D cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cvetkovic et al., 2018</xref>). However, the conclusiveness of the results obtained with spheroids is limited. As mentioned in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S52">Section 4.1.4</xref>, the iNeuron/glia spheroid protocol needs to be improved, as the spheroids did not retain their shape and showed poor viability. In contrast, the iNeuron spheroids kept their spheroidal shape throughout the 8 weeks of culturing. However, they did not present very different electrical characteristics from dissociated iNeurons. Our results indicate that more work is needed to find a proper culture protocol for iNeuron/glia spheroids in PDMS microstructures and that dissociated cells might be a sufficient model for the use of the system in early phases of drug screening.</p></sec><sec id="S62"><label>4.3.3</label><title>Stimulation-induced activity as a readout</title><p id="P92">Using stimulation to induce activity at a controlled rate is a more reliable readout system than relying on spontaneous action potentials. The presence of spontaneously recurring spike sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9C</xref>) suggests defined connection paths between the neurons in our circular networks. Using stimulation to induce activity increases the occurrence of such recurring spike sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>). In addition, a compound can be added to the medium at a precise concentration to measure its effect on the stimulation-induced responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 13</xref>). Finally, our data suggests that stimulation-induced activity is more stable and consistent over time and contains more information compared to spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S46">Section 3.5.3</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S63"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions And Outlook</title><p id="P93">In this work, we built upon the existing reports of a versatile and modular PDMS-based platform for bottom-up neuroscience research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Forró et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Ihle et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Girardin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Duru et al., 2022</xref>). We further demonstrate the versatility of the platform to build circuits of different ratios of human iNeurons and rat primary glial cells, initially seeded as either dissociated cells or spheroids, which can be cultured, imaged, and electrically monitored for more than 50 DIV. As a proof-of-concept for the use of such a platform for pharmacological molecule screening, we evaluated the effect of the sequential addition of magnesium chloride on the spontaneous and stimulation-induced electrical activity of the different types of circuits. Because it is compatible with iPSC-derived neurons, the platform could be used with patient-derived cells or with neurons genetically engineered to recapitulate a disease phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Xu and Zhong, 2013</xref>). Instead of primary glial cells, astrocytes of human origin, such as iPSC-derived astrocytes or primary human astrocytes, could be used.</p><p id="P94">While the results obtained are promising, several developments are still needed to make this platform compatible with early drug discovery. In particular, the platform should allow for higher throughput, be interfaced with medium-exchange pumps, and a set of data analysis tools should be developed to further analyze the stimulation-induced activity. The current throughput is limited by the 15 circuits per MEA. Therefore, MEAs with a higher number of electrodes should be considered. Adding a perfusion system to the MEA would allow continuous and controlled addition of molecules to the medium, which should minimize the effects of external factors such as MEA transport and temperature changes on the stimulation-induced activity. In addition, a perfusion system would enable automatized medium change and uninterrupted long-term recordings. Finally, the collected stimulation-induced data is rich in information, but the tools to analyze such data are lacking. The magnesium ions used in the present work have comparatively large and non-specific effects on the networks’ electrical activity, and are thus easy to detect. An automated band detection algorithm would increase the sensitivity of our model system to lower concentrations and thereby also to more specific effector molecules that only target a certain subtype of ion channels.</p><p id="P95">When all of these aspects are integrated into the platform, it should be possible to elicit and subsequently classify characteristic concentration-dependent effects of molecules based on their known mode-of-action (e.g. NMDA receptors antagonists and AMPA receptors antagonists). New molecules could then be classified based on their effect on the networks response behavior and thereby predict the molecular</p><p id="P96">targets. Overall, the system presented here has the potential to become a drug-testing platform to find new molecules of interest for the treatment of neurological diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS156793-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d98aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S64"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Thank you to Sean Weaver for advice regarding cell culture and microscopy, as well as to Sinéad Connolly for proof-reading the manuscript.</p><sec id="S65"><title>Funding</title><p>ETH Zurich, the Swiss National Science Foundation, the Swiss Data Science Center, the FreeNovation grant, the Human Frontier Science Program, and the OPO Foundation are acknowledged for financial support.</p></sec></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="conflict"><p id="P97"><bold>Conflict of Interest Statement</bold></p><p id="P98">The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></fn><fn id="FN2" fn-type="con"><p id="P99"><bold>Author COntributions</bold></p><p id="P100">SG and JV designed the research project, with inputs from SJI, JD and TR.

The PDMS microstructure is a 120 μm thick membrane containing 15 circuits. A circuit consists of four nodes (blue) connected by microchannels (orange). Nodes are cylindrical holes with a diameter of 170 μm. Microchannels are 4 μm-high to prevent soma from migrating into them, while still allowing axons to grow in them. <bold>(B)</bold> The microchannels of the PDMS microstructure can be aligned on top of a 60-electrode MEA, allowing to record from and stimulate the bundle of axons passing on top of the electrodes. <bold>(C)</bold> Two different seeding modalities were used in the present work: dissociated cells (C) or spheroids (D). The type of cells seeded were either iNeurons (red) or a mixture of iNeurons and glial cells (green). To seed dissociated cells, glial cells were first pipetted into the nodes, followed by iNeurons. <bold>(D)</bold> Cells were left in non-adhesive microwells for two days to form spheroids, were then individually placed in the nodes by pushing them into the wells with a micro-knife. <italic>Schematics are not to scale</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156793-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Immunofluorescence staining of rat primary glial cell cultures.</title><p>Hoechst (cyan) stains nuclei, GFAP (green) stains astrocytes. ‘PC’: phase contrast (brightfield) images. <bold>(A)</bold> Representative image of the immunostained glia culture.
