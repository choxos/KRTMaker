The regulatory networks controlling c-di-GMP are generally complex and understudied. This is largely due to a lack of appropriate tools to monitor dynamic changes of c-di-GMP concentrations <italic>in vivo</italic> in a non-invasive manner. Here, we develop a genetically-encoded ratiometric c-di-GMP biosensor, called cdGreen2, by applying a powerful directed evolution approach based on iterative fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) under alternating c-di-GMP regimes. We demonstrate that cdGreen2 can robustly track c-di-GMP dynamics in live cells with ultra-high temporal resolution over multiple generations. To validate its exquisite diagnostic power, we utilize cdGreen2 to dissect the regulatory networks driving bimodal developmental programs in the environmental model organism <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and the human pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. These studies disclose the molecular determinants governing cell cycle-dependent c-di-GMP oscillations in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and surface-induced c-di-GMP asymmetry in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The sensitivity and versatility of cdGreen2 will help unveil c-di-GMP dynamics in a wide range of organisms with unprecedented temporal resolution. The simple, yet powerful design principles underlying cdGreen2 will serve as a blueprint for the development of similar, orthogonal biosensors for other signaling molecules, metabolites or antibiotics, paving the way to uncover the complex interplay of small molecule-based networks with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The ubiquitous second messenger c-di-GMP plays pivotal roles in many bacteria, regulating important behavioral and physiological processes like motility and virulence, or adherence to and growth on surfaces <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Importantly, accurate control of c-di-GMP was shown to be critical for the establishment of infections and the development of resilience against host-mediated stress and antibiotic therapy in several human pathogens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In most bacteria, regulatory networks controlling c-di-GMP are complex with a multitude of enzymes being responsible for the controlled synthesis and degradation of the signaling compound <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. For example, the opportunistic human pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> encodes 38 enzymes involved in the «make and break» of c-di-GMP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and in some phyla enzymes regulating c-di-GMP constitute more than 1% of the organism’s total protein repertoire <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. This makes the genetic dissection of the respective regulatory pathways and mechanisms challenging. Much of the information on c-di-GMP control and its role in bacterial physiology and behavior stems from extrapolations of genetic data, generally complemented with invasive biochemical assays providing snapshots of c-di-GMP at steady-state levels in bulk populations. However, such measurements do not provide single cell information and thus fail to visualize signaling heterogeneity in bacterial populations, to track cell cycle-dependent fluctuations in asynchronous populations, or to distinguish distinct c-di-GMP-mediated cell fates in bacterial communities. Advancing our mechanistic understanding of c-di-GMP signaling in bacteria thus requires genetically encoded biosensors that monitor dynamic changes of c-di-GMP levels in real-time and in individual cells in a non-invasive manner.</p><p id="P3">The strong interest in the availability of robust biosensors for c-di-GMP or other small molecules has inspired repeated attempts to develop such tools. However, available biosensors generally suffer from major drawbacks. Transcription- or translation-based reporters, although readily available, are generally not suitable for real-time measurements due to considerable temporal delays caused by expression, folding, maturation or stability of the reporters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. This limitation can be overcome by allosteric sensors operating on the posttranslational level. For instance, a recently described sensor based on bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) is suitable to measure steady-state levels of c-di-GMP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. However, the irreversible nature of reconstituting a functional fluorescent protein by BiFC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> precludes this tool from accurately measuring dynamic c-di-GMP fluctuations. More suitable biosensors that can potentially track changes in c-di-GMP levels in real time make use of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between two fluorescent proteins sandwiching a c-di-GMP-binding protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, or of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) where a ligand-binding protein is linked to a luciferase and a fluorescent protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. While FRET sensors can identify and monitor individual cells with different levels of c-di-GMP, they generally lack robustness and, so far, have not been shown to record dynamic changes of c-di-GMP over physiologically relevant time scales. In addition, FRET sensors generally suffer from limited dynamic ranges, making them highly susceptible to noise and imposing challenging downstream analysis procedures.</p><p id="P4">Given the lack of available tools to reliably report on c-di-GMP dynamics in real-time in individual cells, we set out to develop a novel biosensor that overcomes the above limitations and allows monitoring of c-di-GMP dynamics in a diverse range of bacteria by accessing several single-cell techniques, including live cell microscopy and flow cytometry. Starting from a scaffold comprising a circularly permuted enhanced green fluorescent protein (cpEGFP) sandwiched by c-di-GMP-binding domains, we applied a directed evolution-inspired approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, where c-di-GMP-responsive biosensors with increasing dynamic range and rapid binding kinetics were gradually selected by using iterative fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) under alternating c-di-GMP regimes. The resulting biosensor, termed cdGreen2, was benchmarked by dissecting the c-di-GMP regulatory networks of two model organisms, the environmental bacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and the human pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. The bimodal developmental program of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> generates a motile and planktonic swarmer (SW) cell and a sessile, surface-attached stalked (ST) cell. Cell differentiation was proposed to depend on precise and genetically hardwired oscillations of c-di-GMP that coordinate cell cycle progression with morphogenesis and behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Similarly, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> undergoes a surface-induced asymmetric program generating motile and sessile offspring to maximize surface colonization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Like in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, this program was postulated to be orchestrated by the asymmetric distribution of c-di-GMP during the initial cell divisions of surface adherent <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells. Using cdGreen2 to visualize c-di-GMP in individual cells, we largely corroborate these models and define the molecular mechanisms underlying the bimodal phenotypic specialization. We anticipate that cdGreen2 will become a standard molecular tool for the scientific community to dissect the function and mechanisms of c-di-GMP in a large variety of bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>Design and directed evolution of a biosensor for c-di-GMP</title><p id="P5">To develop a biosensor for c-di-GMP, we took advantage of the observation that the optical properties of the chromophore in GFP-derived fluorescent proteins are highly sensitive to the immediate microenvironment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We selected a circularly permutated EGFP (cpEGFP) where the N- and C-termini were engineered to be located close to the chromophore <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and fused the C-terminal c-di-GMP binding domain (CTD) of the transcription factor BldD (BldD<sup>CTD</sup>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> to both termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). BldD is monomeric in the absence of c-di-GMP, but homo-dimerizes in the presence of the ligand with two intercalated dimers of c-di-GMP bridging the BldD momomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). We rationalized that such fusion proteins could change fluorescence intensity upon c-di-GMP binding due to local perturbations around the chromophore. Because we presumed that maximal biosensor functionality would require optimizing the length and flexibility of the linkers connecting cpEGFP with the BldD protomers, we constructed a library of the cpEGFP-[BldD<sup>CTD</sup>]<sub>2</sub> fusion protein with randomized linker length and amino acid composition. This library was then transferred to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> “cdG tuner” strain AKS494 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), in which the concentration of c-di-GMP could be adjusted from &lt;50 nM to &gt;5 µM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Iterative fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) under alternating c-di-GMP high and low regimes was then used to enrich for functional biosensors displaying maximal differences in fluorescence intensity between the two c-di-GMP states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). This led to the isolation of a first-generation biosensor with an approximately three-fold change in fluorescent intensity when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells with low and high c-di-GMP concentrations, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Sequential cycles of linker optimization and selection (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref>) led to gradually improved versions of the biosensor, generating a final variant termed cdGreen with a more than ten-fold change in fluorescent intensity between high and low c-di-GMP states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Because single fluorescent protein biosensors (SFPBs) are intensiometric by design and their readout prone to naturally occurring variations of protein concentration <italic>in vivo</italic>, we sought to normalize c-di-GMP-mediated changes in fluorescence intensity by fusing the sensor to a reference fluorescent protein (FP). To avoid interference of the reference FP with biosensor functionality, we followed the recently developed “Matryoshka” approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> and inserted the mScarlet-I <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> reference FP in the loop connecting the original EGFP N- and C-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>). The resulting construct, termed cdGreen-Matry, retained its c-di-GMP sensitivity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>) and made it possible to normalize the c-di-GMP (cpEGFP) signal with the reference FP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>), thus effectively converting the initial intensiometric into a ratiometric biosensor.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>cdGreen is a ratiometric c-di-GMP biosensor with high ligand specificity and dynamic range</title><p id="P7">To demonstrate that the biosensor specifically responds to c-di-GMP, we interchanged the Arg and Asp residues of ligand-binding motif 2 in one of the BldD<sup>CTD</sup> protomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,g</xref>). These substitutions were previously shown to fully abrogate c-di-GMP binding in the context of full-length BldD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Accordingly, the mutant sensor failed to respond to c-di-GMP and displayed signals in agreement with the c-di-GMP state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h,i</xref>). To characterize our biosensors in more detail, we expressed and purified hexa-His tagged cdGreen and cdGreen-Matry to homogeneity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Purified cdGreen showed two major excitation peaks at 497 nm and 405 nm with corresponding emission maxima at 513 and 518 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Importantly, the addition of c-di-GMP strongly increased the excitation peak at 497 nm, but reduced the peak at 405 nm in a dose-dependent manner with concomitant changes of the corresponding emission peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). This inverse response of two major excitation peaks to c-di-GMP provides a ratiometric readout, a feature that is critical for <italic>in vivo</italic> applications as it provides an elegant means to internally normalize stochastic cell-to-cell variations of biosensor concentrations. cdGreen-Matry showed a similar c-di-GMP-dependent behavior, but a reduced response amplitude due to Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between its cpEGFP and mScarlet-I moieties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The dose-response curves recorded for cdGreen upon excitation at 497 nm and 405 nm and emission at 530 nm revealed sigmoidal monotonic behavior for both wavelengths with maximal fold changes of 12.0 and 5.0 and fitted K<sub>d</sub>s of 214 nM (95% CI: 210-217 nM; Hill slope = 2.30) and 225 nM (95% CI: 217-228 nM; Hill slope = -2.43), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The combined ratiometric readout also displayed a sigmoidal and monotonic behavior with a dynamic range of almost 70 and a fitted K<sub>d</sub> of 386 nM (95% CI: 381-391 nM; Hill slope: 3.31) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The response of purified cdGreen was specific to c-di-GMP, as none of the related nucleotides tested induced a response or caused interference with the ability of cdGreen to respond to c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Stoichiometric titration experiments revealed a plateau at a ratio of 2 c-di-GMP molecules per 1 molecule of protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). This is in line with the observation that BldD, although binding two intercalated c-di-GMP dimers in the fully functional state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>), is able to dimerize with only one c-di-GMP dimer bound <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments showed two consecutive binding events of c-di-GMP to cdGreen, likely corresponding to dimeric and tetrameric c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). These results demonstrated that cdGreen binds tetrameric c-di-GMP, but that one intercalated c-di-GMP dimer is sufficient to provoke the maximal biosensor response.</p><p id="P8">To test whether the ratiometric biosensor readout of c-di-GMP could also be used <italic>in vivo</italic>, we next expressed cdGreen in the <italic>E. coli</italic> “cdG tuner” strain AKS494 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) in c-di-GMP high and low conditions. Using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>) or live-cell imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e,f</xref>), signals were readily detected in the GFP/FITC emission channel upon excitation at 395-405 nm, with signal strengths anti-correlating with the GFP/FITC emission channel signals upon excitation with the standard GFP/FITC excitation wavelengths (470-488 nm). Thus, the ratio of emissions upon excitation with the two major excitation wavelengths can be used for sensor normalization <italic>in vivo</italic>. Excitation around 400 nm is routinely used for DAPI excitation and thus is a standard setting in most modern fluorescence microscopes and flow cytometry instruments, thus allowing the direct adoption of our novel c-di-GMP biosensor in many standard laboratory settings without the need of specialized equipment.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Isolation of cdGreen2, a dynamic and robust ratiometric c-di-GMP biosensor with rapid off kinetics</title><p id="P9">To evaluate the potential of cdGreen to read out dynamic changes of c-di-GMP <italic>in vivo</italic>, we next determined the dissociation rate constant (k<sub>off</sub>) using the “dissociation by dilution” method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). This revealed a k<sub>off</sub> of 1.98 × 10<sup>-3</sup> min<sup>-1</sup> (95% CI: 1.62-2.36 × 10<sup>-3</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>) corresponding to a half-life of 349 min (95% CI: 294-428 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Based on the experimentally determined k<sub>off</sub> and K<sub>d</sub> values, we calculated an association rate constant (k<sub>on</sub> = k<sub>off</sub> K<sub>d</sub><sup>-1</sup>) of around 9000 M<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>. Thus, although the dynamic range of cdGreen is exceptionally high, slow dissociation of c-di-GMP likely precludes dynamic measurements <italic>in vivo</italic>. To test this notion, we expressed cdGreen in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, an aquatic bacterium with a characteristic asymmetric division cycle that generates motile and sessile offspring. While levels of c-di-GMP are high in sessile stalked cells (ST), newborn swarmer cells (SW) experience a short trough of c-di-GMP during their motile phase, before c-di-GMP levels sharply rise again to drive morphogenesis back into sessile replication-competent ST cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. In line with the k<sub>off</sub> determined <italic>in vitro</italic>, cdGreen expressed in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> reported constant high levels of c-di-GMP and failed to reproduce its expected fluctuation during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). A signal corresponding to low c-di-GMP levels was observed when cdGreen was expressed in a <italic>C. crescentus</italic> mutant unable to produce this second messenger (NA1000 rcdG<sup>0</sup>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). This suggested that, while cdGreen is fully functional in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, it fails to report on the expected dynamic fluctuations of the second messenger, likely due to slow dissociation kinetics.</p><p id="P10">Because the affinity equilibrium dissociation constant K<sub>d</sub> directly relates to the dissociation and association rate constants k<sub>off</sub> and k<sub>on</sub> (via K<sub>d</sub> = k<sub>off</sub> k<sub>on</sub> <sup>-1</sup>), we reasoned that variants with lower binding affinities may show more rapid off kinetics. We thus generated mutant libraries with randomized amino acids at non-conserved positions in the immediate vicinity of residues involved in c-di-GMP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>) and subjected them to iterative FACS-based enrichment for variants that shift to the off state at higher c-di-GMP concentrations as compared to cdGreen (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref>). This gave rise to two variants, 2H12-Aff2 and 2H12-Aff8, both of which had Pro residues in position 2 of the RXXD ligand binding motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). We speculate that the Gln126Pro substitution repositions the key ligand-binding residues R125 and D128 in a way that c-di-GMP is bound less tightly compared to parental cdGreen. Because 2H12-Aff2 and 2H12-Aff8 failed to recapitulate expected c-di-GMP oscillations in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), we constructed additional cdGreen-based derivatives by combining substitutions isolated in 2H12-Aff2 and 2H12-Aff8 variants in one or both BldD<sup>CTD</sup> protomers. Variants were scored for their ability to visualize the anticipated differences in c-di-GMP concentration in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ST and SW cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This approach revealed a single sensor variant – termed cdGreen2 – harboring a RPAD motif 2 variant in both BldD<sup>CTD</sup> protomers that recapitulated the expected c-di-GMP oscillations over the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Cells expressing cdGreen2 displayed constantly high levels of c-di-GMP in their ST phase, while levels dropped in newborn SW cells for a period of 20-30 minutes, before reaching their original levels upon SW-to-ST cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Co-expression of cdGreen2 with a ST cell-specific marker (SpmX-mCherry) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> confirmed that the drop in c-di-GMP coincided with the motile SW stage of the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). Importantly, cdGreen2 allowed robust imaging of the expected cell cycle-dependent c-di-GMP fluctuations over several hours and generations without an apparent decrease in sensor performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Purified cdGreen2 showed spectral properties similar to parental cdGreen with two major excitation peaks at 497 nm and 405 nm with corresponding emission maxima at 513 and 518 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Addition of c-di-GMP increased the emission at 550 nm upon 497 nm excitation and concomitantly decreased the emission at 550 nm upon 405 nm excitation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>). Dose-response curves at 497 nm and 405 nm excitation with emission at 530 nm showed sigmoidal monotonic behavior with maximal fold changes of 8.2 and 2.2 and with fitted K<sub>d</sub>s of 1.24 µM (95% CI: 1.22-1.26 µM; Hill slope = 1.86) and 1.17 µM (95% CI: 1.12-1.21 µM; Hill slope = -2.07), respectively. The combined ratiometric readout displayed a sigmoidal and monotonic behavior with a maximal fold change of almost 20 and a fitted K<sub>d</sub> of 1.83 µM (95% CI: 1.81-1.85 µM; Hill slope: 1.98) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Stoichiometric titration experiments revealed a 2:1 ligand-to-protein ratio, similar to parental cdGreen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). Finally, “dissociation by dilution” experiments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref>) with purified cdGreen2 determined a dissociation rate constant (k<sub>off</sub>) of 0.50 min<sup>-1</sup> (95% CI: 0.49-0.52 min<sup>-1</sup>) corresponding to a half-life of 1.38 min (95% CI: 1.33-1.43 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). The calculated association rate constant (k<sub>on</sub> = k<sub>off</sub> K<sub>d</sub> <sup>-1</sup>) is around 400’000 M<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>. These kinetic values were largely confirmed by independent experiments globally fitting parameters based on association kinetics in the pseudo-first-order regime (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2e,f</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In line with the above, time-lapse microscopy of growing <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells expressing cdGreen2 at high temporal resolution (20-sec intervals) exposed a robust c-di-GMP trough period of about 20-30 minutes in differentiating SW cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h,i</xref>). Importantly, no photo-toxicity or bleaching effects were observed when cells were imaged with high temporal resolution for up to 24 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). This exceptional robustness likely relates to the overall signal strength of cdGreen2, allowing the use of ultra-short exposure in the fluorescent channels and reduced laser power during time lapse experiments.

Establishing c-di-GMP asymmetry requires the complete separation of the cellular compartments during cytokinesis.

A few rare cells that managed to escape FtsZ depletion, initiated cytokinesis and rapidly established c-di-GMP asymmetry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). Thus, the diguanylate cyclase PleD is dominant over PdeA when positioned in the same cellular compartment, with different cell fates ultimately being enforced by a checkpoint during cytokinesis.</p><p id="P14">Genetic evidence had suggested that levels of c-di-GMP are kept low in SW cells by PdeA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> and by the phosphatase PleC, which retains PleD in its inactive, unphosphorylated state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>).

However, the observation that c-di-GMP levels in SW and ST cell progeny were indistinguishable in the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) indicated that PleD and DgcB are the principal drivers of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> asymmetry.</p><p id="P15">As <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cells transit from G1 into S phase, c-di-GMP levels gradually increase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> after PleD is activated by phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> and PdeA is proteolytically removed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. This leads to a series of accurately timed events prompting exit from G1, SW-to-ST cell morphogenesis and entry into S phase.

We have recently uncovered a sophisticated asymmetric program termed “touch-seed-and-go” that allows <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to effectively colonize surfaces <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We had proposed that upon surface contact <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> senses mechanical cues with its polar rotary flagellar motor and, in response, triggers a rapid upshift of c-di-GMP to stimulate surface attachment via the production of adhesive Type IV pili <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Surface attached cells then undergo an asymmetric division, generating an offspring that retains high levels of c-di-GMP and remains surface-associated, and an offspring that reduces its internal c-di-GMP to regain motility and to explore more distant sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The reduction of c-di-GMP in one offspring relies on the activity of the phosphodiesterase Pch, which associates with the chemotaxis machinery at the flagellated pole <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Using a codon-adapted version of cdGreen2, called cdGreen2.1, we scrutinized the proposed <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> surface colonization model. Because autofluorescence in the violet excitation range under certain growth conditions of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> complicates internal normalization using the 405 nm excitation peak, we additionally included a transcriptionally coupled reference FP (mScarlet-I) in the construct expressing cdGreen2.1 for normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Using cdGreen2.1, c-di-GMP was readily detected in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PAO1 grown on LB agarose pads. As predicted by the “touch-seed-and-go” model, the first few division events on surface generated offspring with asymmetric c-di-GMP distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). This was followed by a gradual increase of c-di-GMP heterogeneity with an increasing fraction of newborn cells adopting a low c-di-GMP state, arguing that genetic and environmental factors gradually influence the c-di-GMP program upon surface colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). A strain lacking the phosphodiesterase Pch had lost its asymmetry, displaying uniformly high concentrations of c-di-GMP for an extended period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b,d</xref>).

Here, we developed two single-fluorescent protein-based biosensors, cdGreen and cdGreen2, with exceptionally large dynamic ranges of up to 70-fold. cdGreen is very useful for robust steady-state measurements in the nanomolar range. By developing cdGreen2, we have remedied the slow dissociation rate of cdGreen, which rendered it inappropriate for the recording of dynamic c-di-GMP changes <italic>in vivo</italic> on short time scales. Compromising on the dynamic range only marginally, we achieved rapid off kinetics, such that c-di-GMP fluctuations can be studied on physiologically relevant time scales.

Importantly, the spectral properties of the sensors are compatible with most standard microscopy and flow cytometry setups, providing for ready adaptation and usage in most laboratories without the need to purchase specialized equipment.

The gates for high and low fluorescence were defined as containing the top or bottom, respectively, 1-5% of the main GFP distribution.

This IPTG regime was chosen to enrich for cdGreen variants that would “turn off” at intermediate c-di-GMP concentrations, i.e. at higher c-di-GMP concentrations compared to the original biosensor, with the expectation that such variants would display a lower K<sub>d</sub>, possibly due to faster off kinetics.

Signals for the cdG sensor were acquired using 395/25 nm and 470/24 nm excitation filters and a 515/30 nm emission filter. mScarlet was imaged using 575/25 nm excitation and 632/30 nm emission filters. Cells were imaged within 15 min after spotting on agarose pads.

Subsequently, cells were segmented and tracked using the DeLTA 2.0 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup> deep-learning based pipeline. For <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> we used the default pre-trained model for both segmentation and tracking. For <italic>C. crescentus</italic> we retrained the segmentation model using our own training data (the default tracking model was used). Training data was obtained by segmenting cells using the Ilastik pixel classification pipeline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>, followed by postprocessing using custom written Python code, and manually curation using Napari (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zenodo.org/record/3555620">https://zenodo.org/record/3555620</ext-link>). Further data analysis was performed using custom written Python code (available here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/simonvanvliet/cdg_dynamics_caulobacter">https://github.com/simonvanvliet/cdg_dynamics_caulobacter</ext-link>). Visual inspection of the processed data showed that segmentation errors were extremely rare, but tracking errors occurred regularly, especially at later time points. We therefore implemented and automated screening method to filter out erroneous cell tracks. Specifically, we only included pairs of sister cells which were both tracked for at least 12 frames (1h) for <italic>C. crescentus</italic> or 8 frames (40 min) for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. We only consider frames where data for both sister cells was available (i.e., the track of the longest-lived sister was trimmed to the same length of the shortest-lived sister). Moreover, we excluded pairs were one or both cells showed unexpectedly large jumps in cell length between two frames (a decrease of more than 8% or an increase of more than 8% (<italic>C. crescentus</italic>) or 12% (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>)). Finally, we excluded cell pairs where the summed length of the sister cells at birth deviated strongly (a decrease of more than 6% or an increase of more than 20%) from the cell length of the mother cell just before division. For the remaining pairs of cells, the cdG level was estimated as the mean fluorescent intensity in the GFP/FITC channel. We then grouped sister cells into two classes: the cdG-high and cdG-low class, based on the average cdG level over the full lifetime of the cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS155978-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_1.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d12aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figure 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS155978-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d12aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Figure 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS155978-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d12aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Figure 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS155978-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d12aAdEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Figure 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS155978-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_5.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d12aAdEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Figure 6</label><media xlink:href="EMS155978-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_6.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d12aAdEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplementary Movie 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS155978-supplement-Supplementary_Movie_1.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d12aAdEhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS155978-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d12aAdEiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Mark Buttner, David Savage, Attila Becskei, Johannes Schneider and Marek Basler for plasmids; Timothy Sharpe (Biophysics Core Facility, Biozentrum, University of Basel) for expertise support with ITC experiments and advice on stoichiometric titrations; Janine Bögli and Stella Stefanova (FACS Core Facility, Biozentrum, University of Basel) for their technical support with FACS; Raphael Dias Teixeira for preparation of illustrations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>; and Fabienne Hamburger for help with cloning and strain construction.
