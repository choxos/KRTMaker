and the cell-types in which they act. To infer these relationships in the human brain, we implemented Mendelian randomisation using single cell-type expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) as genetic anchors. Expression QTLs were mapped across 8 major cell-types in brain tissue exclusively ascertained from donors with no history of brain disease. We report evidence for a causal association between the change in expression of 118 genes and one or more of 16 brain phenotypes, revealing candidate targets for risk mitigation and opportunities for shared preventative therapeutic strategies. We highlight key causal genes for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease and for each, we report its cellular context and the therapeutic directionality required for risk mitigation. Our use of control samples establishes a new resource for the causal interpretation of GWAS risk alleles for human brain phenotypes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The average cost to bring a drug to market is $2.6 billion (2013 dollars)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Only 4% of drug-development programs yield licensed drugs due to two main issues: (a) preclinical experimental models are poorly predictive of eventual therapeutic efficacy and (b) definitive evidence of target validity is not obtained until randomised controlled trials (RCT) in late-stage drug development[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. The retrospective observation that drugs with genetic support for the target-indication pairing are more than twice as likely to be successful in clinical development has therefore focused attention on the potential for human genetics to predict successful new drugs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. However, translating genetic loci to therapies requires knowledge of the causal genes as well as the directionality of effect of a gene’s expression on disease risk in specific cell-types, which is rarely directly available from genetic analysis alone[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Here, we aimed to infer these causal relationships by implementing a principled approach to Mendelian randomisation (MR) using single cell-type expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) as genetic anchors. MR is a statistical framework for inferring causal associations using human observational data[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Instead of randomising subjects to drug exposure versus placebo to investigate the causal relation between an exposure and a health outcome, MR makes use of the naturally randomized allocation of genetic variants (SNPs) that instrument an exposure such as the level of expression of a gene[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P5">In the present study, we restricted our analysis to human brain single-cell gene expression data ascertained exclusively from donors with no history of brain disease and with normal appearances of the brain on neuropathological examination. Although brain tissue samples from people who have died with a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis are more widely available than control samples, the use of diseased brain tissue has the potential to confound the deconvolution of true forward causal effects from mere correlation due to biased anchoring of the causal inference in disease-induced gene expression changes rather than disease-causing ones (confounding by reverse causation)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. In contrast, our use of brain tissue that predates the onset of brain disease offers an opportunity to discover cell-type specific causal risk factors that are unconfounded by reverse causation and therefore modifiable drug targets for disease prevention. By focussing solely on control samples, we establish a new resource for the interpretation of GWAS-risk alleles on human brain phenotypes.</p><p id="P6">In addition to providing an improved level of certainty about the causal relation between a candidate drug target and a clinical outcome, the application of MR anchored in single cell-type eQTLs also provides estimates of the size and direction of the effect of an exposure on an outcome in a specific cell-type. These estimates are critical to designing the correct therapeutic intervention. Therefore, to enable a transparent assessment of our cell-type specific causal inferences we report our findings in line with the STROBE-MR guidelines for MR studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], including explicit reporting of the strength of the statistical evidence at each step.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Study overview</title><p id="P7">To study cell-type specific genetic effects on human brain structure, disease, and behaviour we utilized single-nuclei gene expression data (snRNA-seq) based on post-mortem brain tissue samples from 147 genotyped adult donors. Across all donors, there was no history of neurological or psychiatric disease prior to death, and no evidence for disease of the brain on neuropathological examination. Single cell-type Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis was implemented on this resource in three stages: (a) data generation and single cell-type eQTL mapping, (b) instrumental variable selection and assessment, (c) two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) (study design summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Data generation and single cell-type <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL mapping</title><p id="P8">After quality control, sample integration, cell-type annotation and genotype imputation, 577,115 single-cells across 128 subjects averaging 4,509 cells per donor were available for estimating allele-specific effects on gene expression in single cell-types (hereon referred to as single cell-type eQTLs). The 577,115 single cells across the sample set were aligned in a single graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and consisted of 219,942 excitatory neurons, 66,246 inhibitory neurons, 133,752 oligodendrocytes, 68,809 astrocytes, 30,086 microglia, 27,248 oligodendrocyte precursors, 17,144 endothelial cells and 13,888 pericytes (overview of snRNA-seq data characteristics in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To calculate cell-type specific eQTLs we generated pseudobulk gene expression matrices by aggregating read counts for each gene in each cell-type for each subject (Methods). <italic>cis-</italic>eQTLs were mapped using MatrixEQTL[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] for each SNP-gene pair in each cell-type using a <italic>cis</italic> window extending 1Mb either side of the gene per protocol and adjusting for age, sex, post-mortem interval, sample source and the first 40 principal components of gene expression as fixed covariates[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. In total, across the eight cell-types, 326,748 <italic>cis-</italic>eQTLs were identified at a study-wide False Discovery Rate (FDR) &lt;5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] corresponding to one or more regulatory SNP (eSNP) for 10,288 genes (eGenes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs.1c-d</xref>). Of these, 5,101 eGenes were unique to a single cell-type (illustrative examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs.1e-f</xref>). Across the set of single cell-type <italic>cis-</italic>eQTLs, we observed a high level of replication (71.3-83.6%, varying by cell-type) in a large independent <italic>cis-</italic>eQTL dataset derived from bulk brain tissue samples from 6,518 subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>](<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Instrumental variable selection</title><p id="P10">Valid genetic instruments for MR are underpinned by three core assumptions: They are associated with the exposure of interest (the relevance assumption); they only act via the measured exposure (the exclusion restriction assumption); there are no unmeasured confounders of the association between the genetic instrument and the outcome (the independence assumption)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p id="P11">To plausibly meet these assumptions, we took a principled approach to the selection of instrumental variables (IVs). As a first step, we assessed whether phenotypic outcomes and potential gene mediators might share one or more causal variants using colocalization analysis. COLOC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] is a method for genetic colocalization analysis that provides an estimate of the posterior probability of a shared signal between pairs of genetic association studies – in our case between a cell-type specific <italic>cis-</italic>eQTL (i.e., a SNP-gene pair in a particular cell-type) as one “trait”, and a SNP-phenotype association from a well-conducted GWAS as the second. We restricted the colocalization analysis to chromosomal regions containing a genome-wide significant association with the outcome in question (defined as a GWAS <italic>P</italic> &lt;5.0×10<sup>-8</sup>). Colocalization analysis was carried out across 23 human brain phenotypes and the resulting cell-type specific colocalizations are summarised for each outcome in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.3</xref>. As an illustrative example, we show the cell-type specific posterior probability of colocalizations (PP.H4&gt;0.5) with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2a</xref>. These reveal several genes in specific cell-types concordant with the known biology of AD such as <italic>PICALM</italic> (PP.H4 microglia = 0.99; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs.2b-c</xref>) and <italic>RIN3</italic> (PP.H4 microglia = 0.99)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], as well as genes with a previously proposed but less well-established link to AD such as <italic>SNX31</italic> (PP.H4 astrocytes = 0.99)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. In total, across all phenotypes, we identified 402 cell-type specific colocalizations with PP.H4&gt;0.5 (summary of the number of colocalised genes and cell-types for each brain phenotype in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2e</xref> respectively).</p><p id="P12">To select the specific IV SNPs for MR analysis we first retained only the colocalised regions with a posterior probability (PP.H4) &gt;0.5 for a shared causal signal, of which 76.5% mapped to a single cell-type. In line with the relevance assumption, we removed all SNPs in the colocalised region with a study-wide <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL FDR&gt;5%. We then identified the lead eQTL SNP in the colocalised region and removed all variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.01) with that SNP so as to minimise the risk of confounding by LD (i.e., confounding because the genetic variant is in LD with another variant that independently influences the outcome via an alternative unmeasured risk factor). For the retained SNPs, we then re-assessed the strength of the association between each instrumental SNP and its associated gene expression in a particular cell-type using the <italic>F</italic>-statistic[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Overall <italic>F-</italic>statistic distributions for each cell-type in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref> (IV-gene <italic>F-</italic>statistic range 16.9 - 233, median 29).</p><p id="P13">Following the above steps only a single SNP was retained as the selected IV for most (96.9%) gene/cell-type/outcome combinations. Less commonly encountered was the occurrence of &gt;1 IV for a particular gene/cell-type/outcome combination. For example, colocalization between a genome-wide significant chromosomal region on 5q35.3 for AD and <italic>cis-</italic>eQTLs for <italic>RASGEF1C</italic> in microglia identified 2,184 SNPs in the colocalised chromosomal region (PP.H4=0.87). Removal of SNPs with a <italic>cis-</italic>eQTL FDR &gt;5% followed by removal of SNPs in LD (r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.01) with the lead <italic>cis-</italic>eQTL eSNP resolved two independent IVs for <italic>RASGEF1C</italic> in microglia, namely: rs76792388 and rs10077711, with study-wide <italic>cis-</italic>eQTL FDRs of 2.40×10<sup>-4</sup> and 4.62×10<sup>-2</sup> respectively. In line with the MR assumptions, we considered each IV to independently instrument <italic>RASGEF1C</italic> expression and both IVs were combined in a single inverse-variance weighted (IVW) MR test to estimate the overall contribution of <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory control of <italic>RASGEF1C</italic> expression to AD risk (MR analysis detailed below).</p><p id="P14">In total, we identified 167 unique IV SNPs which, because a single IV may instrument the same gene across multiple cell-types and/or co-localise with multiple health outcomes, represented 262 IV-gene/cell-type/outcome combinations. Identifying the causal mechanism by which IVs instrument gene expression is challenging due to the multiple mechanisms by which genetic variants can have an effect on gene expression such as alteration of RNA splicing, disruption of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory enhancers or promoters etc as well as cell-type specific effects on gene regulation which are poorly annotated[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Moreover, from a drug target discovery perspective, the precise mechanism by which an IV influences a gene’s expression is less important for MR than the reliability of the association. Nevertheless, an understanding of the mechanisms of <italic>cis-</italic>regulation can add support to the SNP-gene association. We therefore assessed the IVs first using a cell-type agnostic repository of regulatory variants (SNP2TFBS) affecting predicted transcription factor binding sites[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. This revealed that 41/167 (24.6%) of the selected IVs are predicted to disrupt TF binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We then assessed the regulatory relationship between an IV and its paired gene in a particular cell-type using an external dataset of cell-type specific assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), H3K27ac ChIP-seq, H3K4me3 ChIP-seq and proximity ligation-assisted ChIP-seq (PLAC-seq)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Out of the 186 IV-gene/cell-type/outcome combinations mapping to one or more of the three cell-types for which data were available (neurons, microglia and oligodendrocytes), 40 (21.5%) intersected one or more epigenomic feature supporting the observed cell-type gene regulatory relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a</xref>). For example, for the microglial-specific IV-gene pair rs10792832-<italic>PICALM</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3b</xref>), which colocalises with AD, rs10792832 overlaps a microglial-specific enhancer marked by an H3K27ac peak, is connected to the promoter region of <italic>PICALM</italic> in microglia via a PLAC-seq loop and the PICALM promoter itself overlaps an H3K4me3 peak consistent it with being an active promoter in microglia. For the excitatory neuron-specific IV-gene pair rs1716183-<italic>OGFOD2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3c</xref>), which colocalises with schizophrenia (SCZ) and intelligence quotient (IQ), rs1716183 overlaps neuronal ATAC and H3K27ac peaks, interacts with the promoter of <italic>OGFOD2</italic> via a PLAC-seq loop in neurons, and the <italic>OGFOD2</italic> promoter overlaps a neuronal H3K4me3 peak.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Two-sample Mendelian randomisation</title><p id="P15">For each of the 262 IV-gene/cell-type/outcome combinations we assessed the relationship between the levels of expression of a gene in a particular cell-type with a clinical outcome using the package <italic>MendelianRandomisation</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Here, we used the cell-type specific effect sizes for the IV SNP-gene pair in question as the exposure and the SNP-phenotype effect size from the relevant GWAS as the outcome. In total, we found evidence consistent with a causal interpretation of the association between the levels of expression of a gene and a clinical outcome for 118 genes across 16 brain phenotypes (Summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4a</xref>). Of these, 21 genes were inferred to have a causal association to two or more phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4b</xref>), equating to a total of 149 gene-outcome associations across all phenotypes tested. Whilst there is no single standard by which to benchmark these causal inferences, across all 149 gene-outcome pairs inferred to have a causal association, we find that 132 (88.6%) are reported to have a target-disease association score &gt;0 by the Open Targets Consortium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4a</xref>).</p><p id="P16">In addition to inferring the causal relationship between genes, cell-types and health outcomes, the present study informs the directionality of the relationships unconfounded by disease-induced changes in gene expression. Knowledge of the directionality of the relationship between the level of expression of a gene and a clinical outcome is critical to informing the therapeutic strategy (i.e., target activation or inactivation), whilst knowledge of the relevant cell-type/s in which they act can inform more precise pre-clinical experimental validations. For example, among the genes inferred to be causal for AD, <italic>PICALM</italic>, encoding phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein was first associated with AD in 2009[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Currently, no drugs are reported to be in development targeting PICALM as a treatment or prevention strategy for AD[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Here, we associate increased <italic>PICALM</italic> expression in microglia with decreased risk of AD (MR <italic>P</italic>=3.03×10<sup>-36</sup>), a finding consistent with the pre-clinical evidence that a reduction in <italic>PICALM</italic> expression increases the development of both amyloid[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] and tau pathologies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Targeting PICALM as a single molecular entity therefore offers the potential to simultaneously modify both amyloid and tau pathologies as a preventative strategy for AD. Notably, of the 16 genes identified by MR in the present study as having a causal association with AD, seven are putatively involved in protein aggregation or trafficking (<italic>PICALM</italic>, <italic>RABEP1</italic>, <italic>SNX31</italic>, <italic>RIN3</italic>, <italic>PRSS36</italic>, <italic>NSF</italic> and <italic>MINDY2</italic>), suggesting the absence of drugs in clinical development targeting cellular protein metabolism is a gap in the AD drug development pipeline. Moreover, the MR evidence in support of these genes having a causal association with AD unites the amyloid and tau hypotheses of AD around a single proximal mechanism related to protein trafficking and aggregation.</p><p id="P17">As a further illustration of the translational value of directionality and cell-type context, we associate increased expression of <italic>GPNMB</italic> (encoding glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B) in astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) with an increased risk of Parkinson’s disease (PD) (MR <italic>P</italic>=3.01×10<sup>-6</sup> and <italic>P</italic>=1.68×10<sup>-8</sup> respectively). This directionality of effect was recently independently confirmed by the experimental demonstration that loss of GPNMB activity results in loss of cellular internalization of fibrillar alpha synuclein and reduced pathogenicity, confirming GPNMB inhibition as a candidate therapeutic strategy in PD[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Similarly, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was recently suggested as an AD risk gene following genomic fine mapping based on bulk brain-tissue <italic>cis-</italic>eQTL reference datasets[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Here, we explicitly associate decreased EGFR activity in astrocytes with a decreased risk of AD (MR <italic>P</italic>=1.70×10<sup>-7</sup>). This causal inference for <italic>EGFR</italic> is in keeping with EGFR’s known biological relationship to AD, where EGFR inhibition has been shown to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in different AD models via multiple mechanisms including a reduction in amyloid-beta/tau pathology and inhibition of reactive astrocytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. These findings highlight the potential for EGFR inhibition, including the use of new blood-brain barrier-penetrant EGFR inhibitors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], as a potential therapeutic strategy in AD.</p><p id="P18">As well as informing the therapeutic strategy, knowledge of the directionality of an exposure’s effect on an outcome can also inform new biological insights into the causal relationships between genes and phenotypes. For example, five schizophrenia (SCZ) genes (<italic>BTN3A2</italic>, <italic>FLOT1</italic>, <italic>KMT2E</italic>, <italic>OGFOD2</italic>, <italic>KMT5A</italic>) overlapped with intelligence (IQ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4b</xref>). For three out of these (<italic>BTN3A2</italic>, <italic>FLOT1</italic>, <italic>KMT2E</italic>), the directionality of the gene exposure on SCZ risk and IQ are in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.5a</xref>). The inverse relationship between SCZ and IQ for these genes may offer an explanation for the clinically observed monotonic relationship between IQ and SCZ – i.e., increasing risk of SCZ with decreasing IQ[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], and therefore targeting them may offer a route to simultaneously alleviating the cognitive deficit associated with SCZ whilst reducing risk of the disease itself. In contrast, where causal genes overlapped between SCZ and neuroticism (<italic>PCCB</italic>, <italic>FAM120AOS</italic>), the directionality of exposure effect on phenotype was in the same direction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.5b</xref>). The congruent direction of effect of <italic>PCCB</italic> and <italic>FAM120AOS</italic> on risk of SCZ and neuroticism may partially explain the clinically observed increased risk of SCZ with increasing pre-morbid neuroticism[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], and targeting these genes in SCZ may offer a route to alleviating a maladaptive personality trait associated with SCZ whilst mitigating disease risk. These observations highlight how a phenome-wide approach to single cell-type eQTL-based MR can begin to deconvolute the many complex causal relationships between traits that share overlapping heritability, and thereby improve our understanding of both biology and treatment strategies.</p><p id="P19">When considering the full set of phenotypes investigated in this study, we observed examples of causal associations across all cell-types of the brain studied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.5c</xref>), including the lowest abundant cell-types such as pericytes (e.g., multiple sclerosis (MS):<italic>HLA-B</italic>) and endothelial cells (e.g., MS:<italic>ZNHIT6</italic>). Notably, among the 149 gene-outcome combinations inferred to have a causal association, 105 (70.9%) were specific to a single cell-type, suggesting the majority of single gene risk factors for brain outcomes act via a single cell-type as previously observed for immune cell-types and autoimmune disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Conversely, for clinical outcomes for which multiple risk genes were identified, such as AD, no single cell-type accounted for all the observed heritable effects on phenotypic risk (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.6</xref>). In situations where the IV-gene pair was inferred to have a causal association with an outcome across more than one cell-type, in all cases the inferred directionality was concordant across the different cell-types.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Relationship of eQTLs to pQTLs</title><p id="P20">An implicit assumption in all gene expression studies is that transcript abundance is a valid proxy for protein abundance. A recent comparison of human brain protein QTLs (pQTLs) with eQTLs revealed that a majority pQTLs are also identified as eQTLs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], although due to lower mapping power for pQTLs not all eQTLs are identified as pQTLs. However, since (currently), proteins represent the dominant category of druggable targets, we assessed the extent to which the association of a clinical outcome with an exposure converges at both the level of transcript and protein abundance. To this end, we used an external dataset consisting of high-throughput mass spectrometry-based protein expression data from bulk-tissue post-mortem brain samples[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Across all 118 genes inferred to have a causal association with an outcome in our study, only 51 had a measurable protein expression value in this dataset. Of these 51, 26 had one or more <italic>cis-</italic>pQTL SNP at FDR &lt;5% and of these, 13 (50%) of our MR-inferred causal gene-outcome pairings were reproducible when considering proteins instrumented by either the same genetic variant or by a variant in high LD (r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4a</xref>). These results are consistent with the interpretation that for the human brain, causal effects estimated using single-cell snRNA-seq are a valid proxy of a protein’s effect on disease risk. Genes inferred to have a causal association with a clinical outcome at both the level of transcript and protein abundance, and with orthogonal published evidence to support a causal interpretation of the gene-trait association include (trait:gene): PD:<italic>GPNMB</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], AD:<italic>ADAM10</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] and AD.<italic>RABEP1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Causal genes identified by single cell-type MR identify drug repurposing opportunities</title><p id="P21">The identification of a causal gene in a specific cell-type is the first step in the development of a new therapy targeting disease risk. To facilitate this, we summarise the cell-type and therapeutic directionality required for risk mitigation for each gene inferred by MR to have a causal association with a brain outcome in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.6</xref>. In contrast to novel drug development, repurposing an existing drug can offer a more rapid route to clinical translation when there is reliable data supporting the target-disease pairing and where the directionality of effect between drug and exposure and between exposure and clinical outcome are known. To explore potential repurposing opportunities, we therefore investigated existing gene-drug interactions using the Drug-gene Interaction Database (DGIdb)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] and the Sear Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Of the 118 genes inferred to have a causal association with an outcome, 26 (22.0%) had a reported chemical interaction in DGIdb, and 58 (49.2%) in STITCH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). These chemical interactions offer a potential tool compound that can be used to experimentally explore the consequences of a drug intervention, or as a starting point for more refined chemistry. Of the drug-gene interactions with a potential for more immediate repurposing, the acid sensing ion channel-1 (encoded by <italic>ASIC1</italic>) was identified by MR as a significant (MR <italic>P</italic>=6.2x10<sup>-4</sup>) risk factor for SCZ associated with increased expression in oligodendrocytes, suggesting that drugs with a negative effect on ASIC1 currents could act to exert a mitigating effect on schizophrenia.

Single cell-type <italic>cis-</italic>eQTLs were integrated with GWAS loci in a Mendelian randomisation framework to infer causal genes and to identify the cell-types in which they act. In total, we identified 118 genes with MR evidence for a causal association between variation in their levels of expression and susceptibility to one or more brain outcomes. These genes include novel gene-outcome associations as well as genes previously proposed as candidate drug targets for brain disease. For genes with an appropriate measurable pQTL value, we observed a high level of reproducibility of targets identified using cell-type specific gene expression data consistent with causal effects estimated by snRNA-seq being a valid proxy of a protein’s effect on risk.</p><p id="P23">An important scientific advance of this work is our application of Mendelian randomisation to human brain tissue samples ascertained exclusively from subjects with no history of brain disease. Previous research exploring bi-directional effects between gene expression and disease have suggested that differentially expressed genes are more prone to reveal disease-induced gene expression changes rather than disease-causing ones[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Expression QTLs measured in diseased brain samples might therefore be unrepresentative of gene regulatory relationships in the pre-morbid brain. In contrast, the use of non-diseased control human brain samples in a principled Mendelian randomisation framework offers an approach, and a new biological resource, to uncover cell-type specific causal risk factors that are unconfounded by reverse causation and therefore modifiable drug targets for disease prevention.</p><p id="P24">Our sample size for <italic>cis-</italic>eQTL detection in single cell-types was limited by the substantial difficulties in ascertaining control brain tissue of appropriate quality given the predominant focus of brain banks on brain diseases such as PD, AD, MS etc. Despite these limitations, we report regulatory variants for 10,288 genes across eight cell-types. Future studies that include a larger number of control subjects and an increase in the number of sequenced cells per sample will provide a more granular picture of the role cellular sub-types play in disease aetiology and are likely to lead to additional causal inferences missed by the current study due to sample size limitations. Given the importance of effective target discovery for reducing the costly attrition of drug development in Phase II/III trials, this argues for a concerted global effort to collect control brains in addition to those from people who have died with a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis.</p><p id="P25">In addition to inferring causality, the present study provides information on the directionality of the association between a gene exposure and a phenotype in a specific cell-type. Knowledge of the direction of effect of an exposure on a health outcome is critical to guiding the directionality of the therapeutic intervention, whilst knowledge of the cell-types via which genes act can aid the design of more precise pre-clinical experiments that may translate better to the human condition. As well as informing therapeutic strategy, knowledge of the directionality of an exposure’s effect on an outcome from MR can also inform new biological insights into the causal relationships between phenotypes when undertaken in a phenome-wide manner as described here. Identification of such shared risk factors across disease categories present opportunities for shared preventative strategies, with a convergence of diverse stakeholders in therapy development hastening drug development. Additionally, as our knowledge of the relationship between existing drug targets and brain disease expands, so too will our ability to predict long-term adverse health effects from candidate therapeutic interventions.</p><p id="P26">In conclusion, we report a generalizable framework for the selection of genetic instruments and principled conduct of single-cell Mendelian randomisation regardless of starting tissue.

To do so, we downloaded the following interaction databases; DGIdb[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] STITCH[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], and OpenTargets[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. For STITCH, we downloaded the protein/chemical links dataset and kept all connections with a “combined score” of 0.9 and above (which is equivalent to the highest confidence of connections according to the STITCH guidelines), obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stitch.embl.de/">http://stitch.embl.de/</ext-link>. We converted protein ENSEMBL IDs using the <italic>biomaRt</italic> package[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]. For DGIdb, we downloaded the latest set of interactions (“interactions.tsv”, “genes.tsv” and “drugs.tsv” of February 2022), obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dgidb.org/downloads">https://www.dgidb.org/downloads</ext-link>. For OpenTargets, all data was downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://platform.opentargets.org/downloads">https://platform.opentargets.org/downloads</ext-link>. We performed two sets of analysis. First, we tested whether the MR genes in question were also putative targets for the trait analysed in OpenTargets. To do so, we downloaded the “Associations – direct (overall score)” dataset, which contains scores for putatively important risk genes. For our analysis, we intersected all genes with a score above 0. Secondly, we tested whether our targets had been previously used for therapeutic design. Hence, we downloaded the “Target” and “Drug” datasets to assess whether this was the case and matched these to our MR genes.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Processing of GWAS summary statistics</title><p id="P40">We standardised all GWAS studies to contain the following headers; “chr” for chromosome position, “pos” for a base-pair position, “rsid” for SNP id, “pval” for association p-value, “b” for the effect size, “se” for the standard error, “A1” for the effect allele, “A2” for the other allele and “MAF” for the minor allele frequency. In cases where the effect size was missing but the Z-score was available, we calculated the effect size (beta regression coefficient) and standard error using a previously described formula[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. When the Odds Ratio (OR) was included but not the effect size, we did a natural logarithmic conversion to obtain the effect size.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS157800-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d84aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the UKRI MRC (Award No: MR/S02638X/1, Award No: MR/W029790/1) and The Alan Turing Institute under the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council grant EP/N510129/1.

Summary of the number of colocalizations (PP.H4&gt;0.5) for each phenotype (SD: sleep duration; SCZ: schizophrenia; SCV: subcortical volume caudate; PD: Parkinson’s disease; NEUR: neuroticism; MS: multiple sclerosis; MDD: major depressive disorder; IQ: intelligence; INS: insomnia; ICV: intracranial volume; HV: hippocampal volume; FTD: Frontotemporal Dementia; EPI.GEN: genetic generalized epilepsy; BD: bipolar disorder; ADHD: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, AD: Alzheimer disease). Each cell-type/gene pair with PP.H4&gt;0.5 is reported - for example, LRRC37A has two colocalisations with AD, one in Excitatory Neurons and one in Inhibitory Neurons and therefore counts for two colocalisations. <bold>e</bold>.

Each row represents a gene-outcome pair in the indicated cell-type. For neurons, each gene-outcome pair is suffixed with the type of neuron the IV was colocalized in (InN for inhibitory, ExN for excitatory). The first three columns represent (from left to right) the intersection (solid square) between the IV for the indicated gene and an epigenetic feature in that cell-type annotated by ATAC-seq, H3K4me3 ChIP-seq or H3K27ac ChIP-seq. The “PLAC” column indicates whether the IV for the gene in question physically connects to the promoter region of the gene of interest via a PLAC-seq loop in the indicated cell-type. The SNP2TFBS column indicates whether the IV is predicted to disrupt transcription factor binding using the SNP2TFBS database. The H3K4me3.gene column indicates whether the promoter of the gene in question fell within a H3K4me3 ChIP-seq peak in the indicated cell-type. <bold>b.</bold> Genomic map indicating the location of the PICALM instrumental SNP (IV) rs10792832 overlapping a microglial-specific enhancer and connected to the PICALM promoter (red line) via a PLAC-seq loop. <bold>c.</bold> Genomic map indicating the location of the OFGOD2 IV rs1716183 overlapping a neuronal enhancer and connected to the OGFOD2 promoter (red line) via a PLAC-seq loop.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS157800-f003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Overview of Mendelian Randomisation results.</title><p><bold>a.</bold> Overview of gene-outcome pairs (here labelled with the clinical outcome first to allow causal inferences to be grouped by phenotype) with a significant Mendelian randomisation (MR) association in the indicated cell-type/s. “MR beta” refers to whether the beta coefficients for the IV SNP-gene and SNP-phenotype associations are positively or negatively correlated. A positive correlation can be interpreted as increased gene expression leads to increased outcome risk, whilst a negative correlation can be interpreted as increased gene expression leads to decreased disease risk (or vice versa). Grey squares (MS:<italic>HLA-A</italic>) indicate that the cell-types involved had opposite MR beta directions. Column “pQTL” – solid square indicates that the gene-outcome association at a transcriptional level was reproducible when considering proteins instrumented by the same genetic variant or by a variant in high LD (r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.8) (grey square indicates that the gene was not assessed in the pQTL dataset due to lack of data). Columns “STITCH” and “DGIdb” – solid square indicates that the protein product for the indicated gene interacts with a known chemical entity from the relevant database. Column “Open Targets” – solid square indicates that the gene-outcome pair have evidence for a target-indication association from the Open Targets Consortium. <bold>b.</bold> Histogram showing the number of genes with an MR-inferred causal association for the indicated phenotype. Genes with an inferred causal association to two or more phenotypes are shown by a solid vertical line connecting the phenotypes.
