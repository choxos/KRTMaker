Conductive nanowires were first observed in the Gram-negative <italic>Geobacter sulfurreducens</italic> (<italic>GS</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and have been identified across several phyla <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Microbial nanowires are thought to be part of the mechanism by which electrons are transported outside the cell, connecting their internal redox centres with external reductive or oxidative sources. In nature, these structures are used by heterogeneous and pure microbial communities to extend the distance of electrochemical interactions between cell-to-mineral and cell-to-cell connections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Their electrical properties have suggested uses as potential biological electronic material <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, based on conductivity comparable to synthetic metallic structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, non-toxicity, and ability to maintain these characteristics across varying environmental conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, the expression of conductive nanowires in heterologous hosts may provide opportunities in producing novel exoelectrogenic microbial chassis for bioelectrochemical systems applications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">However, the mechanism of electron transport and the identity of the proteins involved are less clearly understood. The term ‘Microbial Nanowires’ refers to conductive, extracellularly- projected filamentous protein assemblies produced by microorganisms to electrochemically communicate with their environment. These structures are thought to be comprised of either repeating subunits of a type- IV pilin monomer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, or polymerised cytochromes containing a stacked inner core of heme-ring structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Compelling evidence of both molecular identities has been demonstrated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and their specific protein composition has been hotly contested <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Indeed, it is feasible that <italic>GS</italic> produces multiple forms of extracellularly projected conductive proteins, in addition to the array of soluble mediator compounds and surface-bound redox-active proteins also shown to exist <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Nevertheless, extensive experimental evidence supports the type-IV pilin mechanistic model of conductivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, where nanowires are constituted of polymerised PilA subunits with aromatic amino acids located at specific positions, bringing overlapping π-π orbitals of neighbouring aromatic rings within the spatial distance to allow electron flux <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Replacing aromatic amino acids for the non-aromatic alanine produced the <italic>GS</italic> Aro-5 strain, with a diminished Fe (ii) oxide reduction ability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, alongside reduced pilus conductivity measured via atomic force microscopy (AFM) based current-voltage spectroscopy. In contrast, replacing native residues for tryptophan, which possesses a double aromatic ring, increased pilus conductivity by over 500% <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Type-IV pilin nanowires capable of electron transport have also been expressed in a range of heterologous bacterial hosts, both by expressing the entire <italic>GS</italic> PilA monomer sequence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> or modifying the aromatic content of native, nonconductive type-IV pili <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. So far, recombinant conductive nanowires have been achieved in <italic>GS</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup><italic>, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup><italic>, Shewanella Oneidensis</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, all Gram-negative bacteria possessing type-IV pili generally used for surface adherence and twitching motility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Providing further evidence of the relationship between aromaticity and pilus conductivity, a 2022 study also demonstrated the first example of a conductive protein based on the type-I pilus architecture of <italic>E. coli</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, via aromatic modification. These findings are difficult to align with the observation that the conductive filaments originally identified as pili were comprised of polymerised cytochromes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Conductive AFM (C-AFM) is the most frequently cited method for measuring the electrical properties of individual pili: with a range of methods to locate and image conductive filaments, including using a pilus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> or biofilm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> to bridge the gap between two electrodes, detached and purified pili deposited on a substratum <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and whole-cell AFM analysis of filaments directly protruding from cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, across these methodologies, no high-resolution images of the conductive data channel have been published to date. Instead, current-voltage spectroscopy is typically used to determine the conductivity and resistance of specific regions along the pili following the acquisition of an image of the sample topography. While these methods are useful to extract quantitative data on conductivity, it is debated whether extensive processing involved in sample preparation methods can cause the artificial polymerisation of individual monomers during precipitation and reconstitution, creating artefacts and synthetically modifying observed conductivities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">In contrast to the extensive reporting of current-voltage curves in the literature, to our knowledge, only a handful of studies have released C-AFM current maps of type-IV pili <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and to date, current data images of filaments emerging from intact cells have not been published. The first current data images of sheared pili deposited on a substratum were released in 2005 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, and other researchers have expanded this work via the visualisation of precipitated pili <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and drop- cast bacterial cultures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, although still without the wide-scale current data maps of intact conductive filaments directly emerging from cells. Such data is vital to address concerns regarding how the preparation of microbial nanowires affects their conductivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and has been achieved in other organisms and proteins. For example, high-resolution C-AFM images of conductive cable bacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and hippocampal neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> have been achieved, validating this technique as suitable to produce wide-scale conductive mapping of whole cells.</p><p id="P8">The reason for the lack of this type of data for conductive microbial nanowires, either pili or cytochrome- based, is unexplained, but likely attributable to technical difficulties in maintaining a balance between the spatial positioning of the AFM cantilever to capture electrical properties, while minimising sample damage or tip contamination. This is challenging to achieve using traditional contact-mode C-AFM, as the high lateral forces applied by dragging the cantilever across the surface frequently destroy biological samples. The use of PeakForce tunnelling atomic force microscopy (PeakForce TUNA<sup>™</sup>) overcomes this limitation by gently oscillating the cantilever (approx. 1kHz, 200nm amplitude) so that the tip intermittently contacts the sample surface during imaging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. This decreases the contact time between cantilever and sample, reducing damaging lateral forces and limiting adhesion of cellular material to the cantilever tip whilst allowing simultaneous measurement of topographic and electrical data within one field of view.</p><p id="P9">This study aims to address in more detail the hypothesis that type-IV pilus aromaticity contributes to filament conductivity. We do this by elucidating the structure-function relationship of pili, resolving the first high-resolution PeakForce TUNA AFM current data and correlating the electrochemical behaviour of conductive type-IV filaments in <italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> H16 <italic>(CN)</italic>, an industrially relevant facultative heterotroph <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, capable of oxidising a wide range of nutrient and energy sources, including CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> as the sole source of carbon and energy. Due to its metabolic versatility and the availability of genetic tools <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, this organism has been successfully engineered to produce several industrially relevant molecules, such as solvents, fuels, terpenes and biopolymers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, which makes this organism a promising candidate for microbial electrosynthesis using bioelectrochemical systems (BES), where the energy required for microbial growth and product synthesis can be derived from renewable electricity. We expressed conductive pili in <italic>CN</italic> via modification of its native type-IV pilus sequence, increasing its aromatic content. By showing these filaments directly emerging from intact bacterial cells, we identify structure-function relationships of the pili and demonstrate how the electron transfer efficiency can be modulated. This has implications for developing new bioelectronic materials and incorporating such bacteria into bioelectronics systems such as microbial fuel cells</p><p id="P10">In terms of the suitability of <italic>CN</italic> as a conductive pili expression host, it expresses a native type-IV PilA monomer structurally related to <italic>GS</italic> PilA, lacking aromatic amino acids in four key locations throughout the N- terminal α-helix. Our hypothesis predicts <italic>CN</italic>’s wild-type PilA to be non-conductive, given its aromatic content and distribution. Therefore, if pilus conductivity is attributable to aromatic content, replacing the native residues for aromatics at the same key locations present on the <italic>GS</italic> monomer should lead to an increase in <italic>CN</italic> PilA filament conductivity. Moreover, removing β-sheet regions to produce a PilA monomer comprised of only α-helix, is theorised to result in marginal conductivity increase by bringing aromatic residues to closer spatial distances when assembled into the major pilus ultrastructure.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Design of native <italic>CN</italic> PilA monomers with variable aromatics content and localisation</title><p id="P11">To establish the mechanism affecting pili conductivity, we initially sought to engineer <italic>CN</italic> native type-IV PilA monomers to be expressed as variants with an array of aromatic amino acid substitutions as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. <italic>CN</italic> PilA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) is structurally like that of <italic>PA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), <italic>GS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) and <italic>GM</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) but with a difference in chain length (<italic>CN</italic>= 161 AA, <italic>PA</italic>= 143 AA, <italic>GS</italic>= 61AA, <italic>GM</italic>= 59AA). Their N-terminus includes a short Sec signal recognition sequence, and it is structured as an α-helix comprising approximately 60 AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1li</xref>). The conductivity of <italic>GS</italic> and <italic>GM</italic> pili is thought to be attributable to the closer spatial positioning of aromatic residues along the monomer sequence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1li</xref>). The <italic>PA</italic> and <italic>CN</italic> monomers possess additional β-sheet and random coil regions which are not present in their counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1lii</xref>), and it is speculated that their influence on the nanowire ultrastructure may increase distances between aromatic residues, interfering with the electron flux. Previous research suggested that cleaving PilA monomers to include only α-helix domains can lead to an increase in conductivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">For this reason, all the modified pilA sequences (mPilA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-H</xref>) were truncated in their C-terminal: the mpilA sequence designated T80 was truncated from 100 to 80 AA residues leaving a portion of C- terminal β-sheet, and the sequence designated T61 was further truncated to a 61 AA length, leaving only the α-helix. PilA variant T61-Y is a derivative of T61 with three amino acid substitutions at R32Y, A51F, N57Y, while T61-W variant has three amino acid substitutions at R32W, A51W and N57W. We theorised that variants T80 and T61 will display a marginal-to non-existent conductivity, while the increased aromatic content of T61-Y and T61-W variants may show increased electron flux.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>CN</italic> strain engineering, cloning and expression of modified PilA nanowires</title><p id="P13">A <italic>CN</italic> H16 chassis with a knock-out of the native type-IV pilus monomer gene was generated as a background strain to avoid cross-reactions between the native and modified variants with the endogenous type-IV pili machinery.

Significantly, GS has achieved the highest current density generation thus far in MFC reactors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> and conductive nanowires are proposed to have a major role in their external electron transfer (EET) capabilities. However, exploiting their industrial useability is complicated by the challenging growth requirements of native hosts, and the debate over their molecular identity is one of the most contentious areas of microbiology.</p><p id="P21">This work offers two significant contributions. Firstly, we confirm the conductivity of microbial pilin proteins can be engineered via a combination of aromatic content and monomer secondary structure modification. The 200% conductivity increases observed in aromatic- modified PilA strains compared to WT are in line with other researchers’ findings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression of conductive type-IV pili nanowires affects the redox behaviour of recombinant <italic>C. necator</italic> strains, allowing bacterial cells to electrochemically interact with the environment with over 9-fold increases in oxidative peak current compared to the wild-type. Together, these findings provide compelling support for the hypothesis that conductive microbial nanowires are comprised of PilA proteins.</p><p id="P22">Importantly, the use of <italic>CN</italic> as a chassis for conductive nanowire expression presents further evidence which is hard to reconcile with the suggestion that polymerised cytochrome nanowires were originally misidentified as pili <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. A homology study conducted with a protein BLAST alignment against the <italic>CN</italic> H16 non-redundant protein database for the <italic>GS</italic> cytochromes and proteins putatively involved in EET (OmcZ, OmcS, OmcT, OmcE and OmcF), indicated no homology nor sequence similarity within the <italic>CN</italic> proteome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI, Table 4</xref>). Therefore, if conductive nanowires were indeed comprised of stacked OmcS subunits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, the detection of conductive filaments in our <italic>CN</italic> strains would have been highly unlikely, considering the absence of both proteins with similar binding sites for polymerisation and functional homologs in <italic>CN</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">Secondly, we present the first high-resolution Images which map the current of conductive surface-expressed protein nanowires emanating from intact bacterial cells. In contrast to previous C-AFM observations of pili, including PeakForce TUNA analysis conducted by the sampling of sheared or precipitated surface-expressed filaments, the limited processing and chemical treatment described in this work allows the visualisation and conductivity analysis of pili in conditions close to their native environment. Based on this analysis, we demonstrate that pili conductivity is not attributable to artefacts caused by chemical treatment.</p><p id="P24">The expression of conductive nanowires in <italic>CN</italic> is a significant development for the intensification of industrial-scale processes using electroactive microbial chassis, with the potential to provide solutions to a range of environmental issues. Type-IV pili are commonly used as adhesive structures by microbial species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, expressed by a range of pathogenic organisms to adhere to and colonise host cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> which complicates their use as an industrially feasible electron transport mechanism. In contrast, <italic>CN</italic> is non-pathogenic and has already been used as a chassis in several pilot-scale industrial projects. These pilot plants aim to produce thousands of metric tons per annum of the degradable bioplastic PHB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, which can then be processed into valuable fuels and chemical feedstocks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, reducing society’s reliance on environmentally damaging fossil fuels. However, current large-scale PHB production systems use agricultural sugars as feedstocks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Engineering an extracellular electron transfer mechanism into <italic>CN</italic> offers a novel path to CO<sub>2</sub> remediation and assimilation into useful bioplastics and chemical feedstocks via renewable energy sources. While indirect electron transfer was achieved previously in <italic>CN</italic>, with the addition of redox-active mediators <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> and hydrogen production via water electrolysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, these processes involve additional reaction stages or materials, adding cost and complexity to system design. In this work, we offer the first example of a purely biological, direct electron transfer mechanism achieved in <italic>CN</italic> based on type-IV pili nanowires. These findings offer new opportunities for alleviating global fossil fuel reliance <italic>via</italic> the production of sustainable biofuels based on the reduction of atmospheric carbon.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Generation of the <italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> H16 Δ<italic>pilA</italic> chassis</title><p id="P25"><italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> H16 was obtained from the University of Nottingham’s Synthetic Biology Research Centre culture collection. <italic>CN’s</italic> native <italic>pilA</italic> sequence was identified (Q0KE72, genomic location 577442:577936), and 1KB fragments of the locations immediately upstream and downstream were amplified using the primers HIFI:PilAKO:UpHA:FWD/ REV and PilAKO:DownHA:FWD/ REV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Table S1</xref>), respectively.

E-H) Modified <italic>CN</italic> PilA sequences, produced in this study: E) <italic>CN:</italic> T80, and F) <italic>CN</italic>: T61, PilA monomers with structural but without aromatic modification. G) <italic>CN</italic>: T61Y, and H) <italic>CN</italic>: T61W monomer sequences, with both structural modifications and increased aromatic amino acid content. Sequences A and B (<italic>CN</italic>, PA) are limited to 100 characters for clarity (from 147 and 143, respectively). Boxed residues indicate homologous regions and coloured residues indicate aromaticity. Alignment produced via Bio Edit. I) Predictive models of type-IV PilA monomer structures. Ii) <italic>GS</italic> WT; Iii) <italic>CN</italic> WT; Iiii) <italic>CN</italic>: T61, with C- terminal β-sheet removed but lacking aromatic modification; Iiii) <italic>CN</italic>: T61W, an adaptation of T61 with native amino acids replaced for tryptophan at locations 32, 51, 57. Aromatic residues are highlighted as red (tryptophan), blue (tyrosine) or green (phenylalanine) branches, and black arrows indicate locations of amino acid mutation. Models produced via Chimera.

A: Peak Force Error, and Contact Current data images, with the corresponding strain labelled to the left of each image. Z- scale shown in the lower- left corner of WT, aligned across all images to a scale of +150 mV to -150 mV (Peak Force Error), and +1pA to -1pA (Contact Current).

B: Contact current peak size, corresponding to pA increase or decrease over the baseline. C: Pili filament cross- sectional height. All variants had a mean filament morphology of 4.5- 5.7 nm, and differences between WT and engineered pili height were not significant (p&gt;0.05). For each data channel, nine measurements were taken in total for each variant, specifically three profiles drawn across three individual filaments (n=9 N=3).
