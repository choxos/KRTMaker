Much regulation occurs during transcription elongation, where RNA polymerase (RNAP) extends nascent RNA transcripts aided by global and universally-conserved elongation factor NusG. NusG modulates transcription by inhibiting pausing and backtracking; promoting anti-termination on ribosomal RNA (<italic>rrn</italic>) operons; coupling transcription with translation on mRNA genes; and stimulating Rho-dependent termination on toxic genes. Despite extensive work on NusG, its functional allocation and spatial distribution <italic>in vivo</italic> is unknown. Here, we addressed these long-standing questions using single-molecule tracking and super-resolution imaging of NusG in live <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. We found that, under conditions of moderate growth, NusG is mainly present as a population that associates indirectly with the chromosome via RNAP in transcription elongation complexes, and a slowly diffusing population we identified as a NusG complex with the 30S ribosomal subunit; this complex offers a “30S-guided” path for NusG to enter transcription elongation. Only ~10% of total NusG was fast-diffusing, with the mobility of this population suggesting that free NusG interacts non-specifically with DNA for &gt;50% of the time. Using antibiotics and deletion mutants, we showed that most chromosome-associated NusG is involved in <italic>rrn</italic> anti-termination and in transcription-translation coupling. NusG involvement in <italic>rrn</italic> anti-termination was mediated via its participation in phase-separated transcriptional condensates. Our work illuminates the diverse activities of a central regulator while offering a guide on how to dissect the roles of multi-functional machines using in vivo imaging.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Transcription, a biochemical process central to all living organisms, is orchestrated by the multi-functional protein machine RNA polymerase (RNAP). After the initial recognition of a promoter region, RNAP initiates RNA synthesis and escapes from the promoter after transcribing up to ~15 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Mooney et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Saecker et al., 2011</xref>). RNAP then enters the phase of transcription elongation, which continues processively until termination signals are encountered, at which point the nascent RNA and RNAP dissociate from the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ray-Soni et al., 2016</xref>). During transcription elongation, RNAP encounters DNA sequences and other signals that can slow down or stop transcription via processes such as pausing, backtracking and premature transcription termination. To counteract these impediments, maintain a steady RNA production, and enable additional mechanisms for transcriptional fidelity and regulation, cells employ a large variety of elongation factors that interact in different ways with RNAP.</p><p id="P3">A key elongation factor, and the only one conserved throughout the tree of life, is bacterial protein NusG, with its archaeal and mammalian homolog being Spt4/5. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, NusG is a 21-kDa protein which consists of two domains connected by a flexible linker; the NusG-NTD domain interacts with RNAP, whereas the NusG-CTD domain has many interacting and mutually exclusive partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Mooney et al., 2009a</xref>). Functionally, NusG appears to play many roles in elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). NusG inhibits transcriptional pausing by enhancing transcription elongation processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kang et al., 2018</xref>). NusG also forms an anti-termination complex on ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which maintains steady rRNA transcription with the help of other proteins, including NusE, NusB, ShuB and NusA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Huang et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Krupp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Zellars and Squires, 1999</xref>). Further, NusG acts as a “bridge” to couple transcription with translation by linking RNAP to ribosomes via an interaction of NusE/S10 with the NusG-CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bailey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Saxena et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Washburn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Webster et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, NusG stimulates termination factor Rho, an RNA helicase that terminates the synthesis of toxic gene products associated with homologous gene transfer and dormant phage genes embedded in the bacterial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cardinale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Peters et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Despite extensive study of the roles of NusG in transcription elongation, it is currently unknown how NusG distributes between all these activities in the cell, how the NusG distribution is affected by cell physiology, and whether (or when) NusG constitutes a limiting resource for the cell. This knowledge gap is further exacerbated by the fact that much of our understanding of NusG mechanisms is derived from <italic>in vitro</italic> work, therefore lacking the cellular context, the complexity of the chromosomal structure and organisation, and the presence of competing processes. For example, there is controversy about the exact biological and mechanistic significance of recent cryo-EM structures of large transcription-translation coupled complexes, some of which contain NusG and some do not, and in a way that depends on the length of nascent mRNA emerging from RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kohler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Webster et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Here, we advance our understanding of NusG functions by examining how NusG distributes between its various activities <italic>in vivo</italic>. To achieve this, we performed single-molecule tracking and super-resolution imaging of NusG fusions with photoactivatable protein PAmCherry, an approach we previously used to study proteins involved in transcription, DNA repair, and chromosome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Garza de Leon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Stracy et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Uphoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Zawadzki et al., 2015</xref>). Under conditions supporting moderate growth rates, we found that most of NusG is present in a chromosome-associated population (via an elongating RNAP) and a slowly-diffusing population corresponding to a NusG complex with free 30S ribosomal subunit; notably, there is little free NusG in the cell. Using mutants of NusB and of NusE, we show that most chromosome-associated NusG is involved in anti-termination on rRNA genes, and in transcription-translation coupling. Finally, using a chemical treatment that removes clusters arising from liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), we show that NusG clusters are associated with LLPS-driven condensates involved in rRNA anti-termination.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Construction and characterization of a functional NusG-PAmCherry fusion</title><p id="P6">To study the spatial distribution and mobility of NusG in bacterial cells, we first constructed a functional NusG-PAmCherry fusion in <italic>E. coli</italic> strain MG1655, where <italic>nusG</italic> is part of the essential <italic>secE-nusG</italic> operon. We first attempted to insert PAmCherry at the C-terminus of NusG using λ red recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Datsenko and Wanner, 2000</xref>), but no viable fusions were obtained. We then inserted a PAmCherry, along with a flexible linker, at the NusG N-terminus; since this strategy required inserting the PAmCherry gene between <italic>secE</italic> and the <italic>nusG</italic> coding sequence (where having an antibiotic marker for successful integration was not possible), we used gene gorging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Herring et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mooney et al., 2009b</xref>). The resulting strain carrying NusG-PAmcherry exhibited normal growth compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>); further, the fusion was expressed as an intact protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Single-molecule tracking reveals a wide range of NusG mobilities <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P7">To study NusG mobility and spatial distribution in live cells, we used single-molecule tracking combined with photoactivation localization microscopy (tracking-PALM; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Manley et al., 2008</xref>)). Since NusG is a transcription elongation factor involved in many functions occurring on the bacterial chromosome, we expected NusG to distribute in at least two diffusive subpopulations; a very-slowly-moving species representing NusG molecules that bind stably with RNAP during transcription elongation on the chromosome (and therefore adopt the very low mobility of the chromosomal loci), and a fast-moving species representing free NusG molecules (~50 KDa for the entire fusion construct). In our previous work on RNAP, we showed that tracking PALM is able to capture this entire range of intracellular mobilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Stracy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We first studied NusG mobility in M9 minimal media supplemented with glucose, MEM vitamins and MEM amino acids (hereafter, “M9GluVA”). Using photoactivation and imaging using 10.64-ms exposures, we collected 75,264 single-molecule tracks, calculated their apparent diffusion coefficient (<italic>D</italic>*), and summarized the mobility of all tracks in a D* distribution (gray histogram, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The D* distribution showed that the large majority of molecules appear to have fairly low mobility (D*&lt;0.5 μm<sup>2</sup>/s). As with other DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Stracy et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Uphoff et al., 2013</xref>), the shape of the distribution is complex, and could not be fit well by a single diffusing species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). A two-species free fit described the distribution better (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>), splitting approximately evenly between a very-slow species (D*<sub>vslow</sub>~0.15 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) and a slow species (D*<sub>slow</sub>~0.4 μm<sup>2</sup>/s).</p><p id="P9">To explore the possibility that our fitting above fails to capture a minor fast-diffusing species (with D*~1 μm<sup>2</sup>/s), we also performed a three-species fit, with the D* of the very-slow species fixed to the value obtained by the two-population fit. The three-species fit fitted our distribution extremely well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), and showed, in addition to the two main species, the presence of a minor fast-diffusing species (D*<sub>fast</sub>~1.0 μm2/s) that accounts for ~12% of all NusG. Both two- and three-species fits showed that there is little fast-diffusing NusG in the cell, a species which we will refer to as “free NusG” or F-NusG.</p><p id="P10">We then tentatively assigned the mobility species to different activities or complexes of NusG. Since the very-slow species (~41% of all tracks; hereafter, the “VS-NusG” species) has a very low mobility, similarly to proteins that bind stably to the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Stracy et al., 2015</xref>), we initially assigned this species to NusG molecules indirectly (and stably) associated with the chromosome via interactions with RNAP and, possibly, via other machinery that interacts with the chromosome during active elongation, anti-termination, or Rho-dependent termination.</p><p id="P11">Intriguingly, however, the largest fraction (~47%) of the tracks is due to the slow species (D* ~0.3 μm<sup>2</sup>/s; hereafter, the “S-NusG” species). This mobility is much slower than that expected for free NusG, indicating that S-NusG comprises NusG molecules with slowed-down motions due to interactions with much larger structures. The structures are likely to be one or more of the three major interacting partners of NusG in elongation: the RNAP core, the Rho-termination factor, and the ribosome or ribosomal subunits.</p><p id="P12">We also found that the distribution between the three main diffusive species in M9GluVA was similar to that in a medium supporting significantly slower growth (M9 + 0.2% glucose medium, hereafter “M9Glu”, with a generation time of ~55 min; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D</xref>), as well as to a medium supporting significantly faster growth (rich-defined medium, hereafter “RDM”, with a generation time of ~33 min).</p><p id="P13">To map the sub-cellular distributions of the NusG species and test our initial assignments, we divided the NusG tracks into a fraction comprised mainly by VS-NusG, and a fraction comprised mainly by S-NusG (by selecting tracks with D*&lt;0.31, and D*&gt;0.31, respectively), and plotted heatmaps for the tracks of these two fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E</xref>, for cell-size ranges featuring two nucleoids vs. one nucleoid, respectively). The VS-NusG distribution resembled the distribution of chromosome-engaged RNAPs, which tend to localize at the periphery of the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Stracy et al., 2015</xref>), and is consistent with the assignment VS-NusG to NusG molecules engaged in transcription elongation.</p><p id="P14">In contrast, the S-NusG fraction is found throughout the cytoplasm and not exclusively in the nucleoid. This localization pattern is different from the localization of diffusing RNAP, which we had previously shown to localize almost exclusively to the nucleoid region due to non-specific interactions with the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bakshi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Stracy et al., 2015</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the S-NusG is formed due to a NusG interaction with a large structure other than RNAP. Further, our results are consistent with an interaction of NusG with the 30S free ribosomal subunit, since the latter localizes throughout the cell, and is not excluded from the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Sanamrad et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Characterising the fast-diffusing NusG species</title><p id="P15">Our initial analysis showed that most NusG molecules interact with larger partners, leaving little free NusG (F-NusG) in the cell. To verify this observation, and determine more accurately the mobility of F-NusG, we overexpressed unlabeled NusG from an IPTG-inducible promoter ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mooney et al., 2010</xref>) and <italic>Methods</italic>) to out-compete NusG-PAmCherry from its interactions with its partners, and release the fusion molecules in the cytoplasm.</p><p id="P16">Indeed, upon overexpression of unlabelled NusG following 30 min induction, the NusG mobility distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) showed near complete disappearance of VS-NusG and S-NusG (&lt;10% for the sum of the two species). Further, a fast-diffusing species (D*<sub>fast</sub>~1.7 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) became predominant, accounting for &gt;90% of all NusG. These results showed that overexpressed NusG fully replaces the tagged version in its interactions in the cell, and provides a better estimate (due to much better sampling than that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) of the mobility of F-NusG.</p><p id="P17">To further validate the mobility of F-NusG without relying on releasing NusG from its complexes, we also overexpressed a NusG-PAmCherry fusion from a low-copy-number plasmid with an IPTG-inducible <italic>plac</italic> promoter in wild-type MG1655. After 30 min of induction, NusG appears almost exclusively (96%) as F-NusG species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). This experiment also provided an additional estimate for the mobility of F-NusG (D*~1.4 μm<sup>2</sup>/s).</p><p id="P18">To further support the analysis of above, and confirm whether VS-NusG indeed comprises NusG molecules bound to chromosome-bound RNAP during transcription elongation, we treated cells with the antibiotic rifampicin (Rif) to block initial transcription and subsequent elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Herring et al., 2005</xref>), and determined NusG mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). As with the NusG-overexpression experiments, VS-NusG essentially disappears as a result of Rif treatment, showing that chromosomal association of NusG requires, as expected, entry of RNAP into transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mooney et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Stracy et al., 2015</xref>). The Rif treatment also substantially increased the abundance of F-NusG (from 12% to 85% of the entire NusG pool), as was seen after NusG overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>). Notably, the S-NusG species was reduced but not abolished by Rif treatment (still accounting for ~18% of all NusG), showing that its presence is not dependent on active transcription.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Most chromosome-associated NusG is engaged in rRNA antitermination</title><p id="P19">We then examined what fraction of NusG engages in transcription anti-termination. Processive anti-termination is mediated by a complex of proteins interacting with RNAP to counteract premature termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Torres et al., 2004</xref>), and ensure efficient <italic>rrn</italic> operon transcription. This is accomplished by the formation of an <italic>rrn</italic> anti-termination complex (ATC), which includes NusA, NusB, NusE, NusG, and ShuB. ATC formation is initiated by the NusB:NusE heterodimer binding to a <italic>boxA</italic> site at the leader rRNA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>; see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Burmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Huang et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Krupp et al., 2019</xref>)). NusB is found at copy numbers that are 50-80% of those of core RNAP in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Swindle et al., 1988</xref>). If NusB is deleted, the assembly of ATC on <italic>rrn</italic> operons is blocked, reducing the total RNA content in the cell and increasing Rho-dependent termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Miyashita et al., 1982</xref>). We thus reasoned that, by eliminating NusB, we can prevent anti-termination, and use the ensuing change in NusG mobility to estimate the fraction of NusG is involved in antitermination.</p><p id="P20">To study NusG diffusion in the absence of NusB, we studied the NusG mobility distribution in a Δ<italic>nusB</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). NusB deletion resulted in a large increase in F-NusG (which reached 55% of all NusG), in large part due to a ~60% decrease in VS-NusG (from 41% to 17%). This fraction (60%) serves as a lower bound of the fraction of chromosome-associated NusG that is involved in <italic>rrn</italic> anti-termination, since some VS-NusG freed from anti-termination may be directed to other (non-<italic>rrn</italic>) chromosome-associated species. Notably, the S-NusG species remains significant, albeit reduced by ~40%. This reduction is consistent with our assignment of S-NusG to a NusG-30S complex, since loss of rRNA transcription will also reduce the levels of the 30S ribosomal subunit, and, in turn, the levels of the proposed NusG-30S complex; however, these results do not exclude the presence of a putative NusG-Rho complex in the S-NusG species.</p><p id="P21">We also examined the spatial distribution of the NusG fraction involved in anti-termination using 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM; see <italic>Methods</italic>). Using a NusG-sfGFP strain grown in M9GluVA, we observed that NusG localised in large clusters (10-20 clusters per cell) that decorate an irregular nucleoid (blue density; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, left). This distribution was similar to that of RNAP in rich media, as we had previously observed using SIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Stracy et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, Rif treatment removed all large NusG clusters, leaving mainly small regions of nucleoid-peripheral NusG signal over a decondensed nucleoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, middle).</p><p id="P22">NusB deletion also resulted in loss of most large NusG clusters, decondenses the nucleoid, and leads NusG to a more regular nucleoid-peripheral localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, right). The change in the NusG spatial distribution is consistent with the expectation that absence of <italic>rrn</italic> anti-termination will lead to a nucleoid-wide loss of the high levels of transcription of <italic>rrn</italic> operons. The remaining clusters are likely to represent NusG attached to clusters of mRNA-transcribing RNAPs, which should be less affected by the loss of <italic>rrn</italic> anti-termination.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Loss of NusG contacts with the 30S ribosome release NusG from elongation complexes and the S-species</title><p id="P23">We then examined the involvement of NusG in transcription-translation coupling, a process extensively studied <italic>in vitro</italic> via biochemical assays and structural approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Burmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kohler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Washburn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Webster et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P24">To dissect the role of NusG-ribosome interactions mediated via the NusE/S10 subunit on the 30S ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), we inserted a degron tag in the NusE C-terminus (see <italic>Methods</italic>). NusE interacts with NusG both during transcription-translation coupling, and during the assembly of the <italic>rrn</italic> anti-termination complex. As a result, once NusE is degraded, we expected a large increase in F-NusG; further, if indeed NusE interacts with NusG in the context of the putative NusG-30S complex, we expected S-NusG species to decrease substantially upon NusE degradation.</p><p id="P25">Indeed, upon induction of NusE degradation, the sum of VS-NusG and S-NusG populations was reduced from ~90% to less than 10%, with the large majority of NusG converted to F-NusG (D*~1.4 μm<sup>2</sup>/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). These results strongly support our proposal that the S-NusG species corresponds mainly to a NusG-30S complex, and not to a NusG-Rho complex or to an NusG-RNAP, both of which should have been either unaffected or increased upon NusE degradation.</p><p id="P26">To explore further the effects of NusE degradation on NusG functions, we also examined the NusG spatial distribution after NusE degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), and established that the F-NusG population distributes across the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, bottom). In sharp contrast, the remaining low-mobility species are completely excluded from the nucleoid periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, top); these species are likely to represent genes actively being prematurely aborted by Rho, as well as any remaining NusG-RNAP complexes.</p><p id="P27">We then used 3D-SIM to determine the NusG sub-cellular distribution after destabilizing the NusG interactions with RNAP and ribosomes by blocking different steps in translation, while not affecting <italic>rrn</italic> antitermination directly. We reasoned that if NusG couples RNAP with the leading ribosome, blocking translation would remove NusG-ribosome interactions, and thus decrease the overall affinity of NusG for the elongation complex on mRNA genes. Previous work on the spatial distribution of ribosomes relative to the nucleoid had shown that treatment with chloramphenicol (Cam), a translation-elongation inhibitor, leads to filling of most cytoplasmic space with ribosomes, with the nucleoid becoming condensed into a spherical object appearing at mid-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bakshi et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, kasugamycin (Kas), a translation-initiation inhibitor, inhibits 70S ribosome assembly while allowing the nucleoid to maintain most of its length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bakshi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P28">After Kas treatment, we observed that medium-size NusG clusters, previously distributed peripherally and along the nucleoid, were lost (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, left with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, middle).

Our work shows that for media supporting doubling times of 33-55 min, there is a limited amount of free NusG (corresponding to the F-NusG species) in the bacterial cytoplasm, with only ~10% of NusG appearing to diffuse rapidly. This result strongly suggests that NusG is a limited resource for the cell, and predicts the presence of a dynamic competition between machineries for binding NusG, with the split between activities changing according to the cellular requirements for growth, duplication, and adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Free NusG binds to the chromosome non-specifically and transiently for &gt;50% of time</title><p id="P36">Our work clearly established that free NusG-PAmCherry, a protein of ~48 KDa, has an apparent diffusion coefficient of D*<sub>fast</sub> ~ 1.4 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Given that NusG is not known to bind directly to chromosomal DNA, but instead binds to the chromosome indirectly (via RNAP during transcription elongation), we would expect that the D* value and diffusion behaviour of NusG should be independent of the presence of the chromosome, as we have shown for proteins lacking DNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Stracy et al., 2021</xref>). However, the D* value for free NusG matches that for a 4-times larger protein that is unable to bind DNA (Lac<sup>-41</sup>, a ~200 KDa truncated <italic>lac</italic> repressor (LacI) derivative lacking its DNA-binding domain).</p><p id="P37">Further, under the same consideration that NusG does not bind directly to chromosomal DNA, the diffusion of free NusG in cells with intact nucleoids should resemble the behaviour of HU-PAmCherry, 48 KDa (same size as NusG-PAmCherry) in cells where the chromosomal DNA has been degraded (DNA-free cells; see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Stracy et al., 2021</xref>)).

The strong nucleoid-like localisation of F-NusG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>) supports the second hypothesis. Further, the fact that the F-NusG species persists and shows no change in mobility in rifampicin-treated cells, where RNA is highly depleted, indicates that these non-specific interactions are not mediated primarily by nascent RNA. As a result, we can use the estimated D<sub>acc</sub> for NusG in the absence and presence of the nucleoid (~12.6 μm<sup>2</sup>/s and ~3.5 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively) to estimate that free NusG binds to the chromosome transiently for ~70% of its diffusion time (see <italic>Methods</italic>). We note that interactions between the DNA and NusG-like proteins, especially with non-template DNA in the context of the transcription bubble, have been previously discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Nedialkov et al., 2018</xref>). The non-specific interactions of NusG with the chromosome may increase the effective concentration of NusG in the vicinity of elongation complexes, thus facilitating the search of NusG for some of its targets.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>NusG interacts with the 30S ribosomal subunit before translation initiation</title><p id="P39">Our work establishes that most NusG associates with transcription elongation complexes on the chromosome (forming VS-NusG species), or diffuses as part of larger complexes (i.e., S-NusG species). Notably, NusG binds to the nucleoid stably only in the presence of transcription elongation, as shown by Rif treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>); this is further supported by the similarity of the spatial distributions of VS-NusG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, top) with chromosome-associated RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Stracy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P40">Our detection of an abundant S-NusG species is intriguing.

Our NusE-degradation results further support the presence of NusG-30S complex, since loss of NusE essentially eliminates S-NusG. Consistent with this interpretation, structural studies suggest that NusG:NusE interaction occurs both in the context of the 70S ribosome, and in the context of free 30S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Burmann, et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P42">The presence of substantial amounts of a NusG-30S complex also suggests an additional major route of NusG entry to the transcription elongation complex – that of association during translation initiation through the interaction of a NusG-loaded 30S with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence on mRNA, formation of 70S ribosomes, ribosome translocation towards an elongating (or stalled) RNAP, and NusG-facilitated transcription-translation coupling on target mRNA genes. This is in line with the ChIP-chip analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mooney et al., 2009b</xref>) showing that NusG enters the transcription elongation complex on mRNA a few hundred bp from the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mooney et al., 2009b</xref>).

Initial cell segmentation using a segmentation algorithm (based on Mask R-CNN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">He et al., 2020</xref>)and training on bright-field images) was followed by mesh refinement via Microbetracker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sliusarenko et al., 2011</xref>). Custom in-house software (“LoColi”) was used to filter localisations using a segmentation mask and generate tracks that were used to calculate diffusion coefficients D* for each track. D* histograms were generated from the compilation of triplicate datasets and were fitted to gamma distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Stracy et al., 2015</xref>). Heatmaps for the intracellular locations of each localisation in the selected tracks were computed for both different diffusive populations (using a specified D* threshold to examine tracks of different mobility), and normalised across cell length.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Estimation of the fraction of time NusG spends in transient DNA binding</title><p id="P60">The fraction of time that a DNA-binding protein binds non-specifically to the chromosome can be estimated by a simplified version of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Elf et al., 2007</xref>) using D<sub>intact</sub> = (1-f<sub>ns</sub>) * D<sub>free</sub>, where D<sub>intact</sub> and D<sub>free</sub> are the accurate protein diffusion coefficients in cells with intact nucleoids, and in cells in the absence of DNA binding, respectively, and f<sub>ns</sub> is the fraction of time that the protein binds non-specifically to the DNA.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS157550-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d95aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Dr. Piers Turner for providing help with cell segmentation; Dr. Olivier Espeli for providing plasmids; Prof David Sherratt for providing reagents for the NusE degron strain; Prof Robert Landick for providing a helper plasmid; and the MICRON Advanced Bioimaging Facility at Oxford (supported by Wellcome Strategic Awards 091911/B/10/Z and 107457/Z/15/Z) for access to a PALM and a 3D-SIM microscope in their facilities.</p><sec id="S26"><title>Funding</title><p>A.N.K. was supported by Wellcome Trust grant 110164/Z/15/Z, and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council grants BB/N018656/1 and BB/S008896/1.

Before locating its target (a transcription elongation complex), NusG interacts non-specifically and transiently with the bacterial chromosome. NusG can enter the elongation complex by binding to RNAP directly. NusG also forms an abundant complex with free 30S ribosomal subunit, which can interact with the mRNA during translation initiation and offer a route for locating the elongating (or paused) RNAP, and establishing transcription-translation coupling.</p><p><bold>B.</bold> Role of NusG in rRNA transcription. <italic>rrn</italic> operons are heavily transcribed in moderate to fast growth rates, with each <italic>rrn</italic> operon being occupied by tens of RNAP molecules (~70 for exponential growth in rich media).
