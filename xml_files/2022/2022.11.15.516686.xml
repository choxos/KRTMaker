The mechanisms underlying the specification of these cell types during human development are not well-understood which limits fine-tuning and broader application of cardiac model systems. Here, we used the expression of ETV2, a master regulator of hematoendothelial specification in mice, to identify functionally distinct subpopulations during the co-differentiation of endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes from hiPSCs. Targeted analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed differential ETV2 dynamics in the two lineages. A newly created fluorescent reporter line allowed us to identify early lineage-predisposed states and show that a transient ETV2-high state initiates the specification of endothelial cells. We further demonstrated, unexpectedly, that functional cardiomyocytes can originate from progenitors expressing ETV2 at a low level. Our study thus sheds light on the <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation dynamics of two important cardiac lineages.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ETV2</kwd><kwd>Cardiomyocyte</kwd><kwd>Endothelial cell</kwd><kwd>Human induced pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>Segregation</kwd><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4"><italic>In vivo</italic>, cardiomyocytes (CMs) and endothelial cells (ECs) originate from <italic>Mesp1</italic>+ progenitors specified during gastrulation. In mice, these cells appear in the primitive streak and subsequently migrate towards the lateral plate mesoderm around E6.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. The timing of segregation of CMs and ECs from their common progenitor is still controversial. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of mouse <italic>Mesp1</italic>+ progenitors collected at E6.75 and E7.25 showed that these cells were already segregated into distinct cardiovascular lineages, including CMs and ECs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. However, other studies showed that multipotential progenitors were still present in <italic>Flk-1</italic>-expressing lateral plate mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. These cells were the first to be recognized as multipotent cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Studies in mouse and chick showed that CPCs come from two different sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]: the first- and the second heart field (FHF, SHF). The FHF in the cardiac crescent contributes to the primitive heart tube, which serves as a scaffold into which SHF cells can migrate before heart chamber morphogenesis. It has been shown that cells from the SHF are patterned before migration to give rise to different parts of the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. CPCs from FHF and SHF can be distinguished by the expression of ISL1, which is specific to the SHF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. <italic>Nkx2-5</italic>-expressing CPCs in both FHF and SHF from E7.5 to E7.75 contribute to both CMs and ECs in the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. ETS Variant Transcription Factor 2 (Etv2) is a master regulator of endothelial and hematopoietic cell lineages during early development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Etv2 functions downstream of BMP, WNT and NOTCH signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] and regulates the expression of early EC-specific markers, such as <italic>Tal1, Gata2, Lmo2, Tek, Notch1, Notch4</italic> and <italic>Cdh5</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), VEGF-FLK1 signaling upregulates ETV2 expression to induce hemangiogenic specification via an ETV2 threshold-dependent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. ETV2 expression was also found to direct the segregation of hemangioblasts and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in mouse ESCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p id="P5">In human heart development, much less is known about the specification of endothelial and myocardial lineages from multipotent CPCs, both in terms of timing and gene regulatory mechanisms. More specifically, it is still unclear whether ETV2 also plays a role in the segregation of ECs and CMs from CPCs in humans. Overexpression of ETV2 converts human fibroblasts into endothelial-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] and ETV2 expression levels have been modified in several studies to drive hiPSCs towards ECs in 2D and 3D cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Paik et al. performed scRNA-seq analysis of hiPSC-derived ECs (hiPSC-ECs), which made up less than 10% of the cells that expressed the cardiac maker <italic>TNNT2</italic>. The developmental dynamics of ECs and cardiac lineages as such were not further studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. In an scRNA-seq study of hiPSC-ECs obtained using a different differentiation protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], ECs were collected at multiple time points. This study showed that endothelial and mesenchymal lineages have a common developmental origin in mesoderm cells but the identity and differentiation potential of these cells was not described.</p><p id="P6">Previously, we found that <italic>MESP1</italic>+ progenitors derived from human ESCs could give rise to CMs, ECs and SMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. We also developed a co-differentiation system for ECs and CMs from hiPSCs through a common cardiac mesoderm precursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Here we performed scRNA-seq analysis of this co-differentiation system to elucidate the relationship between <italic>ETV2</italic> expression and specification of ECs and CMs from cardiac mesoderm. <italic>ETV2</italic> expression was observed principally as an initial “pulse” in the endothelial lineage but also in a subpopulation of the myocardial lineage. Using a newly generated ETV2<sup>mCherry</sup> hiPSC reporter line, we purified two subpopulations of ETV2+ cells and revealed their derivative EC and CM expression characteristics by bulk RNA-seq. These sorted populations also showed distinct differentiation potentials towards CMs and ECs upon further differentiation with VEGF. In summary, this study detailed <italic>ETV2</italic> dynamics during segregation of human CMs and ECs differentiated from hiPSCs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material And Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>hiPSC culture</title><p id="P7">The NCRM1 hiPSC line (NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine (NIH CRM), obtained from RUDCR Infinite Biologics at Rutgers University, hPSCreg number CRMi003-A) was used in this study, except for the single-cell RNA-seq, which was done with LUMC0020iCTRL06 (hPSCreg number LUMCi028-A). hiPSC control lines were cultured in TeSR-E8 on Vitronectin XF and routinely passaged once a week using Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (all from Stem Cell Technologies).

We found that <italic>ETV2</italic> was highly expressed in the EC cluster, as well as in a small fraction of cells in the cardiac mesoderm and CM clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, left). We next focused on <italic>ETV2</italic> expression dynamics along the developmental path from cardiac mesoderm to CMs and ECs. Notably, ECs extended to larger pseudotimes (0.15-0.8) compared to CMs (0.15-0.3), which might indicate faster differentiation kinetics in the EC lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">S1A</xref>). After the bifurcation into ECs and CMs (around pseudotime 0.15), <italic>ETV2</italic> increased only slightly in the CM lineage. In the EC lineage, however, it was initially strongly upregulated (until pseudotime 0.25), and subsequently declined to a similar level as in cardiac mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). <italic>ETV2</italic> downstream target genes, such as <italic>TAL1, GATA2</italic> and <italic>LMO2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] , were only slightly increased in the CM lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), while in the EC lineage, they were highly induced and strongly correlated with <italic>ETV2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Notably, <italic>TAL1, GATA2</italic> and <italic>LMO2</italic> only showed significant expression after ETV2 expression exceeded 0.25 in ECs, an expression level that was not reached in CMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S1B-C</xref>). Endothelial specific genes <italic>KDR, CD34, SOX17, CDH5</italic> and <italic>PECAM1</italic> increased on the path from cardiac mesoderm to ECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S1E</xref>). Most of these genes started to increase when ETV2 was already declining, as exemplified by <italic>CDH5</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S1D</xref>). Genes related to cardiac or muscle function, like <italic>ACTC1, PDLIM5, HAND1, PKP2</italic> and <italic>GATA4</italic>, most of which were already expressed in the cardiac mesoderm, were further increased in the CM lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S1F</xref>). Identification of genes that are differentially expressed between <italic>ETV2+</italic> CMs and ECs showed enrichment in CM- and EC-specific genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S4</xref>). Taken together, these analyses confirmed the differentiation of cardiac mesoderm into CMs and ECs, which we had discovered previously. They also revealed the increase of <italic>ETV2</italic> as a global indicator of early lineage separation and a transient pulse of high <italic>ETV2</italic> at the beginning of EC specification.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Generation and characterization of an ETV2<sup>mCherry</sup> fluorescent hiPSC reporter line</title><p id="P28">In order to follow <italic>ETV2</italic> expression in real-time, we introduced a fluorescent reporter for <italic>ETV2</italic> in hiPSCs.

After neomycin selection and excision of the selection cassette, targeted hiPSC clones were validated by PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S2A-D</xref>) and Sanger sequencing (data not shown). The hiPSC clone with ETV2<sup>mCherry</sup> in both alleles was further characterized by measuring pluripotency marker expression and G-banding karyotyping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S2E-H</xref>). Karyotype analysis revealed an additional duplication in the 1q32.1 locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S2H</xref>). This duplication occurs frequently in hPSCs possibly imposing positive natural selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. However, this did not appear to affect the differentiation of the hPSCs to ECs.</p><p id="P29"><italic>ETV2</italic> and <italic>mCherry</italic> mRNAs were highly expressed on days 4 to 5 of differentiation and downregulated from day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-C</xref>). ETV2 and mCherry protein appeared from day 4 and peaked on day 5. ETV2 protein was downregulated on day 6 and absent on day 8. mCherry was retained in a fraction of the cell population for somewhat longer because of its half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental online Video 1</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis at different stages of differentiation revealed upregulation of ETV2 (mCherry protein) as early as day 4 of differentiation followed by the upregulation of the EC-specific marker CD144 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">S3B</xref>). Quantification of the percentages of single positive (SP; ETV2<sup>mCherry</sup>+CD144-) and double positive (DP; ETV2<sup>mCherry</sup>+CD144+) cells on day 4, 5, 6 and 8 of differentiation from at least three independent experiments showed a decrease and an increase of SP and DP cells respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G-H</xref>). mCherry protein remained present for a longer period than ETV2 protein and endogenous <italic>ETV2 and mCherry</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-H</xref>), likely due to the relatively longer half-life of the mCherry protein. This explains the persistence of mCherry signal in both the DP and SP population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G-H</xref>), and offers the possibility to use mCherry as a lineage tracer, identifying cells that previously passed through a stage of being ETV2+.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>The ETV2<sup>mCherry</sup> fluorescent reporter allows the purification of differentiating cells with lineage-specific expression profiles</title><p id="P30">We next sorted DP and SP cells at different stages of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>) and performed bulk RNA-seq on at least three independent replicates. <italic>ETV2</italic> mRNA showed similar trends in DP and SP cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S4</xref>), consistent with the earlier qPCR result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that DP and SP populations diverged progressively over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Mapping of the bulk transcriptomes to the scRNA-seq data revealed that DP samples aligned on the EC branch and SP cells on the CM branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, SP and DP cells collected at later time points were further away from cardiac mesoderm, reflecting ongoing differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P32">We next leveraged the higher sensitivity and accuracy of bulk RNA-seq compared to scRNA-seq, to get a more comprehensive and robust transcriptional characterization of the subpopulations. By consensus clustering of the most variable genes across DP or SP cells (3000 genes each) we found three gene clusters for each population, with distinct expression dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S5A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S5</xref>). In DP cells, cluster D1 (1226 genes) expression increased over time. Gene Ontology (GO) terms enriched in cluster D1 included “angiogenesis”, “Notch signaling pathway”, “transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway”, “receptor-mediated endocytosis” and “developmental maturation” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S6</xref>). In accordance with this analysis, angiogenesis-related genes (<italic>CDH5, TIE1, TEK, EFNB2, SOX18, VEGFB, LEPR</italic>), Notch and transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway related genes (<italic>COL1A2, NOTCH1, HES4, DLL4, JAG2, HEY1, NOTCH3, NOTCH4, TGFBR2, EGF</italic>) and heart valve morphogenesis related genes (<italic>SMAD6, EFNA1, GATA5, HEY2, EMILIN1, NOS3, GATA3</italic>) were upregulated over the course of differentiation in DP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S5C</xref>). In the scRNA-seq data, cluster D1 genes were specifically expressed in the EC cluster and showed increasing expression along pseudotime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>). Cluster D1 genes are thus likely involved in EC-specific functions. Cluster D2 (1127 genes), which was downregulated after day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), was enriched for cell cycle-related genes (<italic>ITGB1, CDK4, CCND1, CDK2AP2, MYC, CDC6</italic>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S5D</xref>). Cluster D3 (647 genes), which was downregulated after day 5-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), contained cell proliferation- and fatty-acyl-CoA biosynthetic process-related genes (<italic>ACLY</italic>, <italic>FASN, ELOVL1, SLC25A1, ACSL3, ACSL4</italic>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S5E</xref>). Genes in clusters D2 and D3 were more broadly expressed in the scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S5I</xref>). Their dynamics likely reflect changes in proliferation and metabolism at the exit from the multipotent progenitor state.</p><p id="P33">In SP cells, cluster S1 (936 genes) increased over time and contained genes enriched for GO terms related to heart development and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S6</xref>). In agreement, cardiac chamber and cardiac muscle development related genes (<italic>MYH6, HAND1, MYH10, TNNT2, NKX2-5, ISL1, TNNC1, MYOD, LMO4 and HEY1, MYL7, MYL4, ACTA2, KCNH2</italic>) were upregulated over the course of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">S5F</xref>). Cluster S1 genes were highly expressed in the cardiac mesoderm and CM clusters in the scRNA-seq data, which showed an increase over pseudotime in the CM lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>). These genes are thus likely involved in CM-specific functions. Cluster S2 (746 genes), which increased slightly until day 6 and was downregulated afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), contained mitotic nuclear division genes (TPX2, CDC20, NEK2, PLK1, PRC1 and CDC25C) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S5G</xref>). Cluster S3 (1318 genes), whose expression decreased continuously over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), contained transcription and translation process-related genes (<italic>SF1, SNRPE, DDX23, RRP1B</italic> and <italic>PRMT5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S5H</xref>). In the scRNA-seq data, genes from clusters S2 and S3 showed broader expression patterns compared to cluster S1 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S5J</xref>). The dynamics of clusters S2 and S3 likely reflect changes in proliferation and metabolism in the CM lineage, analogous to the role of clusters D2 and D3 in the EC lineage.</p><p id="P34">Taken together, time-resolved bulk RNA-seq of sorted SP and DP populations confirmed that ETV2-positive cells contained transcriptionally distinct subpopulations. DP cells were part of the EC lineage, while SP cells corresponded to the CM lineage.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>ETV2+ cells contain lineage-predisposed subpopulations</title><p id="P35">Next, we wanted to find out how the various subpopulations we identified differed in terms of their further differentiation potential. To this end, we sorted cells on the basis of ETV2 reporter levels shortly after the bifurcation (on day 5) and attempted to differentiate them further towards ECs by adding VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>). After 5 days of additional differentiation, ETV2+ cells produced more than 90% CD144+CD31+ ECs, while ETV2- cells gave rise to only 10-15% ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">S6A</xref>). Only cells derived from ETV2+ cells expressed endothelial-specific markers, as observed by qPCR and immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">S6C</xref>). These cells also upregulated pro-inflammatory markers, such as ICAM-1 and E-Selectin upon TNF-α stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I-L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">S6B</xref>), as shown previously for hiPSC-derived ECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. We thus concluded that the majority of ETV2+ cells on day 5 has a strong propensity to produce ECs.</p><p id="P36">Both the analysis of the scRNA-seq data and the time-resolved bulk RNA-seq of sorted cells had identified a subpopulation of ETV2+ cells with CM characteristics. We strongly suspected that the differentiation of these cells would be predisposed to the CM lineage. To test this hypothesis with our reporter line, we co-differentiated cells until day 7. We chose a later time point for this experiment because the majority of cells are past bifurcation at this point and it is therefore easier to identify the ETV2+ population that does not correspond to early ECs. We co-stained for CD144 and sorted the cells into DP, SP and double negative (DN) populations. These subpopulations were then further cultured in the presence of VEGF until day 18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, M). The majority (&gt;80%) of DP cells differentiated into CD144+CD31+ ECs, in agreement with the previous experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4N-O</xref>). In contrast, more than 50% of SP and DN cells differentiated into cTnT+ CMs while very few ECs were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4N-O</xref>). Interestingly, CMs derived from SP cells seemed to proliferate more and formed a monolayer composed of a contracting cell sheet, while CMs from DN cells proliferated to a lesser extent and produced only a few, isolated clusters of contracting cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplemental online Video 2</xref>). Almost all DP cells on day 18 expressed the EC marker CD31, while only few cells derived from SP and DN cells were positive for CD31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4P-R</xref>). Most cells derived from SP and DN expressed CM-specific α-Actinin and cTnT and showed typical sarcomeric structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4Q-R</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">S6D-E</xref>). A small number of SP and DN-derived cells were also positive for the smooth muscle cell marker SM22, while negative for cardiac markers (data not shown). Furthermore, the α-Actinin positive CMs derived from the SP cell fraction were positive for SM22, possibly indicating their immaturity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4R</xref>).</p><p id="P37">Taken together, the VEGF differentiation experiments showed that DP and SP cells are predisposed to the EC and CM lineages, respectively. DN cells were largely unable to give rise to EC but produced CMs, albeit with lower efficiency than SP cells. Entering a transient state characterized by high ETV2 expression, thus seems necessary to initiate EC specification.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S25" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P38">In this study, we characterized the dynamics of EC and CM co-differentiation from hiPSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. <italic>ETV2</italic> was identified as an early indicator of lineage segregation and found to be strongly, but transiently, upregulated in ECs, in agreement with its essential role in hemangiogenic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>ETV2</italic> expression was also observed in a small population of cardiac mesoderm and CMs. This is reminiscent of a recent study where etv2 expression was observed in lateral plate mesoderm and the CM population in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. In our experiments, expression of ETV2 target genes seemed to occur only above a threshold of <italic>ETV2</italic> expression, although this observation could also be explained by a temporal delay between ETV2 upregulation and target gene expression. An ETV2 threshold in hiPSC differentiation would be in line with previous reports of an ETV2 threshold in hemangiogenic specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].

These relatively late expressed genes could potentially be used as markers to distinguish early and late ECs during development <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>. Genes involved in heart development and definitive hematopoiesis were also upregulated during EC development, suggesting a mixture of cardiac endothelial- and hemogenic endothelial identity of these ECs. A better characterization hematopoietic potential of these cells would be interesting but beyond the scope of this study. ECs that were further differentiated with VEGF showed a clear endothelial identity and were fully functional based on their inflammatory response upon TNFα stimulation. Notably, they also expressed a number of cardiac markers like <italic>MEOX2, GATA4, GATA6</italic> and <italic>ISL1</italic>, suggesting a cardiac specific EC identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p><p id="P41">The SP subpopulation (CM precursors) had already committed to a cardiac fate on day 4, as evidenced by expression of cardiac genes <italic>HAND1, MYH10, NKX2-5, ISL1, TNNC1, MYOCD</italic> and <italic>LMO4</italic>. However, some crucial CM genes were still absent, including <italic>MYH6</italic> and <italic>TNNT2. MYH6</italic> encodes the major CM thick filament protein MHC-α and <italic>TNNT2</italic> is routinely used as a CM marker. Both genes are essential for CM contractility and started to be expressed only after day 4. Their relatively late expression could allow us to identify early and late cardiac progenitors during cardiac development in future studies. CMs were still early progenitors on day 6 of the differentiation as no functionally contracting CMs were observed yet at this stage. Pseudotime analysis also suggested that ECs had differentiated further compared to CMs on day 6. After additional VEGF differentiation, SP cells gave rise to contracting CM, which provided direct evidence they were CM precursors. More importantly, it demonstrated that both ECs and CMs could be derived from ETV2+ progenitors, confirming the presence of a common precursor implied by our earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p><p id="P42">Notably, ETV2- cells (DN population) also gave rise to contracting CMs after VEGF treatment, albeit less frequently than SP cells. This difference could be due to either the different cell growth rates or their different developmental origins (FHF vs. SHF).

Statement</title></caption><p><italic>In vitro</italic> differentiation of cardiac cell types is of great importance for understanding heart development, disease modeling and future regenerative medicine. Currently, underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood, which limits the efficiency and fine-tuning of present differentiation protocols. Here, we investigated the master regulator ETV2 and showed that its upregulation marks the specification of two cardiac cell types during co-differentiation. Using single-cell RNA-seq and a new fluorescent reporter line we identified lineage-predisposed subpopulations in the ETV2+ cells. We thus resolved ETV2 dynamics at the single-cell level in the context of <italic>in vitro</italic> human cardiac differentiation.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>scRNA-seq analysis of ECs and CMs during co-differentiation reveals transient ETV2 upregulation after bifurcation.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic overview of the co-differentiation protocol from day −1 to day 6.
