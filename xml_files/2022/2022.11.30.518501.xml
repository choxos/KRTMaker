However, little is known about how TBI affects the local level of synchronization and how this evolves during the recovery trajectory. Here, we applied a novel turbulent dynamics framework to investigate the temporal evolution in whole-brain dynamics using an open access resting state fMRI dataset from a cohort of moderate-to-severe TBI patients and healthy controls (HCs). We first examined how several measures related to turbulent dynamics differ between HCs and TBI patients at 3-, 6- and 12-months post-injury. We found a significant reduction in these empirical measures after TBI, with the largest change at 6-months post-injury. Next, we built a Hopf whole-brain model with coupled oscillators and conducted <italic>in silico</italic> perturbations to investigate the mechanistic principles underlying the reduced turbulent dynamics found in the empirical data. A simulated attack was used to account for the effect of focal lesions. This revealed a shift to lower coupling parameters in the TBI dataset and, critically, decreased susceptibility and information encoding capability. These findings confirm the potential of the turbulent framework to characterize whole-brain dynamics after TBI and validates the use of whole-brain models to monitor longitudinal changes in the reactivity to external perturbations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>whole-brain modeling</kwd><kwd>resting state fMRI</kwd><kwd>turbulent dynamics</kwd><kwd>traumatic brain injury</kwd><kwd><italic>in silico</italic> brain stimulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">There has been a growing interest in the development and application of large-scale, non-linear brain modeling methods to resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Breakspear, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cabral et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Deco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Deco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Deco &amp; Kringelbach, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Deco et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Deco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kringelbach &amp; Deco, 2020</xref>) as it offers whole-brain coverage and can be acquired in patient populations who are unable to perform cognitive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Demertzi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Escrichs et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">López-González et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, these methodological advancements have enabled reconceptualizing existing measures of non-linear dynamics in order to explain the complex dynamics of human brain activity. One prominent example is turbulence, which has been recently demonstrated in the healthy brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cruzat et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">De Filippi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Deco &amp; Kringelbach, 2020</xref>) and in patients with a disorder of consciousness following brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Escrichs et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we combine a turbulent dynamics framework (model-free) with a computational modeling approach (model-based) to characterize whole-brain dynamics in moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients during a one-year recovery period.</p><p id="P3">Traumatic brain injury is associated with a wide range of cognitive deficits, such as attentional or memory impairments or executive dysfunction, that are often persistent, contribute to poor functional outcomes and have a profound impact on the quality of life of the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">McAllister et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Ponsford et al., 2014</xref>). The emergence of cognitive function in the brain is contingent on the integrity of the structural connectome, especially long-range white matter connections that contribute to the small-world topology underlying the spatiotemporal dynamical patterns observed in a healthy regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bassett &amp; Bullmore, 2006</xref>). In addition to focal lesions, diffuse axonal injury (DAI) has been considered one of the main mechanisms of TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Jolly et al., 2021</xref>), leading to disturbances in long-range connections and ultimately disrupting the spatiotemporal properties of functional brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Caeyenberghs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hellyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jilka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kinnunen et al., 2011</xref>). Such structural and functional disruption results in long-term cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bonnelle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jilka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kinnunen et al., 2011</xref>) and may play a role in the progressive neurodegeneration associated with TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Sharp et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, reliable biomarkers accurately predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI have not been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">National Academies of Sciences et al., 2022</xref>). Here, resting state fMRI-based measures like turbulence could be clinically relevant as they can be assessed repeatedly without a specific cognitive task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">De Filippi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Deco &amp; Kringelbach, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Escrichs et al., 2022</xref>). Despite its clinical relevance, a better understanding of how TBI affects whole-brain dynamics longitudinally is still needed.</p><p id="P4">The shift towards describing the impact of brain injury in terms of changes in whole-brain dynamics holds great promise to bestow a common framework not only to characterize cognitive deficits after TBI but, more generally, to provide insights into the mechanistic principles that support brain function. One widely used approach to studying whole-brain dynamics is based on metastability, a dynamical regime where brain regions engage and disengage flexibly over time showing transient dynamical patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Friston, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Shanahan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tognoli &amp; Kelso, 2014</xref>). In the context of TBI, recent evidence has shown that patients had reduced global and network-level metastability compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hellyer et al., 2015</xref>). Critically, this reduction was associated with cognitive impairment and damage to structural connectivity suggesting that metastability may act as a conceptual bridge between brain structure and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tognoli &amp; Kelso, 2014</xref>). However, the concept of metastability measured as the variability over time of the global level of synchronization of the brain, commonly known as the global Kuramoto order parameter of a dynamical system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kuramoto, 1984</xref>), is limited as it cannot dissociate the dynamical patterns occurring at local spatial scales.</p><p id="P5">Recently, we have proposed an extension of metastability to account for such limitation based on turbulence theory developed first for fluid dynamics and since extended to other domains. As shown by Kuramoto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kuramoto, 1984</xref>), coupled oscillators can be used to describe synchronization globally through metastability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cabral et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Deco, Kringelbach, et al., 2017</xref>) and to capture turbulence using a measure of local metastability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kawamura et al., 2007</xref>). By combining Kuramoto’s framework with Kolmogorov’s concept of structure functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kolmogorov, 1941</xref>), turbulence can be calculated locally at different spatial scales in an analogy to the rotational vortices found in fluid dynamics. By taking this approach, we have found long-range correlations in higher-order task-specific regions that could be controlling a functional resting state core involving primary sensory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Deco &amp; Kringelbach, 2020</xref>). Further, the results from the whole-brain computational model indicated that turbulence is a good index of the information processing capability of the brain as both reached the maximum level at the optimal fitting of the model. When applied to a population of patients with disorders of consciousness —which is often altered in severe cases of TBI— turbulence was significantly reduced at large and intermediate distances, as was the sensitivity of the brain to respond to external perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Escrichs et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, the question arises as to whether similar alterations in whole-brain dynamics could be found after TBI, across different stages of recovery.</p><p id="P6">Here, by combining empirical and computational approaches, we investigated how whole-brain dynamics are affected by TBI measured at three time points (3-, 6- and 12-months post-injury) across one year. To do so, we used a publicly available resting state fMRI dataset of patients with moderate-to-severe TBI (N=14 in each session) and age-matched healthy individuals (N=12) and extracted the time series from each of the 1,000 parcels in the fine-grained Schaefer parcellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>). We tested the hypotheses that whole-brain amplitude turbulence would (i) accurately differentiate patients with TBI from healthy controls (HCs) and (ii) progressively approach the values of HCs across the one-year recovery trajectory. Furthermore, we expected to see other measures derived from the turbulent dynamics framework to discriminate between TBI patients and HCs. Finally, we anticipated that the whole-brain computational model would demonstrate that the brain’s capability to respond to external <italic>in silico</italic> perturbations is compromised after TBI.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Model-free approach</title><sec id="S4"><label>2.1.1</label><title>Participants and behavioral data</title><p id="P7">The source of data for this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>) was obtained from the open access repository OpenNeuro (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000220/versions/00002">https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000220/versions/00002</ext-link>). Please refer to the original publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Roy et al., 2017</xref>) for a full description of the participants included. Briefly, 14 patients with moderate-to-severe TBI between the ages of 18 and 36 with education ranging from 12 to 18 years, and 12 healthy controls (HCs) of comparable age and education were included. A Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) at time of injury was indicative of severe (3-8) and moderate (9-12) injury. The NIfTI images from 2 TBI patients were discarded due to incorrect labels (superior-inferior swap) as shown in FSLeyes. All subjects with TBI completed three separate sessions (3-, 6-, and 12-months following injury). Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from HCs at baseline was also included for group comparisons.

The preprocessed output files from SPM were imported into the CONN toolbox version 20.b (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/conn">https://www.nitrc.org/projects/conn</ext-link>), including the following subject- and session-specific files: T1 and rs-fMRI scans; segmented grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) images; and 6 realignment parameters after rigid body motion correction. We applied the same pipeline as in our previous publication with TBI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Martínez-Molina et al., 2022</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information for more details</xref>).

In the HCP website, a description of the acquisition parameters is detailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Setsompop et al., 2013</xref>). We used the Lead-DBS software package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.lead-dbs.org/">https://www.lead-dbs.org/</ext-link>) for the preprocessing of tractography data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Horn et al., 2017</xref>) which, briefly, were processed by using a q-sampling imaging algorithm implemented in DSI studio (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org">http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org</ext-link>). Segmentation of the T2-weighted anatomical images and co-registering the images to the b0 image of the diffusion data using SPM12 produced a WM mask. For each individual, 200,000 fibers were sampled within the WM mask. Fibers were transformed into MNI space using the Lead-DBS software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Horn &amp; Blankenburg, 2016</xref>). Finally, the structural connectivity (SC) using the Schaefer 1,000 parcellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>) was extracted with the standardized methods in the Lead-DBS. The SC was averaged across participants before the simulated attack.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><label>2.1.5</label><title>Simulated attack</title><p id="P12">In this approach, we used the binary lesion maps from the TBI patients provided by the authors of the original publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Roy et al., 2017</xref>) in order to simulate connectome attacks relative to the SC derived from healthy participants (see previous section). Our goal was to create a lesion mask matrix based on the lesions in the TBI patients that could be applied to the healthy SC. A similar methodology has been recently implemented in patients with aphasia and provided a good approximation of the effects of the real lesions on anatomic networks as well as explaining a comparable amount of variance in behavioral data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Medaglia et al., 2022</xref>). Further, virtual lesions have allowed to disentangle the local and recurrent components from TMS-EEG evoked potentials using a whole-brain connectome-based computational modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Momi et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The lesion masks for each TBI patient (N=11, one patient did not have visible lesions) in native space were normalized to MNI space (after normalization one patient was discarded due to misalignment) and the overlap with each node from the Schaefer 1000 nodes parcellation computed using the fslstats command in FSL v.6.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/">https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/</ext-link>). This value was divided by the volume of the Schaefer node to account for variability in the size of the nodes. We created the lesion mask matrix to simulate the lesion on the healthy SC using 4 thresholds: 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 standard deviations (SD) from the mean overlap volume of lesions in all TBI patients. Thus, for each TBI patient, we calculated the nodes to attack based on these four thresholds. This allowed us to calculate the frequency of lesion for a given node as well as find the unique nodes to attack, that is, nodes that were lesioned in any given patient. The lesion mask matrices thresholded at 3 and 4 SD only resulted in 10 and 7 nodes to attack and were discarded. The lesion mask matrices thresholded at 1.5 and 2 SD produced 41 and 22 nodes to attack. The simulated attack with the 1.5 and 2 SD lesion matrices was performed in two ways leading to the disconnection of the lesioned node: (1) a complete deletion of the SC between the node and the rest of the brain (binary approach, value set to 0 in the lesion mask matrix); (2) a weighted downregulation of the SC between the node and the rest of the brain. The weight was computed by calculating the number of patients with the lesioned node divided by the total number of TBI patients. Then the value in the lesion mask matrix between that node and the rest of the brain was set to 1 - weight. For each masking threshold, the SC was multiplied by the lesion mask matrix before running the computational modeling.

The results of the one-way ANOVA including amplitude turbulence in HCs (averaged across both sessions) and TBI patients at 3-, 6- and 12-months post-injury revealed a significant group effect for λ=0.03 in all 7 RSNs except for the limbic network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S14</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a</xref>). Post hoc we found that this effect was in all cases attributable to the difference between HCs and TBI patients at 6-months post-injury. In other words, this implies that after a decreased in turbulent dynamics at 6-months most RSNs recovered healthy levels by 12-months at this spatial scale. No significant group effect was found for λ=0.01.</p><p id="P34">To complement this analysis, we computed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance (KSD) that quantifies the difference in the distributions of node-level metastability between HCs and TBI patients. We found that the KSD monotonically decreases (i.e., distributions are more similar) across scales in all group comparisons, whereas the value of λ increases. In other words, the KSD is maximal for lower values of λ, i.e., long distances in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Remarkably, the highest KSD is found between HCs and TBI patients at 6-months post-injury (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S15</xref>).</p><p id="P35">For illustrative purposes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> displays the absolute difference in node-level metastability between HCs and TBI patients at 3-,6- and 12-months post-injury at λ= 0.03 rendered onto the brain cortex.

The battery included those tests more sensitive to detect deficits in processing speed and working memory that are common after TBI (see Material and Methods). We found a positive association between Digital Span (Forward and Backward) and information cascade flow at λ=0.01 (large spatial scale) (r=0.754, p=0.007, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S16</xref>). This result survived multiple-comparison correction with FDR across number of battery tests (p-adj=0.042). In other words, the greater the propagation of information between consecutive spatial scales, the better the working memory performance. Furthermore, we found that performance in this working memory task was also positively associated with turbulence in the default mode network for λ=0.03 (r=0.744, p=0.009, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S17</xref>). This result also survived multiple-comparison correction with FDR across number of battery tests (p-adj=0.045). Lesion volume did not correlate neither with cognitive performance nor with amplitude turbulence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23"><label>3.2</label><title>Model-based framework</title><p id="P37">We defined a whole-brain model of coupled oscillators (Stuart-Landau oscillators) for each time point of the TBI patients and HCs rs-fMRI data. To account for the effect of focal lesions on the structural connectivity (SC) we adopted a simulated attack approach with lesion mask matrices thresholded at 1.5 and 2 standard deviations (SD) and applied a binary or weighted attack resulting in a total of 4 simulated attacks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b</xref>). Additionally, for each time point of the TBI patients’ dataset, a computational model was run with intact healthy SC to assess the sensitivity of the model to the simulated attack. In total, 11 different whole-brain computational models were computed for the 1.5 SD lesion mask. To optimize the fitting between the whole-brain model and the empirical rs-fMRI data, we varied the global coupling parameter G from 0 to 3 in steps of 0.01, and for each G value, we ran 100 simulations with the same TR (2s) and time duration (145 scans) as the empirical rs-fMRI data. We then determined the optimal working point of each model as the minimum of the fitting level. Next, we calculated differences in susceptibility and information encoding capability and susceptibility between groups (HCs session 1 and 2; TBI patients at 3-, 6- and 12-months post-injury) after <italic>in silico</italic> perturbations.</p><p id="P38">We first identified the working point G for each rs-fMRI dataset, which represents the global coupling parameter. First, we found that the working point of the model was lower for the TBI patients at all time points (3-,6- and 12-months post-injury) as compared with the value for both sessions of HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5a-c</xref>) regardless of whether an intact or lesioned SC was used as input to the model. Crucially, we detected the same pattern, that is, the global coupling parameter for TBI patients at 6-months was smaller than that at 3- and 12-months post-injury. Second, the global coupling parameter shifted to lower values after the simulated attack with both thresholds (1.5 and 2 SD). However, the difference with respect to the intact healthy SC was small. And the binary approach did not yield to smaller values than the weighted (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S18</xref>).</p><p id="P39">Once we identified the working point G for each rs-fMRI dataset, we introduced external perturbations by changing the local bifurcation parameter a<sub>n</sub> of each brain node n. For each value of G, we perturbed the whole-brain model 100 times with random parameters for the local bifurcation parameter. Our model-based measures, susceptibility and information encoding capability, allowed us to evaluate the reactivity to the external perturbations introduced (for more details see Material and Methods). Briefly, susceptibility was estimated by first measuring the perturbed and non-perturbed modulus of the Kuramoto local order parameter and then calculating the difference between the perturbed and non-perturbed cases averaged across time, trials, and brain nodes. As an extension of this measure, the information encoding capability of the whole-brain model was calculated as the standard deviation across trials of the difference between the perturbed and unperturbed mean of the modulus of the local order parameter across time, averaged over all brain nodes.</p><p id="P40"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d-e</xref> shows that both susceptibility and information encoding capability were significantly reduced in TBI patients across the recovery trajectory compared to both sessions of HCs regardless of whether an intact or lesioned SC was used as input to the model. However, the values of these measures for the binary simulated attack were significantly reduced at all stages of recovery with respect to the values in the weighted simulated attack suggesting that the model is most sensitive to focal lesions that greatly overlap. Since in this cohort of TBI patients the frequency of lesion per node was mostly 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S19</xref>), the results from the weighted attack may be more representative of the underlying average SC. With the 1.5 SD weighted lesion mask matrix, TBI patients at 6-months post-injury showed the lowest mean value across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5d-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S20-21</xref>). This pattern of results was replicated when using the weighted 2 SD lesion mask (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S22-23</xref>). Therefore, the results from our <italic>in silico</italic> stimulation suggest that, at 6-months post-injury, the brain in this cohort of TBI patients is working in a regime that is the least responsive to external perturbations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S24" sec-type="discussion"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P41">Here we investigated how TBI impacts whole-brain resting state fMRI dynamics using a turbulence-based framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Deco &amp; Kringelbach, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Deco et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings revealed specific spatial patterns of reduction in global amplitude turbulence between HCs and TBI patients at all three time points (3-, 6- and 12-months post-injury) differentially affecting long distances in the brain. Noteworthily, the greatest mean difference was observed between HCs and TBI patients at 6-months at all significant λ values. This was also the stage of recovery where we found differences in amplitude turbulence over time at long distances. Between group differences were also found at long distances for the other turbulent measures except for information transfer, where short distances were affected and no differences found in the longitudinal analysis. Importantly, when analyzing network-level turbulence between HCs and TBI patients for λ=0.03 (long distances), we found that, after a significant decrease at 6-months post-injury, amplitude turbulence recovers healthy levels in all RSNs except for the limbic by 12-months. Finally, the results from the whole-brain model indicated that susceptibility and information encoding capability are significantly reduced after TBI, with the largest difference again in the comparison between HCs and TBI patients at 6-months post-injury regardless of whether an intact or lesioned SC was used as input to the model. These results provide causal links needed for a better understanding of the recovery process one year after TBI. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the longitudinal evolution of turbulent dynamics during recovery from TBI.</p><p id="P42">Our empirical finding of reduced turbulence at long distances after TBI as compared to HCs is in alignment with previous work showing a reduction in global metastability in TBI patients as compared with healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hellyer et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the turbulent dynamics framework adopted here lends indirect support to the graph theory results obtained in the same dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Roy et al., 2017</xref>) and extends those findings by offering a dynamical approach across spatial scales and a causal perspective on the information processing deficits following TBI during one year. Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Roy et al. (2017)</xref> have shown that global functional hyperconnectivity, in terms of network strength, peaked at 6-months post-injury. Of note, the local analysis revealed hyperconnectivity in the left frontal DMN and temporo-parietal attentional control networks across time points but was only associated with an increased cost at 6-months post-injury. Moreover, a cost-efficiency analysis showed that this elevated cost was mostly due to a higher number of medium-range connections rather than long-range connections. This fits well with our network-level finding where turbulence is reduced at 6-months post-injury in most RSNs with no residual effects after 12-months, when there was no cost associated with hyperconnectivity. Remarkably, we also found that the 15% quantile nodes in the HCs vs. TBI patients at 6-months were in the SM, DAT and CNT networks, in accordance with increased cost found in the temporo-parietal control network by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Roy et al. (2017)</xref>. Overall, our network-level findings suggest a shift in the functional plasticity of the brain in response to TBI where the turbulent dynamics at large distances rebalances to a healthy regime during the period spanning from 6 months to 12 months post-injury.</p><p id="P43">Regarding brain-behavior relationships, we found that performance on the Digit Span task (Forward and Backward) was positively associated with information cascade flow and amplitude turbulence in the DMN at long distances. This task is used to evaluate working memory processes, which are commonly affected after TBI, and requires the rapid communication across large-scale brain networks involving sensory (patients are read a sequence of numbers) and higher-order regions responsible for the manipulation of information for temporary use. Our findings suggest that the propagation of information between consecutive spatial scales and higher levels of amplitude in the DMN at rest might be an important dynamical mechanism to support working memory tasks. However, future work with larger sample sizes could better characterize additional associations between turbulent measures and performance in other cognitive domains as this has been previously found for metastability and cognitive flexibility, information processing and associative memory after TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hellyer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P44">Our computational findings are consistent with our empirical results, demonstrating that TBI hinders the reactivity of the brain to external <italic>in silico</italic> perturbations. When fitting the Hopf model to each empirical condition, we found lower values in the optimal working point for TBI patients across time points regardless of whether an intact or lesioned SC was used as input to the model. However, significant differences between the binary and the weighted approach emerged when examining the susceptibility and information encoding capability after our <italic>in silico</italic> perturbation. Indeed, the values of these measures for the binary simulated attack were significantly reduced at all stages of recovery with respect to the values in the weighted simulated attack. This is indicative that these measures are less affected by a distributed pattern of lesions, as the one in this cohort of TBI patients, and may be more sensitive to focal lesions that greatly overlap in the sample. Whether this result is contingent upon the anatomical identity (and connectivity profile) of the lesions remains an interesting question for future research. That said, we believe that this is an interesting finding on its own, highlighting the importance of the impact that focal lesions may have in other patients’ populations, such as stroke, where usually most patients present a lesion in the vascular territory of the middle cerebral artery and there is greater degree of overlap.</p><p id="P45">The results from the present study have some potential clinical implications. Turbulent measures might be used to improve clinical diagnosis and prognosis after TBI as they demonstrated sensitivity to the longitudinal changes in whole-brain dynamics compared to HCs. However, further information regarding the relationship of these measures and TBI severity is still needed and calls for collaborative efforts to perform these analyses on large cohorts of patients. On the other hand, information processing-based measures obtained from resting state data could provide a meaningful and repeatable way to monitor the evolution of TBI, the recovery progress, and the patient’s possible response to treatments as these remain prominent challenges in clinical settings to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">National Academies of Sciences et al., 2022</xref>). Our <italic>in silico</italic> perturbation approach with the Hopf computational model also indicated reduced coupling and reactivity to external stimulation after TBI across time points. We restricted our perturbative protocol to the introduction of random values in all nodes to modify the local bifurcation parameter of the model. That being said, it would be interesting to implement an excitatory protocol for individual nodes or a subset of relevant nodes in order to identify brain targets that can be stimulated with techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Demirtas-Tatlidede et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, some promising results indicate that TMS and neurorehabilitation may act synergistically to improve functional outcomes after TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Nardone et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, we leave the implementation of such perturbative protocol for future work.</p><p id="P46">It is also worthwhile to acknowledge some limitations in the current study. Although this dataset represents a relatively homogenous sample in terms of age and time since injury, it remains of small size and a replication with a larger cohort of patients is needed to assess the generalizability of these results. In addition, the resting state sequence comprised 150 scans with a temporal resolution of 2s that were acquired over a 5-minute period. While it has been shown that functional correlation of RSNs only stabilizes after 5-min with TR=2.3s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Van Dijk et al., 2010</xref>), recent evidence indicates that metastability is less affected by temporal resolution and shows greater reliability in short-term scans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). Even if our simulated attack approach allowed us to take into account the effect of focal lesions on the SC, it leaves aside inter-individual differences in SC and future studies with personalized models are warranted to validate our findings. Finally, although we were able to partially replicate our results using the 400 node Schaefer parcellation, it remains unknown how they may be affected when using a different atlas.</p><p id="P47">In conclusion, we have shown that whole-brain turbulent dynamics complement previous findings on the temporal evolution of functional connectivity after TBI in an open access dataset of healthy controls and patients with data collected after 3-, 6- and 12-months post-injury. Specifically, our empirical results suggest the presence of maladaptive neuroplasticity at 6-months post-injury as manifested in the reduction of global amplitude turbulence at long distances. Thus, we demonstrated that the framework of turbulent dynamics may facilitate our understanding of how the brain responds to traumatic injury. Importantly, our computational approach suggests that in this cohort of moderate-to-severe TBI patients, their brain is the least reactive to external perturbations at 6-months post-injury during the recovery trajectory.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supporting Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS189687-supplement-Supporting_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d33aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Funding</title><p>N.M.M. was supported by the Beatriu de Pinós programme (grant agreement no. 2019-BP-00032) from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie agreement no. 801370.

T1-weighted (T1-W) and resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients were collected at three time points (3-, 6- and 12-months post-injury). For group comparisons, T1-W and rs-fMRI were collected from age-matched healthy controls in two sessions. <bold>(a)</bold> Model-free approach. Top left: rs-fMRI data were preprocessed in the CONN toolbox and the time series were extracted for each of the 1,000 nodes in the Schaefer parcellation and the instantaneous phase calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Schaefer et al, 2018</xref>). Bottom left: Visualization of the change over time and space of the Kuramoto local order parameter in a healthy subject (left hemisphere). The Kuramoto local order parameter can define the turbulent signatures of brain activity at different spatial scales in the vortex space. Here, we computed four turbulent measures based on the Kuramoto local order parameter to characterize the brain’s information processing: amplitude turbulence, information cascade flow, information cascade and information transfer (see Methods for more details). <bold>(b)</bold> Model-based approach and simulated attack. We built Hopf whole-brain dynamical models that described the intrinsic dynamics of each brain area by a Stuart-Landau non-linear oscillator. Such local oscillators are linked through the underlying structural connectivity to simulate the global dynamics. We used the DTI matrix with the exponential distance rule and long-range exceptions as structural connectivity to fit the empirical data as a function of the Euclidean distance. To account for the effect of focal lesions, we adapted a simulated attack approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Medaglia et al., 2022</xref>). The overlap between the patient’s specific lesion mask and the Schaefer parcellation was calculated and used to create a group lesion mask thresholded at 1.5 and 2 SD from the group’s overlap. Next, a binary or weighted disconnection was applied to the group lesion mask. For each threshold and disconnection approaches, a model was computed by multiplying the structural connectivity by the group lesion mask. Then we applied <italic>in silico</italic> perturbations to assess the model’s reaction for each time point in the TBI group compared to healthy controls using the susceptibility and information encoding capability model-based measures (bottom panels adapted with permission from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Deco &amp; Kringelbach, 2020</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS189687-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Turbulent dynamic measures differ between TBI patients and healthy controls over time, peaking at 6-months post-injury.</title><p>Significant differences in turbulent-like dynamics between healthy controls (HCs, averaged across sessions) and TBI patients at 3-, 6- and 12-months post-injury were calculated using a 4 (Group) x 10 (Lambda) ANOVA.
