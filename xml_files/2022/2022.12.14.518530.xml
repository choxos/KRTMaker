However, how circuits regulate the dynamic range of sensitivity to sensory stimuli is not well understood. A given odor is represented in the insect mushroom bodies (MBs) by sparse combinatorial coding by Kenyon cells (KCs), forming an odor quality representation. To address how intensity of sensory stimuli is processed at the level of the MB input region, the calyx, we characterized a set of novel mushroom body output neurons that respond only to high odor concentrations.</p><p id="P2">We show that a pair of MB calyx output neurons, MBONa1/2, are postsynaptic in the MB calyx, where they receive extensive synaptic inputs from KC dendrites, the inhibitory feedback neuron APL, and octopaminergic sVUM1 neurons, but relatively few inputs from projection neurons. This pattern is broadly consistent in the third instar larva as well as in the first instar connectome. MBONa1/a2 presynaptic terminals innervate a region immediately surrounding the MB medial lobe output region in the ipsilateral and contralateral brain hemispheres. By monitoring calcium activity using jRCamP1b, we find that MBONa1/a2 responses are odor-concentration dependent, responding only to ethyl acetate (EA) concentrations higher than a 200-fold dilution, in contrast to MB neurons which are relatively concentration-invariant and respond to EA dilutions as low as 10<sup>-4</sup>. Optogenetic activation of the calyx-innervating sVUM1 modulatory neurons originating in the SEZ (Subesophageal zone), did not show a detectable effect on MBONa1/a2 odor responses. Optogenetic activation of MBONa1/a2 using CsChrimson impaired odor discrimination learning compared to controls. We propose that MBONa1/a2 form an output channel of the calyx, summing convergent sensory and modulatory input, firing only to high odor concentration, and might affect the activity of downstream MB targets.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>calyx</kwd><kwd>mushroom bodies</kwd><kwd>MBONs</kwd><kwd>odor discrimination learning</kwd><kwd>intensity coding</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">To respond adaptively to environmental stimuli, sensory signals defined as sensory objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gottfried, 2010</xref>), must be encoded in neural representations that are highly selective, to be useful for formation and retrieval of memories. The recognition of sensory objects depends on the selective pattern of activation of a few numbers of neurons at higher centers in the brain, using a combinatorial coding mechanism that is shared across different sensory modalities in insects and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Perez-Orive et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Quiroga et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Settler and Axel, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">DeWeese et al., 2003</xref>). However, the dynamic range of intensity of sensory signals can be large. For example in vision, the dynamic range of light intensities is in the order of 10<sup>10</sup>; in olfaction rats can recognize odors over a 50,000-fold range in intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Homma et al., 2009</xref>), and still a unique image or smell must be recognized across a large range of intensities. The control of gain in the visual pathway is found at many levels, for example by negative feedback of horizontal cells on photoreceptors, and amacrine cells on bipolar cells, the presynaptic cells of ganglion cells. However, how different levels of intensity are encoded and integrated to generate a unique representation of a given sensory object at the higher centers of the brain is not well understood.</p><p id="P4">The olfactory system shares principles of information processing across insects and mammals, and the numerical simplicity of brains in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, makes it a good model to study olfactory coding. Odors are detected by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the fly antennae and maxillary palp, or dorsal organ in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. OSNs have different affinities for their ligands, and the combinatorial pattern of their activation is represented in the antennal lobe (AL), the first olfactory center. Here, a nonlinear transformation of intensity coding takes place, weak signals are enhanced and strong signals suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bhandawat et al., 2007</xref>), a principle also found in honeybees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sachse and Galizia, 2003</xref>). Therefore, the AL plays a role in improving signal to noise, adjusting the gain, a process that is regulated by lateral inhibition by the local inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Asahina et al., 2009</xref>). Response tuning of individual OSNs in larvae studied by electrophysiological recordings, showed that individual OSNs respond to different dilutions of an odor, in a range of dilutions over 10<sup>-2</sup> to 10<sup>-4</sup>, and that the combined responses of OSNs allowed larvae to perceive and discriminate odors in an odor preference test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kreher et al., 2008</xref>). Compared to projection neurons (PNs) that are broadly responsive, Kenyon cells (KCs) in the mushroom body (MB) are selective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Perez-Orive et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting a transformation in odor coding between PN input and KC processing. The anatomical organization of KCs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval MBs predicts the use of a combinatorial code for odors, generating an odor identity channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 2005</xref>). KCs are quiescent and respond with one or 2 spikes to PN input, and their responses are relatively concentration-invariant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Stopfer et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Ito et al., 2008</xref>). In the mammalian piriform cortex, odor identity is suggested to be encoded in a subset of odor concentration-invariant piriform cortex neurons, while piriform cortex neurons can respond to a 100-fold concentration range with different odor representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Roland et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P5">To understand the neural circuitry that regulates the selectivity of sensory representations, and its regulation by odor intensity, we use the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval MB calyx. MBs are centers for associative learning in the insect brain, and the calyx is the dendritic input region with a role in odor discrimination. The calyx receives stereotypic input from projection neurons (PNs) and is innervated by a feedback inhibitory neuron, the larval APL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">2014</xref>), and two octopaminergic neurons called sVUM1 originating in the SEZ, which can modulate behavioral odor discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Wong, Wan et al., 2021</xref>). Two output neurons, named MBONa-1 and MBONa-2, arborize in the MB calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Saumweber et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Odd neurons are a group of eight neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Slater et al., 2015</xref>) that include two neurons named MBONa1/a2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Saumweber et al., 2018</xref>) that widely innervate the calyx of the MBs, and have been proposed to receive multiple PN inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Slater et al., 2015</xref>). Odors can be discriminated by a combinatorial mechanism at the MB calyx, that allows the representation of many odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 2005</xref>). The balance between discrimination and sensitivity affects learning; higher sensitivity could improve learning, while lower sensitivity could decrease learning, while improving discrimination. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Slater et al., (2015</xref>) showed that Odd neurons enhanced the ability to discriminate different concentrations of odors in a chemotaxis assay; however, learning was not tested.</p><p id="P7">We have shown previously that the calyx-innervating Odd neurons, MBONa1/a2, labeled by <italic>GAL4-OK263</italic>, have potential synaptic contacts with both octopaminergic sVUM1 neurons, sVUMmd1 and sVUMmx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Wong, Wan et al., 2021</xref>), and therefore MBONa1/a2 might be subject to modulation by OA input.</p><p id="P8">Here we characterize the connections and polarity of MBONa1/a2 neurons in the larval calyx. We show that MBONa1/a2 respond to odor in a concentration-dependent manner, in contrast to the relatively concentration-invariant KCs. They also affect learning performance, although not in a strongly concentration-dependent manner. MBONa1/a2 may nonetheless represent a channel that conveys odor intensity information to the output region of the MBs, and therefore could potentially have a role in concentration-dependent modulation of MB output neurons and signals.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Fly stocks</title><p id="P9">All stocks were maintained on cornmeal-yeast-agar medium at 25°C in a 12-hour day/night cycle.

The vertical illuminator aperture was minimized to a diameter of approximately twice that of the calyx (from a dorsal view) and centered within the camera’s field of view. A 470nm LED and power supply (Cairn Research, OPTOLED Light source) with an LED mount (Cairn Research, LED mount) was used alongside Polygon400 (polygon400-G) for patterned illumination.

A region of interest (ROI) was selected to correspond to the responding pixels with highest standard deviation, ensuring the same ROI was obtained when comparisons were to be made between different stimulation conditions. The Z-axis profile function was then used to quantify the fluorescence changes over time which were subsequently saved as Excel files. The same ROI outline was then moved to an adjacent, non-responding region and the procedure was repeated to calculate background fluorescence over time. After subtracting background fluorescence from each frame, baseline fluorescence calculated as the average of the first 10 frames before odor delivery, were subtracted from each frame value to obtain ΔF. Normalized signal intensity ΔF/F at each time point was calculated by dividing ΔF over baseline fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 2014</xref>). To ensure these changes were not due to the order in which concentrations were tested (possibility for adaptation affecting the results for the later tested concentrations), randomization of the order in which the concentrations were tested was also practiced. In this experiment and subsequent experiments, data from larvae that had moved during imaging were excluded as it was impossible to tell if the fluorescence change was due to movement or an odor response. Each acquisition consisted of 60 frames of background-subtracted intensity data acquired over 12 seconds.

We therefore tested the hypothesis that MBONa1/a2 affect discrimination learning in an odor concentration-dependent manner, by optogenetic activation of MBONa1/a2 using the long-wavelength-absorbing channelrhodopsin, CsChrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) driven by the split line <italic>64F07-p65.AD</italic> (X)<italic>; R57C10-GAL4DBD (III)</italic>. As controls we used the progeny of the <italic>Canton S</italic> line crossed to the reporter CsChrimson. We measured learning scores after conditioning with amber light (to activate CsChrimson if expressed) or blue light as control, at two different concentrations of EA and pentyl acetate (PA): a higher concentration with dilutions of EA2000:PA500 and a lower concentration with dilutions of EA4000:PA1000.</p><p id="P57">Activation of MBONA1/a2 neurons in amber light during conditioning led to a lowered learning score compared to blue light at both odorant concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). A 2-way ANOVA test on this genotype showed a significant effect of amber light (P = 0.0193), and no significant effect of concentration (P &gt; 0.4). While conditioning under amber light appeared to have a larger effect at the higher odorant concentration than at the lower one, ANOVA showed no significant interaction between light and concentration (P &gt; 0.6), suggesting that the effect of light (and CsChrimson activation in MBONa1/a2) was statistically indistinguishable across both concentrations. A similar analysis of the control cross showed similar learning scores to the experimental cross under blue light, but in contrast to the experimental cross, there was no effect of amber light (P &gt; 0.6). As in the experimental cross, there was no effect of concentration in the control cross (P &gt; 0.05). We therefore conclude that activation of MBONa1/a2 impairs olfactory discrimination reward learning in larvae, but that there is not a statistically detectable dependence of this effect on odor concentration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S29" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S30"><title>MBONa1/a2 show major contacts with KCs, APL, and sVUM1s but not PNs</title><p id="P58">The larval calyx is organized in about 34 glomeruli, sites of PN cholinergic terminal boutons synapsing with KC dendrites that are visualized by anti-DLG as the shape of a bouquet of round structures around a central core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 2005</xref>). MBONa1/a2 arborize in the core of the calyx and interglomerular space, with processes abutting glomeruli but clearly avoiding their interior, suggesting that synapses onto MBONa1/a2 occur at non-glomerular space, suggesting that they might not receive direct PN input.</p><p id="P59">Contrary to our expectations based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Slater et al., (2015</xref>), who showed GRASP signals between PNs and Odd neurons in the calyx, GRASP signals were rare or atypical between PNs and the MBONa1 or MBONa2 labeled <italic>by 68B12-GAL4</italic>. Long axonal tracts bordering the inner surface of a few glomeruli were observed labeled with GFP. There was no co-localization of GRASP with OA, suggesting that these tracts were not likely to be non-glomerular synaptic sites of PNs onto sVUMs and MBONa1/a2. The possibility exists that MBONa1/a2 would make synapses with PNs in the core of the calyx, where PN axons are also traversing, however, GRASP signal between MBONa1/a2 and PNs were not observed in the core of the calyx. Our evidence favors the view that PNs do not provide direct input onto MBONa1/a2, suggesting that olfactory input is not delivered directly onto MBONa1/a2 by the olfactory PNs.</p><p id="P60">We have shown previously that MBONa1/a2 labeled by <italic>OK263-GAL4</italic> have many contacts with OA neurons at interglomerular sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Wong, Wan et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Here we have shown that KCs also have contact sites with the MBONa1 or a2 labeled by <italic>68B12-GAL4</italic> in regions neighboring glomeruli. GRASP signals between KCs and MBONa1/a2 resemble a mesh rather than the typical dot-like signals. This might be caused by the density of KC processes in the core of the calyx and limited space between glomeruli making it easier for MBONa1/a2 processes to become in close proximity to KC processes. Nevertheless, typical GRASP signals with high GFP intensity were seen near OA labeling, suggesting proximity to synapses between KCs and sVUM1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), a feature observed in previous EM analysis, showing divergent synapses of sVUM1 neurons onto MBONa1/a2, APL and KCs (Wong, Wan et al., 2020, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref> bottom three panels). KC dendrites are known to have presynaptic sites at a distance from the dendritic region containing the synapses between PNs and KCs, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Christiansen et al., 2011</xref>), therefore KC contacts in the calyx core or interglomerular space could be KC presynaptic sites onto MBONa1/a2.</p><p id="P61">Contacts between the larval APL and the single MBONa1/a2 neuron labeled by <italic>68B12-GAL4</italic> formed characteristic dot-like GRASP signals, that overlapped with GABA often at one end of a large GABAergic APL bouton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2Biii</xref>). Not all GABA termini showed GRASP signals, and GRASP signals were in the calyx core and interglomerular space. Since APL is presynaptic in the calyx (Wong, Wan et al. 2020), this suggests that APL synapses onto MBONa1/a2.</p><p id="P62">We found that MBONa1/a2 processes have a clear polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>): in the calyx processes are mainly postsynaptic, labeled by the postsynaptic marker DenMark::mCherry, and only a few puncta labeled by Syt::GFP or n-Syb::GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref>), whereas the output region surrounding the medial lobe is presynaptic and labeled by Syt::GFP and nSyb::GFP, suggesting that MBONa1/a2 receive predominantly inputs at the calyx. This suggests that APL, sVUM1s, and even KCs are likely presynaptic to MBONa1/a2 in the calyx, suggesting a role for MBONa1/a2 as integrators of multiple inputs, rather that relay neurons of olfactory input.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Comparison with the first instar connectome</title><p id="P63">The first instar (6-hr) larva connectome provides a comprehensive map of synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>). However, neurons can be immature at this stage, and therefore we compared the annotated connections with those that we found in the more mature 3rd instar larvae. MBONa1/a2, known also as MBE7a/b in the connectome, shows a similar morphology to MBONa1/a2 in the 3rd instar; 2 neurons have been annotated with similar and spatially overlapping projections to the calyx, ipsilateral medial lobe and contralateral medial lobe. MBONa1/a2 processes in the first-instar calyx were postsynaptic: in the right brain, only 6 synapses were presynaptic compared to more than 600 postsynaptic sites, in agreement with our observations in 3rd instar larvae.</p><p id="P64">We have previously shown that at the EM level, sVUM1 neurons have divergent synapses onto MBONa1/a2, KCs and APL; and that these synapses are surrounded by many KC processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Wong, Wan et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref> bottom three panels). Here we found that synapses of KCs on MBONa1/a2 are also divergent, synapsing onto MBONa1, MBON a2, and KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, top panel); APL also shows divergent synapses onto MBONa1 and a KC. Therefore, in the calyx synapses between the different types of calyx neurons, KCs, APL, sVUM1s, and MBONa1/a2 appear to be co-localized. This is consistent with our GRASP analysis between KCs and MBONa1/a2, where GRASP signal co-localizes with OA labeling in the calyx, suggesting the presence of synaptically rich regions localized to regions that neighbor glomeruli or in the core of the calyx.</p><p id="P65">Our CATMAID analysis shows that only a few PNs synapse onto MBONa1/a2. Since there are at least 21 olfactory PNs, it is unlikely that PNs are a major input into MBONa1/a2. This is consistent with our GRASP results in which GRASP signals between PNs and MBONa1/a2 labeled tracts with no distinct punctate localization, suggesting that the signal on tracts may not be synaptic contacts as interpreted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Slater et al., 2015</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P66">We found that KCs are the major input to MBONa1/a2 in the calyx. KCs form more than 600 synapses onto MBONa1/a2 in the right brain calyx, which are 90% of total MBONa1/a2 calyx inputs, and considering that there are 223 KCs at this early stage in the brain, summing up left and right brain KC numbers, potentially all KCs could input into MBONa1/a2. sVUM1 and APL also have inputs into MBONa1/a2, suggesting that MBONa1/a2 can be activated by KCs, but also integrate calyx inhibitory and modulatory input.</p><p id="P67">A difference from the 3rd instar larvae was found in the output region of first-instar MBONa1/a2, where synapses were a mix of pre- and post -synaptic sites without a defined polarity: 68 presynaptic sites and 56 postsynaptic sites in the right brain. However, there was a regional segregation of these synapses, with branches that were exclusively presynaptic or postsynaptic. This is in contrast to the 3rd instar output region which appears exclusively presynaptic using presynaptic and dendritic markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). This might be due to a developmental issue, if the postsynaptic projections in the medial lobe contain immature synapses that are subsequently removed or pruned. Immature synapses are common at this stage; for example for KCs, nearly 65% are immature, defined by lack of dendrites, or tiny dendrites and processes with endings typical of growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>). The output region had synapses between MBONa1/a2 in CATMAID; however, presynaptic vesicles were ambiguous and there were only a small number of synapses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), questioning whether these were true synapses. However, this observation raises the possibility that MBONa1/a2 may provide bidirectional input to each other.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Concentration dependence of MBONa1/a2</title><p id="P68">Our anatomical studies show that MBONa1/a2 neurons ramify extensively throughout the calyx core and interglomerular space and receive few direct PN inputs, casting doubt on whether they might be activated by odor input. However, specific expression of jRCAMP1b in MBONa1/a2 using the split line <italic>64FO7-p65.AD (X); R57C10-GAL4DBD (III)</italic> showed odor-evoked response in the postsynaptic dendrites in the calyx at localized regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Moreover, the response was concentration-dependent, showing graded responses to increasing concentrations of odor. The dynamic range was narrow, lying between a 10-fold and 200-fold dilutions, and the latter concentration gave only a negligible response. In sharp contrast, KCs responded to odors at a dilution as low as 10<sup>-4</sup>. Also in adult flies, KCs respond to odorant dilutions of 10<sup>-5</sup> to 10<sup>-2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, MBONa1/a2 have a high threshold of activation. Their extensive ramification in the calyx predicts a high capacitance that could rise the threshold of firing, compared to KCs that innervate only a few to 5 glomeruli in the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 2005</xref>). This is the first time that the specific concentration-dependence of MBONa1/a2 is reported; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Slater et al., (2015</xref>) analyzed concentration-dependence for the apple cider vinegar, ACV, in <italic>Odd-GAL4</italic>-expressing cell bodies, that they reported to label 8 neurons including 3 innervating the calyx, only within a relatively high concentration range of 10-fold to 20-fold dilution. The concentration dependence of MBONa1/a2 reported here, in light of their anatomical organization that shows no regional arborization of dendrites in the calyx, suggests that they have a role in odor intensity coding, as opposed to KCs that work in a combinatorial mechanism that allows odor discrimination and encoding of many odors.</p><p id="P69">CATMAID and GRASP analysis in 3rd instar larvae are consistent with MBONa1/a2 receiving their major input from KCs, sVUM1s, and APL neurons innervating the calyx. This implies that the source of olfactory input onto MBONa1/a2 might be an indirect activation of MBONa1/a2 mediated by other calyx neurons; for example KC dendrites, and APL terminals in the calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 2014</xref>) are activated by odors. KCs are known to possess presynapses at the dendrites in the calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Christiansen et al., 2011</xref>) and would be the most obvious candidate to activate MBONa1/a2 dendrites. The odor-evoked response by KCs in the calyx, showed activation of a few glomeruli, consistent with one odor activating a few olfactory receptors that act in a combinatorial manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>). In flies it has also been shown that the EA-evoked odor response in KCs localizes to particular calycal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wan et al., 2004</xref>). The odor-evoked response of MBONa1/a2 in the calyx also showed preferential localized activation, as opposed to whole activation of the dendritic processes in the calyx, similar to the pattern of localized glomerular activation observed in the calyx by the odor-evoked activation of KCs, suggesting that MBONa1/a2 dendritic processes in the vicinity of KC processes activated in glomeruli by PN input, might receive input from KCs. The picture that emerges is that MBONa1/a2 are postsynaptic to KCs, generating an output channel that encodes the intensity of olfactory input indirectly.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>State dependent signals and MBONa1/a2</title><p id="P70">Octopaminergic neurons are positive neuromodulators of circuit function, for example in the motion vision system in the fly, they provide input to motion detection neurons and are involved in their temporal tuning, by increasing the excitability of medulla input neurons (Strother et al., 2017). We have previously shown that activation of sVUM1s OA neurons innervating the calyx, impair the behavioral discrimination of sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Wong, Wan et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting a role of calyx-innervating OA neurons in modulating calyx circuit activity. To test whether sVUM1 neurons in the calyx would modulate the excitability of MBONa1/a2, we activated Tdc2 neurons, by optogenetic stimulation of ChR2-XXL. Localized odor-evoked responses were observed in both the calyx and output region of MBONa1/a2 upon prior optogenetic activation of sVUM1 neurons, similar to an odor response in the specific split line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The time course of odor plus light response in the calyx showed an earlier rise immediately after the light pulse and was also longer lasting than the odor only response which return to baseline after 13 seconds, showing that light alone has an effect on MBONa1/a2 activity. On the other hand in the output region, the odor response did not return to baseline after 13s, and the light plus odor response still remained high after 13 seconds. The difference between the response in the calyx and the output response could be mediated by the larval APL, a feedback neuron, that would shut down the response in the calyx, since MBONa1/a2 receive significant input from APL in the calyx, also shown by GRASP signals between MBONa1/a2 and APL.</p><p id="P71">When comparing the theoretical sum of the light only response and odor only response to the experimental odor-evoked response with prior light stimulation, there was no enhancement of the odor-evoked response in MBONa1/a2 in the calyx nor the output region, but only an additive effect of light stimulation. It is interesting to note that the light only response of MBONa1/a2 in the calyx shows an increase in response, while the light only response in the output region showed no increase by light alone, suggesting that the effect of light is specific to the activation of ChR2-XXL upstream of the MBONa1/a2 in the calyx. Our controls without driver Tdc-GAL4 showed no statistically significant difference between odor-evoked response with or without prior light stimulation, suggesting that at least some effect could originate in Tdc2 activation. Therefore, activation of sVUM1 neurons did not have a significant effect on the enhancement of the odor response in MBONa1/a2.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Behavioral role of MBONa1/a2</title><p id="P72"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mishra et al., (2013</xref>) have shown that learnability in <italic>Drosophila larvae</italic> is dependent on the odor intensity at training, i.e. when the concentration at training matches the concentration of testing in an associative learning paradigm, larvae perform more efficient learning compared to lower or higher concentrations of the conditioning odor during testing. Therefore, the learning circuits in the MBs, must have mechanisms to adjust the intensity of odor signal for optimal learning.</p><p id="P73">The neural basis of associative learning resides at the output synapses between KCs on MBONs that innervate the lobes in a compartment specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Owald et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, these are synaptic sites where learning related plasticity could be induced. In our CATMAID analysis we observed that MBONa1/a2 are presynaptic to many MBONs, as well as modulatory MBINs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that they can be involved in the regulation of MB output synapses. Could MBONa1/a2 signals regulate KC-MBON synapses to achieve homeostatic control? Homeostatic matching has been reported in flies at the OSN-PN synapse: here strong odor stimuli would cause depression of PN responses to so that PN responses would be transient, a mechanism that would promote perceptual adaptation, and also discriminability of weak signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kazama and Wilson, 2008</xref>). In this scenario MBONa1/a2, signaling a stimulus intensity largely over its threshold, could depress synapses in the KC output region around the lobes, and modify plasticity and hence learning.</p><p id="P74">In odor discrimination, subsets of KCs at the core of the MBs, named “on” and “off” cells, have been proposed to function antagonistically to encode increase or decrease of odor intensity, respectively, in an odor discrimination test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Vrontou et al., 2021</xref>). They proposed that MBONs innervating the core region of the MBs lobes would be integrating both on and off signals, and the synapses between these both types of KCs and MBONs represent the plasticity site involved in learning; However, on off KCs have yet to be identified. In the larva, there is only one type of gamma KC, and although we can not rule out such “on” and “off” KCs, MBONa1/a2 could potentially be a high-intensity channel and contribute to mediating intensity coding in reinforcement learning.</p><p id="P75">The only evidence for a role of MBONa1/a2 in odor discrimination comes from studies in Odd neurons by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Slater et al., (2015</xref>). They found that silencing Odd neurons impairs chemotaxis, while exciting them enhances chemotaxis, and concluded that Odd neurons increase behavioral sensitivity to odor concentrations. Larvae in which Odd neurons were activated could sense 4-fold differences in odor concentration (although at a very high concentration of acid vinegar at 1:4, two to three orders of magnitude higher than the dilutions that we used for learning). Also, when the output of MBONa1/a2 is blocked by expressing <italic>UAS-shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> in a simplified reward association task, there was an impairment in preference index, the authors have not commented on this, but it might support a role for MBONs in regulating the formation of odor associations.

Moreover, the prediction is that MBONa1/a2 receive the same regulation as KCs, by receiving inhibitory input via APL, and neuromodulation from octopaminergic sVUM1 neurons. Therefore, MBONa1/a2 would carry not only odor intensity input, but this would be subject to inhibition and modulation, representing a dynamic read-out of the activity state of the calyx upon stimulation of its inputs. Furthermore, since MBONa1/a2 respond only to high concentrations of odor, it could potentially be channeling an odor concentration-dependent pathway that would be integrated with the quality channel of KCs, at the level of the MBONs around the MB lobes. MBONa1/a2 form synapses with many MBONs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), and elucidation of downstream partners has the potential to unravel the neural mechanism of the regulation of learning at the MB output synapses. The calyx of the MBs shows remarkable similarity in function and network organization to the piriform cortex of mammals. It is interesting to note that in the mammalian piriform cortex, different separate subsets of piriform cortex neurons have been proposed to carry concentration-invariant odor quality information and concentration-dependent intensity information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Roland et al., 2017</xref>).
