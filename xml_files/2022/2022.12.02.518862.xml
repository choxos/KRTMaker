PSIP1 is a chromatin protein associated with transcriptional elongation complex, possesses histone chaperone activity, and is implicated in recruiting RNA processing and DNA repair factors to transcription sites. Here, we show that PSIP1 interacts with R-loops and other proteins involved in R-loop homeostasis, including PARP1. Genome-wide mapping of PSIP1, R-loops and γ-H2AX in PSIP1-depleted human and mouse cell lines revealed an accumulation of R-loops and DNA damage at gene promoters in the absence of PSIP1. R-loop accumulation causes local transcriptional arrest and transcription-replication conflict, leading to DNA damage. PSIP1 depletion increases 53BP1 foci and reduces RAD51 foci, suggesting altered DNA repair choice. Furthermore, PSIP1 depletion increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to PARP1 inhibitors and DNA-damaging agents that induce R-loop-induced DNA damage. These findings provide fresh insights into the mechanism through which PSIP1 maintains genome integrity at the site of transcription.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The newly synthesised nascent RNA can bind to the template DNA during transcription, forming an RNA-DNA hybrid. This hybrid structure combined with the displaced single-stranded DNA is termed R-loops <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Physiological R-loops play an essential regulatory role in DNA replication, DNA repair, transcription initiation and termination, and many other cellular processes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. On the other hand, accumulating unscheduled R-loops at the site of transcription is known as pathological R-loops. The accumulation of these unscheduled R-loops leads to RNA polymerase-II (RNAPII) pausing and transcriptional arrest <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. R-loops also cause collision between stalled transcription and replication forks, leading to DNA damage and increased genomic instability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. To overcome this, several RNA processing factors (SRSF1), nucleases (RNASEH1 and RNASEH2) and helicases (SETX, DDX1, DDX19 etc.) reduce R-loop levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Dysregulation of R-loops is linked to neurological autoimmune disorders and cancers (reviewed in) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, R-loops are also accumulated due to DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at the transcription sites. R-loops have also been shown to facilitate DNA repair; however, the mechanism through which R-loops feedback to transcription and DSB repair choice is unclear (reviewed in) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">PC4 and SF2 interacting protein (PSIP), also known as LEDGF, is a multifunctional chromatin protein, a proto-oncogene that promotes cell survival, cancer cell proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and chemotherapy resistance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. PSIP1 binds to methylated histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me) via the PWWP domain, and PSIP1 binding is enriched at the sites of RNAPII transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. <italic>PSIP1</italic> encodes two protein isoforms – a shorter PSIP/p52 and a longer PSIP/p75 – generated by alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The smaller PSIP1/p52 isoform binds to RNA processing proteins and modulates alternative splicing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In contrast, PSIP1/p75 plays a role in guiding the integration of HIV to expressed gene bodies via the interaction of HIV integrase with integrase binding domain (IBD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. PSIP1/75 also interacts with the transcription elongation complex via IBD, which is homologous to the TFIIS N-terminal domain (TFIIS-NTD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Increased RNAPII pausing and backtracking due to TFIIS mutations results in R-loop formation, leading to genome instability, directly linking transcription stress, R-loop formation, and DNA damage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, PSIP1 aids in transcription elongation by functioning as a histone chaperone in the absence of the FACT complex in differentiated cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. It also recruits CtIP to DNA damage sites to promote homologous recombination (HR) at transcribing regions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Here, we discovered that PSIP1 interacts with the R-loop directly, and several proteins, including PARP1, are involved in R-loop homeostasis. We also demonstrated that PSIP1 reduces R-loop levels at the site of RNAPII transcription to maintain genome stability and promotes the repair of DNA damage induced by R-loops by homologous recombination (HR).

This increase in DNA damage could be reversed by re-expression of PSIP1/p75, indicating a role of PSIP1/p75 in maintaining genomic integrity in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Published proteomics data from immunoprecipitation (IP) of endogenous PSIP1/LEDGF identified several proteins involved in transcription, RNA processing and DNA repair <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Forty-six proteins enriched in the PSIP1 IP overlap with the previously reported S9.6 antibody-based R-loop interactome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. These overlapping proteins include DNA-RNA helicases, splicing and DNA repair factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b</xref>). PSIP1 is also enriched among other R-loop modulating proteins in the RNASEH1 TurboID-based proximity-dependent labelling system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Since PSIP1 interacts with RNAPII transcriptional elongation machinery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and is associated with transcriptionally active chromatin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, we hypothesised that PSIP1 could prevent R-loop accumulation or promote the resolution of unscheduled R-loops at the sites of RNAPII transcription. We, therefore, sought to investigate whether PSIP1 is involved in R-loop homeostasis.</p><p id="P6">Firstly, we evaluated the ability of PSIP1 to bind R-loops <italic>in vitro</italic> by incubating the genomic DNA blotted membrane with recombinant PSIP1/p52 and PSIP1/p75, followed by the detection of PSIP1 isoforms using antibodies. Both p75 and p52 isoforms showed binding to R-loops, which was reduced upon RNASEH treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). IP with the S9.6 monoclonal antibody that binds RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, detected the interaction of PSIP1/p75 with the R-loop complex. This interaction was abolished upon degradation of R-loops in the RNASEH treated extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Proximity ligation assay (PLA) using S9.6 and PSIP1/p75 antibodies confirmed the interaction of PSIP1/p75 with R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Quantifying bulk R-loop levels using immunoblotting of genomic DNA using the S9.6 antibody showed a stark increase in R-loop levels in <italic>Psip1<sup>–/–</sup></italic> MEFs compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). This was rescued upon PSIP1/p75 re-expression, implying the role of PSIP1 in reducing the R-loop level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). The elevated R-loop levels in <italic>Psip1<sup>–/–</sup></italic> MEFs were sensitive to RNASEH treatment, confirming the specificity of this R-loop detection method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Using two independent short-hairpin (sh) RNAs that target both isoforms of PSIP1, we generated normal prostate epithelial (RWPE-1) and HEK293T cell lines depleted of PSIP1 (PSIP1-KD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1d and S1g</xref>). Immunofluorescence imaging followed by a high-content microscopy and slot blot analysis revealed a significantly higher level of R-loops in the PSIP1-KD compared to the control RWPE-1 nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>) and in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). RNASEH1 overexpression in these cells led to the reversal of R-loop accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a</xref>). A similar increase in R-loop intensity was observed when PSIP1 was depleted using an independent shRNA in RWPE-1 cells and HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1d–i</xref>).

Reduction in PSIP1/p75 signal in PSIP1-KD cells confirms the specificity of the PSIP1/p75 CUT&amp;Tag data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1j</xref>). Consistent with the slot blot and immunofluorescence data, we found a nearly five-fold increase in R-loop peaks (n=2741) in PSIP1-KD RWPE-1 cells compared to the control (n=545).

CUT&amp;Tag data is consistent with the increased bulk γ-H2AX level and the number of γ-H2AX foci in the PSIP1-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a and 2b</xref>). γ-H2AX peaks gained in PSIP1-KD also show an increased R-loop signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e, 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3c</xref>). Furthermore, PLA analysis revealed an increased number and co-localisation of γ-H2AX and R-loop foci in PSIP1-KD, further confirming that R-loops accumulated upon PSIP1 depletion are responsible for increased DNA damage in PSIP1 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>R-loops cause transcriptional arrest and transcription-replication conflict</title><p id="P11">CUT&amp;Tag with γ-H2AX antibodies revealed an increase in the number of γ-H2AX peaks in PSIP1 KD compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).

R-loop peaks gained, as a result of PSIP1-KD, were enriched around promoter or transcription start sites (TSS) and gene bodies compared to intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Similarly, PSIP1/p75 binding showed enrichment around gene promoters, PSIP1 depletion led to an increase in R-loop levels and DNA damage (γ-H2AX level) at PSIP1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a–3c</xref>). Peak overlap analysis revealed that the 909 R-loop peaks detected in PSIP KD overlapped with PSIP1/p75 peaks in control cells. Similarly, 239 S9.6 and γ-H2AX peaks that appeared upon PSIP1 depletion overlapped with the PSIP1/p75 peaks in control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Accumulated R-loops show enrichment for G-rich promoters with high GC skew, suggesting that PSIP1 reduces R-loops at G-rich promoters or genes regulated by strong CpG islands with high transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4a and S4b</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">R-loops can induce transcriptional termination or arrest <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. To investigate whether R-loop accumulation upon PSIP1 depletion affects transcription at the sites of R-loop accumulation, we performed transient transcriptome sequencing (TT-seq) by labelling newly synthesised transcripts with 4SU <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Meta-analysis of TT-seq data showed an overall reduced level of nascent transcription across the gene transcription unit. The reduction in TT-seq signal was higher at the promoter or upstream of gene TSS compared to the rest of the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d</xref>). Replotting of TT-seq reads at R-loops that are gained in PSIP KD revealed a stark reduction in the nascent transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Furthermore, triptolide-mediated transcription inhibition reversed the elevated R-loop levels in PSIP1-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). These results suggest the role of PSIP1 in reducing the R-loop level during ongoing transcription, accumulation of these R-loops, which can otherwise lead to transcriptional arrest. However, since PSIP1 is a transcriptional regulator, it is tricky to infer the direct effect of PSIP1 depletion on R-loop mediated transcriptional arrest.</p><p id="P13">The R-loop-induced transcriptional arrest can cause collisions with the DNA replication forks, resulting in DNA damage. R-loop accumulation in the head-on orientation with the replication fork can cause a transcription-replication conflict (TRC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Hence, we monitored the interaction between the transcription and replication machinery using the PLA for RNAP II and PCNA antibodies, which mark transcription complexes and replication forks. Increased RNAPII and PCNA PLA foci in PSIP1 KD show a higher level of TRC in the absence of PSIP1; RNASEH1 overexpression in the PSIP1 KD leads to significantly reduced RNAPII and PCNA PLA foci suggesting reduced TRC due to rescue in elevated R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Reduced incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) into DNA in PSIP1-KD in an EdU incorporation assay implies a slower replication rate upon PSIP depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5a</xref>). Cell cycle analysis revealed that reduced EdU incorporation is not due to changes in the cell cycle stages due to PSIP1 depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5b</xref>). These results show that PSIP1 reduces transcription-induced R-loops, which can otherwise lead to local transcriptional arrest due to collision with the replication fork, resulting in reduced replication.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>PSIP1 promotes the repair of DNA damage induced by transcription and R-loops</title><p id="P14">Our data showed increased DNA damage upon PSIP1 depletion is due to elevated R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-3f</xref>). The slow repair of R-loop induced DNA damage could also contribute to the observed increase in DNA damage. The absence of PSIP1 could slowdown repair of R-loop mediated DNA damage, as PSIP1 is known to promote HR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, and interacts with DNA repair factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b</xref>). The DNA damage caused by R-loops is repaired by transcription-coupled double-strand break repair <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. To investigate the role of PSIP1 in the repair of R-loop mediated DNA damage at the site of transcription, we treated the cells with illudin-S and etoposide, which are known to cause transcription-coupled DNA damage. PSIP1 depletion led to an increased sensitivity to illudin-S mediated DNA lesions that are specifically repaired by the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway but not global nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and base excision repair (BER) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

This specific sensitivity to clastogens, that interfere with the transcription process, reveals the role of PSIP1 in promoting DNA repair at the site of transcription.

PSIP1 depletion in LNCaP cells increased olaparib sensitivity, which could be partially rescued by RNASEH1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5g and 5h</xref>). These results show that PSIP1 and PARP1 synergistically reduce R-loops-induced genomic instability. Depletion of PSIP1 also led to hypersensitivity of LNCaP cells to illudin-S, which was reversible by RNASEH1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>). These data suggest that the clastogens and PARP1 inhibitors that are known to interfere with the transcription-coupled DNA repair mechanism, could be effective in inducing synthetic lethality in specific cancers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17"><monospace>Accumulation of</monospace> unscheduled co-transcriptional R-loops affects transcription elongation, compromises genome integrity, and is implicated in cancer and inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that PSIP1 binds to R-loops and proteins associated with R-loops, including PARP1. PSIP1 reduces R-loops formed during transcription to minimise DNA damage and genomic instability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5J</xref>). R-loops and γ-H2AX accumulation are sensitive to inhibition of transcription and overexpression of RNASEH1, which confirms the elevated DNA damage in PSIP1-KD cells due to unresolved R-loops that appear at the site of transcription. Furthermore, PSIP1/p75 R-loops are detected at promoters and gene bodies, confirming the role of PSIP1 in resolving transcription-induced R-loops. We further demonstrate that elevated DNA damage is due to R-loop-induced collision between RNAPII transcription with the replication fork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5j</xref>).</p><p id="P18">PSIP1 isoforms are enriched at the transcription unit of expressed genes through binding to di and tri-methylated H3K36 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.

These pieces of evidence suggest a broader role of histone chaperones in facilitating transcriptional elongation by reducing R-loops formed at the transcription site.

Reduced nascent transcript levels at R-loop sites and increased PLA foci between PCNA and RNAPII show that unresolved R-loops lead to increased transcription-replication conflict (TRC). Although most PSIP1 binding and PSIP1-KD-specific R-loops are detected around promoters and gene bodies, intergenic regions also show enrichment for R-loops and γ-H2AX. Although most of the R-loops and DNA damage were detected at gene transcription units, distal regulatory elements are also a source of enhancer RNA transcription that could lead to R-loops and DSBs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">The interaction of PSIP1/p75 with CtIP and various DNA repair factors also suggests its role in promoting HR and improving the efficiency of DNA repair during transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.

Since we detect accumulation of both R-loops and DNA damage in the absence of PSIP1, some of the R-loops accumulated in the PSIP1-KD could be due to DNA damage, as double-stranded breaks are known to generate R-loops <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">In summary, we show that PSIP1 interacts with proteins involved in the R-loop homeostasis, such as DNA repair, RNA processing factors, and PARP1. PSIP1 maintains genomic stability at the site of transcription by a) reducing the R-loop levels by interacting or recruiting R-loop processing proteins and b) promoting the HR repair pathway to repair damage caused by transcription-induced R-loops. Our data also revealed an increased sensitivity of cancer cells with low levels of PSIP1 to drugs that induce transcription-associated DNA damage and PARP1 inhibitors.
