Here, we report the first whole genome, multiparametric CRISPR anti-aging screen, identifying 43 new genes that can reverse multiple aging phenotypes in progeria. The screen was implemented in fibroblasts from Néstor-Guillermo Progeria Syndrome (NGPS) patients, carrying a homozygous p.Ala12Thr mutation in barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF A12T). The hits were enriched for genes involved in protein translation, protein and RNA transport and osteoclast formation. We further confirmed that BAF A12T drives increased protein translation and translational errors that could directly contribute to premature aging in patients. This work has highlighted the power of multiparametric whole genome synthetic rescue screens to identify new anti-aging genes and uncover novel biology behind progeria-associated cellular dysfunction.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Premature aging syndromes (progerias) are very rare conditions that recapitulate many aspects of physiological aging, causing symptoms such as alopecia, lipodystrophy, cardiovascular dysfunction, and bone dysfunction well before the expected age of onset. Many progeria syndromes are caused by mutations in nuclear envelope (NE) associated proteins. For example, the classic Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is caused by mutations in <italic>LMNA</italic> encoding for the nuclear lamina proteins lamin A and C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). A more recently described progeria, Néstor-Guillermo progeria syndrome (NGPS), is caused by a recessive alanine to threonine amino acid substitution at position 12 (p.Ala12Thr) in the <italic>BANF1</italic> gene, encoding the 10 KDa protein barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). BAF forms dimers that bind to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), lamin proteins as well as LEM-domain containing proteins of the inner nuclear membrane including emerin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Through these interactions, BAF exerts critical functions including reformation of the NE after mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) and NE rupture repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). NGPS patients suffer from multiple aging-associated pathologies, such as alopecia and lipodystrophy, as well as osteoarthritis and joint stiffness. However, the most severe phenotype affecting their quality of life is bone dysfunction, with osteoporosis and dramatic skeletal deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). NGPS patients have an increased life expectancy compared to HGPS, probably due to the absence of cardiovascular dysfunction, the main cause of death in HGPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p><p id="P3">NGPS remains poorly characterized compared to HGPS, and insights into the molecular mechanisms behind the disease have only recently started to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Therefore, with the aim of identifying new genes and pathways relevant to NGPS, as well as potential targets for therapeutic avenues in the disease, we carried out a whole genome CRISPR/Cas9 arrayed microscopy screen in patient derived NGPS cells. We assessed the impact of deleting each of the ~20,000 human genes on four specific cellular NGPS aging phenotypes simultaneously, to identify “rescue” genes acting across several phenotypes. Through this approach, we identified 43 genes enriched in pathways including protein translation and bone cell development, that improve NGPS cellular phenotypes.</p><sec id="S1"><title>NGPS fibroblasts show distinct phenotypes compared to HGPS</title><p id="P4">Fibroblasts from HGPS patients have been extensively studied and characterized. The best-established phenotypes in these cells include NE blebs and invaginations, loss of heterochromatin, downregulation of lamin B1, nucleocytoplasmic transport defects and accumulation of DNA damage foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). To establish whether NGPS cells might share similar phenotypes, we obtained immortalized fibroblasts from two of the three so far identified NGPS patients (NGPS1 and NGPS2) and age-matched immortalized fibroblasts (wild-type – WT) (gift from Dr. Carlos Lopez-Otin). We observed severe NE abnormalities by electron microscopy, including deep folds and NE blebbing but no apparent loss of heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). On the contrary to primary NGPS cells being unable to proliferate in culture (personal communication from Dr. Carlos Lopez-Otin), the immortalized NGPS cells grew at an only slightly lower rate compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), we confirmed the accumulation of the NE protein emerin into the cytoplasm of both NGPS1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), and the absence of lamin B1 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) and of DNA double strand breaks accumulation (53BP1 foci <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, E</xref>), both of which being common hallmarks of HGPS cells. In addition, and unlike HGPS cells, NGPS fibroblasts did not display loss of nuclear Ran – used as a reporter for nucleocytoplasmic transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, F</xref>) or of the heterochromatin markers HP1γ and H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G-I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A-D</xref>). We did however observe an increase in the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 – involved in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and DNA damage response – in both NGPS cell lines but to different extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D, E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>A combination of four specific NGPS phenotypes amenable to high-throughput screening</title><p id="P5">Phenotypes associated with NE dysfunction in progeria cells can only be assessed by microscopy, precluding a whole genome pooled CRISPR screening approach. We therefore designed a multiparametric, microscopy based CRISPR screen, aimed at interrogating the whole genome to identify genes that when deleted, could rescue multiple NGPS cellular phenotypes. This approach is based on the principle of synthetic rescue, relying on a genetic interaction whereby a protein not involved in the aetiology of the disease is targeted, thereby rebalancing the pathophysiological state towards a “healthy” one. Our previous work, based on small scale screening, has established the proof-of-concept of this approach in HGPS, where we identified N-acetyltransferase 10 as a new target to reverse HGPS aging phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). The design of the screen is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and involves multiple steps. The first major step relied on the identification of a combination of phenotypes, specific to the BAF A12T mutation, significantly different in NGPS cells compared to WT cells, and amenable to high throughput screening. To this aim, we took advantage of our recently established NGPS2 isogenic cell lines, in which we reversed the homozygous BAF A12T mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 (NGPS2 corrected) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The screen set-up also required the design of specific pipelines to reliably identify and quantify these phenotypes. The first of these phenotypes is the delocalization of emerin from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>), as characterized by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). The second phenotype is the increased nuclear deformation, commonly observed in progeria cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) and in cells from normal aged individuals. This was measured using a perimeter to area ratio (P2A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). Additionally, we identified an increased number of NE ruptures during interphase in NGPS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>), further characterized in our recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). NE ruptures are identified on fixed cells by the presence of nuclear blebs (observed using LAP2 staining), the first step in the NE rupturing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E, F, H</xref>). Finally, we observed an increased frequency of micronuclei formation in NGPS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G, I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D</xref>), a known marker of genomic instability. The combination of these four phenotypes was subsequently chosen for the whole genome screen.</p><p id="P6">Next, we engineered stable Cas9 expression in WT and NGPS fibroblasts for use in the CRISPR screening. After testing the efficiency of protein transduction using various promoters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A, B</xref>) we infected WT and NGPS cells with hCMV-Cas9. Despite a good Cas9 expression level in all three cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>), the knock-out efficiency in individual cells was too heterogenous for screening purposes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>). Therefore, we established individual WT and NGPS Cas9 expressing clones grown from single cells and selected the best clones based on Cas9 efficiency assessed by resistance to 6-Thioguanine after HPRT knock-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) (Fig. S3E-G). We also assessed Cas9 expression level by western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E</xref>) and picked clones combining a high cutting efficiency, and no increase in the level of the DNA double strand break marker γH2AX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E, F</xref>). Finally, to avoid obtaining results that could result from a clonal effect, we pooled 3 of the selected clones to generate the WT-Cas9, NGPS1-Cas9 or NGPS2-Cas9 cell populations. The NGPS2-Cas9 was the one used for the screen and was generated by pooling clones D, F and I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E-G</xref>). These Cas9 cells showed a good level of protein knock-down upon transient transfection with various crRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref> – acetyl-tubulin level serves as an additional readout for HDAC6 knockout efficiency).</p><p id="P7">Finally, as the project started at a time when the first whole genome CRISPR arrayed libraries were being synthetized, we tested the efficiency of the two non-viral systems available at the time, one relying on a CRISPR/tracrRNA (cr/tracrRNA), the other one on a single guide RNA (sgRNA). After comparing the knock-down efficiency of several genes by western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3H</xref>) and by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3I-L</xref>), we set up a mini screen relying on cellular proliferation arrest upon knock-down of five different mitotic genes, compared to 5 non-mitotic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L</xref>). In both cases, we observed a strong proliferation arrest 3 days after transfection of either the sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L</xref> left panel) or the cr/tracrRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L</xref> right panel) against the mitotic genes (blue/purple genes), without transfection-associated toxicity (grey/red/yellow genes). Based on cost efficiency, we therefore selected the cr/tracrRNA system for the whole genome screen.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>The multiparametric NGPS screen identifies 43 hits that reverse NGPS phenotypes</title><p id="P8">We then carried out the primary genome wide screen using the pool of 3 NGPS2-Cas9 expressing clones (NGPS2-Cas9). An overview of the screening approach is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, and the plate layouts are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A-B</xref>. The four screening phenotypes - nuclear shape, micronuclei, NE ruptures (blebs) frequency and emerin nuclear intensity - were reduced to two dimensions for each single knock-out and mapped as a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). The cluster analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>) was used to visualise NGPS2 cells (grey dots) alongside the same parameters measured in control cells (blue dots). The two populations were clearly separated, reflecting the phenotypic difference between the control and the NGPS2 cells. The red dots highlight 112 genes that upon being depleted were identified as “normalising” the combination of NGPS phenotypes. To these, we added 18 genes not yet on the list that appeared in the top 15 of three individual phenotypes (see details in the Methods section). We then carried these 130 genes into a validation screen, in which 3 out of the 4 individual crRNAs used in the primary screen were deconvoluted into individual wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We carried out the validation screen in triplicate and confirmed 43 hits with high confidence (at least 2 out of 3 crRNA and confirmed in the 3 replicates). A gene ontology analysis revealed specific enrichment in biological processes including translation, protein and RNA transport as well as osteoclast development – of high relevance to the patient phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C, D</xref>). In accordance with the concept of synthetic rescue, only 3 hits were proteins associated with the NE: NUP160, SEC13 and AHCTF1 (ELYS).</p><p id="P9">To evaluate the potential relevance of our identified candidate genes to normal variation in related health and disease traits, we interrogated phenotypic and genetic data from available large-scale population studies. These analyses aim to assess the impact of naturally occurring alleles, influencing the function of our candidate genes, on related phenotypes. Since NGPS patients display severe skeletal abnormalities and lipoatrophy, we focused on publicly available Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR) adjusted for BMI, circulating triglyceride levels and estimated bone mineral density (eBMD) in sample sizes up to 1,253,275 individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). We found that 30 of our 43 identified genes were within 500kb of a genome-wide significant signal for at least one of these four traits. Specifically, 13 genes were proximal to BMI signals, 11 to WHR, 19 to eBMD and 13 to triglyceride signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S12</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). To more directly link these proximal associated genetic variants to the function of our candidate genes, we undertook a number of variants to gene mapping approaches (see methods), including assessment of protein-coding variants and integrating activity-by-contact enhancer maps and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data. These analyses highlighted a number of genes with strong support for a direct involvement in these human phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). For example, genetic variants residing within enhancers for <italic>RPL13</italic> and influencing its transcript expression in blood, were associated with eBMD, triglycerides and BMI. Collectively these findings demonstrate that our cellular screens are able to identify genes that influence NPGS-like phenotypes in the normal population.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Increased protein translation rate caused by BAF A12T is reduced upon depletion of the hits</title><p id="P10">The screen revealed a strong enrichment for genes involved in protein translation, whose modulation has previously been associated with longevity in various model organisms. To gain further insights into protein translation regulation in NGPS, we first assessed nascent protein synthesis using incorporation of the clickable methionine analogue L-homopropargylglycine (HPG). Upon fluorescent labeling of HPG through a “click” reaction, we observed a significant increase in protein synthesis in NGPS cells compared to both WT cells and NGPS corrected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>) as well as in wild-type fibroblasts overexpressing BAF A12T compared to BAF WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B</xref>). This suggests that the BAF A12T mutation is directly driving increased protein translation, similarly to what has been reported previously in HGPS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). In accordance with this data, we observed a modest but significant increase in the nucleolar area of NGPS2 cells compared to NGPS2 corrected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C-D</xref>), with a similar trend – but without significance – observed in NGPS 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C, D</xref>). A significant increase was also observed in fibroblasts expressing BAF A12T compared to BAF WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Together with this phenotype, we identified through a dual luciferase mistranslation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) that both NGPS1 and NGPS2 cells displayed an increased rate of errors during protein synthesis, as observed by an increased readthrough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We next asked how depletion of the hits identified in the screen might impact nascent protein synthesis in NGPS cells. To address this question, we used siRNA to deplete 41 of the hit proteins, followed by HPG incorporation and quantification of HGP fluorescent intensity by high-throughput microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5F</xref>). This confirmed a higher rate of protein synthesis in NGPS2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref> red dotted line) compared to NGPS2 corrected cells (“NGPS WT”). As expected, depletion of the hits directly involved in protein translation (RPL12, RPL37A, RPL13, RPS3A, EIF3B) almost completely abolished HPG incorporation, and served as a good positive control for the assay. Interestingly however, we observed that depletion of many of the other hits, not known to play a role in protein translation, also led to a reduction of HPG incorporation to various extents in NGPS2 cells, with 21 genes out of the 43 hits (49%) reaching significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>, blue data points). To assess the potential link between the reduction of protein translation we observed in NGPS2 upon depletion of the hits and the phenotypic improvements identified in our whole genome screen, we treated NGPS1 and 2 cells with the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide (CHX) and silvestrol. Both inhibitors led to the enrichment of emerin into the nucleus of NGPS1 and NGPS2 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H-I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Depletion of RPS3A, PAFAH1B1, VPS16 and SMU1 suppress the lethality of an NGPS <italic>C. elegans</italic> model</title><p id="P12">To establish the potential of our screen hits in translating into improvement of NGPS phenotypes <italic>in vivo,</italic> we used an NGPS <italic>C. elegans</italic> model carrying a <italic>baf-1(G12T)</italic> mutation. The phenotype of these NGPS worms will be described elsewhere, but it is noticeable that control of nucleolar size is impaired as in NGPS cells. When wild type animals were shifted from 16°C to 25°C, nucleolar size was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-B</xref>). Interestingly, this decrease was not observed in <italic>baf-1(G12T)</italic> mutants, which even displayed a mild trend for larger nucleoli at the higher temperature. The <italic>baf-1(G12T)</italic> mutant worms are fully viable, but &lt;10% complete development when combined with an endogenously tagged <italic>gfp::lmn-1</italic> /lamin allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6A</xref>). We took advantage of this sensitized background to test for rescue of developmental arrest upon RNAi-mediated knockdown of 32 genes from our screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B</xref>), for which there was a <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologue. Interestingly in regards to the protein translation data we obtained in human cells, depletion of RPS-1 (the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologue of human RPS3A), a ribosomal protein of the 40S subunit, suppressed the lethality of the <italic>gfp::lmn-1; baf-1(G12T)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Three additional genes: <italic>lis-1</italic> (PAFAH1B1) – involved in various dynein and microtubule processes as well as in osteoclast formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), <italic>vps-16</italic> (VPS16) – a protein involved in protein trafficking to lysosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), and <italic>smu-1</italic> (SMU1) – involved in mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), led to a similar rescue of worm lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Depletion of the other genes did not rescue the lethality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B</xref>), potentially due to some of them – including protein translation genes – being essential <italic>in vivo.</italic></p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">Our data demonstrates the feasibility and the power of a microscopy based, CRISPR/Cas9 multiparametric synthetic rescue screen for identifying new genes and pathways that can reverse aging phenotypes in progeria cells. While a targeted (320 genes) multiparametric siRNA screen has been carried out previously in a cellular model of HGPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), our screening approach has interrogated the entire human protein coding genome (19,200 genes) and used NGPS patient cells. By using both WT fibroblasts from an unaffected individual, as well as NGPS fibroblasts in which we reversed the BAF A12T homozygous mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), we were able to identify a reliable combination of four phenotypes that were both specific to the BAF A12T mutation, and quantifiable by high throughput microscopy. This approach allowed us to reduce the number of hits to ~0.2% of the whole genome library, and to identify genes showing the best “rescue” across several phenotypes. In accordance with the principle of synthetic rescue, only 3 of the hits were NE proteins, and more specifically nuclear pore complex proteins: NUP160, SEC13 and AHCTF1 (ELYS). Both SEC13 and ELYS have been previously shown to regulate nuclear size and nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), a function shared by RAN, another hit from our screen. This suggests that modulating nuclear import might have positive effects on NE organization and function in NGPS cells.</p><p id="P14">In view of the strong skeletal abnormalities of NGPS patients, it is also worth highlighting that our screen identified two genes involved in osteoclast development: LRRK1 (Leucine-rich repeat serine/threonine-protein kinase 1) and PAFAH1B1/LIS1 (Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase IB subunit alpha), whose depletion improve NGPS cellular phenotypes and in the case of LIS1 also increases viability of NGPS worms. LRRK1 has been involved in the regulation of osteoclast activity and bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Accordingly, LRRK1 dysfunction in mice or human is associated with severe osteopetrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Similarly, PAFAH1B1 regulates osteoclast formation and bone homeostasis through interacting with the protein Plekhm1, involved in osteoclast secretion. PAFAH1B1 depletion has been shown to strongly reduce osteoclast formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Therefore, we can hypothesize that the severe osteoporosis and osteolysis observed in NGPS cells might be associated with an increased level or activity of LRRK1 and/or PAFAH1B1. This might contribute to the aberrant NGPS cellular phenotypes that become normalized upon depletion of these genes.</p><p id="P15">One of the top functional enrichments in the screen was protein translation, with 7 out of the 43 hits being associated with this process. Loss of protein homeostasis is one of the hallmarks of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and inhibition of protein translation has been associated with enhanced longevity in several animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Identifying that inhibition of this pathway was beneficial to NGPS cells and NGPS worms, therefore reinforce the current hypothesis that loss of cellular homeostasis observed in both premature and physiological aging might occur through similar mechanisms. More specifically, we observed that the NGPS associated BAF A12T mutation was causing a higher rate of nascent protein synthesis. This could be a common mechanism involved in premature aging, as increased protein synthesis was also observed in HGPS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). In the case of NGPS, we saw that this was associated with a higher rate of errors, as seen by an increased stop codon readthrough.</p><p id="P16">There is currently no mouse model for NGPS but a recent study reported the effect of error-prone protein synthesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Through engineering a specific ribosomal mutation, the authors induced genome-wide translational errors in mice. This resulted in reduced lifespan and premature aging features resembling the phenotypes observed in NGPS patients including chest and spine deformation as well as loss of fat. This suggests that deregulation of protein synthesis and accumulation of errors might directly contribute to the premature aging phenotypes of NGPS patients. Therefore, identifying non-toxic pharmacological interventions to slow down protein translation, thereby potentially limiting error-prone translation might yield phenotypic improvement at the level of the individuals. According to our data, this could be achieved through targeting proteins directly involved in protein synthesis (such as RPL proteins) as well as proteins involved in various other cellular functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4G</xref>). Indeed, in the cellular context of NGPS, we observed a reduction of nascent protein synthesis upon depletion of genes that don’t have any known protein synthesis function. The mechanisms behind this and the link between protein translation and NE integrity remain unknown and will be the basis of future studies, but it does suggest a common mechanism by which depletion of the hits from the screen improve NGPS phenotypes.</p><p id="P17">Altogether, our screen has shed light on new pathways involved in cellular dysfunction caused by the BAF A12T mutation in NGPS patient cells. This work has also identified potential new therapeutic targets for this incurable premature aging syndrome, supported by the data we obtained <italic>in vivo,</italic> showing rescue of <italic>C. elegans</italic> lethality upon knocking down some of the hits from the screen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS155702-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d39aAdIbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="S7"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Prof. Lopez Otin for providing us with the NGPS and WT immortalized fibroblasts, Dr Daniel Starr for providing us with the <italic>gfp::lmn-1</italic> alleles, Dr Dimitri Shcherbakov and Dr Erik Böttger for sharing the dual luciferase mistranslation assay plasmids and Dr Dimitri Shcherbakov for helpful discussions on setting up and interpreting the assays, Matthew Gratian (CIMR microscopy) for his help with the high content microscope and screen set up, Henri Huppert (ThermoFisher) for his help with the HCS studio pipelines and Dr Gabriel Balmus for giving us access to the CyBio Felix robot.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Funding</title><p>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society 206242/Z/17/Z (S.Y.B., D.L.)</p><p>Wellcome Trust Institutional Strategic Support Fund 204845/Z/16/Z (A.F.J.J., D.L.)</p><p>FEBS Long-Term Fellowship (A.F.J.J.)</p><p>Spanish State Research Agency Grants PID2019-105069GB-I00 and CEX2020-001088-M (P.A.)</p><p>Spanish State Research Agency Fellowship BES-2017-080216 (R.R.B.)</p><p>Medical Research Council (Unit programs: MC_UU_12015/2, MC_UU_00006/2 (J.
