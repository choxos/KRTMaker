Here we analyzed how multiple NFs explore chromatin, by combining live-cell single-molecule tracking with multifocal structured illumination of DNA density. We find that NFs displaying higher bound fractions sample DNA dense regions more exhaustively. Focusing on the tumor-suppressor p53, we demonstrated that this NF search for its targets by alternating between rapid diffusion in the interchromatin compartment and compact sampling of chromatin dense regions. Efficient p53 targeting requires balanced IDR/chromatin interactions: adding an exogenous IDR potentiates p53-mediated target gene activation, but excessive IDR/IDR interactions lead to p53 condensates, derailing its search and downregulating transcription. Our findings highlight the role of NF IDRs on their search and showcase a powerful method to generate traffic maps of the eukaryotic nucleus and dissect how nuclear organization guides NFs action.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Single molecule tracking</kwd><kwd>Chromatin</kwd><kwd>Nuclear Factors</kwd><kwd>Search Mechanism</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Advances in microscopy and biochemistry of the last two decades are shedding light on the organization principles of the eukaryotic cell nucleus. DNA/DNA, DNA/RNA and DNA/protein interactions render the nucleus a highly compartmentalized organelle at multiple scales, with different compartments being specialized in peculiar tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. At the nanometer scale, DNA is wrapped into chromatin by nucleosomes, and the chromatin fiber is further organized into a hierarchy of higher-order structures giving rise to topologically associated domains and chromatin compartments, that cluster together genes that are similarly regulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. At the sub-micron scale, the compaction of the chromatin fibers results in chromatin dense (CD) domains proposed to contain inactive genes, interspersed by a branched network of chromatin-depleted channels, known as the inter-chromatin compartment (IC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Recent computational and experimental work highlights that both active transcription and large macromolecular complexes involved in maintaining nuclear architecture are preferentially located at the CD/IC interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. These observations have led to the hypothesis that the IC might serve as a route for targeting diffusible macromolecules such as transcription factors (TFs) to their site of action (e.g. their binding sites on enhancer/promoters), potentially accelerating their target search mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">A rapid search mechanism is particularly relevant for inducible TFs (iTFs) facing the apparently gargantuan task of identifying their target sites among billions of potential decoy sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Remarkably, many iTFs are capable of activating transcription of their target genes in minutes following the activating stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, a timescale that seems incompatible with the classical diffusion-limited search mechanism. This target search problem has been addressed extensively in bacteria, where an efficient search is achieved by facilitated diffusion, a mechanism combining 1D sliding on DNA with 3D diffusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Whether TFs exploit a similar 1D+3D search mechanism in the eukaryotic cell nucleus is unclear, as the large excess of nonspecific binding sites, the heterogeneity in chromatin density and the presence of nucleosomes might limit the efficacy of facilitated diffusion.</p><p id="P5">In recent years, single-molecule tracking (SMT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> have highlighted some mechanisms used by nuclear proteins to search for their target sites in eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Live-cell SMT of proteins involved in the maintenance of chromatin organization (such as CTCF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> or its epigenetic state (such as the Polycomb protein Cbx2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> display an accelerated search mechanism named guided exploration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Here, transient multivalent interactions mediated by the protein intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) trap the factor in nuclear condensates or clusters that are explored in a compact (exhaustive) manner.</p><p id="P6">The role of condensates in transcription remains however fervently debated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. While some data point to condensates as a way to enhance the on-rate of TFs to their binding sites and consequently amplify transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, recent findings highlight that condensates could also be detrimental for transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. On the other hand, a recent report on artificial TFs suggests that the IDRs per-se, rather than condensates formation, could have a positive role on TF binding and transcriptional activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">In this context, whether guided exploration characterizes the dynamics of diverse nuclear proteins/TFs – especially of those not participating in the assembly of visible condensates – and how nuclear organization affects the TF search remain fundamental, yet unaddressed, questions.</p><p id="P8">To tackle these questions, we combined SMT of nuclear factors with super-resolved structured illumination microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> (multifocal SIM, mSIM) of a reference channel in an integrated optical microscope to track single molecules within their chromatin environment with 150nm resolution.</p><p id="P9">We exploited the developed SMT/mSIM microscope to characterize the role of chromatin in shaping the search mechanism of different nuclear proteins, showing that different factors display distinct accessibility to DNA dense regions that strongly correlates with their propensity to interact with immobile scaffolds, such as chromatin itself. We next focused on characterizing the search mechanism of the tumor suppressor p53, a key TF involved in the transcriptional response to DNA damage. Although p53 has been shown to be capable of facilitated diffusion in test tube experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, its search mechanism remains unexplored in living nuclei. Our analysis shows that the p53 search is defined by rapid diffusion in the IC and slowed down anisotropic diffusion in CDs, where chromatin-bound p53 molecules are enriched. At the IC/CD boundary, p53 diffusion is slowed down and rendered more compact by interactions mediated by p53 IDRs.</p><p id="P10">To characterize the role of its IDR in p53’s target search mechanism we performed SMT on p53 mutants, either without its IDRs, or with a fused exogenous IDR – derived from the FUS protein -, in order to increase its multivalent interactions. IDR deletion mutants display reduced compact exploration and a lower capability to access high-DNA density regions, leading to lower expression of p53 target genes. On the other hand, the exogenous IDR FUS can lead p53 to enhanced expression of its target genes. However, when expressed at concentrations sufficient to form condensates, p53-FUS displays a derailed target search resulting in a drop in transcriptional activation. Our results suggest that condensates of transcriptional activators are not exclusively activating, but can also shut down transcription. We predict that the application of SMT/mSIM to multiple TFs and chromatin/organelles binding proteins will enable to dissect how the crowded nuclear environment can guide the molecular players involved in transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair to their targets.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Different nuclear factors display different accessibility to DNA dense nuclear regions</title><p id="P11">To address how the search mechanism of nuclear factors (NFs) relates to chromatin organization, we designed a microscope capable of combining Highly Inclined Laminated Optical Sheet (HILO) imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> of TF dynamics by SMT with super-resolution imaging of a reference channel, by multifocal structured illumination microscopy (mSIM, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.1a</xref>). As detailed in the Methods, mSIM imaging is based on scanning a pattern of illumination spots on the sample, created by a digital micromirror device (DMD). The image is then reconstructed via virtual pinholing (resulting in confocal-grade optical sectioning) and pixel reassignment to increase the lateral resolution). We confirmed that mSIM increases the lateral resolution close to the theoretical 1.4x maximum by imaging microtubules in fixed cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.1b</xref>). Additionally, we observed improved optical sectioning by imaging DNA stained with Hoechst 33342 in living osteosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Further, we evaluated that chromatic aberrations between the SMT and the mSIM channels were on average below the resolution limit, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.1c</xref>). Finally, we moved on combining mSIM of DNA density with single molecule imaging of Halo-tagged proteins diffusing in the nucleus of cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To this end, we recorded the positions of the detected single molecules for each of the tested proteins and measured the Hoechst intensity at each of these positions, classified in quartiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-c</xref>). We focused our analysis on one “inert” tracer (unconjugated HaloTag), two TFs (p53 and NF-kB), an architectural protein (CTCF) and a chromatin core component (Histone H2B). The analysis revealed that different factors map against DNA density with different likelihoods. Unconjugated HaloTag was found to be enriched in regions at lower DNA density, while histone H2B was preferentially found at regions with higher DNA density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c</xref>). The TFs and CTCF showed an intermediate profile, with CTCF displaying more enrichment in DNA dense regions than p53 and NF-kB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p><p id="P13">These differences in protein accessibility to DNA dense nuclear regions did not appear to be caused by size-exclusion effects, as no correlation between protein molecular weight and enrichment in higher DNA classes was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Rather, the tendency of NFs to localize in DNA dense regions is correlated to their ability to bind chromatin, as measured by the fraction of bound molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. This suggests that the different localization of the tested NFs might be driven by interactions with scaffolds, such as chromatin itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Next, we tested if the diffusion speed of each NF is controlled by the DNA density of the visited nuclear regions.

In contrast, for both p53 and CTCF, slow diffusing molecules are enriched in DNA dense regions, while fast diffusing molecules are enriched in DNA poor regions. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1g</xref>).</p><p id="P16">In sum, different NFs sense DNA density differently, with preferential localization at DNA dense regions being apparently driven by their propensity to interact with nuclear scaffolds, as estimated by the single molecule bound fraction. Further, some factors such as CTCF and p53 are slowed down at regions with higher DNA density, while others preferentially occupy regions at defined DNA density, independently of their diffusion speed.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Different NFs display different search strategies that correlate with their accessibility to DNA dense regions</title><p id="P17">Since our results indicated that different nuclear proteins display different mobility in chromatin, we next investigated how these proteins search for their binding sites and whether their search is influenced by chromatin organization. The search mechanism of NFs can be classified under two universal classes: non-compact exploration - where the factor has a high probability of leaving a certain volume before having explored it completely, e.g. in the case of Brownian diffusion - and compact exploration, where the protein exhaustively explores a given region before leaving it, as in the case of diffusion in fractal/crowded environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. These different search strategies can be highlighted by analyzing the anisotropy of diffusion – i.e. the likelihood of unbound molecules to walk back on their steps – by calculating the distribution of angles between three consecutive localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Brownian motion generates isotropic diffusion, while compact exploration would display backward anisotropy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">To compute diffusional anisotropy, we labeled the different nuclear proteins with a photoactivatable ligand (PA-JF549)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and acquired photoactivated SMT (paSMT) movies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> composed by 10,000 frames at 100 fps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>) at a low molecule density (1-2 localized molecules per frame). We next tracked the molecules, filtered out immobile/bound molecules using a Hidden Markov Model approach (variational Bayes single particle tracking, vbSPT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and measured diffusional anisotropy using the ‘fold anisotropy metric ‘<italic>f</italic><sub>180/0</sub> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, describing how many times a molecule is more likely to show backward steps than forward steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P19">After verifying that our vBSPT analysis successfully filters out chromatin bound molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), we discovered that NFs displayed different degrees of diffusional anisotropy: factors showing poor localization in DNA dense regions display low anisotropy (HaloTag and NF-kB), compatible with non-compact exploration. Differently, factors enriched in DNA dense regions such as CTCF and H2B showed higher diffusional anisotropy, a hallmark of more compact exploration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Plotting the fold anisotropy metric <italic>f</italic><sub>180/0</sub> as function of the distance run by the molecules highlights that p53, CTCF and H2B display high diffusional anisotropy at a spatial scale of 100-300 nm, and more isotropic diffusion when jumping to longer distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). This behavior, recently named ‘guided exploration’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> , occurs when a nuclear protein is trapped transiently in specific areas but is capable of diffusing freely between trapping zones, potentially accelerating its search for target sites. Since our data showed that diffusion of some NFs can be slowed down in DNA dense nuclear areas, we reasoned that chromatin itself could be responsible for transiently trapping these factors. By combining the analysis of diffusional anisotropy with our mSIM imaging of DNA density, we observe that NFs display higher diffusional anisotropy when slowly diffusing in DNA dense regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Thus, factors like p53 and CTCF alternate between isotropic and fast diffusion in DNA poor regions with slower and more anomalous diffusion in DNA dense areas.</p><p id="P21">In summary, factors displaying different enrichment in DNA dense regions display also different search strategies. Proteins with limited accessibility to dense DNA perform non-compact search in the nuclear environment, while the histone H2B - that preferentially occupies DNA dense areas – shows the highest degree of compact exploration. CTCF and p53 perform guided exploration, potentially using DNA as a template: for these factors, slow diffusing molecules are enriched in chromatin dense regions and appear trapped, while fast diffusing molecules are enriched in regions at low DNA density and explore such areas in a non-compact manner.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>p53 searches its target sites by a combination of fast and slow diffusion, and slow diffusing molecules spatially segregate with p53 chromatin bound molecules</title><p id="P22">We next focused on characterizing the search mechanism of the tumor suppressor p53, an important TF controlling the cellular response to genotoxic stress. To this end, we genetically engineered the U2OS-derived DIvA cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> to homozygously label endogenous p53 with HaloTag at its C-terminal, by means of CRISPR/Cas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. These cells allow for enzymatic induction of double strand breaks by inducing the translocation of the AsiSI restriction enzyme with Tamoxifen (4-OHT). After verifying that p53-HaloTag is fully functional (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a-d</xref>), we applied paSMT to characterize p53 mobility before and after its activation by DNA damage, induced by ionizing radiation (IR) or AsiSI translocation. In agreement with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, the distribution of frame-to-frame displacements for p53-HaloTag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a</xref>) is described by three apparent diffusion coefficients, with medians equal to 0.07, 0.9 and 4.4 <italic>μ m</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>s</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). As we previously demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, we confirmed that the slowest of these three components represents DNA binding, since a p53 mutant at the seven residues responsible for specific DNA contacts (p53-mSB) displays a significant reduction in the fraction of molecules involved in such component (see below). Four hours after DNA damage induction by 10 Gy of IR, the fraction of p53-HaloTag molecules bound to chromatin increases, indicating more efficient recruitment to binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), and confirming our previous results upon ectopic expression of p53-HaloTag in other cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">The increased bound fraction of p53-HaloTag upon IR is associated with more pronounced compact exploration of its unbound population, as we verified following track classification by vbSPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) – after controlling that no misclassification of bound track segments in the diffusing ones was present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>). Further, the transition probabilities derived from the vbSPT model highlighted that p53-HaloTag molecules reach the bound state ten times more frequently starting from the slow state than from the fast one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Accordingly, bound molecules more frequently co-cluster with slow diffusing ones than with fast diffusing ones, as can be quantified by computing the pair cross-correlation between the localizations assigned to each of the states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>). While the cross-correlation between bound and fast diffusing molecules closely resembles the one expected from randomly positioned molecules, slowly diffusing molecules spatially segregate at short distance from bound ones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>). Together, these data indicate that p53 searches for its targets by alternating between fast and slow diffusion modes, with the slow diffusing molecules performing more compact exploration and occupying more frequently nuclear regions that can be bound by the TF.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Bound, slow diffusing and fast diffusing p53 molecules occupy nuclear regions with distinct DNA density</title><p id="P24">Next, we combined p53 track classification with the maps of DNA density obtained by mSIM, to highlight how molecules with different mobility preferentially occupy regions at different DNA density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). By averaging the normalized distribution of Hoechst signal around each classified p53 single molecule, we could visualize that fast diffusing molecules preferentially occupy DNA depleted regions, surrounded by regions at higher DNA density - such as the channels composing the interchromatin compartment (IC) - while bound molecules are enriched in denser chromatin domains (CDs), surrounded by DNA poor regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.

Activation of p53 by 10Gy IR further promotes the enrichment of p53 bound molecules in DNA dense compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Notably, activation of p53 by AsiSI induction of DNA damage recapitulates the previous observations: in these settings p53-HaloTag displays an increased bound fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), a diffusion anisotropy profile compatible with guided exploration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>) and positioning of bound p53 molecules at regions of higher DNA density than diffusing ones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c-d</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Since p53 bound molecules preferentially reside in DNA dense domains, we asked whether p53 target genes occupy regions of similar density.

Finally, a mutant lacking both specific binding and its C-terminal region was included (p53-mSB-ΔC). We collected paSMT movies on these mutants, and analyzed their single molecule dynamics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Mutants involving the DNA binding domain and/or the C-terminal region displayed a significant reduction in the TF bound fraction, associated with an increase in the fraction of diffusing molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). Further, all tested mutants displayed reduced backward diffusional anisotropy than p53 WT, indicating that both the IDRs and the DNA binding domain of p53 might participate in guiding the TF to its binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Next, we resorted to our SMT/mSIM approach to evaluate the enrichment of these mutants at DNA dense regions of the nucleus. While p53 WT displays an enrichment of bound/slow diffusing molecules in regions at high DNA density, this enrichment is progressively lost, in particular when analyzing the localization of mutants lacking the C-terminal domain of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Thus, in agreement with our previous results on different NFs, interactions (mediated by the p53 IDRs and by its binding domain) control the capability of p53 to reach regions at higher DNA density.</p><p id="P28">If, indeed, deletion of p53 IDRs disrupts the targeting of the TF to its binding sites, one would expect these mutants to display a lower capability to induce transcription. To test this possibility, we compared the expression of two p53 targets in cells expressing p53 WT, or p53ΔC (the only mutant displaying transcriptional activity in luciferase assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>) over a p53-null background. To account for the cell-to-cell heterogeneity of ectopically expressed p53, we resorted to single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH), to quantify the number of expressed mRNAs at the single cell level and to relate it with p53 abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Notably, at similar protein expression levels, the p53ΔC mutant displayed lower mRNA counts than p53 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Such difference across p53 mutants was also reflected at the nascent transcription level, by quantifying the number of transcription sites (TS) per cell, that appear as 1 to 4 bright foci in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f-g</xref>). These results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that the p53ΔC might be less efficiently targeted to its genes, reducing their expression both at the nascent and the mature RNA level.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>An exogenous IDR fused to p53 can modulate and divert the p53 search mechanism</title><p id="P29">Since deletion of the p53 IDRs resulted in a reduction of the protein compact exploration signature, we aimed to investigate the effect of adding an exogenous IDR to p53 on the TF search mechanism.</p><p id="P30">To this purpose, we fused the IDR derived from FUS protein, to the full p53 coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). The HaloTag-FUS-p53 construct displayed nuclear localization and, differently from p53 WT, the capability of forming condensates in living cells at expression levels higher than a certain critical concentration (located around the 60-th percentile of our transfected cell population, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b-c</xref>). Analysis by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) revealed that these condensates displayed ‘solid’ properties, with a high immobile fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Notably, even outside of these condensates (where a large proportion of HaloTag-p53 still resides), FUS-p53 displayed slowed-down diffusion compared to p53 WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Accordingly, when analyzing FUS-p53 mobility at the single molecule level by paSMT, this mutant displayed a reduced mobility. The diffusion coefficients of FUS-p53 were reduced and a larger fraction of FUS-p53 molecules were classified as bound and slowly diffusing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>), with almost a two-fold drop in the fraction of fast diffusing molecules compared to WT p53. Further, diffusing FUS-p53 also displayed a stronger signature of guided exploration with a more prominent anisotropy peak at spatial scales below 150nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6e</xref>). This data indicates that FUS-p53 spends more time in the slow, anisotropic diffusion state, and therefore samples the nuclear environment in a more compact fashion, further highlighting that TFs IDRs play a major role in determining the search strategy employed by the TF. We next employed the SMT/mSIM combined approach to monitor how this more compact exploration affects the capability of targeting FUS-p53 to DNA dense domains. To our surprise, however, the analysis revealed that - on average - FUS-p53 is not enriched at DNA dense regions, independently on its diffusion coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>).</p><p id="P31">We thus applied smFISH to probe the effect of the exogenous IDR on the transcription of <italic>CDKN1a</italic> and <italic>MDM2</italic>, at the single cell level. p53 WT and FUS-p53 resulted in remarkable differences in the transcriptional output as function of the TF expression levels. Transcripts of <italic>CDKN1a</italic> and <italic>MDM2</italic> were found to increase with p53 WT levels, as expected for a transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>). The amount of synthesized mRNA in response to FUS-p53 displayed instead a more peculiar profile: at expression levels lower than a critical concentration <italic>CDKN1a</italic> and <italic>MDM2</italic> mRNA counts increased with FUS-p53 more markedly than with p53 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>). This more rapid increase was also observed for the number of active TS observed per cell, suggesting that in this regime of low FUS-p53 expression levels, the targeting of the activator to its regulated genes is enhanced. At FUS-p53 expression levels higher than a critical concentration, we instead observed a decrease in mRNA counts and active TS per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>). This observation was reproduced in another cellular model (p53KO MCF7 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Notably, no modulation in expression depending on FUS-p53 levels was observed for the p53-unrelated house-keeping gene <italic>GAPDH</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). Of note, the FUS-p53 concentration at which transcription starts to be inhibited, was found between the 50% and the 67% percentile of our cell population, roughly matching with the one at which visible FUS-p53 condensates appear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). This data suggest that IDR-mediated interactions need to be finely regulated in order to promote the targeting of the TF on its binding sites, as an excess of IDR-mediated interactions could divert the search mechanism and inhibit transcriptional activation. To test this hypothesis, we therefore re-analyzed our SMT/SIM acquisition on FUS-p53 by splitting the dataset in two subgroups: cells expressing FUS-p53 at low levels, with no visible condensation and cells expressing FUS-p53 at high levels and displaying two or more condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6h</xref>). Such analysis highlighted that bound/slow-diffusing FUS-p53 can be targeted to regions at higher DNA density when expressed at low levels, while high expression of FUS-p53 derails this targeting, resulting in the localization of both diffusing and bound p53 molecules in chromatin poor regions.</p><p id="P32">In summary, our data demonstrate that DNA density modulates the target search of p53, through interactions with the protein IDRs, and these interactions need to be finely regulated since both IDR deletions or potentiation can have detrimental effects on p53 targeting and on transcription of its target genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P33">How TFs scan the genome to identify the subset of their responsive elements to bind and regulate, and what is the role of chromatin organization in directing this search in eukaryotes are fundamental unanswered questions. To address these questions, we have developed a microscope that allows overlaying single molecule tracks of TFs on maps of chromatin organization obtained by structured illumination. We used the microscope to characterize how DNA density modulates the search process of different NFs, with particular attention to the search mechanism of the tumor suppressor p53.</p><p id="P34">Our data show that individual NFs display distinct accessibility to DNA dense regions. Some factors such as the NF-kB subunit p65 and inert tracers as the unconjugated HaloTag are excluded from chromatin-dense regions and display isotropic diffusion. Others, such as p53 and CTCF, display a specific enrichment of slow, anisotropically diffusing molecules in DNA dense nuclear regions, suggesting that these factors might be trapped in these DNA areas, to search for their target sites.</p><p id="P35">Indeed, our further characterization of p53 diffusion at endogenous levels, revealed that the search mechanism of this TF is compatible with a guided exploration mechanism. p53 alternates between a fast, non-compact exploration mode to a slower and more compact diffusion where molecules sample ~100nm sized domains exhaustively by frequently walking back on their steps, as evidenced by p53 anisotropic diffusion at short spatial scales. These slow compact diffusing molecules scan and interrogate the genome to identify their target sites, since they frequently co-localize with bound molecules. Such guided exploration appears to be modulated upon p53 activation by DNA damage and can speed up the search mechanism, as a CTD deletion mutant with reduced anisotropic diffusion displayed reduced efficiency in the activation of target genes.</p><p id="P36">Guided exploration is emerging as a common strategy to accelerate the search mechanism of nuclear proteins: for example the chromatin factors CTCF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and the Polycomb subunit CBX2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> display similar compact diffusion profiles to the ones measured here for p53. However, while CTCF forms nuclear clusters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and CBX2 form nuclear condensates that act as trapping zones for the guided exploration mechanism, p53 WT does not appear to be involved in the formation of visible clusters.</p><p id="P37">Rather, our combined SMT/SIM approach points to chromatin itself as the template for p53 compact exploration. p53 fast diffusing molecules are preferentially localized in DNA poor nuclear regions (i.e. the interchromatin compartment) while slow-scanning molecules appear to diffuse on regions at higher DNA density - potentially representing the surface of chromatin dense (CD) regions - and bound molecules often localize inside or at the edge of these CD domains. This result might reflect the behavior of p53 as a pioneer factor that binds responsive elements in inaccessible chromatin dense regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, with recent reports highlighting that p53 has pioneer activity only at nucleosome dense regions flanked by nucleosome poor ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup><sub>.</sub></p><p id="P38">Mutant analysis for p53 further suggested that the IDRs of the TF play a role in controlling such guided exploration, as p53 versions lacking IDRs display impaired guided exploration and mis-localization of bound molecules with respect to chromatin environment. This provides new evidence on the emerging role of IDRs in driving the mobility of TFs and, in turn, their targeting process. In agreement with our observations on p53, SMT has been recently used to show that the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF) 1-α and HIF 2-α display interchangeable nuclear mobility when swapping their IDRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Importantly, mutants of the yeast TFs Msn2 and Yap lacking the DNA binding domain, can still locate most of their target genes through their IDRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P39">In the last years, TF IDRs have drawn substantial attention also related to the capability of disordered proteins to form condensates that might enhance transcription by increasing the local concentration of the TF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Recent data highlight that IDRs might be important for the transactivation potential of TFs independently on their capability to form condensates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and overexpression of an isolated IDR that can interact with specific TFs can divert the TFs search<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Our results extend these observations. Fusing p53 to an exogenous IDR (derived from FUS), compact exploration and the transcription of target genes at low expression levels increase. However, higher expression of FUS-p53 leads to the formation of solid FUS-p53 condensates and results in the derailment of the search process. In these conditions, FUS-p53 bound molecules do not localize any longer in DNA dense regions and we observe downregulation of target gene transcription.</p><p id="P40">These results point to a model in which IDR-mediated interactions with the eukaryotic nucleus need to be finely balanced to warrant efficient targeting. According to this, p53 mutants deficient in IDR-mediated interactions explore the nuclear environment in a less compact fashion and are less likely to find their binding sites, but adding an exogenous IDR results in excessively compact search that sequesters the TF away from its responsive elements. A similar trade-off has been described for facilitated diffusion, the most studied accelerated search strategy in prokaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Here, optimal search is achieved when the factor spends 50% of the search time by sliding on DNA, as shorter or longer sliding times result in inefficient targeting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P41">Such model raises some novel and important questions we hope to be capable to address in the near future like identifying the mechanism that control p53 guided exploration at DNA dense region: an interesting candidate that might mediate p53 compact exploration at CD edges is nascent RNA (as IDR/RNA interactions seem to control the guided exploration of other NFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and the CD edges have been shown to be enriched in nascent RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>) or protein/protein interactions (as for example active histone marks, general transcription factors and pre-initiation complex members are found to be enriched at the boundary of CDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P42">Another important question is whether the search mechanism described here for p53 also applies to other TFs. On one side, the CD/IC interface appears as a peculiar compartment, enriched with nascent RNAs and permissive histone marks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, and it appears therefore possible that many other factors would be targeted there with high efficiency. To a limited degree, however, data on other NFs seem to point against a common shared search mechanism. Factors such as the oncogene cMyc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and the NF-kB subunit p65 (this work) display non-compact search mechanisms, while P-TEFb shows compact exploration at all spatial scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Finally, other NFs display guided exploration that depends on the capability of the factor to form clusters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Different TFs are likely to explore the nuclear environment differently, by transiently interacting with different nuclear structures, organelles/compartments and molecular players. We envision that by increasing the throughput of the SMT/mSIM approach described here for probing multiple nuclear organelles, it will be possible to map the specific nuclear landscape sensed by any individual TF.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P43">DIvA cells (originated from the human osteosarcoma U2OS) were a kind gift from the Gaëlle Legube lab <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.
