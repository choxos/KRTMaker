Here, and for the first time, IFN-I signaling was modulated in rhesus macaques (RMs) prior to and during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using a mutated IFNα2 (IFN-modulator; IFNmod), which has previously been shown to reduce the binding and signaling of endogenous IFN-I. In SARS-CoV-2-infected RMs, IFNmod reduced both antiviral and inflammatory ISGs. Notably, IFNmod treatment resulted in a potent reduction in (i) SARS-CoV-2 viral load in Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), upper airways, lung, and hilar lymph nodes; (ii) inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and CD163+MRC1-inflammatory macrophages in BAL; and (iii) expression of Siglec-1, which enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection and predicts disease severity, on circulating monocytes. In the lung, IFNmod also reduced pathogenesis and attenuated pathways of inflammasome activation and stress response during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study, using an intervention targeting both IFN-α and IFN-β pathways, shows that excessive inflammation driven by type 1 IFN critically contributes to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in RMs, and demonstrates the potential of IFNmod to limit viral replication, SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation, and COVID-19 severity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>Type-I Interferon</kwd><kwd>nonhuman primate</kwd><kwd>immunology</kwd><kwd>pathogenesis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is an ongoing and rapidly developing pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. While vaccines are highly effective, vaccine-induced immunity and neutralizing antibody titers wane over time. In addition, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants resulting in breakthrough infections remains worrisome. Thus, it is imperative to fully characterize the viral pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and early COVID-19 immune responses to identify correlates of protection and design therapeutics that can mitigate disease severity and viral replication.</p><p id="P4">Type-I interferons (IFN-I) are ubiquitously expressed cytokines that play a central role in innate antiviral immunity and cell-intrinsic immunity against viral pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The receptors for IFN-I, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, are universally expressed and trigger the transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), that mediate a myriad of antiviral effector functions and promote recruitment of inflammatory cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Work early in the pandemic indicated that the IFN-I system has a protective effect from disease in SARS-CoV-2 infection, as individuals with severe COVID-19 were demonstrated to be more likely to have deficiencies to IFN-I responses, either by the presence of rare inborn errors (<italic>TLR3</italic>, <italic>IRF7</italic>, <italic>TICAM1</italic>, <italic>TBK1</italic>, or <italic>IFNAR1</italic>), neutralizing auto-antibodies against IFN-I, or the lack of production of IFN-I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Additionally, Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of critically ill COVID-19 patients have identified multiple critical COVID-19-associated variants in genes that are involved in IFN-I signaling including <italic>IFNA10</italic>, <italic>IFNAR2</italic>, <italic>TYK2,</italic> as well as type III interferon signaling <italic>IL10RB</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. These findings contributed to the establishment of a model in which sustained IFN-I responses were deemed to be critical for protecting SARS-CoV-2-infected patients from progressing to severe COVID-19.</p><p id="P5">However, more recent work has suggested that the role of the IFN-I system in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be more complex than initially thought. In contrast to the aforementioned studies, Povysil et al. found no associations between rare loss-of-function variants in IFN-I and severe COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Further, Lee et al. demonstrated that hyper-inflammatory signatures characterized by IFN-I response in conjunction with TNF/IL-1β were associated with severe COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and Blanco-Melo et al. showed that high IFN-I expression in the lung was linked to increased morbidity early in the COVID-19 pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Additionally, prolonged IFN signaling in murine models of respiratory infection have recently been shown to interfere with repair in lung epithelia, increasing disease severity and susceptibility to bacterial infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Further work also has demonstrated the association of multiple ISGs with increased SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM 1-3) have been shown to be commandeered by SARS-CoV-2 to increase efficiency of viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, the IFN-I-inducible receptor sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 1 (Siglec-1/CD169) can function as an attachment receptor and enhances ACE2-mediated infection and induction of trans-infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, and prolonged cGAS-STING signaling has also been shown to induce aberrant IFN-I induced immunopathology by macrophages surrounding infected endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Lastly, IFN-I can also drive the expansion of pro-inflammatory monocytes (CD14<sup>+</sup> CD16<sup>+</sup>), which have been shown to phagocytose FCγRs followed by abortive infection and induction of pyroptosis that induces systemic inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Several ongoing and recently completed clinical trials administering IFNs have shown little to no positive effects of therapy during acute infection, despite treatment with IFN being highly efficient against SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. No beneficial effects were observed with either IFNβ-1a or combination IFNβ-1a and remdesivir treatment in in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the WHO Solidarity Trial and Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-3) respectively. In fact, combination IFNβ-1a and remdesivir actually resulted in worse outcomes and respiratory status in ACTT-3 patients who required high-flow oxygen at baseline when compared to treatment with remdesivir alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Pegylated IFN-α2b has shown some promise in moderate COVI-19 patients, with a phase 3 randomized open label study showing that patients that received pegylated IFN-α2b experienced a faster time to viral clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Recently, there has been renewed interest in pursuing IFN-λ as a COVID-19 therapeutic following a recent initial release of the data on the Phase 3 TOGETHER clinical trial showing that early administration of pegylated IFN-λ resulted in a 50% risk reduction of COVID-19-related hospitalizations or lengthy emergency room visits in individuals at high risk of developing severe COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Given the discordant effects of IFN treatment observed in the aforementioned trials as well as the demonstrated ability of Type I and III IFNs to inhibit lung tissue repair in viral respiratory infections and render the host susceptible to opportunistic bacterial infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, it is critical that further research on therapies targeting IFN pathways is conducted to determine the optimal balance of stimulation of antiviral response while avoiding excessive inflammation and maintaining tissue repair pathways.</p><p id="P8">One compound previously used to effectively manipulate the IFN-I system is a mutated IFNα2 which binds with high affinity to IFNAR2, but markedly lower affinity to IFNAR1, with a net effect of reducing the binding and signaling of all forms of endogenous IFN-I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (as such, previously referred to as IFN-I competitive antagonist, IFN-1ant).

Multiple previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> have shown that RMs generate a rapid and robust IFN-I response following SARS-CoV-2 infection, with numerous ISGs upregulated as early as 1-day post-infection. To better understand the role of IFN-I in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we characterized the effects of IFNmod on ISGs, SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, and pathology in an RM model.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>IFNmod administration decreases SARS-CoV-2 loads in airways of RMs</title><p id="P10">We first administered IFNmod to four uninfected RMs (7-10 years old, median = 9.5 years, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) at a dose of 1 mg/day, intramuscularly, for 4 consecutive days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) to determine its impact on ISGs in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcript levels of a panel of 17 ISGs previously observed to be induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> in RMs were quantified by RNAseq at pre- and post-treatment timepoints. ISGs were observed to be modestly upregulated following IFNmod administration in both BAL and PBMC of uninfected RMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b-c</xref>), whereas IL-6 signaling and inflammatory genes remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d-e</xref>). Additionally, in concordance with the unchanged expression of IL-6 signaling and inflammatory genes, IFNmod treatment in uninfected animals did not impact cytokines and chemokines associated with inflammation and recruitment of inflammatory cells including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p40, TNFβ, IFNγ, MIP1α, and MIP1β (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>). Consistent with the data in uninfected RMs, IFNmod treatment alone in Calu-3 human lung cancer cells induced low-level expression of antiviral ISGs OAS1 and ISG15 but did not lead to detectable differences of the pro-inflammatory chemokine CXCL10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a-c</xref>). Importantly, in the presence of IFNα stimulation, IFNmod inhibited expression of both antiviral ISGs (ISG15, OAS1) and the pro-inflammatory CXCL10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a-c</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that IFNmod stimulates a weak antiviral IFN-I response in the absence of endogenous IFNα, but potently inhibits both antiviral and pro-inflammatory IFN-I pathways induced in response to addition of IFNα. In a follow up experiment, Calu-3 cells were treated with IFNmod and, 24-hours later, infected with SARS-CoV-2 NL-020-2020 (MOI 0.1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis of the supernatant at 48-hours post-infection demonstrated that IFNmod inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner, with up to 80% reduction in viral RNA copies at the highest tested dose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2e-f</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To determine how IFN-I pathways affect SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, 18 adult RMs (6-20 years old, mean = 10 years; 10 males and 8 females; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) were age and sex matched between two experimental arms to receive 4 doses of IFNmod (intramuscularly, 1 mg/day; IFNmod-treated group) starting from one day prior to infection (d-1) and continued until 2 days post-infection (dpi), mimicking the 4-day dosing regimen of the uninfected RMs, or to remain untreated (untreated group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).

Consistent with this model, expression of GSDMD, a central regulator of NLRP3-regulated pyroptosis, was highest in monocyte/macrophage populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>).

Here, we employed an integrated systems approach in a nonhuman primate model to dissect the opposing roles of antiviral and pro-inflammatory IFN-I responses in SARS-CoV-2 using a mutated IFNα2 (IFN-I modulator; IFNmod) that was previously demonstrated to have a high affinity to IFNAR2 and markedly lower affinity to IFNAR1, result in receptor occupancy, and block binding and signaling of all forms of endogenous IFN-I produced in response to viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. While SARS-CoV-2-infection in untreated RMs was shown to induce a strong IFN-I response with concomitant inflammation and lung damage, IFNmod remarkably and potently reduced viral loads in the upper and lower airways, inflammation and lung pathology. Therefore, our study shows for the first time in NHP and with an <italic>in vivo</italic> intervention targeting IFN-I pathways that an aberrant IFN-I response critically contributes to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and demonstrates a beneficial role of IFNmod in limiting both viral replication and SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation.</p><p id="P35">The administration of IFNmod prior to and during the first two days of SARS-CoV-2 infection was found to result in a highly significant reduction in viral loads in the BAL (&gt;3 log reduction), nasal, and throat swabs. Additionally, IFNmod reduced viral loads in the upper and lower lungs as well as hilar LNs of RMs during the treatment period and limited lung pathology as well as the production of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines within the lower airways.</p><p id="P36">We show that IFNmod administration prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection in RMs results in a subtle upregulation of antiviral ISGs, while potently dampening endogenous IFN-I signaling and limiting the immunopathology that has been linked to IFN-I following SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data support a working model in which a sustained and systemic IFN-I response, particularly when extended to pro-inflammatory genes, exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 pathology and suggests that targeting downstream modulators of IFN-I responses may prove to be a viable therapeutic option. Of note, while IFNmod reduced viral loads and pathology in our SARS-CoV-2-infected RMs, it resulted in significantly higher plasma viral loads, increased CD4+ T cell depletion, and a more rapid progression to AIDS in SIV-infected RMs when administered during the first 4 weeks of infection. These results highlight that modulating IFN-I during infection with inherently different viruses (SARS-CoV-2, which establishes an acute infection that is naturally controlled in a few weeks in RMs and SIV, which establishes a persistent, chronic infection) can have vastly different effects on pathogenesis.</p><p id="P37">Our data also show a central role of IFN-I in regulating the axis of infiltrating monocytes and subsequent inflammation within the airway and lung interstitium during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous studies have observed hyperactivation of monocytes and macrophages in COVID-19 (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>). Within the lower airway, an early study identified elevated expression of IL1B, IL6, TNF within alveolar macrophages in patients with severe COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.

In these studies, a consistent model has emerged in which resident tissue alveolar macrophages are displaced by inflammatory, infiltrating monocytes and interstitial macrophages.

Moreover, and supporting recent studies in humanized mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, our work demonstrates that targeted modulation of the IFN-I system during early SARS-CoV-2 can effectively eliminate the level of cell-associated virus on macrophages and broadly dampen induction of the inflammasome.</p><p id="P38">Autopsies of patients succumbing to severe COVID-19 have linked disease pathology to the accumulation of aberrantly activated macrophages in lungs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> and hyperactivated Siglec1+ macrophages co-localizing with SARS-CoV-2 in the hilar LNs of autopsy samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>.

In this context, the observation that IFNmod was able to potently reduce the expression of the viral attachment receptor Siglec-1 on CD14+ blood monocytes and BAL macrophages, with concomitantly lowered ISG expression and inflammasome activation, provides a possible mechanism by which the IFN system may enhance trans-infection and enable propagation and dissemination of inflamed macrophages in the airspace. Our scRNA-Seq data are consistent with the “Trojan horse” hypothesis and extend it by identifying that the CD163<sup>+</sup>MRC1<sup>-</sup> and CD163<sup>+</sup>TREM2<sup>+</sup> populations are the predominant populations in the lung in which the inflammasome is induced.</p><p id="P39">This study, using an intervention targeting both IFN-α and IFN-β pathways, shows that excessive inflammation driven by type 1 IFN critically contributes to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in RMs, and demonstrates the potential of IFNmod to limit viral replication, SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation, and COVID-19 severity.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Study Approval</title><p id="P40">EPC’s animal care facilities are accredited by both the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).

For single-cell RNA-Seq, approximately 20,000 cells were loaded onto the 10X Genomics Chromium Controller in the BSL3 facility using the Chromium NextGEM Single Cell 5’ Library &amp; Gel Bead kit according to manufacturer instructions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. The resulting gene expression libraries were sequenced as paired-end 26×91 reads on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 targeting a depth of 50,000 reads per cell. Cell Ranger software was used to perform demultiplexing of cellular transcript data, and mapping and annotation of UMIs and transcripts for downstream data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Bulk RNA-Seq analysis</title><p id="P59">Reads were aligned using STAR v2.7.3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. The STAR index was built by combining genome sequences for Macaca mulatta (Mmul10 Ensembl release 100), SARS-CoV2 (strain MT246667.1 - NCBI). The gffread utility (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/gpertea/gffread">https://github.com/gpertea/gffread</ext-link>) was used to convert gff3 file for SARS-CoV2 and the resulting gtf file for SARS-CoV2 was edited to include exon entries which had the same coordinates as CDS to get counts with STAR. The combined genomic and gtf files were used for generating the STAR index. Transcript abundance estimates were calculated internal to the STAR aligner using the algorithm of htseq-count<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. The ReadsPerGene files were read in R constructing a count matrix that was imported in DESeq2 using the DESeqDataSetFromMatrix function. DESeq2 was used for normalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>, producing both a normalized read count table and a regularized log expression table. Only the protein coding genes defined in the gtf file were used for analysis. The design used was: ∼ Subject + Treatment * Timepoint. The regularized log expression values were obtained using the rlog function with the parameters blind =FALSE and filtType = “parametric”. GSEA 4.1.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/">https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/</ext-link>) was used for gene set enrichment analysis with the following gene sets: Hallmark and Reactome and Biocarta Canonical pathways (MsigDB), NHP ISGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. GSEA was run with default parameters with the permutation type set to gene_set.

The gene expression matrix was filtered to include protein coding genes and exclude genes encoded on Y chromosome, B and T cell receptor genes, mitochondrial genes, RPS and RPL genes and SARS-CoV2 genes. The cells were filtered based on the following criteria: (i) nFeature_RNA between 500 and 5000 and (ii) percent mitochondrial genes &lt;= 25%. Normalization was performed using SCTransform and the samples were integrated using reciprocal PCA. The first 30 dimensions were used and clustering was carried out with the resolution set to 0.1 using the default Louvain algorithm in seurat. The clusters were annotated based on the expression of canonical markers and roughly divided into four major subsets: epithelial, myeloid, lymphoid and others. Each subset was then clustered separately to fine tune the cell type annotations.
