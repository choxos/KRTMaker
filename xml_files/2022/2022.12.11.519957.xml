Understanding the mechanisms of immunosuppression can lead to strategies for bioengineering disease resistance. Here, we show that a cyst nematode virulence effector binds and inhibits oligomerization of the helper NLR protein NRC2 by physically preventing intramolecular rearrangements required for activation. A single amino acid polymorphism at the binding interface between NRC2 and the inhibitor is sufficient for this helper NLR to evade immune suppression, thereby restoring the activity of multiple disease resistance genes. This points to a novel strategy for resurrecting disease resistance in crop genomes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The nucleotide binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) class of intracellular immune receptors are an important component of innate immunity in plants and animals. They mediate intracellular recognition of pathogens and subsequently initiate an array of immune responses in order to counteract infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). NLRs can be activated by pathogen-secreted virulence proteins, termed effectors, which pathogens deliver into host cells to modulate host physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). A hallmark of plant and animal NLR activation is their oligomerization into higher order immune complexes termed resistosomes or inflammasomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). These complexes initiate immune signaling via diverse mechanisms, often leading to a form of programmed cell death, termed hypersensitive response (HR) in plants or pyroptosis in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Recent studies have reported NLR-like proteins mediating antiviral immunity and programmed cell death in prokaryotes via mechanisms analogous to those found in eukaryotic NLRs, suggesting that this is a conserved defense mechanism across all three domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Remarkably, pathogen effectors can act both as triggers and suppressors of NLR-mediated immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). In some cases, adapted pathogens deploy effectors which directly or indirectly interfere with NLR signaling to suppress immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). However, the exact biochemical mechanisms by which pathogen effectors compromise NLR-mediated immunity to promote disease remain largely unknown. Moreover, whereas multiple strategies to bioengineer novel effector recognition specificities in NLRs have been proposed in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), approaches to mitigate the impact of effector-mediated immune suppression of NLRs are lacking.</p><p id="P5">NLRs belong to the signal ATPases with numerous domains (STAND) superfamily. They typically exhibit a tripartite domain architecture consisting of an N-terminal signaling domain, a central nucleotide binding domain and C-terminal superstructure forming repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The central domain, termed NB-ARC (nucleotide binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, plant R proteins and CED-4) in plant NLRs, is a hallmark of this protein family and plays a key role as a molecular switch, mediating conformational changes required for activation. NB-ARC domains consist of a nucleotide binding domain (NB), a helical domain (HD1), and a winged-helix domain (WHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Diverse NLR activation and signaling strategies are found in nature. In some cases one NLR protein, termed a singleton, can mediate both elicitor perception and subsequent immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). However, some NLRs can function as receptor pairs or in higher order configurations termed immune receptor networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). In these cases, one NLR acts as a pathogen sensor, requiring a second helper NLR to initiate immune signaling. Such is the case in the solanaceous NRC immune receptor network, which is comprised of multiple sensor NLRs that require an array of downstream helper NLRs termed NRCs (NLRs required for cell death) to successfully initiate immune signaling. Upon perception of their cognate effectors, sensors in this network activate oligomerization of their downstream NRC helpers into a putative NRC resistosome, without stably forming part of the mature complex. This has been termed the activation-and release model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The NRC network can encompass up to half of the NLRome in some solanaceous plant species and plays a key role in mediating immunity against a variety of plant pathogens including oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, nematodes and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Plant and metazoan parasites have evolved effectors that interfere with host NLR signaling to promote disease. Parasite effectors can suppress NLR-mediated immunity indirectly by interfering with host proteins that act downstream of NLR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), or directly by interacting with NLRs to inhibit their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). One such example is the potato cyst nematode (<italic>Globodera rostochiensis</italic>) effector, SPRYSEC15 (SS15), which can suppress signaling mediated by <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> helper NLRs NRC2 and NRC3 and tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) helper NLR NRC1, by binding to their central NB-ARC domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1A</xref>). In this study, we reasoned that mapping the binding interface between SS15 and its target helper NLRs would enable us to bioengineer NLR variants that evade pathogen suppression, therefore resurrecting the immune signaling activity of upstream sensors in the NRC network.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P7">First, we investigated how SS15 binding to NRC2 prevents immune signaling., notably whether SS15 prevents oligomerization of NRC following sensor NLR activation. To test this hypothesis, we transiently co-expressed NRC2 or NRC4 with their upstream sensor Rx and the effector SS15 in leaves of <italic>nrc2/3/4</italic> CRISPR KO <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants and leveraged previously established BN-PAGE-based readouts for NRC resistosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). For biochemical analyses, we used previously described NRC2 and NRC4 variants with mutations in their N-terminal MADA motifs (NRC2<sup>EEE</sup> and NRC4<sup>AAA</sup>, respectively) which abolish cell death induction without compromising receptor activation, oligomerization, or localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). We activated the Rx-NRC system by co-expressing PVX CP-GFP or free GFP as an inactive control. In the absence of SS15, both NRC2 and NRC4 oligomerize upon effector-triggered activation mediated by their upstream sensor Rx. However, when SS15 is present, Rx/CP-activated NRC2 is unable to oligomerize and appears as a band of ∼240 kDa, which co-migrates with SS15. Inactive NRC2 co-expressed with SS15 also migrates as a band of ∼240 kDa, which is slower-migrating relative to inactive NRC2 in the absence of SS15, indicative of <italic>in vivo</italic> NRC2-SS15 complex formation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1</xref>). We also observed that SS15 co-expression not only blocks NRC2 oligomerization but also prevents the previously reported shift of NRC2 from cytoplasm to PM as well as the formation of NRC2 PM-associated puncta upon Rx/CP activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). In contrast, NRC4 oligomerization is not affected in the presence of SS15, which is in line with previous findings that NRC4 immune signaling is not suppressed by SS15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). We conclude that SS15 can suppress immune signaling by acting as a direct proteinaceous inhibitor of NRC2, but not NRC4, by directly binding to its NB-ARC domain to block the formation of a signal-competent oligomeric resistosome.</p><p id="P8">Given that NRC4 retains the capacity to oligomerize in the presence of SS15, we leveraged this differential SS15 sensitivity between NRC2 and NRC4 to identify the domain that determines SS15 association and inhibition. We generated a series of NRC2-NRC4 chimeric proteins (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3</xref>), which we subsequently assayed for SS15 association via <italic>in planta</italic> co-immunoprecipitation. We identified one chimeric variant of NRC4, carrying the HD1-1 region of NRC2 (NRC4<sup>2HD1-1</sup>), which gains association to SS15 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Unlike NRC4, NRC4<sup>2HD1-1</sup> is susceptible to inhibition by SS15 and is unable to oligomerize and trigger cell death in the presence of SS15 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3, Fig. S4</xref>). We conclude that the HD1-1 region is important for association to SS15 and for the effector to directly inhibit NRC oligomerization and programmed cell death.</p><p id="P9">To further define the interface between SS15 and NRC proteins, we crystallized SS15 in complex with the NB-ARC domain of SlNRC1, a tomato NRC that is inhibited by the nematode effector. We subsequently solved the structure using X-ray diffraction data collected to 4.5 Å resolution (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5, Table S3</xref>), which allowed us to determine that SS15 binds to a loop in the HD1-1 region of NRCs which connects the NB domain to the HD1 and WHD domains. This provides orthogonal evidence that the SS15-NRC interactions are mediated by this region as shown with the chimera experiments (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This loop was previously shown to act as a “hinge”, allowing the NB domain to rotate relative to the HD1 and WHD domains following activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). We propose that SS15 prevents conformational changes that are critical for NLR activation by binding and immobilizing the NB-HD1 hinge.</p><p id="P10">Given that SS15 suppresses cell death induction mediated by SlNRC1, NRC2 and NRC3 but not NRC4 or other well characterized NLRs such as ZAR1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), we leveraged the high degree of conservation that is characteristic of plant NB-ARC domains to narrow down residues within the binding interface that underpin this interaction. We shortlisted residues within the HD1-1 region that are similar in SlNRC1, NRC2 and NRC3 but different in NRC4 or AtZAR1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Combining information from the co-crystal structure and the alignments allowed us to select 13 candidate residues to test by mutagenesis in NRC2 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). We mutated each of these residues to the corresponding amino acid found in NRC4 and screened these NRC2 variants for susceptibility to SS15 inhibition in cell death assays. This revealed two variants, NRC2<sup>E316P</sup> and NRC2<sup>D317K</sup> which triggered cell death when activated by Rx/CP and were no longer inhibited by SS15 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6, Fig. S7</xref>). We also tested all 13 single amino acid mutants for association with SS15 by <italic>in planta</italic> co-immunoprecipitation and found that NRC2<sup>E316P</sup> and NRC2<sup>D317K</sup> exhibited reduced association with SS15 relative to NRC2 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6</xref>), which is in line with the observation that SS15 is not able to suppress these variants (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). We conclude that the E316 and D317 residues are critical for SS15-mediated inhibition of NRC2 and that mutating these residues to their equivalent amino acid in NRC4 allows Rx/CP-activated NRC2 to evade SS15 association and inhibition.</p><p id="P11">We next tested whether these two SS15-evading variants of NRC2 could restore functionality of NRC2-dependent sensor NLRs that are suppressed by the parasite effector. We tested this by performing complementation assays with NRC2<sup>E316P</sup> and NRC2<sup>D317K</sup> in <italic>nrc2/3/4</italic> CRISPR KO <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants. We activated the NRC2 variants with a panel of agronomically important sensor NLRs mediating resistance to diverse pathogens, including the potato cyst nematode R gene Gpa2 (an allele of Rx), as well as other well characterized oomycete and bacterial resistance proteins. Remarkably, NRC2<sup>D317K</sup> evaded SS15 inhibition with all tested sensor NLRs restoring their capacity to activate immune signaling (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S8, Fig. S9</xref>). In contrast, NRC2<sup>E316P</sup> could evade SS15 suppression when activated by Rx, but not when activated by other sensors. We therefore selected NRC2<sup>D317K</sup> for follow-up biochemical studies, using BN-PAGE-based assays. Unlike NRC2, activated NRC2<sup>D317K</sup> oligomerized even in the presence of SS15 and did not form an <italic>in vivo</italic> complex with the inhibitor (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). We conclude that NRC2<sup>D317K</sup> can fully evade SS15-mediated immune suppression, retaining the capacity to oligomerize and mediate cell death when activated by multiple agronomically important sensor NLRs.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P12">Our study reveals how a parasite effector has evolved as an inhibitor of a helper NLR by directly binding its NB-ARC domain to prevent resistosome formation and immune signaling. By binding and immobilizing a critical hinge loop in the HD1 region of the NB-ARC, SS15 restricts movement of the NB domain relative to the HD1 and WHD domains, preventing immune receptor activation. Remarkably, while SS15 can bind and inhibit NRC2, it cannot bind or inhibit the NRC2 paralog NRC4. We exploited NRC4’s resilience to SS15 inhibition by making chimeric NRC2-NRC4 variants which, together with structural information, helped us identify the inhibitor binding interface. Mutational studies of this interface allowed us to generate a single amino acid variant of NRC2 (NRC2<sup>D317K</sup>) that evades SS15 inhibition without compromising receptor signaling capacity. This NRC2<sup>D317K</sup> variant can now support signaling by any NRC2-dependent sensor even in the presence of SS15.</p><p id="P13">The existence of plant parasite secreted NLR inhibitors suggests that suppressed resistance genes may occur in crop genomes. Leveraging the approach detailed in this study, it may be possible to resurrect cryptic or defeated resistance proteins to enhance disease resistance. Moreover, considering that multiple sensors can signal through the same downstream helper, applying this approach to helper NLRs holds potential to simultaneously resurrect multiple upstream sensor NLRs. Importantly, the single amino acid NRC2 variants we identified could in theory be generated in-locus using gene editing technologies in agronomically important crop species, making deployment of this technology viable in countries where transgenic approaches are not feasible. Our work describes a novel approach to achieve robust immunity by engineering NLRs that avoid parasite suppression. This could in theory be applied to other plant, metazoan or even prokaryotic NLR immune receptors that are directly targeted by parasite effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Combined with recent advances in NLR engineering to achieve novel pathogen recognition specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), this technology holds the potential to unlock a new era in disease resistance breeding.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Plant growth conditions</title><p id="P14">Wild-type and <italic>nrc2/3/4</italic> CRISPR mutant <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> lines were grown in a controlled environment growth chamber with a temperature range of 22 to 25 ºC, humidity of 45% to 65% and a 16/8-hour light/dark cycle.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p id="P15">We used the Golden Gate Modular Cloning (MoClo) kit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) and the MoClo plants part kit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) for cloning.

In brief, leaf material was ground to fine powder using liquid nitrogen and 2x volume of extraction buffer was added. Extraction buffer consisted of 0.81M sucrose, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM EGTA, 5mM KCl, and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) supplemented with 5 mM DTT, 1% Sigma Plant Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, 1 mM PMSF and 0.5% PVPP. After addition of the buffer, the samples were vortexed for a minute and the cell debris was cleared out by two subsequent centrifugation steps at 1000 xg for 5 min. The supernatant was diluted 1:1 using distilled water and an aliquot of the supernatant was separated as the total fraction (T). The remaining supernatant (200-300 μL) was further centrifuged at 21,000 xg for 90 min at 4°C. This centrifugation yielded the supernatant (soluble fraction, S) and membrane enriched pellet (membrane fraction, M). After separating the soluble fraction, the pellet was resuspended in diluted extraction buffer (without PVPP). All the fractions were diluted with SDS loading dye, and proteins were denatured by incubating at 50°C for 15 min. Western blotting was performed as previously described following SDS-PAGE. Endogenous plasma membrane ATPase was detected using anti-H+ATPase (AS07 260) antibody (Agrisera) as a marker to show the success of membrane enrichment.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Heterologous protein production and purification from <italic>E. coli</italic>

Drops composed of 0.3 μL of protein solution and 0.3 μL of reservoir solution were set up in MRC 96-well crystallisation plates (Molecular Dimensions), which were dispensed using an Oryx Nano or an Oryx8 robot (Douglas Instruments). Crystal growth was monitored using a Minstrel Desktop Crystal Imaging System (Rikagu). Suitable crystals grew after 72 hrs in a Morpheus screen crystallisation condition containing 0.1M MES buffer (pH 6.5), 10% (w/v) PEG8000 and 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol (Molecular Dimensions) and were harvested by flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen using LithoLoops (Molecular Dimensions). X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Diamond Light Source (Didcot, UK) on beamline I03 using an Eiger2 XE 16M pixel array detector (Dectris) with crystals maintained at 100 K by a Cryojet cryocooler (Oxford Instruments).</p><p id="P28">X-ray data were integrated, and scaled using XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), as implemented through the XIA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) pipeline, and then merged using AIMLESS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), via the CCP4i2 graphical user interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). The NRC1<sup>NB-ARC</sup>-SS15 complex crystallised in space group <italic>P</italic>6<sub>1</sub> with cell parameters <italic>a</italic>=<italic>b</italic>=128.6, <italic>c</italic>=170.7 Å, and the best crystal yielded diffraction data to 4.5 Å resolution (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3</xref> for a summary of data collection and refinement statistics). Given the small size of the dataset, we assigned 10% of the data (883 unique reflections) for the <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> calculation, to give a more statistically meaningful metric. The crystal structure of NRC1<sup>NB-ARC</sup> alone was already available (PDB 6S2P), but there was no experimentally determined structure for SS15. Thus, we made use of AlphaFold2-multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), as implemented through Colabfold (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb">https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) to generate structural predictions for the complex. There was very good sequence coverage for both proteins and the five independent models of the individual components were closely similar. The pLDDT scores were generally good (e.g. averages of 82 and 75 for NRC1<sup>NB-ARC</sup> and SS15 models, respectively, from the rank 1 predictions). However, the relative placement of the two components varied across the five models and the corresponding PAE scores indicated very low confidence in these predictions. A comparison of the five NRC1<sup>NB-ARC</sup> models with the known crystal structure showed a good agreement (e.g. superposition of the rank 1 model gave an rmsd of 1.77 Å). Given that the AlphaFold2 (AF2) model provided starting coordinates for several loops missing from the crystal structure, we decided to use this model in molecular replacement. Templates for both components were prepared using the “Process Predicted Models” CCP4i2 task, which removed low confidence regions (based on pLDDT) and converted the pLDDT scores in the <italic>B</italic>-factor field of the PDB coordinate files to pseudo <italic>B</italic>-factors. Analysis of the likely composition of the asymmetric unit (ASU) suggested that it contained two copies of each component, giving an estimated solvent content of ∼67%. PHASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) was able to place the four chains within the ASU, although the second SS15 domain required manual repositioning with respect to its neighbouring NRC1 domain in order to avoid a number of clashes and improve the fit to the density. This was achieved using COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>) and guided by the arrangement of the other NRC1-SS15 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4</xref>). The structure was then subjected to jelly body refinement in REFMAC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) using ProSMART restraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>) generated from the AF2 models, giving <italic>R</italic><sub>work</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> values of 0.357 and 0.401, respectively, to 4.5 Å resolution.</p><p id="P29">Now it was possible to generate more complete models for the components by superposing the original unprocessed AF2 models and trimming these with reference to the improved electron density. Furthermore, a significant region of positive difference density was present at the cores of both NRC1 domains, which corresponded to the ADP in the crystal structure; thus we incorporated ADP into the model. Due to the low resolution of the dataset, only very limited rebuilding was possible in COOT, where Geman-McClure and Ramachandran restraints were used to maintain good stereochemical parameters. After several cycles of restrained refinement in REFMAC5 and editing in COOT, a reasonable model was obtained with <italic>R</italic><sub>work</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> values of 0.258 and 0.298, respectively. However, there remained a region of positive difference density near the N-termini of both SS15 domains that we could not adequately explain. At this point we re-ran the AlphaFold2-multimer predictions, but this time with one copy of the complex taken from the crystal structure as a reference template. Although the new predictions did not produce complexes that were consistent with the X-ray data, and the models for the individual components did not appear to be noticeably improved based on pLDDT scores, we used them as starting points to rebuild the X-ray structure.</p><p id="P30">Significantly, for several models, the N-terminal region of SS15 adopted conformations that partially accounted for the region of positive difference density electron density, and this could be improved by careful rebuilding and refinement. This “AlphaFold recycling” procedure was repeated a further two times before finalising the structure, which included residues 153-494 for SlNRC1 (numbered with respect to full length protein) and residues 18-223 for SS15, where residues 33-43 in both copies of the latter formed α-helices that occupied the regions of positive difference density observed earlier. For the last refinement in REFMAC5, the following options were used: ProSMART restraints generated from the latest AF2 models, overall <italic>B</italic>-factor refinement with TLS restraints (where each protein chain was treated as a separate domain), and non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. The final model gave <italic>R</italic><sub>work</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> values of 0.237 and 0.275, respectively, to 4.5 Å resolution (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3</xref> for a summary of refinement statistics).

consisting of multiple sensor NLRs (in blue) and their downstream helper NLRs, NRC2 and NRC4 (in purple and green, respectively). Effector-triggered activation of a sensor leads to downstream helper oligomerization and resistosome formation. The <italic>G. rostochiensis</italic> effector SS15 (in yellow) can directly bind to the NB-ARC domain of NRC2 but not NRC4, thereby inhibiting signaling by directly binding to the NB-ARC domain of this helper NLR. (<bold>B</bold>) BN-PAGE assays with inactive and activated Rx together with NRC2 or NRC4, in the absence or presence of SS15. C-terminally V5-tagged Rx and C-terminally 4xMyc-tagged NRC2<sup>EEE</sup> or NRC4<sup>AAA</sup> were co-expressed with either free GFP or C-terminally GFP-tagged PVX CP. These effector-sensor-helper combinations were co-infiltrated together with a 6xHA-mCherry fusion protein or with N-terminally 6xHA-tagged SS15.
