We scaled haploid CRISPR-Cas9 base editing to target the entire human spliceosome and interrogated the mutants using the U2 snRNP/SF3b inhibitor, pladienolide B. Hypersensitive substitutions define functional sites in the U1/U2-containing A-complex but also in components that act as late as the second chemical step after SF3b is dissociated. Viable resistance substitutions map not only to the pladienolide B binding site but also to the G-patch (ATPase activator) domain of SUGP1, which lacks orthologs in yeast. We used these mutants and biochemical approaches to identify the spliceosomal disassemblase DHX15/hPrp43 as the ATPase ligand for SUGP1. These and other data support a model in which SUGP1 promotes splicing fidelity by triggering early spliceosome disassembly in response to kinetic blocks. Our approach provides a template for the analysis of essential cellular machines in humans.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression. In addition to driving proteome diversity via alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Blencowe, 2017</xref>), splicing impacts RNA stability, for example through the inclusion of exons with premature termination codons subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), and plays critical roles in RNA export and translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Le Hir et al., 2016</xref>). Splicing is also a major player in human disease: a large fraction of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with human disease impact splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Li et al., 2016</xref>), and many human cancers harbor driver mutations in components of the spliceosome itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bejar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Yoshimi et al., 2019</xref>)</p><p id="P3">There are four intron sequences important for splicing: the 5' splice site (SS), the branchpoint (BP), the polypyrimidine tract (PPT), and 3' splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In humans, there is large variability in these sequences, which can have an enormous impact on splicing efficiency and regulation, enabling regulation by RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Pre-mRNA splicing proceeds via two transesterification reactions which are catalyzed by the spliceosome. Compared to the simplicity of the chemical steps, the spliceosome is staggeringly complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 A,B</xref>). Components include five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs – U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5) and numerous proteins that assemble onto the intron substrate and undergo several large rearrangements to form a catalytically active complex in which a U6 snRNA acts as an RNA catalyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wilkinson et al., 2020</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> from which much of our understanding has been developed, splicing of a single intron requires eight ATP-dependent steps and about 90 proteins. Human spliceosomes appear to contain about 60 additional proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Wahl et al., 2009a</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Initial intron recognition involves base-pairing between the 5' end of U1 snRNA and the 5' SS and recognition of the branchpoint, PPT, and 3' SS by sequence-specific RNA binding proteins: Splicing Factor 1 (SF1/Msl5) recognizes the branchpoint sequence while the two subunits of U2AF recognize the PPT and the conserved AG dinucleotide at the 3' splice site. This forms an early, or E, complex that is the precursor to the A complex in which U2 snRNP binds to the intron, base-pairing with sequences around the branchpoint (the branchpoint sequence), replacing SF1 and U2AF. A triple snRNP, containing base-paired U4/U6 snRNAs together with the U5 snRNA, then joins the complex to form the pre-B complex which converts to the B complex by the departure of U1. Activation of the spliceosome occurs via ATP-dependent rearrangements that expels the U4 snRNP and several proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wahl et al., 2009b</xref>), allowing the PRPF19/Prp19 complex (NTC) and NTC-related proteins (NTR) to join. This produces the B<sup>act</sup> complex, in which U6 base-pairs with the 5' splice site and U2 and U6 snRNAs base-pair to form the spliceosomal active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wilkinson et al., 2020</xref>). A component of U2 snRNP, the SF3 complex, which sequesters the U2-branchpoint helix away from the 5' splice site, is then removed, allowing the U2-branchpoint helix to dock with the catalytic core. Association of additional proteins allow the chemical steps to proceed in the B* and C* catalytic complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wilkinson et al., 2020</xref>). The ATPases DHX38/Prp16 and DHX8/Prp22 respectively remodel the active site after each chemical step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wahl et al., 2009b</xref>). Following mRNA release, the helicase DHX15/Prp43 disassembles the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Martin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Tsai et al., 2005</xref>). Like other DEAH-box helicases, DHX15/Prp43 is activated by a cognate G-patch protein, TFIP11/Spp382/Ntr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Given the high variability in splicing signal sequences in humans, how the spliceosome distinguishes between cognate and noncognate sequences remains to be understood. A longstanding hypothesis suggests that the dynamic and complex nature of the spliceosome promotes the fidelity of splicing through kinetic proofreading while also permitting substrate flexibility and regulation. Evidence supporting this model came from a genetic screen in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in which missense mutations in the ATPase Prp16 were identified as suppressors of a mutation in the branchpoint adenosine sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Burgess and Guthrie, 1993</xref>). Subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> studies demonstrated that mutant pre-mRNA substrates that assemble into spliceosomes, but are kinetically slow at either chemical step, trigger spliceosome disassembly prior to completion of the reaction, a process termed “discard” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Koodathingal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Koodathingal and Staley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Mayas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mayas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Semlow and Staley, 2012</xref>). Failure to perform catalysis prior to ATP hydrolysis by Prp16 (step 1) or Prp22 (step 2) produces a spliceosome that can be disassembled by Prp43. These ATPases have been proposed to act as molecular timers for productive movement through the splicing pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Koodathingal and Staley, 2013</xref>). The yeast studies used mutant pre-mRNA substrates because their signals are always very close to the optimal consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Irimia and Roy, 2008</xref>). Whether there are analogous or additional fidelity mechanisms that operate in animal cells is unknown.</p><p id="P6">The ability to perform forward genetic screens in haploid <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was critical for the studies on spliceosome fidelity outlined above as well as numerous other foundational studies of splicing. To adapt these methods to human cells, we describe here a strategy to mutagenize the spliceosome in fully haploid human cells by developing and deploying a CRISPR-Cas9 base editor sgRNA library that targets the entire human spliceosome. After mutagenesis, we interrogated the spliceosome using the potent inhibitor pladienolide B (PB), which targets U2 snRNP by binding to a pocket between the SF3B1 and PHF5A subunits of the SF3b complex, preventing stabilization of the U2-branchpoint RNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cretu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cretu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gamboa Lopez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Teng et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Validation and genomic sequencing revealed resistance mutations in SF3B1 and PHF5A in residues adjacent to the compound binding pocket. We mapped hypersensitive mutants to U2 snRNP components, but also to factors that act as late as the second chemical step, after SF3b has dissociated. Strikingly, we obtained resistance mutants in SUGP1, a spliceosomal G-patch protein of unknown function that lacks orthologs in yeast and is also a newly proposed tumor suppressor whose loss underpins the splicing changes induced by cancer-associated SF3B1 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alsafadi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Our resistance mutations in SUGP1 map in or adjacent to its G-patch motif and modulate splicing changes triggered by PB. We describe biochemical experiments that reveal the spliceosomal disassembly ATPase DHX15/hPrp43 to be the biologically relevant direct target of the SUGP1 G-patch domain. We propose a unified model in which SUGP1/DHX15-mediated disassembly of kinetically-slowed early splicing complexes explains compound resistance as well as oncogenic aberrant splicing events resulting from SF3B1 and SUGP1 mutations. More broadly, our results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the programmed generation of informative viable haploid alleles targeting a complex essential gene expression machine in human cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Large-scale mutagenesis of the human spliceosome</title><p id="P7">A major impediment to the study of the human spliceosome <italic>in vivo</italic> has been the inability to program point mutations in endogenous genes on a large scale. CRISPR-Cas9 technology now provides such opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Anzalone et al., 2020</xref>). Due to its scalability and ability to introduce point mutations, we chose CRISPR-Cas9 base editing for a forward genetic screen of the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S1B</xref>). We first generated a monoclonal stable cell line expressing FNLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Zafra et al., 2018a</xref>), a cytosine base editor, in an eHAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Essletzbichler et al., 2014</xref>) haploid cell background (hereafter: eHAP FNLS). During clonal cell line generation, we maintained eHAP FNLS cells as haploid so that we could subsequently assign genotype-phenotype relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). We assessed editing efficiency on a set of standard targets used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Zafra et al., 2018b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S1C,D</xref>). eHAP FNLS cells demonstrated efficient editing (up to &gt;90%) at expected positions within the editing window, which spans positions 3-8 [with position 21-23 being the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)], and induced transversions (C &gt; R editing) at high frequencies (&gt;25%) in some cases. Transversion editing has been described previously; its extent is cell line-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sánchez-Rivera et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We designed a single guide RNA (sgRNA) library targeting a hand-curated list of 153 human spliceosomal proteins which engage at various steps of the splicing cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), and are reproducibly detected through mass spectrometry (MS), interaction studies, and/or visualized in structural biology studies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sales-Lee et al., 2021</xref>). Given that base editing outcomes are not fully predictable, to maximize mutagenesis we targeted every available NGG PAM sequence across all annotated exons plus 20 bp flanking intronic sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Our library includes 42,618 sgRNAs targeting 42,650 sites, including 8,426 sgRNAs that target genomic sites but are predicted to be non-editing with FNLS, and an additional 1,000 guides that do not target genomic sites (non-targeting sgRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Doench et al., 2016</xref>). The library can in principle mutagenize up to 30% of spliceosomal protein coding sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S1E</xref>) and edits are predicted to result in in missense mutations in &gt;50% of cases with an additional 20% of edits predicted to impact protein sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S1F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref> for details on mutation outcome prediction).</p><p id="P9">We cloned this library into lentiviral vectors that express the sgRNA and associate each to a unique barcode and produced virus for transduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Boettcher et al., 2019</xref>). We transduced the library into eHAP FNLS cells, incubated them for 6 days to allow for editing and selection of transduced cells, and then split the selected pool into treatment arms (control/DMSO vs. 2 nM PB, which approximates its EC<sub>50</sub>). We cultured cells for two weeks while maintaining a representation of 500 cells per sgRNA. On days 0, 8 and 14 we isolated genomic DNA and amplified and sequenced the sgRNA inserts; we also did this for the input plasmid library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Using the sgRNA-linked barcode, we randomly assigned sgRNAs to two sample populations and depletion vs. enrichment of sgRNAs was analysed for both time and treatment using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Love et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We then compared the abundances of guide sequences in the population that differed in their predicted consequences versus the plasmid input control 14 days after transduction. Given that most spliceosomal proteins are essential for cell survival, we anticipated that a subset of induced mutations would be lethal or result in reduced viability, and that their sgRNAs would therefore be depleted over time. As expected, sgRNAs predicted to promote mutations with more severe consequences such as splice site mutations or creation of stop codons displayed the strongest depletion as a class, consistent with efficient and precise editing at many of those sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S1G</xref>). Conversely, guides predicted to be non-editing or to produce silent mutations were generally not depleted</p><p id="P11">By comparing guide sequence abundances for day 14 for 2 nM PB versus the matched DMSO control, we observed that several guides were enriched or depleted upon compound treatment of the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). For validation, we selected the sgRNAs showing statistically significant enrichment or depletion (LFC &gt; |2|, padj &lt; 0.05) between the 2 nM PB sample and its matched control sample on day 14. To this list we added a subset of sgRNAs with high average enrichment/depletion but did not pass statistical significance (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref> for details). To enrich for PB-specific phenotypes, we required that those guides depleted after PB treatment did not show depletion between t0 and t14 in untreated cells. This procedure yielded 19 candidate-enriched sgRNAs and 26 candidate-depleted sgRNAs. These sgRNAs and three non-targeting sgRNAs were then subjected to an arrayed dual-color competition assay in which cells transduced with virus encoding a non-targeting sgRNA or transduced with a candidate-depleted or -enriched sgRNA were marked with distinct fluorescent proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The assay confirmed the response to PB treatment for 23/26 of the candidate-depleted sgRNAs and 11/19 of the candidate-enriched sgRNAs. Except for a sgRNA targeting <italic>SF3B1</italic> and another targeting <italic>PRPF6,</italic> only sgRNAs found to be statistically significantly enriched validated in the confirmation assay, supporting the utility of the statistical approach used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Pladienolide B hypersensitive mutations identify functional spliceosomal residues</title><p id="P12">Given the notable number of sgRNAs depleted upon compound treatment, we determined the genomic consequences of base editing. We transduced eHAP FNLS with lentivirus carrying individual sgRNAs, grew cells for six days, isolated genomic DNA, amplified the edited locus and subjected the amplicons to deep sequencing. This approach revealed the consequences of base editing at the amino acid level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Guides presumably must edit efficiently to produce a depletion phenotype. Amplicon sequence confirmed this expectation: all sgRNAs displayed high/substantial rates of editing (median = 57.7% for C &gt; T within positions 3 to 8, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2B</xref>) leading to amino acid changes that become depleted in the presence of PB (with a median of 82% of the sequences carrying an amino acid change, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). Again, we observed not only C &gt; T editing but also C &gt; R editing, with predicted mutations matching for 19/23 sgRNAs. Thirteen distinct guides programmed mutations in early-acting spliceosomal factors, including SF1, SF3, and DDX46/hPrp5 as well as the U2AF-associated DEAD box protein DDX5/UAP56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Unexpectedly, we also identified a mutation in the tri-snRNP-specific protein USP39/hSad1 and five mutations in the second-step factor CDC40/hPrp17, which is first found in the B<sup>act</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Haselbach et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, we found PB-sensitive mutations in factors that join catalytically active complexes and act at the second chemical step of splicing (DHX35/hPrp16 and CACTIN), a point in the spliceosome cycle after which SF3b has been dissociated. As a first step in understanding how these changes impact the spliceosome, below we briefly place some of these mutations into the context of existing spliceosome structures, focusing on the SF3 complex.</p><p id="P14">PB sterically blocks binding of the U2-intron branchpoint duplex to its pocket in SF3b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cretu et al., 2021</xref>), which is necessary for spliceosome assembly to proceed beyond the A complex. Six of our PB-sensitive mutants occur in the SF3 complex, which consists of the SF3a and SF3b subcomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brosi et al., 1993</xref>). Recent work has shown that the HEAT-repeat region of SF3B1, a SF3b component, undergoes a conformational transition upon U2 snRNP binding to the branchpoint, moving from an open conformation to a closed state, thereby stabilizing the U2-branchpoint duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Tholen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>). We mapped an SF3B3 E159K mutant to an interface between SF3B3, SF3B1 and PHF5A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), distal to where PB or the branchpoint engages SF3b. The mutation lies in a region of SF3b that changes conformation upon binding to the branch helix (formed between U2 and the branchpoint sequence) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), likely impacting SF3B1 closing which would favor PB binding and, presumably, cell growth inhibition. Finally, we mapped PB-sensitive substitutions in residues in several factors not part of SF3b onto available structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Haselbach et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Nameki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and found that they often occur at protein-protein interfaces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S3D-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>), providing a resource for structure-functional studies.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Viable SF3b mutations produce resistance to pladienolide B</title><p id="P15">SF3B1 and PHF5A mutations have been identified that render cells resistant to PB treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cretu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Teng et al., 2017a</xref>), but they only occur in a dominant (heterozygous) fashion, suggesting recessive lethality. Nonetheless, in our haploid screen, we identified eleven significantly enriched sgRNAs that target these factors, five against <italic>PHF5A</italic> and one against <italic>SF3B1,</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). To identify the underlying alleles, we transduced eHAP FNLS cells with individual sgRNAs and collected cells at t0, t8 and t15 in the presence and absence of 2 nM PB treatment. Following genomic DNA isolation and amplicon deep sequencing, we determined mutation prevalence across time and treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Note that for efficient guides, resistance-promoting mutations may be highly prevalent at t0 and therefore may not enrich in abundance under compound treatment (see e.g., sgPHF5A_7, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S3A</xref>).</p><p id="P16">sgSF3B1_166 was the only sgRNA conferring PB resistance through mutation of SF3B1. For this guide, no mutant alleles were detected by sequencing in the transduced cell population in the absence of PB treatment (possibly due to poor editing efficiency), but an allele encoding a T1080I change enriched rapidly upon PB addition to cells carrying this sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, all five guides targeting <italic>PHF5A</italic> gave rise to substantial cell populations carrying different mutations at t0. Both sgPHF5A_7 and sgPHF5A_21 are predicted to result in cysteine to tyrosine mutations for side chains involved in the coordination of a Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion. However, in both instances deep sequencing revealed that the predicted Cys &gt; Tyr mutation was not detected; rather, we observed mutations impacting the preceding residue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S3A,B</xref>). Both the resulting PHF5A K29N and E74D mutation arise through transversion (C &gt; R mutation). sgPHF5A_47 is predicted to result in mutation and loss of the 3′ splice site of exon 3. This mutation did occur at high frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2C</xref>) and likely resulted in a growth disadvantage (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S2A</xref>, reduced fitness of sgPHF5A_47 transduced cells in absence of PB). Instead, after transduction with this guide, the more frequent mutation at t0 encodes a D27N change which further accumulates in the population under compound selection. The remaining two resistance-promoting sgRNAs in PHF5A are predicted to be non-editing. sgRNA_PHF5A_6 targets a cytosine at position 7 in a G<sub>6</sub>C<sub>7</sub> dinucleotide context, which is unfavourable to editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kluesner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sánchez-Rivera et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, this sgRNA resulted only in 12% of amplified molecules harboring the anticipated D47N mutation. Surprisingly, under PB selection, the more frequent mutation encodes a two amino acid insertion (TL) between C40 and T41 producing a tandem TL dipeptide in the protein sequence (hence we name the allele PHF5A-2xTL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Because it is mutated in numerous diseases and the target of myriad splicing regulators, it is a key compound development target. Numerous questions exist regarding the coupling of transcription and chromatin to splicing, the underpinnings of splicing fidelity, and the functional roles of many if not most human spliceosomal proteins. However, the genetic analysis of the human spliceosome has not been pursued, even though it harbors ∼60 proteins not found in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and is likely to operate in ways that cannot be anticipated from prior studies of yeast. Particularly useful would be so-called “informative alleles” that dissect essential protein function. While CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens are not designed to generate such information, CRISPR base editing and related methods in principle provide approaches generating programmed point mutations. We adapted pooled CRISPR-Cas9 base editing to the human spliceosome to mutagenize 153 protein subunits in a haploid cell context. We interrogated the mutants with PB, a prototype for a class of anti-cancer compounds that targets the SF3b complex. Our studies provide insights into structure-function relationships by identifying viable alleles of numerous spliceosomal proteins that program hypersensitivity or resistance to SF3b inhibition. We demonstrate the utility of such alleles through studies of the SUGP1 tumor suppressor. Below we discuss the evidence for these conclusions and propose a new human-specific discard/fidelity step mediated by the activation of the spliceosomal disassemblase DHX15/hPrp43 by SUGP1 during early stages of spliceosome assembly and its implications for human disease.</p><sec id="S10"><title>PB hypersensitive mutations identify functional sites in the human spliceosome that vary in the human population</title><p id="P33">We obtained PB-hypersensitive mutants in a small subset of the 153 proteins mutagenized. Gratifyingly, most lie in factors that act at or near the step inhibited by PB, including in SF1 and components of U2 snRNP. This specificity highlights the utility of single-residue chemical-genetic interactions to identify functional sites related to a particular phase of an essential process. As described in the results above, many mutations we identified could be placed on existing structures, enabling the generation of structure-function relationships. However, most of the residues altered in our mutants are not visualized in existing structures. In both cases, detailed studies <italic>in vitro</italic> and/or <italic>in vivo</italic> will be required to understand the impact of these functional sites on splicing of the numerous endogenous introns that interrupt human genes.

We speculate that triggering the use of different branchpoints via PB results in a dependency on weaker 3' splice sites, whose docking into the catalytic core of the spliceosome requires stabilization by step 2 factors, a model consistent with the cryoEM structure of the human post-catalytic P complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Fica et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Because the residues impacted by the PB-sensitive mutations are (by definition) functional, one anticipates that they would not vary in the human population, given the essential function of the spliceosome.

The stronger of the two alleles produced by these guides, G603N, lies in a conserved domain of G-patch proteins called the “brace loop” which is important for G-patch proteins to activate their cognate DEAH-box helicase. The other change, E554K, lies just upstream in a region predicted by AlphaFold2 to be helical. By performing proximity labelling, comparing wild-type versus mutant proteins, we identified a single DEAH-box protein, DHX15/hPrp43 as being both labelled by SUGP1-miniTurboID fusions and sensitive to a G-patch mutation obtained in our screen. DHX15 has often been found in proteomic studies of early spliceosomes, but its function at this stage remained relatively opaque. However, a recent study from Jurica and colleagues has shown that depletion of DHX15 from HeLa cell extracts results in an increase rather than a decrease in A complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Maul-Newby et al., 2022</xref>).

In this model, PB resistance results from mutation in the SUGP1 G-patch domain because this increases A complex formation or residence time by inhibiting disassembly, thereby counteracting the inhibitory activity of PB in reducing stable A complex formation.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Relationship to oncogenic mutations in SUGP1 and SF3B1</title><p id="P37">Manley and colleagues have proposed that cancer SF3B1 mutations act by limiting association of SUGP1 with the spliceosome.

However, our discard model proposes a different mechanism underpinning the effects of SUGP1 cancer mutations, namely a defect in an early rejection step mediated by spliceosome disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Such a model would explain the activation of cryptic branchpoints as a defect in proofreading enabling the production of oncogenic mRNAs via the activation of cryptic branchpoint/3' splice site combinations as has been observed in SF3B1 and SUGP1 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).

Reads were then deduplicated using the UMIs from the Lexogen CORALL workflow to prevent removal of natural duplicates. On average, 85% of the reads could be mapped and quality assessment using the RSeQC package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) showed neither a bias in read distribution nor gene body coverage. Differential expression of genes was assessed using RSubreads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Liao et al., 2019</xref>) for counting and DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Love et al., 2014</xref>). To analyze splicing at the exon level only junctions with more than 10 junction reads were considered. We used rMATS-turbo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Shen et al., 2014a</xref>) (hereafter, rMATS) for quantification. For all analysis performed with rMATS only splicing junctions with FDR &lt; 0.01 were considered.

All generated peak lists were searched against the human subset of the SwissProt database (SwissProt.2019.07.31), using Protein Prospector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Clauser et al., 1999</xref>) with the following parameters: Enzyme specificity was set as Trypsin, and up to 2 missed cleavages per peptide were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues, and TMTPro16plex labelling of lysine residues and N-terminus of the protein were allowed as fixed modifications. N-acetylation of the N-terminus of the protein, loss of protein N-terminal methionine, pyroglutamate formation from of peptide N-terminal glutamines, and oxidation of methionine were allowed as variable modifications. Mass tolerance was 10 ppm in MS and 30 ppm in MS/MS. The false positive rate was estimated by searching the data using a concatenated database which contains the original SwissProt database, as well as a version of each original entry where the sequence has been randomized. A 1% FDR was permitted at the protein and peptide level. For quantitation only unique peptides were considered; peptides common to several proteins were not used for quantitative analysis. Relative quantization of peptide abundance was performed via calculation of the intensity of reporter ions corresponding to the different TMT labels, present in MS/MS spectra. Intensities were determined by Protein Prospector. Summed intensity per sample on each TMT channel for all identified carboxylases were used to normalize individual intensity values. Relative abundances were calculated as ratios vs the average intensity levels in the 4 channels corresponding to control samples. For total protein relative levels, peptide ratios were aggregated to the protein levels using median values of the log2 ratios.</p></sec><sec id="S50"><title>Software for data visualization and statistical analyses</title><p id="P88">For visualisation of cryo-EM and crystal structures we used PyMOL (v2.3.5), for visual presentation we used R ggplot2 (v3.3.6) with MetBrewer (v0.2.0.) and ggVennDiagram (v1.2.0) or pheatmap (v1.0.12), and GraphPad Prism (v8), and the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) (v2.12.2).
