Although cytotoxic levels of DSBs occur mainly due to external factors, such as ionizing irradiation and UV radiation, DSBs can occur naturally under physiological conditions through cell’s natural processes such as transcription and replication. However, how physiological DSBs are generated during transcription is still poorly understood. Here, we mapped DSBs using in-suspension break labeling <italic>in situ</italic> and sequencing (sBLISS) and re-analysis of ChIP-seq and DRIP-seq data, along with immunofluorescence staining for DNA damage markers in MCF-7 cells. Mapping of DSBs revealed their occurrence at highly expressed genes that are enriched with Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1), the main enzyme responsible for resolving positive and negative supercoiling, and with R-loops. Depleting R-loops and TOP1 decreased DSBs specifically at highly expressed and TOP1/R-loops-enriched genes implying that TOP1 and R-loops are the main causes of transcriptional DSBs. These findings propose a model in which DSBs in highly expressed genes, mainly oncogenes, are caused by resolving of R-loops and the catalytic activity of TOP1. Our data also reveal that these genes, despite being highly fragile, are covered by γ-H2AX suggesting efficient repair signaling. Our findings underscore the critical roles of TOP1 and R-loops in regulating DSBs in hypertranscribed oncogenes implicated in carcinogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>R-loops</kwd><kwd>TOP1</kwd><kwd>γH2AX</kwd><kwd>DSBs</kwd><kwd>hypertranscription</kwd><kwd>oncogenes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Double-stranded breaks (DSBs) are considered to be the most deleterious type of DNA damage, and thus must be repaired to preserve genome integrity. Although cytotoxic levels of DSBs occur mainly by external factors such as ionizing radiation and UV radiation, DSBs can occur naturally under physiological conditions through the cell’s natural processes such as transcription and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Wilhelm, Said and Naim, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Transcription can cause DSBs in replicating cells due to collision with the replication machinery, especially when transcription and replication have opposite directions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mirkin and Mirkin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Helmrich, Ballarino and Tora, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hamperl <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). This collision (also called transcription-replication conflict) happens when the replication machinery, mainly DNA polymerases, and the transcriptional machinery, mainly RNA polymerases, encounter each other in close proximity within the gene. Since cancer cells are highly active exhibiting hypertranscription and high replication levels, they are expected to exhibit a high occurrence of such conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Helmrich, Ballarino and Tora, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hamperl <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). This collision between transcription and replication was found to occur mainly at transcription termination site (TTS), and to be prevented by the activity of topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Promonet <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Elevated transcription was found to strongly correlate with DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Lensing <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). However, how transcription by itself causes DSBs is still under investigation.</p><p id="P4">During transcription elongation, the DNA unwinds around the transcribing RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Choder and Aloni, 1988</xref>), which increases the chance of newly transcribed RNA to anneal to its template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>), forming a three-stranded nucleotide structure composed of a DNA:RNA hybrid and a dislocated single-stranded DNA, known as an R-loop. Very short R-loops (&lt;10 bp) are important for various cellular processes and are formed during transcription and removed afterward by the enzyme RNase H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cerritelli and Crouch, 2009</xref>) and RNA-DNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aguilera and Gómez-González, 2017</xref>). Longer R-loops on the other hand, are known to be harmful to genome integrity due to generating DSBs. The specific mechanism by which R-loops generate DSBs is still poorly understood. A proposed mechanism is that they expose the displaced ssDNA to endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sollier and Cimprich, 2015</xref>), making it more susceptible to single-stranded breaks (SSBs). Another observation is that R-loop structures can be recognized by specific endonucleases such as XPG, XPF, and FEN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cristini <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), which cleave the ssDNA hybridized to the RNA in the R-loop leaving a SSB. However, how these SSBs turn into DSBs is unknown.</p><p id="P5">Transcription elongation causes negative and positive supercoiling behind and ahead of the transcribing RNA PolII, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Liu and Wang, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Ma and Wang, 2016</xref>). This supercoiling has to be resolved to preserve efficient transcription, especially at highly transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Ma and Wang, 2016</xref>). TOP1 is the main enzyme responsible for resolving positive and negative supercoiling; TOP1 cuts the DNA single-strandedly through its catalytic domain allowing the DNA to relax, followed by re-ligation of the cut strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Pommier <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">2022</xref>). Optimally, TOP1 forms a transient Topoisomerase cleavage complex (TOP1cc) which cuts the DNA, and this transient complex is rapidly reversed and TOP1 is released, eventually leading to no persistent DNA damage. However, if TOP1 is trapped at its catalytic state, either by physiological or pathological causes, the ssDNA would remain cut, and TOP1cc that is bound to the DNA should be removed through the Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) excision pathway for the break to be repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cristini <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Pommier <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P6">DSBs can be detected using various methods, including antibodies against markers of DNA damage like anti-γ-H2AX which is helpful to detect changes in DNA damage with different treatments and conditions, however, it fails to locate the site of these breaks in the genome. Using those antibodies for chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assays (ChIP-seq) can detect the location of those breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">DeCaprio and Kohl, 2020</xref>), but because of the nature of γ-H2AX distribution, which can be as wide as several kilo-basepairs around the break, it is less efficient to detect the site of the break with high resolution. For these reasons, we used the newly established technique, break labeling <italic>in situ</italic> and sequencing (sBLISS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bouwman <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), which detects DSBs in a single nucleotide resolution. sBLISS can detect the levels of DSBs across the genome, with high discrimination between DSBs occurring at proximal genomic locations and has also been confirmed to detect physiological DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hazan <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), which makes it a very powerful technique for studying transcriptional DSBs.</p><p id="P7">Here we used multiple techniques, including sBLISS, ChIP-seq, and DRIP-seq data to uncover a mechanism in which transcription, R-loops, and TOP1 altogether facilitate physiological DSBs formation at active regions and especially at highly transcribed genes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Physiological breaks are enriched at highly transcribed genes</title><p id="P8">In our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hazan <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), we found physiological DSBs to be highly enriched at active regions such as promoters, insulators, and super-enhancers using the BLISS method. To further uncover the mechanism regulating physiological DSBs, we mapped DSBs distribution across the genome (breakome) using the newly developed sBLISS method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bouwman <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) in untreated MCF-7 breast cancer luminal cells. Comparing the observed breaks to those that are expected at different chromatin states, we found that the observed:expected ratio is higher at active promoters, strong enhancers, transcription elongation, and transcription transition chromatin states, as opposed to repressed regions, where the ratio was significantly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The increased break enrichment relative to expected at active but not at repressed regions further confirms the involvement of transcription in the formation of DSBs in these regions. To further test this, relative gene expression was measured using the RNA sequencing technique CEL-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hashimshony <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), and relative gene expression for each gene was correlated with its break density. Interestingly, relative gene expression was found to be positively correlated with break density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A, B and D-K</xref>), indicating that higher expressed genes tend to have higher break density. Moreover, gene ontology analysis of the top 400 broken genes in MCF-7 showed enrichment in biological processes such as translation, gland morphogenesis, and response to estradiol, which are biological processes that are expected to be highly active in breast epithelial tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that active genes tend to exhibit high break densities.</p><p id="P9">To investigate these transcriptional DSBs, the top 1000 expressed and the lower 1000 expressed genes were selected from our CEL-seq, and for each gene, the ratio of observed to expected breaks was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). As predicted, highly expressed genes displayed a higher ratio (∼7 folds) compared to low expressed genes (&lt;1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). When examining break density distribution across the gene body of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>), we observed an elevated break density at the gene body of the highly transcribed genes compared to low transcribed genes, with two distinct peaks at transcription start site (TSS) and transcription termination site (TTS).</p><p id="P10">These data clearly suggest that physiological DSBs are more enriched at active regions, specifically at highly transcribed genes, and point towards transcription as a direct or indirect cause of physiological DSBs.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Transcriptional DSBs are associated with TOP1</title><p id="P11">Previously, TOP1 was found to overlap regulatory elements such as insulators, promoters, and enhancers, especially at those which exhibited high break density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baranello <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hazan <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). To directly test the involvement of TOP1 in transcriptional DSBs formation, we correlated TOP1 levels and expression levels. Interestingly, the expression of moderately and highly expressed genes revealed a positive correlation with TOP1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, we found high enrichment of breaks at TOP1 peaks across the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, we compared the ratio of the observed breaks to the expected breaks between high and low TOP1 enriched genes and found a greater ratio in high TOP1 genes (∼9 folds) compared to low TOP1 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). To further confirm the significance of TOP1, we knocked down TOP1, using siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>), and examined the consequences on DNA breaks using immunofluorescence staining. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E and F</xref>, a significant decrease in γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci per nucleus were observed in TOP1-depleted MCF7 cells compared to scramble siRNA control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate an important role of TOP1 in the formation of transcriptional DSBs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Transcriptional DSBs are associated with R-loops</title><p id="P12">R-loops are known for their harmful effect on genome integrity, and their formation is known to be facilitated by the transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aguilera and García-Muse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>). Given the connection between TOP1 and R-loops, which was further validated by correlating TOP1 levels with R-loops levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>), we next set to test the involvement of R-loops in the formation of transcriptional DSBs.</p><p id="P13">Correlating R-loops levels, using published DRIP-seq data done on untreated MCF-7 cells, and expression revealed a positive correlation in the top 50% expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>). When mapping break enrichment at R-loops peaks, we observed elevated break enrichment at these peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, comparing observed to expected breaks ratio between high and low R-loops genes revealed that genes enriched with R-loops have a higher ratio (∼9 folds) compared to those deprived of R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To test the effect of R-loops depletion on global DSBs, the enzyme RNase H1 which degrades the RNA moiety of R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>) was overexpressed in MCF-7 cells, and immunofluorescence staining was performed for 53BP1 and γ-H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E, F</xref>). Interestingly, cells overexpressing RNase H1 had fewer γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci per nucleus compared to control cells, indicating the involvement of R-loops in the formation of physiological DSBs.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>TOP1 knockdown and RNase H1 overexpression decrease break enrichment specifically at the gene body of highly transcribed genes</title><p id="P15">To investigate the contribution of TOP1 and R-loops in transcriptional DSBs formation, TOP1 was depleted in MCF-7 cells overexpressing RNase H1 or control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure 3A, B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">C</xref>), and changes in DSBs were mapped by sBLISS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). We first examined break enrichment at different chromatin states and found that regions associated with transcription elongation and transcription transition chromatin states, but not active promoters, had fewer breaks in the treated samples compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). To investigate the effect of RNase H1 overexpression and TOP1 knockdown on highly active regions, we looked specifically at the highest expressed genes selecting the top 1000 expressed genes from CEL-seq data that was done on those treated MCF7 cells. Remarkably, we found that highly transcribed genes exhibit a decrease in DSBs enrichment when TOP1 is depleted and/or RNase H1 is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, no significant effect was detected in low expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, genes enriched with R-loops displayed a significant decrease in break enrichment after RNase H1 overexpression and/or TOP1 knockdown, while no significant change was detected in genes deprived of R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Similarly, genes enriched with TOP1 exhibited a significant decrease in break density as compared to those which are deprived of TOP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). We next examined how the distribution of breaks changed across the gene body upon TOP1 depletion and/or RNase H1 overexpression and found that breaks density decreases in gene body and TTS, but not at TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3E</xref>). These findings are consistent with the observation that TOP1 is catalytically active at gene bodies but not at TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baranello <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Interestingly, both manipulations (RNase H1 OE and TOP1 KD) together did not give a complementary effect compared to each treatment separately. To further uncover this, we selected active genes that exhibited the most decrease in break density with each treatment separately (calculated by the average of the two separate treatments) and examined break density of the three groups. Interestingly, although genes were selected based on the separate manipulations (SR or TE), break density was lowest with the combined manipulations (TR) at these genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3 F</xref>). Similar results were obtained when we examined breaks at overlapping genes between high R-loops/TOP1 and active genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3 H, J</xref>), indicating that both TOP1 and R-loops coordinate the induction of DSBs at these active genes.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Fragility of estradiol responsive genes is mediated by R-loops and TOP1</title><p id="P17">To test if an increase in transcription would increase global DNA damage, transcription in MCF-7 cells was induced by treatment with estradiol (E2) followed by immunofluorescence staining for γ-H2AX and 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). As expected, we found that cells displayed more 53BP1 and γ-H2AX foci per nucleus when treated with E2 (increased transcription), and this increase is suppressed with RNase H1 overexpression or TOP1 knockdown, indicating that the increase in DNA damage upon E2 treatment is mediated by R-loops and TOP1. To further specify these results, we utilized sBLISS to map DSBs in control cells (NE/SN), cells treated with estradiol (EE/SE2), and cells overexpressing RNase H1 or knocked down for TOP1 and treated with estradiol (ER/TE2). We found that estrogen responsive genes, exhibiting significant increased expression upon E2 treatment (extracted from GSE27463) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hah <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), displayed increased break density as opposed to down-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4 A-D</xref>). Importantly, the majority of these genes had decreased break density upon depletion R-loops or TOP1 (ER/TE2) as compared to estradiol only, indicating that the increase in transcriptional DSBs upon E2 treatment is mediated by R-loops and TOP1.</p><p id="P18">Furthermore, selecting estrogen responsive genes which exhibited increased break density following estradiol induction showed strongly that the fragility of these genes was highly attenuated by the depletion of R-loops or TOP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 E, F</xref>), further confirming the involvement of TOP1 and R-loops in transcriptional DSBs in general, and specifically estrogen associated DSBs. Moreover, disease related pathway analysis for these estrogen responsive genes using DisGenNET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Piñero <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) revealed enrichment in tumor progression, neoplasm metastasis, breast carcinoma, and malignant neoplasm of breast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4 E</xref>) implying that estrogen treatment up-regulates breast cancer-associated genes and this upregulation causes DSBs at those genes through R-loops and TOP1. Altogether, these data imply that an increase in transcription results in an increase in DSBs, and this transcriptional DSBs is associated with R-loops and TOP1.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>DSBs at highly transcribed genes might limit transcription</title><p id="P19">To make sure the decrease in breaks enrichment at highly expressed genes was not due to decreased transcriptional levels caused by the treatment itself, we examined the change in normalized expression counts of the top 1000 expressed genes with the different treatments using CEL-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5 A, B</xref>). Surprisingly, cells overexpressing RNase H1 (SR) or depleted for TOP1 (TE), but not with both treatments (TR), had more genes with increased normalized expression counts indicating increased expression of the top 1000 expressed genes with treatments (62.6%, 67.7%, and 47.3% for each treatment, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5C-E</xref>) Furthermore, comparing gene sets sorted by expression in the control sample (same group of genes in all conditions), we found that the highest expressed group (group 1) has the largest percentage of genes with increased transcription upon treatments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5 F</xref>). Additionally, comparing the normalized expression counts of these gene sets, we observed the highest expressed group to have the major increase in normalized expression counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5 G</xref>). However, when we examined the change of expression specifically at genes that exhibited the most decrease in break density the pattern seemed to be variable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3 G, I</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">K</xref>), indicating that the effect of TOP1 depletion and/or RNase H1 OE -and therefore decreased breaks- on expression to be different at different genes. These findings suggest that transcriptional DSBs, facilitated by TOP1 and R-loops, might be hampering transcription at highly expressed genes.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>TOP1 and R-loops are the main causes of DSBs at highly transcribed genes</title><p id="P20">To further investigate the contribution of TOP1 and R-loops in the formation of DSBs of highly expressed genes at physiological conditions, we compared different gene sets with similar expression levels in untreated MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, TOP1 and R-loops density in break-prone genes is greater than in break-deprived genes although both groups exhibited similar expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). These results indicate that TOP1/R-loops density dictates the level of DSBs formation at actively transcribed genes. Moreover, break density in highly expressed genes that are deprived of R-loops/TOP1 is lower as compared to similarly expressed genes with high R-loops/TOP1 genes, and have slightly lower breaks as compared to low expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). These data clearly suggest that TOP1 and R-loops are contributing the major source of DSBs at highly expressed genes.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Transcriptional DSBs can cause mutations at cancer genes</title><p id="P21">Endogenous DSBs are a source of genomic instability and mutations that contributes to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Tubbs and Nussenzweig, 2017</xref>).

Interestingly, from the 97 genes that have breakome data, 77 genes (79%) exhibited a decrease in break density with TOP1 knockdown and/or RNase H overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>), with 62 genes (80%) having a decrease in both treatments. Sorting these genes according to their break enrichment shows that most of these genes exhibited a decrease in break density with RNase H1 overexpression and/or TOP1 knockdown, especially at those genes with the highest break density in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Moreover, these genes have a significant decrease in the total relative breaks with each treatment but not both treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>).

We found that many MCF7-dependent oncogenes like <italic>ESR1, GATA3, NRAS, CCND1, ACTB, MYC, HES1, EGR1</italic> and <italic>TFF1</italic> were very enriched with DSBs (top 5% broken genes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), which are significantly decreased after TOP1 KD and/or RNase H1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6A, B</xref>) with no significant change in normalized expression counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6 C</xref>). Notably, these genes were also very enriched with TOP1 (mostly top 1% of genes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 2</xref>). Given the dependency of MCF-7 cells on these genes for growth and survival, and the fact that most of these genes are highly expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), we hypothesized that these genes must indeed be actively repaired. To test this hypothesis, we looked at γ-H2AX enrichment at these oncogenes. Interestingly, we found that these MCF7-dependent oncogenes were indeed marked by high levels of γ-H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8E</xref>). A zoom-out view demonstrates the specificity of γ-H2AX enrichment around these genes as well as other well-characterized oncogenes like <italic>XBP1, FOS</italic> and <italic>miR21</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6 D</xref>).</p><p id="P24">To test whether the decreased breaks observed at these oncogenes are also accompanied by a decrease in γ-H2AX levels, we performed ChIP-qPCR for selected genes that are most enriched with γ-H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8F</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>miR21, EGR1</italic>, and <italic>MYC all showed significant decrease in</italic> γ-H2AX enrichment upon RNase H OE and TOP1 KD, with the highest decrease with combined manipulations (TR), consistent with our results using sBLISS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3 F, H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">I</xref>). These results further indicate that transcriptional DSBs are caused by TOP1 and R-loops, and that their depletion decrease DSBs as detected by direct labeling with sBLISS, and ChIP-qPCR of the DNA damage marker γ-H2AX.</p><p id="P25">Moreover, gene ontology analysis of 400 genes with the highest score for γ-H2AX showed that most of these genes are involved in cellular functions like DNA repair, cell-cycle control, gene expression, translation, and response to stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6E</xref>) and cancer-associated signaling pathways including TP53, FOXO, HGFR, NFAT, IGF1, HIF1α, INFγ, EGFR, and RB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6 F</xref>). These results further confirm that highly transcribed genes including oncogenes are covered by γ-H2AX marks, to facilitate efficient repair of transcriptional DSBs, and promote hypertranscription of oncogenes.</p><p id="P26">To determine how these transcriptional DSBs are being repaired, we analyzed the breakome of MCF-7 cells depleted for RAD51 (HR) or XRCC4 (NHEJ), two major proteins involved in DSB repair pathways. We found that while RAD51 depletion slightly increased break density at both TSS and gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8 G, H</xref>), XRCC4 depletion remarkably increased break density only at gene bodies of highly expressed genes but not at the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8 I, J</xref>), consistent with previously published data showing the repair signaling of DSBs produced by transcription-blocking TOP1 lesions to be triggered by DNA-PK which recruits NHEJ factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cristini <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). These results imply that transcriptional DSBs caused by TOP1 and R-loops at gene bodies might be repaired by the NHEJ pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">Our data show that highly transcribed genes overlap both TOP1 and R-loops, and that R-loops and TOP1 genomic levels can predict the damage at these regions. Moreover, we showed that TOP1 knockdown or RNase H1 overexpression significantly decreases transcriptional DSBs at highly expressed genes, including oncogenes. These findings propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8 K</xref>) in which DSBs in oncogenes are mainly caused by the accumulation of R-loops and the catalytic activity of TOP1. Our data also reveal that these oncogenes, despite being highly broken (fragile), are also highly expressed, and this high expression is mediated by efficient repair signaling as indicated by γ-H2AX accumulation and involvement of XRCC4.</p><sec id="S13"><title>Transcriptional DSBs at TSS are different from gene body</title><p id="P28">Our data propose a model in which transcriptional DSBs at TSS are produced and processed differently from transcriptional DSBs at gene body. TOP1 and R-loops depletion reduced DSBs only at gene bodies of the highly expressed genes, and not at TSS, consistent with the finding that DSBs at TSS are produced by high-mobility group AT-hook 2 protein (HMGA2) which is required for transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dobersch <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). This is also consistent with our previous observation that the pattern of DSBs is behaving differently at regulatory element including promoters, strong enhancers and insulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hazan <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Moreover, TOP1 and R-loop depletion slightly increased break density at promoters and enhancers, implicating that they might serve another function at these regions.</p><p id="P29">Our data also indicate that not only the origin of DSBs at promoters are different from gene body but also how these DSBs are processed, consisting with a recent report showing that promoters are prone to oxidative damage and are protected by NuMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Ray <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). These observations are proposing a model inwhich DNA damage and repair are subjected to different ‘rules’ at different regions across the gene.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>The coordination between TOP1 and R-loops</title><p id="P30">The mechanism by which TOP1 and R-loops cause DSBs has been previously explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cristini <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). A mechanism was proposed in which TOP1 and R-loops cause DSBs through the induction of two adjacent SSBs, one produced by TOP1cc processing, and the other by the activity of endonucleases which recognizes R-loops structures. In our data, although the general view of highly expressed genes points towards the previously proposed mechanism, a more focussed view on genes with the highest decreased breaks with the separate manipulations showed that these genes had the lowest break enrichment with both RNase H1 OE and TOP1 KD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3 F, H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">J</xref>), which was also validated by γ-H2AX ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8F</xref>). These findings imply that R-loops and TOP1 cause DSBs independently of each other. A possible mechanism could be that R-loops and TOP1 themselves could accumulate SSBs at both strands leading to DSBs. Another posibility is that SSBs induced by TOP1 and R-loops could be adjacent to SSBs induced by other agents such as oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Ray <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Estrogen responsiveness and DSBs</title><p id="P31">Previously, R-loops have been proposed to be the main cause of estrogen-induced DNA damage (Stork <italic>et al</italic>., 2016), pointing towards a role of R-loops in transcriptional DSBs. Our sBLISS data on E2 responsive genes after TOP1 KD or RNase H1 OE shows induction of breaks at these genes after estradiol treatment, further validating a causing effect of transcription on DSBs formation. Furthermore, TOP1 KD or RNase H1 OE significantly attenuated the effect of estradiol, further validating the involvement of TOP1 and R-loops in transcriptional DSBs formation.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>The repair of transcriptional DSBs</title><p id="P32">Our results show that despite many of MCF7 dependent oncogenes are enriched in the break density list, they are also highly expressed, implying that these regions are repaired very efficiently. Our findings suggest that highly expressed genes including oncogenes, are covered by the histone mark γ-H2AX, indicating that DDR signaling is very active in these regions likely to ensure repair of the DSBs resulting from the hypertranscription of these genes. We also showed that depletion of XRCC4 increased DSBs at the gene body of highly expressed genes as compared to RAD51 knockdown, indicating that the NHEJ repair pathway might be the main pathway for transcriptional DSBs repair at gene bodies, while HR might be more prominent at TSS.</p></sec></sec><sec specific-use="web-only" id="S17"><title>Method details</title><sec id="S18"><title>cell culture</title><p id="P33">MCF7 (HTB-22) were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (GIBCO), glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (Beit-Haemek).

Model of transcriptional DSBs formation at hyper-transcribed oncogenes and its repair. Oncogene hypertranscription by RNA PolII increases the negative supercoiling (-SC) behind the transcribing RNA PolII. This -SC increases the demand for the catalytic activity of TOP1 to resolve it, which eventually leads to the stabilization of TOP1cc and formation of a persistent SSB. The increased -SC caused by the hypertranscription also facilitate the formation of R-loops that can turn into a SSB, which together with the SSB caused by TOP1cc, could result in a DSB. To ensure efficient and sustained hypertranscription of oncogenes, oncogenes are enriched with the mark γ-H2AX to ensure strong DNA damage response (DDR) and efficient repair of transcriptional DSBs. The illustration was generated using BioRender. sBLISS and ChIP-seq experiments were done in duplicates.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS158880-f008"/></fig></floats-group></article>
