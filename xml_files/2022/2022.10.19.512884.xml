mutations in the spike protein’s receptor binding domain (RBD). This region coincides with known epitopes and can therefore have an impact on immune escape. Protracted infections in immunosuppressed patients have been hypothesized to lead to an enrichment of such mutations and therefore drive evolution towards VOCs. Here, we show that immunosuppressed patients with hematologic cancers develop distinct populations with immune escape mutations throughout the course of their infection. Notably, by investigating the co-occurrence of substitutions on individual sequencing reads in the RBD, we found quasispecies harboring mutations that confer resistance to known monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as S:E484K and S:E484A. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence for a viral reservoir based on intra-host phylogenetics. Our results on viral reservoirs can shed light on protracted infections interspersed with periods where the virus is undetectable as well as an alternative explanation for some long-COVID cases. Our findings also highlight that protracted infections should be treated with combination therapies rather than by a single mAbs to clear pre-existing resistant mutations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Several SARS-CoV-2 VOCs have convergent mutations in the spike protein’s RBD that coincide with known epitopes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> Mutations in this genomic region affect the ability of the spike (S) to enter the cell via the ACE2 receptor and have been linked with higher transmission rates and/or immune escape.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup></p><p id="P3">While in most cases, SARS-CoV-2 infections are cleared within a few days, key mutations develop <italic>de novo</italic> in long lasting infections in patients with immunosuppressive conditions.

She had undergone several courses of anti-CD20 (rituximab) and chemotherapy in the months preceding her COVID diagnosis. She was vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine on 25/02/2021. The patient tested positive again on 28/04/2021 (D111). The full timeline of her infection is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>. Because the sample sequenced on D111 had S:E484K, it was first assumed that this sample and all subsequent timepoints were from a reinfection. However, phylogenetic analysis of all time points shows that all samples came from the same infection that lasted at least 173 days, from 08/01/2021 to 29/06/2021 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). She passed away on 14/08/2021 from a non-COVID related complication.</p><p id="P7">One immunosuppressed South Korean 25 years old male patient (K1, described as P2 in Lee et al.) was infected with PANGO lineage B.1.497 in late 2020 and early 2021.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> He had acute myelogenous leukemia and had received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant one year prior.

For Q1, the substitutions on S:484 at D111 and D116 were mutually exclusive; no reads contained both alternative alleles on 23012 and 23013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). There were two major distinct mutant populations of S:E484K (0.68 on D111, 0.93 on D116) and S:E484A (0.26 on D111, 0.06 on D116), as well as a small wild-type population (0.06 on D111, 0.01 on D116). For K1, G22599A and C22605T on D38 were both at a frequency of 0.10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>), which could suggest co-occurrence of these mutations. However, when retrieving reads containing all three positions, we see that those substitutions belong to different viral populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>).

Only four samples had more than one mutation on S:484 that led to distinct viral populations (SRR15258550, SRR15061404, SRR17006835, SRR16298333). No clinical details on these infections are available, but the overall mutational burden was not characteristic of protracted infections. The small number of occurrences of the RBD mutational pattern found in the general population (at a frequency below 0.003%) highlights the peculiar character of the mutational events identified in the immunosuppressed individuals described here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P12">We performed intra-host analysis on serial SARS-CoV-2 sequences from two patients with hematologic cancers and compared the identified patterns with 147,537 sequencing libraries to look for intra-host populations of immune escaping mutations in the spike’s RBD. We found evidence of multiple viral populations co-existing in this region within a single host in immunosuppressed patients. Furthermore, we found distinct populations of mutants for codon S:484 which is extremely rare in the general population, thus stressing the importance of studying immunosuppressed patients in a longitudinal design to get insights into key steps of viral evolution.</p><p id="P13">When comparing consensus mutations found at Q1’s D1, D111/D116, and D172, we saw that all four time points share the mutations present at D1, demonstrating that this is a single long-lasting infection. However, D111/D116 and D172 accumulated 10 and 20 new mutations, respectively, that are not shared across time points. The only notable exception was C26728T, a synonymous mutation in the N protein present at frequencies of 0.29, 0.2, and 0.92 on D111, D116, and D172, respectively. This suggests that the substrains present at these time points evolved separately from the substrain at D1, and that C26728T may be a recurrent mutation. The substrain present at D111/D116 was cleared from the nasopharyngeal tissues and replaced by the one at D172. Given the lack of overlap of mutations between D111/D116 and D172, the substrain present at the last time point may have evolved in another location within the host’s body, consistent with patterns observed in viral reservoirs. The theory of viral reservoirs as an explanation for long-COVID symptoms has been put forward because viral antigens or intermediate molecules of viral replication have been detected in long-COVID cases despite negative PCR tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> However, to our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a viral reservoir based on intra-host phylogenetics. These results call for further investigation to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 viral reservoir can be found in immunocompetent patients.</p><p id="P14">Immune escape has been a growing concern in the past year due to the rise of Omicron and its multiple sublineages that escape natural immunity as well as available vaccines and several mAbs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> Here we described two immunosuppressed patients that were not treated with mAbs but that developed de novo multiple viral populations with mutations known to cause resistance to different mAbs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> We have shown that this pattern is extremely rare in the general population, making it very likely that those distinct populations in Q1 and K1 arose due to their condition, revealing SARS-CoV-2 escape strategies. This conclusion is supported by another recent case study with an immunocompromised patient, which also found multiple mutations on S:484.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> As is the case for other viruses, our results suggest that combination strategies accelerating viral clearance may be required to clear viral populations with pre-existing mutations within vulnerable patients.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Viral databases</title><p id="P15">SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences data were obtained from the LSPQ database through the CoVSeQ consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covseq.ca/data-info?lang=en">https://covseq.ca/data-info?lang=en</ext-link>) on 16/11/2021. Only sequences that were covered at more than 90% and a mean depth of 50X for Illumina and 16X for Oxford Nanopore technologies (ONT) with no previously documented frameshift, less than 5% N at most 5 ambiguous bases were used.

Samples were sequenced on Illumina or ONT. Regardless of the sequencing technology, data was initially processed to remove any host sequences by aligning to a hybrid reference with both human (GRCh38) and SARS-CoV-2 (MN908947.3). Any sequences that aligned to the human portion of the hybrid reference were removed from downstream analysis. For Illumina sequencing data, raw reads were first trimmed using cutadapt (v2.10), then aligned to the reference using bwa-mem (v0.7.17). Aligned reads were filtered using sambamba (v0.7.0) to remove paired reads with an insert size outside the 60-300bp range, unmapped reads, and all secondary alignments. Then, any remaining ARTIC primers (v3) were trimmed with iVar (v.1.3.4). To create a consensus representative of the most abundant species in the sample, a pileup was produced using Samtools (v1.9) which was used as an input for FreeBayes (v1.2.2). For ONT sequencing data, raw signals were basecalled using guppy (v3.4.4) with the High-Accuracy Model (dna_r9.4.1_450bps_hac). Reads outside the expected size range (400-700bp) were removed from the analysis. Reads were then aligned to the reference using minimap2 (v.2.17) and filtered to remove incorrect primer pairs and randomly downsampled to keep 800X depth per strand in high coverage regions. Finally, Nanopolish (v0.13.1) was used to call mutations in regions with a minimum depth of 16X (8X per strand) and a flank of 10bp. After masking regions with coverage below 20X, mutations called by nanopolish were integrated into the reference using bcftools (v1.9) to create a consensus sequence. In all cases, MN908947.3 was used as a reference genome.
