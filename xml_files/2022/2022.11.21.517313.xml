However, to the best of our knowledge, a direct assessment of the total collagen levels of an entire mammal to confirm this estimate is missing. Here we measured hydroxyproline levels as a proxy for collagen content together with total protein levels of entire mice or of individual tissues. Collagen content normalized to the total protein is approximately 0.1% in the brain and liver, 1% in the heart and kidney, 4% in the muscle and lung, 6% in the colon, 20-40% in the skin, 25-35% in bones, and 40-50% in tendons of wild-type (CD1 and CB57BL/6) mice, consistent with previous reports. Mice consist of 37 mg of collagen and 265 mg of protein per g of body weight. To our surprise, we find that collagen is approximately 12% in females and 17% in males of the total protein content of entire wild-type (CD1 and CB57BL/6) mice. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography approaches confirmed a 10-12% collagen over total protein estimates for female mice. Collagen staining methods and extracellular matrix-enriched proteomics estimated 5-6% of collagens over the total protein extracted. Although collagen type I is the most abundant collagen, the most abundant proteins are albumin, hemoglobulin, histones, actin, serpina, and then collagen type I. Analyzing amino acid compositions of mice revealed glycine as the most abundant amino acid. Thus, we provide reference points for collagen, matrisome, protein, and amino acid composition of healthy wild-type mice that are important for tissue and biomaterial engineering and for the comparison of these factors in various disease models.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Progress in biomedical science depends on building models using existing data to predict the outcome of a future experiment and either confirm or adapt the working model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. These models then should be derived from data and not from assumptions. One such assumption used as a point of reference is the statement: “collagen is the most abundant protein making up one-third or 30% of total protein in mammals or vertebrates.” We found over 50 publications making such a statement without any reference or citing a review paper. It seems as if this statement is a given textbook fact (BNID 109731) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen</ext-link>, accessed 05.10.22); however, the actual quantifications are elusive. The biochemical properties of collagens have been studied since the end of the 18th hundred <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Given the recent increased interest in collagen research of over 8000 papers published per year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, Supplementary Table 1), it might be essential to have a reference point for collagen levels in tissues and entire organisms. For instance, quantification of collagen levels is important in different disease settings, such as fibrosis (too much collagen deposition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and 45% of all human deaths <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>), immune-induced degradation of collagen in arthritis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>), more collagen and stiffer tumor environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, excessive collagen in skin diseases (scleroderma, keloids) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, cancer patient survival correlates with specific collagen types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, fibrotic collagen remodeling in cardiovascular diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and aging usually associated with lower collagen levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Collagen is a fascinating biomaterial that is highly biocompatible and used for many biomedical applications in processes, such as wound healing, tissue repair, and dental implants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Collagen-based materials have been used for medical applications already reported by Galan two millennia ago for reconstructive surgery on tendons and wound closure on gladiators <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Collagen can survive longer than other biomolecules, such that collagen has been extracted from dinosaur bones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and is used for estimating the age of a specimen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. During evolution, the invention of collagen probably enabled the transitions from unicellular to multicellular organisms solving three major problems, cell and tissue adhesion, mechanical support (skeleton), and protection in the form of barrier function and mechanical shock absorption <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Collagen is characterized by its triple helix repeats of (Gly-X-Y)n whereby Gly stands for glycine, X and Y can be any amino acid but most commonly are proline and hydroxyproline (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>). For sterical reasons, the glycine on every third position is essential for adequately forming the triple helix composed of the three collagen chains (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>). Hydroxyproline is relatively unique to collagens (only in a few other proteins found, <italic>e.g.,</italic> elastin, argonaute-2, HIF-1α) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and is essential for stabilizing the collagen triple helix (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P4">There are several methods for the detection of collagen levels: quantifying hydroxyproline levels, collagen stainings, densitometry of collagen bands in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) coupled with collagen antibodies, immunohistochemistry using collagen antibodies, quantitative mass spectrometry enriched for extracellular matrix proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> The gold standard in the field for assessing collagen levels is via hydroxyproline quantification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Here, we hydrolyzed entire mouse samples to amino acid levels and used hydroxyproline and amino acid levels as a proxy to estimate the total collagen over total protein levels.

In the literature, it has been stated that collagen makes up about 60-90% of the dry weight of bone, skin, sclera, and tendon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). These percentages seem to be a given in the field since many of these statements have either no reference or cite review publications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). Our literature search to identify the source for these percentages led to a review paper by Grant from 1972 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> that summarized the collagen content of various tissues and animals. For the original work, we found two publications by Lowry and colleagues from 1941 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and Neuman and Logan 1950 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> that measured the collagen content of dried tissue. However, we found no current experimental or quantitative evidence. To fill this gap, we measured total collagen levels in mice. Instead of normalizing to the organs’ dry weight, we decided to normalize to total protein levels. We harvested mouse tissues and hydrolyzed them with hydrogen chloride to the amino acid levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, Materials and Methods for details). And then e made aliquots of these amino acid homogenates to quantify total collagen and protein levels. A colorimetric read-out was used to determine free hydroxyproline amino acids that were oxidized with chloramine-T to pyrrole and stained with Ehrlich's reagent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We normalized these hydroxyproline amino acid levels to a standard curve of rat tail collagen to determine total collagen levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We validated our hydroxyproline and collagen quantification with an alternative but comparable protocol approach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2 a-e</xref>). Since standard protein quantification does not work with free amino acids in an acidic environment, we used the color change of genipin when it reacts with amino acids as a read-out <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. We normalized these amino acid levels to a standardized curve of bovine serum albumin protein (BSA) to determine total protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>; Materials and Methods for details). Thus, with this protocol, we overcame the obstacle of the insolubility of collagens in the extracellular matrix and were able to quantify total collagen over total protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Collagen levels across mice tissues range from 0.1 to 51% of total protein levels</title><p id="P7">We harvested organs from four weeks old outbred wild-type CD1 female mice and 41 weeks old inbred wild-type C57BL/6 male mice and quantified collagen over protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-i</xref>). We found that the brain and liver had the least amount of collagen to protein levels (0.1%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), heart and kidney around 1%, muscle and lung around 3.5%, colon 5.7%, skin 20%, bone 25-35%, and tendon about 40% of total collagen to the protein of wild-type CD1 female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>; Supplementary Table 3). To provide a reference point, we quantified collagen or protein weight per weight of wet tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e, 1f</xref>; Supplementary Table 3). Next, we quantified collagen over protein levels of 41 weeks old wild-type C57BL/6 male mice and found higher collagen levels for skin (38.5%) and tendon (50.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>; Supplementary Table 4). This difference could be either due to age, gender, or genotype. Furthermore, we noticed a heterogeneity of collagen to protein levels for individual animals’ organs within the same cohort (dots in the bar graph represent individual mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, 1e</xref>). For comparison, we searched the literature for collagen measurements normalized to protein levels (BSA, amino acids, nitrogen; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>; Supplementary Table 5). We only found a few studies and included rat tissues as additional reference points. Reassuringly, the collagen over protein values were in similar ranges. Thus, our measurements provide reference values for collagen over protein levels for several organs of wild-type mice.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Quantifying total collagen levels normalized to total proteins of entire mice</title><p id="P8">An accumulating body of literature states the quote: “30% of total protein is collagen in mammals” and the quote: “collagen is the most abundant protein”; however, a reference to the original work that quantified these percentages is missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, Supplementary Table 6). None of the over 50 publications we found had an original reference for these statements (Supplementary Table 6). Our literature search to identify the original work for these percentages led to a review paper from 1961 as a probable source <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. In this review article, R.D. Harkness states: “A complete analysis of a whole animal has only been performed on mice (Harkness, Harkness &amp; James, 1958) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Collagen formed about a fifth of the total body protein.” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. In that referenced study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, Harkness and colleagues dissected nine adult male albino mice, each into five parts (skin, carcass, viscera, femora, quadriceps). They quantified the collagen content of these tissues by multiplying hydroxyproline levels by 7.46 and normalized them to total nitrogen (N) levels as a proxy for protein levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Then they added the values of these five parts to estimate the collagen levels of the entire mice. They found that: “Collagen formed 2.6 ± 0.1 % of the body weight and 17.7 ± 0.7% of total N in the control animals” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">There are limitations to this approach of combining and estimating total collagen levels from individual tissue parts. Moreover, quantification of the total collagen of an entire mouse has not been performed before. To address this, we homogenized individual entire mice and hydrolyzed aliquots of these whole mice homogenates with hydrogen chloride to the amino acid levels to determine total collagen over total protein levels of entire mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, Materials and Methods for details). We found that 4-week-old outbred wild-type CD1 female mice contained 14.8% of collagen over total protein levels, inbred wild-type C57BL/6 female mice at the age of 4 weeks contained 12.0%, 7- or 21-weeks old had 12.8% of total collagen over total protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-e</xref>, Supplementary Table 7). Although in wild-type C57BL/6 female mice from 4 to 21 weeks, there was no significant change in collagen over protein levels, 7-week C57BL/6 male mice showed higher collagen over protein levels compared to corresponding 7-week C57BL/6 female mice, 16.9% versus 12.8%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, Supplementary Table 7). This suggests a gender-specific effect on total collagen over protein levels. Furthermore, the 16.9% collagen to the protein content of our 7-week C57BL/6 male mice is comparable to the 17.7 % of the male albino mice determined by Harkness and colleagues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">To complement our colorimetric measurements of hydroxyproline and total amino acids levels, we analyzed amino acid levels within the samples with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). We found that hydroxyproline (4HP) over total amino acids is 1.6% and 1.3% of 4-week old wild-type CD1 and C57BL/6 female mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>, Supplementary Table 8). To convert the hydroxyproline levels to collagen levels, we used the conversion factor of 7.46. We found 11.8% and 10.0% of 4-week-old wild-type CD1 and C57BL/6 female mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>, Supplementary Table 8). The conversion factor of 7.46 is an estimate based on hydroxyproline levels of collagens from various tissues of cows, pigs, sheep, chickens, kangaroos, and rats resulting in 13.0-14.4% of hydroxyproline in mammalian collagens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Since experimental quantification of this conversion factor for mice is missing, we assessed and compared this conversion factor from our data. We found that a conversion factor of 7.46 reflects well collagen estimation from hydroxyproline in whole mouse samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2 g-i</xref>; Supplementary Table 9). Furthermore, in our HPLC, we also ran a collagen standard to know how much hydroxyproline levels correspond to total collagen levels. When normalizing with this collagen standard, we found 7.75 x (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>, Supplementary Table 8). Thus, we obtained comparable results either using a colorimetric approach or HPLC. Taken together, our measurements suggest that, on average female wild-type mice have about 12.3 ± 1.5% of collagen over total protein. Consistent with the previous measurements by Harkness, Harkness &amp; James, 1958 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, male wild-type mice showed about 17% of collagen over total protein.</p><p id="P11">To assess total collagen levels differently than by using hydroxyproline as a read-out for collagen, we digested our samples with pepsin. We used an adapted version of Sircol staining to quantify soluble collagens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. For Sircol staining, the dye Sirius red binds collagens and other non-collagenous proteins. By running the samples over columns that retain larger proteins, such as collagens, the accuracy for Sircol collagen quantification is improved <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We validated this approach using a collagen standard and found similar collagen content with the Sircol method compared to when assessed by hydroxyproline measurements for pure protein samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref>, Supplementary Table 10). From our whole mouse lysates digested with pepsin, we recovered about 5-14 mg collagen per g wet weight, which is about 19-41% of estimated collagen by hydroxyproline measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2k</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2l</xref>, Supplementary Table 10). Normalizing the Sircol-derived collagen levels (mg collagen / g wet weight) to our total protein estimates (mg protein / g wet weight), resulted in on average 5% of collagen over total protein (Supplementary Table 10). This estimation is lower compared to the 12-17% of collagen content by the hydroxyproline measurements. We speculate that the underestimation is in part due to the lack of proper solubilization of collagen using this approach.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Total protein content and amino acid composition of mice</title><p id="P12">Next, we asked how much total collagen and protein is found in entire mice. In the literature, we found only one publication from 1977 that estimated a total protein of 1.5 g and 1.4 g per 3-week-old male or female CB57BL/6J ob/ob mice, respectively, based on nitrogen levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. We quantified higher protein levels of 3.8 g of total protein per 4-week-old BL6 wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We found wild-type mice contain about 4-8 g of total protein and 0.5-1.2 g of total collagen per mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, 3b</xref>), which corresponds to 265 mg of protein and 37 mg of collagen per g body weight on average (Supplementary Table 7). The total protein and collagen per mouse were poorly correlated with its total body wet weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c-f</xref>). The collagen levels correlated better, which makes sense since collagens are structural and scaffold proteins important for tissue geometry and size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Next, we asked what is the relative amino acid composition of mice. We found that glycine with 15% was the most abundant amino acid in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g-h</xref>, Supplementary Table 8). Proline was 6.5%, and hydroxyproline (4HP) was about 1.5% relative to all other amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g-h</xref>, Supplementary Table 8). Thus, we provide the first relative amino acid composition of entire mice.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Collagen quantification using proteomics</title><p id="P14">Next, we used a quantitative proteomics approach. To enrich extracellular matrix proteins, we separated whole mouse lysates by SDS-PAGE, gel lanes were cut into five slices per sample, and proteins therein were digested with trypsin overnight. Generated peptides were extracted and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref> for details). Extracted ion currents of peptides were used for label-free quantification employing the iBAQ algorithm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. For each sample, the relative proportion of all quantified collagen proteins was calculated in comparison to the overall intensity of all proteins. We quantified 4.6±0.3% for 4-week-old CD1 mice, 4.6±1.4% for 4-week-old C57BL/6 mice, and 6.4±0.4% for 21-week-old C57BL/6 mice (Supplementary Table 11). Although these percentages are similar to the Sircol collagen quantifications, these percentages were lower compared to the hydroxyproline measurement, probably due to the crosslinked nature of collagens, and we would expect that trypsin is less efficient in generating measurable peptides.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Matreotype of entire mice</title><p id="P15">To establish matreotypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, which is the composition of the ECM (<italic>i.e.</italic>, matrisome) associated with entire mice, we analyzed our ECM-enriched proteomics data according to matrisome category <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.

To our surprise, serine protease inhibitors (Serpina1,3) were more abundant than collagen type I (Col1a1,2), followed by fibrillin (Fbn1), elastin (Eln), and collagen type 6 (Col6a1,2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>, Supplementary Table 11). Furthermore, considering all detected proteins, albumin (Alb), hemoglobin (Hbb), and parvalbumin (Pvalb) were the most abundant protein, followed by histones, actin (Acta1), serine protease inhibitors (Serpina1,3), and then collagen type I (Col1a1,2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>, Supplementary Table 11).

Astonishingly, our quantification revealed a similar percentage of 16.8% of total collagen over protein of entire male mice.

For both methods, samples need to be separated via either running on a gel or on a column, probably losing material. Furthermore, a lower yield might also be due to the inherent insolubility of the collagen networks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, and in the case of proteomics, limited protease access to crosslinked peptides and lack of identification of crosslinked peptides, limitations we had not addressed here. A previous study on tendons and ligaments achieved complete solubilization by successive protease and elastase digestion, which allowed the harvesting of more collagen and elastin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Thus, such an approach might allow quantifying more collagen over protein levels, which might asymptote to our hydroxyproline to collagen estimations.</p><p id="P20">Our proteomics analysis revealed collagen type I (Col1a1,2), fibrillin (Fbn1), elastin (Eln), and collagen type 6 (Col6a1,2) as the most abundant core matrisome proteins. This is comparable to a recent meta-analysis of different proteomics studies on articular cartilage, bone, ligament, skeletal muscle, and tendon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.
