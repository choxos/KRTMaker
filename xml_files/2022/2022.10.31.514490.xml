Macrophages are known targets of HCMV and considered to be permissive for productive infection, while monocytes, their precursors, are latently infected. Here we reveal that infection of macrophages is more complex than previously appreciated and can result in either productive or non-productive infection. By analyzing the progression of HCMV infection in monocytes and macrophages using single cell transcriptomics, we uncover that the level of viral gene expression, and specifically the expression of the major immediate early proteins, IE1 and IE2, is the principal barrier for establishing productive infection. On the cellular side, we reveal that the cell intrinsic levels of interferon stimulated genes (ISG), but not their induction, is a main determinant of infection outcome and that intrinsic ISG levels are downregulated with monocyte differentiation, partially explaining why macrophages are more susceptible to productive HCMV infection. We further show that, compared to monocytes, non-productive macrophages maintain higher levels of viral transcripts and are able to reactivate, raising the possibility that they may serve as latency reservoirs. Overall, by harnessing the tractable system of monocyte differentiation we decipher underlying principles that control HCMV infection outcome, and propose macrophages as a potential HCMV reservoir in tissues.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a prevalent pathogen of the beta-herpesvirus family, infecting the majority of the human population worldwide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Although primary infection is usually asymptomatic in healthy individuals, HCMV can cause detrimental disease in immunocompromised individuals, and is the leading cause of congenital infections worldwide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Like all herpesviruses, HCMV can establish latent infection that persists for the lifetime of the host. Reactivation from latency in immunosuppressed individuals, such as transplant recipients and HIV patients, can result in severe morbidity and mortality.</p><p id="P3">HCMV infects a wide range of cell types including epithelial and endothelial cells, fibroblasts and myeloid cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Infection outcome is tightly connected to cell type, and generally, differentiated cells are more permissive to productive infection, but the molecular determinants that govern HCMV permissiveness are still largely unknown. HCMV infection has been studied intensively in the myeloid lineage as cells along this lineage are thought to play a critical role in HCMV latency, reactivation, dissemination and persistence. CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMPs) and blood monocytes are infected with HCMV but do not support productive infection and are the main cells in which HCMV latency has been characterized <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Extensive work had been conducted on HCMV infected monocytes, illustrating infection activates cellular receptors and long term signaling events, promoting differentiation processes that support viral dissemination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, since CD14+ monocytes are short-lived, it has been proposed that the long term latent reservoir resides in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. It is noteworthy that the observed risk of HCMV reactivation in hematopoietic cell transplantations versus in solid organ transplantations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> strongly implies that latent HCMV does not reside only in the bone marrow, and that there are additional uncharacterized sources of latent HCMV that likely reside within tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Unlike monocytes, it was demonstrated that when macrophages and dendritic cells are infected with HCMV, they are permissive for productive infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and tissue macrophages were shown to be infected by HCMV <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. This difference in infection outcome between macrophages and their monocyte progenitors indicates a major role for the cellular environment, and repression of the virus via epigenetic mechanisms was shown to play an important role <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, however, it is not clear what drives these epigenetic differences and how the differences in infection outcome between different cell types is explained at the molecular level.</p><p id="P5">Furthermore, although macrophages are important for the first response to pathogens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, reside in every tissue, the effect of HCMV infection in macrophages on their function is not well charted.</p><p id="P6">To dissect the molecular determinants that dictate infection outcome, we scrutinize HCMV infection of monocytes and macrophages at a single cell resolution. We reveal that macrophages can support both productive and non-productive infections and by comparing these two infection outcomes, as well as to infected monocytes, we demonstrate that the key determinant of infection outcome is the expression of viral immediate early genes. We show that non-productive infection is characterized by activation of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), but this activation by itself does not deterministically affect infection outcome. On the other hand, we demonstrate that intrinsic ISG expression levels, independent of induction upon infection, are coupled to the differentiation state and have a substantial effect on infection outcome. We further reveal that productive infection perturbs macrophage cell identity and function. Finally, we show that non-productive macrophages are characterized by higher levels of viral gene expression compared to monocytes, and that the virus can reactivate from these cells. Altogether, our findings define determinants of HCMV infection outcome in the myeloid lineage, suggest that infection of macrophages interferes with their functions and raise the possibility that macrophages can serve as latent tissue reservoirs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Experimental system for studying HCMV infection outcome</title><p id="P7">In order to elucidate the molecular determinants that influence HCMV infection outcome, we sought to investigate the progression of infection in high temporal resolution in HCMV infected monocytes, which support latent infection, and in differentiated monocytes, which are permissive to productive infection. Initially, we infected CD14+ primary monocytes following different treatments that are used for differentiation, with HCMV TB40-E strain. The virus also contained a GFP reporter under the SV40 promoter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, which allows quantification of productive infection efficiency. We tested three treatments that trigger primary monocyte differentiation in order to choose a strategy that will most efficiently support productive HCMV infection: phorbol-myristate (PMA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor combined with interleukin-4 (GM-CSF/IL-4) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In addition, we tested TNFα treatment, which was previously shown to induce HCMV-permissive cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. As expected, 3 days post infection (dpi) of primary CD14+ monocytes with HCMV-GFP, almost all the cells show an increase in GFP indicating they are infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). However, GFP expression remains relatively low indicating that viral gene expression is repressed.</p><p id="P8">Interestingly, following all differentiation inducing-treatments, infection resulted in two distinct populations: one with a small increase in GFP levels (GFP-dim), suggesting these cells were infected with HCMV but like in monocytes, viral gene expression is repressed, and the second with a strong GFP signal (GFP-bright), suggesting productive infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Cells within each of the treatments displayed uniform shifts in surface expression of macrophage/dendritic cell markers, negating the possibility that differences in differentiation efficiency within the cell populations can solely explain the differences in infection outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). For most further experiments we chose to use PMA derived macrophages as it is commonly used in HCMV studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and resulted in a large and distinct population of GFP-bright cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Importantly, the two distinct populations in infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) are not apparent at early stages of infection, suggesting that they likely do not reflect two separate initial populations, but rather two different infection outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Productive infection in MDMs was verified by detection of infectious virus in the supernatant, as long as several weeks post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), despite ongoing cell death of cultured MDMs with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig 1c</xref>). In comparison, parallel infection of CD14+ monocytes yielded no infectious virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We sought to assess whether the two distinct GFP-expressing MDM populations seen by flow cytometry and microscopy indeed reflect different infection outcomes. First we noticed that GFP-bright cells are bigger compared to GFP-dim cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>), a known feature of lytic HCMV infection. We further sorted infected MDMs to GFP-bright and GFP-dim populations at 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1f</xref>). Measurements of viral DNA levels show that at 4 dpi both the GFP-bright and the GFP-dim populations harbored viral DNA, yet viral DNA load was much higher in the GFP-bright cells suggesting viral DNA replication occurs in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1g</xref>). Furthermore, viral DNA levels continued to increase with time in the GFP-bright population, while the GFP-dim population showed no substantial change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These results indicate that viral genome replication was taking place in the GFP-bright population but not in the GFP-dim. In addition, supernatants from GFP-dim and GFP-bright MDMs were collected at different dpi and used to infect fibroblasts in order to measure production of infectious virus. We failed to detect any infectious virus in the supernatant of the GFP-dim cells at any time point. However, measurable infectious virus was detected in the supernatant of the GFP-bright cells, reaching highest titers at 10dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). These results indicate that the majority of MDMs were infected with the virus but a productive infection only developed in part of the population. The split of infected macrophages into two infection outcomes occurs also in MDMs differentiated with all other treatments tested, as we could verify the discernible GFP bright and dim populations differed in viral genome levels at 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1 h-j</xref>). To explore whether these two infection outcomes occur also in natural tissue myeloid cells, we collected cells from BronchoAlveolar Lavage (BAL) samples and infected them with HCMV-GFP. The presence of macrophages in these samples was verified by size, morphology and surface marker staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1k</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1l</xref>). Indeed also in BAL macrophages we observed two distinct populations of GFP-dim and GFP-bright cells that differ in viral genome levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1l</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Single-cell transcriptome analysis along HCMV infection of CD14+ monocytes and MDMs</title><p id="P10">In order to shed light on the viral and cellular processes governing these two infection outcomes, we turned to single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Differentiation of primary monocytes provided a tractable system which allowed a head to head comparison between infection in monocytes and macrophages and a large enough number of cells to be able to analyze infection at multiple time points. We analyzed infected primary CD14+ monocytes and PMA-induced MDMs from the same donor at 5, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 144 hours post infection (hpi), as well as mock-infected CD14+ monocytes and MDMs at the 5 and 144 hpi time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In total we analyzed 871 monocytes and 2355 MDMs. Projection of all cells according to both cellular and viral reads, revealed several distinct groups of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>).</p><p id="P11">At 5 hpi, infected monocytes were grouped with mock-infected monocytes, indicating that transcriptional changes at this time point are milder compared to later times in infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). Infected monocytes from 12 hpi onwards appeared as a single population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2b</xref>) and the cellular genes that dictated their stratification from early monocytes were mainly interferon stimulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). As expected, viral transcript load in infected monocytes remained low along infection (median=0.063%), and did not exceed 1% of the total transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), indicating lack of productive infection, in line with previous reports <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. In contrast to monocytes, and in agreement with our flow cytometry analysis, infected MDMs from 24 hpi and onwards, were separated into two distinct populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) that were characterized by drastic differences in viral transcript load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). These two populations reflect two infection outcomes: in one, viral transcript load increased as infection progressed, reaching more than 50% of the transcriptome, illustrating these cells represent productive infection. The second group of MDMs was composed of mock-infected MDMs, most of the infected MDMs from the early time points, as well as 57% of MDMs at the later time points. In infected MDMs that belong to this group, viral transcript loads were low (median=0.226%) and did not dramatically differ from infected monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Two distinct infection outcomes in infected macrophages</title><p id="P12">We next focused on analyzing infected MDMs separately, as the two separate populations give an opportunity to explore the trajectories that lead to these two distinct infection outcomes. Notably, all mock-infected MDMs were transcriptionally distinct from the initial monocyte population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>) and showed an increase in macrophage differentiation signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>) indicating that it is unlikely that the two distinct infection outcomes originate from two initially distinct populations. Projection of all infected MDMs according to both cellular and viral transcripts, revealed that cells were divided into three discernible populations, stratified further into sub-clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Most of the cells from the early time points (5-12 hpi) belong to a single group, while cells from later time points in infection split into two additional distinct groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), which differ greatly in the level of viral transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). These divisions illustrate that initially, all cells start with low levels of viral transcripts and are indistinguishable in regard to infection outcome. Beginning at 12, and in most cases at 24 hpi, cells transition to one of two groups: either productive infection, as indicated by the high levels of viral transcripts, reaching 20%-70% at late times of infection, or non-productive infection in which viral transcript levels remain low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). These features,therefore, define three main populations of infected MDMS: early, non-productive and productive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d</xref>). Clustering further stratified cells in each of these populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>), which corresponded to progression in the given trajectory with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>). The productive and non-productive populations, showing low and high viral loads, correspond to low and high GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>), indicating that the two distinct GFP populations indeed reflect the two different infection outcomes in MDMs.</p><p id="P13">We further applied scRNA-seq to total infected BAL cells. Since the number of cells was very low, we sampled the cells only at two time points post infection: 20 hpi and 72hpi. Projection of the cells according to both cellular and viral transcripts, demonstrated that the cells from both time points stratify into two distinct populations of cells and an additional small population that expresses significantly higher viral transcript levels and reflects productively infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e</xref>). Analysis of marker genes showed one population exhibits signatures of cytotoxic lymphocytes, with genes encoding granzymes and T/NK cell related surface markers and cytokines, whereas the second population represented myeloid cells/macrophages, with genes related to antigen presentation and phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3f</xref>). The productive cells also expressed myeloid cell markers (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>), demonstrating these cells originate solely from the myeloid cells. Therefore, in order to focus on the relevant signatures to HCMV infection outcome, we focused only on the myeloid cells. As in the MDMs, we observe a distinct group of productively infected cells, as evident from the much higher levels of viral transcripts and another group, in which the cells carry low levels of viral transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Expression levels of viral immediate early genes govern infection outcome</title><p id="P14">In order to delineate the contribution of cellular and viral genes to the stratification of the MDMs to the different groups (early, non-productive, productive), we next analyzed the transcriptome solely according to cellular genes. This analysis produced the same three distinct groups of cells and very similar cluster stratification, indicating these three infection states are associated with corresponding changes in the cellular transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). The exceptions were clusters 5 and 7. Cluster 5 includes very few non-productive cells from different time points and these cells clustered with early cells when clustering was based only on cellular genes. The nature of these cells is unclear but since this cluster is very small these cells were removed from following cluster-based analyses.</p><p id="P15">Cluster 7 is the earliest productive cluster and contains cells that already express substantial levels of viral transcripts (median= 8.7%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). When clustering was based only on cellular genes, these cells clustered together with the early cells, showing that their classification as productively infected is dictated mainly by viral gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Also when infected BAL myeloid cells were analyzed based only on cellular genes it became clear that some of the cells that are productively infected are defined as such only based on the expression of viral genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). This demonstrates that the major first transcriptional signature that defines cells as productively infected is robust viral gene expression. We next examined which viral genes are expressed at the transition from early to productive cells. For this, we took advantage of the recent temporal classification of HCMV gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We found that the distinction of these early productive cells (cluster 7) was the high relative expression of IE genes (TC1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), as well as specific induction of true early genes (TC2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), compared to the other viral temporal classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). This suggests that expression of IE genes at a level which is sufficient to initiate the induction of early genes, is the main determinant that dictates the progression towards productive infection. Examination of the relative expression levels of the two transcripts transcribed from the major immediate early promoter, UL123, which encodes IE1, and UL122, which encodes IE2, showed that they indeed have specific expression in these early productive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). To test if the initial expression levels of UL123 or UL122 indeed dictate HCMV infection outcome, we ectopically expressed either mCherry (that served as a control), UL123, UL122 or UL99, a viral late protein that was used as an additional control, in macrophages derived from the monocytic cell line THP1. To avoid prolonged expression of the viral proteins, we used a doxycycline-inducible system and induced the expression of the transgene only 24 hour prior to infection, after the cells were differentiated. Similar to infection with primary monocyte-derived MDMs, infection of THP1 MDMs resulted in two populations of GFP-bright and GFP-dim cells, representing productive and non-productive infection, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>). In accordance with the signature revealed by our single cell analysis, we show that ectopic expression of either UL123 or UL122 but not UL99 significantly increases the percentage of productively infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4e</xref>), demonstrating that the expression of IE genes is indeed a major barrier that dictates infection outcome in MDMs. Notably, following overexpression, levels of the corresponding viral proteins were substantially increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4f and 4g</xref>). The effect of ectopic expression of UL123 was further validated in another commonly used model for HCMV infection, PMA treated Kasumi-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Fig. 4h</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Since scRNA-seq gives unprecedented detail on inter-cellular heterogeneity in gene expression profiles, we next explored whether we can use this heterogeneity to identify cellular gene expression profiles that are associated with the initial levels of viral gene expression. Calculation of the correlation coefficient between each cellular transcript and either viral gene expression or specifically with UL123 and UL122 expression, in early infected MDMs, did not reveal any cellular genes whose expression significantly correlates or inverse correlates with the initial levels of viral genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4i</xref>). Our inability to detect variations that are associated with induction of viral gene expression, likely reflects the relatively homogenous nature of the cells we used and therefore small differences in gene expression are likely masked by other factors, such as the amount of incoming virions which varies between cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, or variability between the content of virions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, both which likely play a major role in setting infection outcome.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Induction of interferon stimulated genes does not dictate infection outcome</title><p id="P17">We next examined the features that characterize the shift from early infection to the non-productive population. The cellular genes that were most upregulated in the non-productive cells were Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISGs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). These genes were strongly upregulated in the non-productive cells and barely in the productive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Since the main characteristics of non-productive and productive cells are the induction of ISGs and induction of viral gene expression, respectively, we next examined the relationship between these two features in single cells along MDM infection. This analysis revealed that at early time points, both viral gene and ISG expression are low. As time progressed, most of the cells increased either viral gene expression or ISG expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Notably, the cells of both trajectories were exposed to the same extracellular signals (e.g. interferons), as they were grown together in the same culture dish. This indicates that the induction of viral gene expression, and likely the specific induction of IE genes and/or additional early genes in the productive cells, renders the cells unresponsive to IFN signaling. Since we hardly detected infected MDMs that induced both viral genes and ISGs, this analysis may imply that these events describe two competing deterministic outcomes - induction of viral genes resulting in productive infection, or induction of ISGs prohibiting productive infection. However, analysis of the percentage of cells in the different populations at each time point indicates that productive cells must also originate from the non-productive groups in which ISGs were already induced, as the percentage of productive cells reaches numbers that can not be solely explained by transition from the early infected population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). This therefore suggests that induction of a robust interferon response does not forestall establishment of productive infection and the main determinant that governs infection outcome is the induction of viral gene expression above a certain threshold. Analysis of a recent single cell RNA-seq dataset along HCMV infection of fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> demonstrated the same phenomenon. At 96 hpi, a time point that permits mostly a single round of infection, almost all fibroblasts are productively infected, nevertheless a significant portion of the cells went through a stage in which ISG expression was induced and viral gene expression was low, at earlier time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). These observations in two independent systems suggest that induction of ISGs by an infected cell does not deterministically prevent the establishment of productive infection within that cell.</p><p id="P18">To experimentally examine whether IFN response has deterministic effects on infection outcome, we tested whether boosting the IFN response co-currently with infection will affect infection outcome in MDMs. In accordance with the results of our analysis, adding IFNs (500U/ml IFNα, 700U/ml IFNβ and 500U/ml IFNγ) at the time of infection did not affect the percentage of productively infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>), despite significant increase in ISG expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig 5d</xref>).

As expected, all monocytes exhibit low viral gene expression levels which is comparable at earlier stages to infected MDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>). Notably, compared to MDMs, the expression level of ISGs was substantially higher in monocytes even at the earliest stage of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>). The substantial differences in ISG levels between monocytes and MDMs at the very early time point of infection, which likely proceed the induction of IFN, prompted us to examine if there are differences in the intrinsic levels of ISGs and whether they relate to the permissiveness to productive HCMV infection. We first examined the scRNA-seq data of mock-infected monocytes and MDMs from this study, as well as fibroblasts from Hein et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. We found that indeed the intrinsic levels of ISGs (in mock-infected cells) in fibroblasts is lower than in MDMs, which in turn is lower than in monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>) and there is a clear inverse-correlation between the intrinsic levels of ISGs in mock-infected cells and the levels of viral gene expression at early time points of HCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>). To examine this finding along differentiation of monocytes, we analyzed published transcriptomic data along the differentiation trajectory from monocytes to MDMs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> which revealed a decrease in the intrinsic levels of many ISGs along this trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5k</xref>). Since the permissiveness for lytic infection is tightly linked to differentiation state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, we examined the link between intrinsic expression of ISGs and differentiation state of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow.

Indeed, addition of IFNs 24 hours prior to infection almost completely eliminates productive infection in both MDMs and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">extended Fig. 5g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5h</xref>).

We further show that in IFN pretreated cells viral gene expression is extremely reduced already at 12hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5l</xref>), indicating that ISGs act to block the virus at the stage of immediate early viral gene expression or earlier.</p><p id="P21">While these experiments show that boosting ISG expression prior to infection affects infection outcome, we next sought to test if intrinsic ISG levels, without any boost, also play a role. Intrinsic levels of ISGs may originate from low basal levels of interferon signaling, but it was recently suggested that basal expression of ISGs is controlled by preformed STAT2-IRF9 complexes, which are independent of interferon receptors signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. To test these possibilities we first treated MDMs, 24 hours prior to infection, with ruxolitinib, a potent and selective Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and 2 inhibitor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> that blocks the signaling downstream of interferon receptors.</p><p id="P22">This treatment did not affect the intrinsic levels of ISG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 5k</xref>) and correspondingly did not affect infection outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 5l</xref>). We therefore next tested whether we could reduce intrinsic ISG levels by depleting IRF9 or STAT2 using CRISPR-cas9 in THP1 derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 5m</xref>). In support of their role in regulating basal ISG expression independently of IFN, depleting either IRF9 or STAT2 reduced the basal expression of many ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5m</xref>). Importantly, depletion of IRF9 or STAT2 using two independent guide-RNAs increased the percentage of productively infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5n</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 5n</xref>). Furthermore this effect was not diminished by addition of ruxolitinib at the time of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 5o</xref>), illustrating the increase in productive cells is due to the reduction in intrinsic ISGs rather than reduced induction of ISGs following infection.</p><p id="P23">Overall these results point to a major role for intrinsic ISG expression in dictating HCMV infection outcome and suggest that the intrinsic expression of ISGs, that decrease upon differentiation, contributes to the permissiveness of differentiated cells to HCMV infection. Furthermore, by combining differential ISG expression in our various experiments, we highlight ISGs that may be more likely to be involved in determining HCMV infection outcome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and future work is needed to delineate their specific effects.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Productive HCMV infection disrupts macrophage identity and function</title><p id="P24">To characterize cellular transcriptional changes following the different infection outcomes in MDMs, we performed differential gene expression analysis comparing MDMs from the different infection trajectories to mock-infected cells, followed by pathway enrichment analysis. Several metabolism pathways that are known to be enhanced during HCMV infection in fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> were significantly enriched in productive MDMs, including the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). In line with the virus subverting the cell cycle machinery to its own benefit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, several pathways related to modulation of the cell cycle were enriched. In addition, HCMV is reliant on the cellular machinery for expression of its genes, as reflected by modulation of different pathways related to gene expression with a strong induction of genes related to translation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. As mentioned above, non-productive MDMs significantly induced, mainly and most robustly, ISGs. These results demonstrate that the non-productive trajectory is dominated by induction of ISGs, while in the productive trajectory the virus takes over and subverts the cellular machinery for promoting its propagation.</p><p id="P25">Several pathways were suppressed in productive MDMs, including some which are associated with immune signaling and some which are associated with common functions of macrophages, such as antigen presentation and phagocytosis. Furthermore, genes related to hematopoietic cell lineage were also suppressed in productive MDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). We further performed RNA-seq on infected BAL cells, enriched for macrophages, and sorted into GFP-bright and GFP-dim as well as on mock-infected cells. We show that indeed similar pathways related to immune signaling as well as macrophage identity and function are significantly suppressed in productively infected BAL macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). In the non-productively infected cells the most noticeable changes, as in MDMs is strong induction of ISGs.</p><p id="P26">Since transcriptional signatures pointed to disruption of macrophage identity and function in productively infected MDMs, we next examined the surface levels of CD11b, a prominent macrophage marker, in MDMs induced by either PMA or M-CSF, and found reduced surface levels in productively infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>). Analysis of phagocytosis was done in M-CSF-induced MDMs, which regardless of infection exhibited more robust phagocytosis than PMA-induced MDMs, and revealed dramatically reduced phagocytosis activity in productively infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>).

For the productive MDMs we binned the cells according to % viral reads to reflect progression along infection. In order to look at dynamic expression of viral genes, we calculated the relative expression pattern, out of total viral reads in a given bin. This was followed by hierarchical clustering, revealing a temporal expression cascade in productive MDMs that is similar to that seen in infection of fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>, left heatmap). It is important to note that this analysis reflects relative expression patterns, i.e. how each viral gene is expressed relative to all other viral genes. At the absolute level, almost all viral genes increase as infection progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). We next examined gene expression in the non-productive cells. We noticed that despite viral transcript levels being low throughout infection, intriguingly, they seem to increase with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>), and this relative increase in viral gene expression was not observed in infected monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>). Although we computationally monitor and subtract reads that can originate from low level cross contamination between cells (by subtracting the background signal we capture from empty wells, see methods section), we wanted to exclude the possibility that this apparent increase in viral reads originates from low levels of cross contamination from the productive cells that were processed simultaneously with the non-productive MDMs and at late time points express extremely high levels of viral transcripts. To address this issue and to validate that the increase in viral reads is authentic, we conducted another experiment in which at 72 and 144 hpi only GFP-dim cells were processed separately allowing us to avoid productive cells and potential cross-contamination. This more stringent analysis further demonstrated a small increase in viral transcript levels along time post infection in non-productive MDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 7c</xref>). We also examined if there are changes in viral gene expression in non-productive cells along infection. Besides UL123,which similarly to productive MDMs, was detected mainly at an early time point, we observed broad gene expression with no clear kinetic program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>, right heatmap). Overall, these results indicate that non-productive MDMs express diverse viral transcripts and compared to monocytes are more permissive for maintaining low levels of viral gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Non-productive MDMs can reactivate and release infectious virus</title><p id="P28">The observation that viral gene expression is maintained at higher levels in non-productive macrophages compared to monocytes, indicates a less repressed state in the former.

We therefore reasoned that non-productive MDMs could also potentially undergo reactivation. To explore this possibility, we infected both PMA and M-CSF induced MDMs, sorted the GFP-dim cells at 4 dpi, and at 7 dpi added either PMA or LPS as triggers for reactivation. We did not observe any reactivation without additional stimuli, attesting that our sorting indeed singled out only non-productive MDMs. However, both treatments resulted in reactivation events, forming GFP-positive plaques when co-cultured with fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 7d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7e</xref>), illustrating that upon a stimuli, HCMV has the potential to reactivate from non-productive MDMs.</p><p id="P29">The complete elimination of productive cells following pre-treatment with IFN, brings up a question whether cells that are exposed to IFN prior to encountering the virus, are not infected, abortively infected or infected in similar manner to the non-productive MDMs we have characterized here, in which case they can later on reactivate. To test whether the last scenario is occurring, we infected IFN pre-treated MDMs with HCMV, and tested their ability to reactivate. As mentioned above, no productively infected cells could be detected following IFN pre-treatment, and at 7 dpi PMA was added as a trigger of reactivation. While there was mostly no reactivation without additional stimuli, indicating that infection in MDMs pre-treated with IFNs was indeed mostly non-productive, few reactivation events did occur, in line with previous findings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, and PMA led to more robust reactivation of the virus accompanied by release of infectious progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 7f</xref>).</p><p id="P30">These results show that at least in these culture models, MDMs can be infected in a latent-like infection, in which viral gene expression is repressed, but the viral genome retains the ability to reactivate upon an additional stimulation.

Non-productive infection can potentially mean latent infection, if the viral genome is maintained and retains the ability to reactivate and complete productive infection. In order to delineate, in an unbiased manner, the determinants contributing to HCMV infection outcome, we comprehensively analyzed, by scRNA-seq, the progression of HCMV infection in monocytes and macrophages, which are considered to support latent and lytic infection, respectively.</p><p id="P32">In monocytes we found very low levels of viral transcripts in all cells, throughout the infection time course assayed, as was previously reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Interestingly, infection of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) resulted in both productive and non-productive infections. This was reflected in two distinct populations that differed in the levels of the viral-derived GFP expression, viral DNA replication and production of infectious progeny. Notably, MDMs exhibiting low virus-derived GFP levels harbored viral DNA indicating that they are not bystander cells and that they were infected. By applying scRNA-seq in a dense time course along infection we characterize these two distinct populations, showing low and high viral transcript loads. Productive cells exhibited a clear temporal viral gene expression cascade which resembles the kinetic viral gene expression in infected fibroblasts. In non-productive cells we detected low-level, broad viral gene expression, as has been reported previously for latent infection of monocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Importantly, no clear distinct populations could be detected at early times of infection, indicating there were no major differences prior to infection within the MDM population that can readily explain the different outcomes.</p><p id="P33">We found that the unequivocal factor associated with the earliest split of productive cells is viral gene expression and specifically the expression of immediate early genes and the onset of early gene expression. Our analysis revealed that the two immediate early genes, UL123 (IE1) and UL122 (IE2), are distinctly expressed at the split of productive and non-productive cells. Previously, ectopic expression of these genes in THP1 cells was shown to be insufficient to induce productive infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, which was explained by additional barriers. We show that overexpression of UL123 or UL122 but not a late viral gene, in THP1-derived macrophages results in much more cells being productively infected. The notable difference between the reports are the use of THP1 monocytic cells versus the use of differentiated THP1 cells. This suggests that in THP1-derived macrophages, these additional barriers are lower, allowing to reveal that sufficient expression of the IE genes is a major threshold for the establishment of productive infection. In addition, our findings imply that what defines the critical threshold of IE genes is their capacity to induce early genes. This possibly points to the ability to commence substantial viral DNA replication as the genuine step that determines infection outcome. The lack of a clear cellular gene expression signature that is associated with the initial increase in viral gene expression levels, indicates that in this experimental set-up, infection outcome is not dictated by variations in the cellular transcriptome and is likely mostly determined by the amount of infectious virus entering the cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, which will have significant consequences on the initial induction of viral gene transcription or possibly by variability between virion particles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">The defining signature of non-productive MDMs is the expression of ISGs. A similar feature was also shown in HSV-1 infected cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Examination of viral transcript levels and expression levels of ISGs on a single cell level, generally showed that cells either elevate viral genes or elevate ISGs, thus seemingly defining two mutually exclusive scenarios. However, detailed examination of the trajectories along infection in both MDMs and fibroblasts strongly points out that productive infection can be established in cells that initially induced ISGs, which means that they may go through a stage of induction of ISGs and low viral transcript levels, before becoming productively infected. This illustrates that the induction of ISGs following infection does not deterministically define infection outcome, although it may account for delayed induction of viral gene expression. Indeed, addition of interferons to MDMs or fibroblasts immediately following infection did not affect the proportion of cells succumbing to productive infection.</p><p id="P35">On the other hand, we demonstrate that intrinsic expression levels of ISGs, independently of infection, influence infection outcome. Intrinsic levels of ISGs negatively correlate with permissiveness of cells to productive infection when comparing monocytes, MDMs and fibroblasts. Furthermore, differentiation of monocytes to macrophages as well along the hematopoietic lineage which are known to be associated with permissiveness to HCMV productive infection, is also associated with a decrease in intrinsic levels of ISGs. A connection between intrinsic expression of ISGs and differentiation was noted previously by Wu et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> and intrinsic expression of select ISGs was shown to be functionally relevant in resistance of embryonic stem cells to infection by several RNA viruses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that this link between intrinsic expression of ISGs and differentiation, could be a major contributing factor to the cell-type dependent infection outcome of HCMV and potentially other herpesviruses.</p><p id="P36">Beyond explaining cell type differences, this effect of intrinsic levels of ISGs could be relevant to the establishment of latency. Notably, we show that interferon treatment prior to infection of both fibroblasts and MDMs almost completely abrogated productive infection. We further show that this treatment completely blocks viral DNA replication and acts at early stages of infection. These results support the notion that the levels of certain ISGs, at the time of infection, act to repress viral gene expression thus preventing productive infection. Similar findings were previously provided for murine CMV infection of fibroblasts and endothelial, where it was further shown that IFN-mediated silencing of the CMV genome is reversible <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. This effect of IFNs may have implications for infection in an <italic>in-vivo</italic> setting in which a substantial fraction of cells are not infected. In that case, the induction of IFNs by infected cells would affect neighboring uninfected cells by inducing ISG expression and subsequently shifting their fate towards non-productive infection, potentially aiding the virus to seed latent reservoirs, and perhaps also prolonging infection in case of reversion of silencing. Indeed we show that IFN pre-treated MDMs, which are infected non-productively, are able, upon stimulation, to reactivate, demonstrating that IFN exposure may lead to a latent-like infection in MDMs. Future work will be needed to delineate which of the ISGs contribute to blocking productive infection, and whether they are a central determinant in dictating cell-type dependent differences in permissiveness to productive infection and potentially establishment of latency.</p><p id="P37">Reactivation of HCMV from latency is a substantial clinical burden in immunocompromised individuals and may cause serious and often life-threatening disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.

For many years tissue resident macrophages were considered to be short lived and be replenished regularly by circulating monocytes.

Our analysis demonstrates that macrophages can be non-productively infected, they can be viable for weeks in culture, carry viral genomes and harbor low levels of viral transcripts.

Interestingly, HCMV reactivation was demonstrated in alveolar macrophages from healthy HCMV carriers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Another support for the idea that macrophages may serve as a latent HCMV tissue reservoir comes from an observation made 25 year ago that macrophages carry latent MCMV following clearance of an acute infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P38">Macrophages are found in most tissues and are the first responders to microbial invasion, thus are an important component of the immune system.
