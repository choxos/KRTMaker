This small genome is crucial for proper functioning of mitochondria, the energy-converting organelles. In mammals, mtDNA is arranged into macromolecular complexes called nucleoids that serve as functional stations for its maintenance and expression. Here, we aimed to explore an uncharacterized protein c17orf80, which was previously detected close to the nucleoid components by proximity-labelling mass spectrometry. To investigate the subcellular localization and function of c17orf80, we took an advantage of immunofluorescence microscopy, interaction proteomics and several biochemical assays. We demonstrate that c17orf80 is a mitochondrial membrane-associated protein that interacts with nucleoids even when mtDNA replication is inhibited. In addition, we show that c17orf80 is not essential for mtDNA maintenance and mitochondrial gene expression in cultured human cells. These results provide a basis for uncovering the molecular function of c17orf80 and the nature of its association with nucleoids, possibly leading to new insights about mtDNA and its expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>c17orf80</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>mtDNA</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial nucleoid</kwd><kwd>2',3'-dideoxycytidine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Mitochondria are eukaryotic organelles responsible for aerobic metabolism and involved in regulation of the majority of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</xref>). These organelles contain DNA molecules, i.e. mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), that despite being small, are critical for energy conversion as they encode several subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes, as well as mitochondrial ribosomal and transfer RNAs. In a human mitochondrion, mtDNA exists in multiple circular copies organized in nucleic acid-protein complexes termed nucleoids, which individually resemble bacterial chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Lee and Han, 2017</xref>). The main structural protein component of nucleoids is the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which fully coats mtDNA to tightly pack it into ellipsoid nanometric structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Kukat et al., 2015</xref>). A variety of proteins associate with mtDNA to mediate its replication, repair, transcription, and distribution within the mitochondrial network. Such interactors involve, among others, core replication and transcription factors, namely DNA polymerase gamma (POLy), mitochondrial single-strand binding protein (mtSSB), mitochondrial replicative helicase Twinkle, and mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT). While in the last decades the major components of nucleoids have been described, new proteins with functional roles in mtDNA-related processes are still regularly unveiled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hensen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P3">In a previous study, we investigated the proximal interactome of Twinkle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hensen et al., 2019</xref>), a core nucleoid protein. Along with the well-known nucleoid-associated proteins involved in mtDNA replication and transcription, we detected an uncharacterized protein, annotated as c17orf80, in close vicinity to Twinkle. Other groups have also identified this protein while investigating interactors of mtDNA-binding proteins via proximity-labelling proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Antonicka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hangas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). The close spatial proximity of this unknown protein to mtDNA replication and transcription apparatuses prompted us to investigate c17orf80 in more detail.</p><p id="P4">To date, there is no information regarding the molecular function(s) of c17orf80, and clinically significant data are very limited. However, some genetic association studies linked c17orf80 to autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Laird and Maertens, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Mencer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Shaath, 2013</xref>) as well as pancreatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Makler and Narayanan, 2017</xref>) and prostate cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>). Many orphan proteins detected in genetic screens remain uncharacterized, as their molecular functions have not yet been investigated and are generally difficult to predict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Kustatscher et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Here, we used several strategies to further investigate and validate the interaction between c17orf80 and mitochondrial nucleoids. As an initial step in exploring the molecular function of c17orf80, we analysed the effect of its depletion on mtDNA maintenance and mitochondrial gene expression in cultured human cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>C17orf80 is a vertebrate protein with two transmembrane helices and a ZnF motif</title><p id="P6">The human c17orf80 gene (chromosome 17 open reading frame 80) is located on locus 17q25.1 and is predicted to produce three splice variants annotated in UniProt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). According to Human Protein Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>), c17orf80 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues, with the highest levels detected in the testes during spermatogenesis. The designated canonical c17orf80 isoform consists of 609 residues and has a theoretical molecular mass of 67 kDa. According to AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) and Phyre2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>), most of the c17orf80 polypeptide lacks a well-defined secondary structure, except for the N- and C-termini (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), suggesting it to be an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">van der Lee et al., 2014</xref>), as also predicted by the disorder prediction algorithm IUPRED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dosztányi et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Nevertheless, the remote homology detection server HHPred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>) predicted that the N-terminus of c17orf80 is homologous to a zinc finger motif (ZnF, <italic>E</italic> = 0.1), and the C-terminus to subunit f of the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase (ATP5MF, <italic>E</italic> = 2.6E-15) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1</xref>). The ZnF of c17orf80 has an arrangement of Cys-X2-Cys-X9-His-X3-Cys and belongs to the CCHC type typically involved in the binding of DNA or other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bijlmakers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Kim and Hudson, 1992</xref>). Because the ZnF spans only ∼20 amino acids, the <italic>E</italic> value is relatively high; however, the cysteine and histidine residues as well as some other residues of that region are well conserved among the c17orf80 orthologs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C and 1D</xref>). The homology with the ATP synthase subunit f covers almost that complete protein, including its two transmembrane (TM) helices that correspond to the helices predicted in c17orf80 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1</xref>). Note that both the N- and C-termini of the ATP synthase subunit f are located in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gu et al., 2019</xref>). If this topology is preserved in c17orf80, this suggests that it associates with the inner mitochondrial membrane with most of its polypeptide in the matrix.</p><p id="P7">To determine the evolutionary origin of the c17orf80 orthologous group, we used JackHMMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>) to detect homologs that contain both the N-terminal zinc finger and the C-terminal domain that is homologous to the ATP synthase subunit f. The most distantly related to humans species in which we detected full-length homologs of c17orf80 are cartilaginous fish, such as sharks (e.g. AOA4W3JPRO_CALMI in the Ghost shark). This makes c17orf80, relative to other mitochondrial proteins, a young gene that arose about 450 million years ago, early in the evolution of vertebrates after branching off from jawless vertebrates like Lampreys (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>C17orf80 locates in mitochondria and associates with the inner membrane</title><p id="P8">C17orf80 was identified in BioID screens as a potential interactor of mitochondrial nucleoid-associated proteins. According to the DeepMito (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Savojardo et al., 2019</xref>) and Mitofates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Fukasawa et al., 2015</xref>) prediction algorithms, c17orf80 has a low prediction score of localizing to mitochondria or for containing an N-terminal mitochondrial pre-sequence (0.17 and 0.045 for DeepMito and Mitofates, respectively). However, c17orf80 may contain an internal matrix-targeting sequence, as predicted by the iMTS-L algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Schneider et al., 2021</xref>), with a propensity score of 3.91. C17orf80 is not annotated in MitoCarta 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Rath et al., 2021</xref>), a list of proteins with strong evidence of mitochondrial localization. This protein is nonetheless classified as “likely associated with mitochondria” in the Integrated Mitochondrial Protein Index (IMPI) collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Smith and Robinson, 2018</xref>). The latter is consistent with several proteomics studies of subcellular fractions, showing that c17orf80 localizes in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Antonicka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Morgenstern et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To confirm that c17orf80 locates in mitochondria, we used immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy. We detected co-immunofluorescence of c17orf80, mtDNA, and a mitochondrial marker cyclophilin D (CypD) or a nucleoid marker TFAM in human osteosarcoma cells (U2OS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We observed that the majority of the c17orf80 IF signal overlapped with the mitochondrial network, showing both uniform and punctate patterns. We quantified the colocalization using Manders coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Manders et al., 1993</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The Manders coefficient M1 calculated for c17orf80:CypD indicated that most of the c17orf80 IF signal colocalized with the mitochondrial network, while Manders coefficients M1 calculated for TFAM:c17orf80 and mtDNA:c17orf80 indicated that most of the nucleoids colocalized with c17orf80. In turn, Manders coefficients M2 for c17orf80:CypD, TFAM:c17orf80 and mtDNA:c17orf80 pairs indicated that only half of the c17orf80 signal colocalized with mitochondria or nucleoids. The M1 and M2 coefficients for mtDNA:CypD and mtDNA:TFAM pairs demonstrated the expected localization of mtDNA in the mitochondrial network and the exact colocalization of mtDNA and TFAM. These data confirmed that the majority of the cellular c17orf80 locates within the mitochondrial network.</p><p id="P10">Additional IF signal obtained with the c17orf80 antibody was observed in the cytoplasm. To check whether this signal relates to c17orf80, we validated the specificity of the antibody using siRNA-mediated depletion and found that only the mitochondria-derived signal was specific to c17orf80 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To further define the sub-mitochondrial localization of c17orf80, we treated fixed U2OS cells with either digitonin or a combination of digitonin and Triton X-100. The cells were then probed with antibodies against an outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) protein TOM20, a matrix protein MRPL12, as well as DNA and c17orf80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The added amount of digitonin permeabilizes the plasma membrane and OMM while keeping the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) mostly intact. Consequently, this condition enables TOM20 to be detected by IF, but not MRPL12 or mtDNA. The addition of Triton X-100 disrupts both the OMM and IMM, thus making the IMM and matrix accessible for antibodies. Under these conditions, TOM20, MRPL12 and mtDNA can be detected. In this assay, the IF signal of c17orf80 was only detected in the cells treated with both detergents. Considering that the epitope for the c17orf80 antibody is located at the N-terminal part of the protein (35-261 aa), this result suggests that at least this region of c17orf80 resides in the internal mitochondrial compartments.</p><p id="P12">Since c17orf80 was predicted to contain C-terminal TM helices, we sought to determine whether the protein is membrane-associated. For this, we subjected intact mitochondria isolated from HEK293 cells to sodium carbonate alkaline extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Fujiki et al., 1982a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fujiki et al., 1982b</xref>). This method allows the separation of integral membrane proteins from peripheral and soluble ones. In this experiment, the majority of c17orf80 was found in the pellet fraction. However, a visible portion of the protein also appeared in the soluble fraction and the distribution of c17orf80 between pellet and supernatant varied between the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This result agrees with the structural prediction of c17orf80 containing TM helices, nevertheless indicating that it is not an integral membrane protein.</p><p id="P13">Taken together, the results of the colocalization analysis and IF antibody accessibility test combined with alkaline extraction indicated that c17orf80 is a mitochondrial protein that is located in the mitochondrial matrix and associates with the inner mitochondrial membrane.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>C17orf80 colocalizes with mtDNA</title><p id="P14">As the previous c17orf80 BioID interaction data suggested a link between c17orf80 and mtDNA or mitochondrial gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hensen et al., 2019</xref>), we sought to determine whether c17orf80 associates with mitochondrial nucleoids or RNA granules, the RNA-processing structures that are often found adjacent to nucleoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antonicka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Jourdain et al., 2013</xref>). For this, we performed co-immunofluorescence experiments labelling nucleoids with antibodies against TFAM and/or DNA, and RNA granules with antibodies against 5-bromouridine (BrU) following BrU labelling. Because of variability in intensity and background of c17orf80 IF, we opted for qualitative colocalization studies using chemical treatments that affect mtDNA quantity and nucleoid morphology.</p><p id="P15">First, we investigated whether c17orf80 colocalizes with mitochondrial nucleoids or RNA granules under regular culturing conditions. To this end, we co-labelled U2OS cells with c17orf80, TFAM and DNA antibodies. We observed that c17orf80 formed foci that overlapped with mtDNA and TFAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The RNA granules that appeared after 20 min of BrU labelling partially overlapped with nucleoids or were located next to them; expectedly, not all of the mtDNA spots had an adjacent RNA granule. We observed that c17orf80 preferentially colocalized with nucleoids but not with RNA granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To examine whether c17orf80 foci were dependent on presence of mtDNA, we depleted mtDNA by treating cells with 2’-3’-dideoxycytidine (ddC) for two or four days. After depletion, the cells were colabelled with c17orf80, TFAM, and DNA antibodies. After two days of ddC treatment, partial depletion of mtDNA was observed, while c17orf80 was still detected in foci overlapping with nucleoids. Moreover, the c17orf80 IF signal visibly increased, whereas the signal of TFAM was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). After four days of ddC treatment, c17orf80 was still found in foci overlapping with the remaining nucleoids, although most of its signal was uniformly distributed along the mitochondrial network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p><p id="P17">As we observed c17orf80 to remain in nucleoids after mtDNA depletion with ddC, we tested whether the same was true when depleting mtDNA with ethidium bromide (EtBr). While ddC primarily affects mitochondrial gene expression by blocking mtDNA elongation thus resulting in mtDNA-loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Nelson et al., 1997</xref>), EtBr intercalates into mtDNA and actively hampers both replication and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Coppey-Moisan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hayakawa et al., 1998</xref>). We treated cells with a moderate concentration of EtBr for three days, which induced not only mtDNA depletion, but also frequent clustering of nucleoids, a phenomenon described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alán et al., 2016</xref>). Accumulation of c17orf80 was observed in the clustered nucleoids along with TFAM. The remaining nucleoids, with normal morphology, also contained c17orf80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). In parallel, we also detected the mitochondrial network with CypD to confirm that the clustered nucleoids are not just individual fragmented mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>).</p><p id="P18">These data indicate that c17orf80 not only interacts with the nucleoids under regular conditions, but also remains associated after treatment with mtDNA replication inhibitors ddC and EtBr.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>C17orf80 accumulates in nucleoids upon a short treatment with ddC</title><p id="P19">In our ddC treatment experiment, we observed that c17orf80 foci appeared brighter after two days of the treatment. At the same time, IF signals of TFAM and DNA were expectedly lower in ddC-treated cells whereas nucleoid morphology seemed unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We calculated an average particle size and intensity levels (represented by object mean grey intensity) of the c17orf80, TFAM, and mtDNA spots using the ImageJ software. We found that while the size of TFAM and mtDNA spots decreased by 1.5- and 3-fold, respectively, after ddC treatment, the size of c17orf80 spots increased by 35% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). The calculated intensity change was very small for all three channels. However, the intensity of c17orf80 was significantly higher (by 11%) after ddC treatment, in contrast to a slight decrease for mtDNA and TFAM. Additional IF images demonstrating changes in c17orf80 IF upon ddC treatment are provided in high-resolution as supplementary data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Data 1</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To further examine if changes in c17orf80 localization could result from stress situations or mitochondrial translation blockage, cells were exposed to either H2O2 or UV light, and incubated with chloramphenicol, respectively (data not shown). We did not detect a similar change in c17orf80 IF signals as aforementioned, which suggests that its accumulation in nucleoids upon ddC treatment is a response to mtDNA replication/depletion stress and not to oxidative stress, mtDNA damage or translation inhibition.</p><p id="P21">As we thought that the increase in c17orf80 IF after ddC treatment could reflect its molecular function, we decided to explore whether any other nucleoid components behave similarly. Thus, we detected IF of TFAM, mtSSB, Twinkle, and POLRMT in control and ddC-treated cells; in addition, we tested the effect of ddC treatment on RNA granules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4</xref>). We observed that upon ddC treatment: a) the TFAM signal was reduced; b) the signal of mtSSB, a marker of active mtDNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Rajala et al., 2014</xref>), was reduced and its punctate pattern became dispersed; c) Twinkle remained unchanged; d) the POLRMT signal was reduced and generally uniform even in control cells. The RNA granule formation was inhibited after two days of ddC treatment, but some uniform BrU staining was still observed, suggesting that mitochondrial transcription is not fully suppressed. It should be noted that we tested only proteins for which we had IF-compatible antibodies. Nevertheless, these results indicate that a short treatment with ddC does not induce a sudden enrichment of mitochondrial transcription and replication factors in nucleoids. Thus, the nature of c17orf80 concentration in the remaining nucleoids remains elusive, but our findings suggest a high affinity of this protein for mtDNA or nucleoid protein components.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>C17orf80 interacts with mitochondrial replication and gene expression factors</title><p id="P22">In a study of the mitochondrial protein interactome performed by Antonicka et al.

The authors also used c17orf80 as bait but the resulting hit list did not contain the above-mentioned proteins. In contrast, it mostly consisted of membrane-bound and membrane-associated proteins.</p><p id="P23">Here, we set out to investigate the protein interactors of c17orf80 in more detail, and performed a BioID assay using the Flp-In™ T-Rex™ cell system, allowing for stable and inducible expression of c17orf80 fused with BirA* (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Roux et al., 2012</xref>) added to either the N- or C-terminus. Prior to the experiment, we confirmed that both N- and C-terminally tagged fusions of c17orf80-BirA* were localized to mitochondria. To this end, we used transient transfection of the fusion proteins in U2OS cells followed by IF detection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S6</xref>). As a negative control for BioID pulldowns, we used the same cells cultured without addition of the inducing agent (anhydrotetracycline, AnTET).</p><p id="P24">We performed BioID pulldowns in quadruplicate using concentrations of AnTET optimized for each cell line individually. Cells were induced or not with AnTET and simultaneously supplemented with biotin to allow for biotinylation of all preys that c17orf80-BirA* fusions interact with after being synthesized in the cytoplasm. Biotinylated proteins were pulled down from total cell lysates with streptavidin-coated agarose beads, trypsin-digested on the beads, and analysed by mass spectrometry.</p><p id="P25">We first analysed which proteins were biotinylated with the N-terminally tagged c17orf80-BirA* fusion by comparing it to the pulldown performed with non-induced cells. The statistically significant differences between protein abundances were determined in the Perseus software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>) using a two-tailed Welch’s t-test with a permutation-based false-discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05 and artificial within-group variance (S0) set to 0.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Tusher et al., 2001</xref>). This analysis revealed 78 potential protein interactors of c17orf80 (hits), of which 40 were annotated in MitoCarta 3.0. At least 15 hits were involved in mtDNA replication or gene expression, with the highest enrichment for the core nucleoid proteins TFAM (12-fold), Twinkle (7-fold), and mtSSB (7-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A, 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl.

We determined that the non-induced control contained an equally large set of proteins as the BioID pulldown. In addition, this control had a higher overall protein abundance than the control for c17orf80-BirA*(N) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Data 1</xref>). It is possible that the amount of c17orf80-BirA*(C) fusion protein produced by leaky expression in non-induced cells was sufficient to biotinylate as many preys as in the induced ones, even though the protein level was 9fold higher upon induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S6A</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Nevertheless, a direct comparison of BioID pulldowns performed with C- and N-terminally tagged c17orf80-BirA* fusions showed distinct protein identifications. The C-term BioID pulldown was more enriched for mitochondrial inner membrane proteins, such as subunits of the TIM complex, Complex I, BCKDC, as well as OXAL1 and LETM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B, 6D</xref>). This hit list was similar to that published previously for c17orf80 C-terminal BioID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Antonicka et al., 2020</xref>), with 56 shared hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). In contrast, in the N-term BioID pulldown, we identified a 19-fold enrichment for TFAM and 3-fold enrichment for Twinkle compared to the C-term pulldown.</p><p id="P28">It should be noted that although the c17orf80-BirA*(C) fusion protein was imported into mitochondria, it, in contrast to c17orf80-BirA*(N), did not biotinylate the endogenous c17orf80, as evidenced by the absence of biotinylated c17orf80 after induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S6A</xref>). This might indicate that the C-terminal region of c17orf80 is actually located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and when BirA* is added to the C-terminus, it cannot reach matrix proteins. Nonetheless, there is a possibility that the c17orf80-BirA*(C) fusion protein does not preserve the exact location and function of the endogenous c17orf80. Thus, the results of proximity-labelling with the C-terminally tagged c17orf80-BirA* fusion should be interpreted with caution.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Complexome profiling identifies c17orf80 migrating at high molecular mass</title><p id="P29">Thus far we have shown that c17orf80 colocalizes with mitochondrial nucleoids and is located in close proximity to multiple nucleoid-interacting proteins. To further study these interactions and gain more evidence regarding the potential occurrence of c17orf80 in DNA-/RNA-associated protein complexes, we performed complexome profiling (CP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cabrera-Orefice et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Van Strien et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Wessels et al., 2013</xref>). CP is an unbiased approach that combines the separation of native proteins and protein complexes, typically by gel electrophoresis, with quantitative tandem MS identification of individual fractions followed by data clustering. Individual signals from components of protein complexes typically co-fractionate, hence showing similar intensity patterns across gel fractions. In contrast to BioID, CP does not require genetically engineered fusion proteins and therefore avoids possible interference of tags with protein structure, interactions and function. For this CP experiment, we used highly pure mitochondria that were freshly isolated from two clones of c17orf80 knockout generated by CRISPR-Cas9 in HEK293 cells (KO), parental HEK293 cells, and parental cells treated with ddC for two or three days.</p><p id="P30">In the resulting CP dataset, 4326 proteins were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl. Data 3</xref>), of which ca. 1000 have evidence of being mitochondrial, as annotated in MitoCarta 3.0. Despite its low abundance and challenging MS detection, c17orf80 was identified (q-value: 0, score: 46.091) with 19 peptides. However, ten peptides were also detected in the KO samples. Our KO cell lines were verified to contain frameshift mutations, leading to the loss of the start codon in the third exon of c17orf80. The absence of c17orf80 protein was confirmed by Western blotting. Thus, the remaining c17orf80 peptides identified in KO samples were considered as false positives and omitted with subsequent recalculation of iBAQ values for c17orf80 based on the remaining nine identified peptides.</p><p id="P31">The signal of c17orf80 was mostly found in the high molecular mass range (&gt;1 MDa) in two defined fractions at ∼1.3 MDa and ∼2.5-3.7 MDa. To identify potential protein interactors, we inspected the CP dataset at the position where c17orf80 was clustered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). Only proteins annotated in MitoCarta 3.0 were considered for this analysis. The abundance profile of c17orf80 clustered with those of a large number of proteins including RNA-binding proteins, such as mitochondrial RNA polymerases and RNA-modifying enzymes, mitoribosome-binding proteins, the large mitoribosomal subunit, as well as chaperones, proteins involved in lipid metabolism (e.g., ATAD3A), and diverse oligomeric enzymes. In addition, a portion of the replication factors TFAM and Twinkle also migrated in the same mass range, although they did not automatically cluster together with the above-mentioned proteins. This result indicates that c17orf80 exists in a high molecular mass complex with other proteins and/or nucleic acids.</p><p id="P32">In addition to control cells and c17orf80 KO, we analysed ddC-treated samples to determine whether the c17orf80 migration profiles change under these conditions. To evaluate the effect of ddC treatment on mitochondria, we first measured the relative mtDNA copy number and found it to decrease to 36% and 15% of the control levels after 48 h and 72 h of treatment, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S7A</xref>). Based on the CP data, mtDNA-encoded subunits of the OXPHOS complexes were still present at least at 40% of the control level at both time points, indicating that this residual mtDNA was sufficient to maintain gene expression active (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S7B</xref>). We quantified changes in protein abundance and migration using the Hausdorff effect size (<italic>Hes</italic>) between controls and ddC-treated samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hausdorff, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Moeckel and Murray, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Van Strien et al., 2019</xref>). In total, 421 mitochondrial proteins had different abundance profiles in ddC-treated samples based on <italic>Hes</italic> &gt; 2.0 cutoff. The most pronounced decrease was detected for the supercomplex containing OXPHOS complexes I, III and IV. Besides, we observed elevated levels of many proteins involved in mitochondrial gene expression and membrane architecture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Data 2</xref>). The abundance of c17orf80 was also higher in ddC-treated samples (<italic>Hes</italic> = 1.85, 2- and 3-fold increase after 48 h and 72 h, respectively).</p><p id="P33">Among all the clustered proteins, we found that the protein DNAJA3 showed the most similar migration profile to c17orf80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Furthermore, the signal of DNAJA3 in c17orf80 KO cells was lower than in controls, whereas it was increased in ddC-treated samples like similarly to c17orf80. The abundances of DNAJA3 and c17orf80 were relatively similar in control cells, as indicated by their maximal iBAQ values of 2.6-10<sup>6</sup> and 4.4-10<sup>6</sup>, respectively. DNAJA3 belongs to the DNAJ/Hsp40 family and acts as a co-chaperone of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Iosefson et al., 2012</xref>). However, the co-migration of DNAJA3 and Hsp70 was not observed in our CP dataset. Notably, we also identified DNAJA3 in our c17orf80 BioID experiment as a potential interactor. Moreover, DNAJA3 was previously found to be associated with mitochondrial nucleoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">He et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Lu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Rajala et al., 2015</xref>). Altogether, our BioID and CP results suggested an interaction between c17orf80 and DNAJA3.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>C17orf80 is not strictly required for mitochondrial gene expression in cultured cells</title><p id="P34">As we demonstrated that a substantial portion of c17orf80 resides in mitochondrial nucleoids, we aimed to investigate possible effects of its loss on mtDNA maintenance and gene expression. To this end, we knocked out c17orf80 in HEK293 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 system. We generated two single-cell clones of c17orf80 knockout (KO-1 and KO-2) and compared them with the parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>).</p><p id="P35">First, we measured the relative mtDNA copy number in c17orf80 KO cells using real-time PCR (quantitative PCR, qPCR). We found that both clones had a moderate reduction in mtDNA content (a 20-30% decrease compared to parental control), which however was statistically significant only for one of the clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8C</xref>). Since metabolic compensation might occur in knockout cells masking an mtDNA phenotype, we also checked whether the mtDNA content was affected by a short-term depletion of c17orf80. For this, we transfected U2OS cells with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting c17ofr80 or with a negative siRNA control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>) and measured the relative mtDNA copy number in ten independent biological replicates of knockdown and control. We found no change in mtDNA content after three days of c17orf80 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8D</xref>), suggesting that c17orf80 is not directly involved in mtDNA copy number regulation.</p><p id="P36">Next, we investigated whether the lack of c17orf80 caused any mtDNA maintenance perturbations. We examined mtDNA replication intermediates in c17orf80 KO cells and parental control cells using 2D DNA agarose electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8E</xref>). We observed a slight decrease of the slow-moving replication forks (y-arcs), containing intermediates of the RITOLS mtDNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Pohjoismaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Yasukawa et al., 2006</xref>), in both c17orf80 KO clones. There was no mtDNA replication stalling in response to c17orf80 absence. We also measured levels of 7S DNA using Southern blotting and found no difference between c17orf80 KO and parental control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S8A</xref>). In addition, we analysed the topology of mtDNA using Southern blotting. We observed that KO cells exhibited a minor but significant increase in oligomeric and open circle forms of mtDNA accompanied by a slight decrease in supercoiled species and replicating mtDNA molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S8B</xref>). Overall, the changes in mtDNA replication mode and topology were minor and require further validation.</p><p id="P37">Furthermore, we assessed the morphology of mitochondria and nucleoids using immunofluorescence microscopy and found no visible changes upon c17orf80 silencing in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S9</xref>).</p><p id="P38">Since we previously observed an accumulation of c17orf80 in nucleoids upon ddC treatment, we decided to test the effect of ddC exposure on mtDNA depletion and the efficiency of mtDNA recovery after its removal in KO and control cells. We measured the relative mtDNA copy number every 24 h throughout the three days of ddC treatment and the three days after its removal. We did not observe any substantial changes in the rates of mtDNA depletion and recovery between control and c17orf80 KO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. 8F</xref>).</p><p id="P39">Due to its association with mtDNA and mitochondrial gene expression factors, we tested whether the lack of c17orf80 affects the function of the OXPHOS system. To this end, we analysed the mitochondrial respiration in c17orf80 KO cells. We measured the oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) in freshly harvested intact cells using an Oroboros™ Oxygraph-2k. We found no difference in the OCRs of the routine, leak, and maximal respiration states between c17orf80 KO and control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8G</xref>).</p><p id="P40">To determine whether c17orf80 KO cells carry any defects in mitochondrial protein complexes architecture, we used our CP data of c17orf80 KO for detailed examination of OXPHOS, mitoribosome and other proteins. As expected, KO cells showed no sign of OXPHOS changes as the subunits of all four complexes containing mtDNA-encoded subunits, i.e. complexes I, Ill, IV and F1FO-ATP synthase (CV), and their respective supercomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Signes and Fernandez-Vizarra, 2018</xref>) were properly assembled in amounts comparable to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8H</xref>). No changes were observed for the mitoribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8I</xref>). This suggests that c17orf80 does not relate to biogenesis of OXPHOS complexes and its absence does not dramatically affect the expression level of mitochondrial transcripts. In addition, we quantified changes in the protein abundance profiles between control and KO using the Hausdorff effect size for all 4326 identified proteins. We found no systematic changes between the complexomes of c17orf80 KO and control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl.

Proper execution of the mitochondrial gene expression system is essential for a healthy energy metabolism. In this study, we investigated an uncharacterized protein c17orf80, which was previously captured by mitochondria-targeted proximity mass spectrometry. Using immunofluorescence microscopy and interaction proteomics, we demonstrated that c17orf80 associates with the mitochondrial nucleoid, a nucleoprotein complex composed of mtDNA and proteins involved in its maintenance, replication and transcription. In addition, we showed that although c17orf80 interacts with the nucleoids, its loss did not lead to a mitochondrial dysfunction in human cells cultured under standard growth conditions.</p><p id="P43">Here, we provide evidence that c17orf80 is a novel nucleoid resident, as evaluated by both immunofluorescence microscopy and BioID analysis. Notably, c17orf80 was detected only in recent proximity-labelling proteomic experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Antonicka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hangas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hensen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>), but was not identified in early IP-based studies or biochemical nucleoid preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bogenhagen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">He et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Rajala et al., 2015</xref>). This probably reflects the fact that biotin-based proximity labelling techniques allow better detection of labile protein interactions that potentially do not withstand standard affinity-purification procedures. Our IF experiments showed that c17orf80 forms a punctate pattern colocalizing with mtDNA, which is a characteristic feature of core nucleoid proteins such as TFAM, Twinkle, and mtSSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Spelbrink, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, c17orf80 retained in nucleoids under replication stress caused by ddC and EtBr, suggesting it has a high affinity to one of the nucleoid components, either mtDNA or a protein. These findings were supported by the BioID proximity-biotinylation experiment that showed that c17orf80 is located in close spatial proximity to mitochondrial replication and gene expression factors.</p><p id="P44">The secondary structure of c17orf80 mostly lacks defined functional motifs, hampering any hypothesis about its molecular function. There is, however, a possible CCHC-type ZnF located on its N-terminus suggesting nucleic-acid binding abilities. C17orf80 may acquire more structural features upon binding to another protein or nucleic acids, as it is often true for intrinsically disordered proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">van der Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Wright and Dyson, 2009</xref>). In various organisms, some proteins with such highly disordered sequences are involved in DNA damage protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hashimoto and Kunieda, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Smith and Graether, 2022</xref>) and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Balasubramanian et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">López et al., 2020</xref>) via direct interaction with DNA.</p><p id="P45">We observed c17orf80 to pellet with the membrane fraction after sodium carbonate extraction, which is consistent with the structural prediction of two TM helices at its C-terminus. Since a portion of c17orf80 was also present in the supernatant, resembling peripheral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), we propose that it peripherally associates with the IMM with the majority of the polypeptide being in the mitochondrial matrix. Based on the results of our antibody-accessibility assay and BioID, we excluded a stable association with the OMM. Additionally, we detected homology of the C-terminus of c17orf80 to the subunit f of the F1F0-ATP synthase (CV). However, we found no experimental support for an interaction of this protein with CV.</p><p id="P46">Interestingly, although the core mtDNA-binding components of nucleoids are soluble replication and transcription factors, nucleoids have been proposed to interact with the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Hillar et al., 1979</xref>), possibly via its peripheral components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bogenhagen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gerhold et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">He et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Kasashima et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, a recent super-resolution microscopy study showed that most of mtDNA colocalizes with a membrane-scaffolding protein ATAD3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Arguello et al., 2021</xref>), supporting this model. In yeast, tethering nucleoids to the inner membrane is essential for mtDNA integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dimmer et al., 2005</xref>). Considering that we did not observe enrichment of ATAD3A in the c17orf80 interactome or any changes in nucleoid morphology or mtDNA depletion upon loss of c17orf80, it is unlikely that this protein is a major player in nucleoid membrane attachment.</p><p id="P47">Previously, the interactome of c17orf80 was investigated by Antonicka et al., using c17orf80 C-terminally tagged with the biotin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Antonicka et al., 2020</xref>). Following the analysis of 100 BioID baits, the authors assigned c17orf80 to a cluster of RNA-processing factors located in mitochondrial RNA granules. It is common to use C-terminal tags for mitochondrial proteins to prevent disruption of the mitochondria-targeting sequence, which is usually located at the N-terminus. However, in the case of c17orf80, we showed that the N-terminal fusion with BirA* was successfully imported into mitochondria and labelled a distinct set of proteins compared to the C-terminal version. Using this approach, we identified TFAM, mtSSB and Twinkle as the c17orf80 interactors, confirming the nucleoid association of c17orf80. We did not identify many RNA granule residents in this experiment and did not detect colocalization of c17orf80 with BrU-labelled RNA-granules by IF. Thus, possible involvement in RNA processing was not investigated here; however, it cannot be excluded with our current evidence.</p><p id="P48">Based on our BioID and complexome profiling results, we suggested an interaction between c17orf80 and DNAJA3 (a.k.a. Tid1), a member of the DNAJ/Hsp40 protein family and co-chaperone of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Syken et al., 1999</xref>). DNAJA3 has been shown to be associated with nucleoids in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">He et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Lu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Rajala et al., 2015</xref>), and its depletion was linked to reduced mtDNA copy number and OXPHOS deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hayashi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Ng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). It was suggested that these effects may be linked to DNAJA3 co-chaperone activity and accumulation of aggregated complex I upon its depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Ng et al., 2014</xref>). The direct involvement of DNAJA3 in mtDNA-related processes is still to be investigated. It is necessary to note that the quantification of both c17orf80 and DNAJA3 by CP was challenging, with relatively low intensity, some misidentified and low-scoring peptides, and dispersed profiles at the high molecular mass range. However, since our CP data are based on four independent profiles, where the levels of the proteins correlate with each other and are supported by the identification of DNAJA3 in c17orf80 BioID, the interaction of these two proteins is plausible and deserves to be investigated in more detail.</p><p id="P49">We observed a prominent accumulation of c17orf80 in nucleoids upon treatment with ddC, a modified cytosine analogue that causes stalling of mtDNA replication via inhibition of PoIy processivity and/or nascent strand termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Brown and Clayton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Nelson et al., 1997</xref>). It is known that the rapid mtDNA depletion induced by ddC is accompanied by complete inhibition of mtDNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Rajala et al., 2014</xref>) and TFAM degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Li et al., 2021</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms of subsequent mtDNA decay and its repair have not been extensively investigated. Several proteins have been proposed to participate in mtDNA repair or restart of mtDNA replication under or after ddC exposure, such as PrimPol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Carvalho et al., 2021</xref>), MGME1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Kornblum et al., 2013</xref>), RAD51C/XRCC3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>), and TDP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). Generally, in the absence of these proteins, cells were unable to recover mtDNA levels after its depletion. In our c17orf80-lacking cells, mtDNA depletion and recovery rates were similar to those in the control, suggesting that the accumulation of c17orf80 in ddC-treated nucleoids is not a sign of its direct involvement in mtDNA repair or replication, at least not in HEK293 cells.</p><p id="P50">In our CP experiment performed with ddC-treated cells, a three days exposure to ddC did not lead to complete depletion of OXPHOS complexes and their mtDNA-encoded subunits, even when the mtDNA level was diminished to 15% of the control after three days. Instead, we observed upregulation of transcription and translation factors, mitoribosomes, and complexes involved in cristae formation (e.g. ATAD3A, MICOS complex) and protein quality control (e.g. ClpX), likely reflecting the general compensatory response to mtDNA depletion. C17orf80 was also elevated in ddC-treated samples, which correlates with our IF experiments demonstrating its enrichment in nucleoids after ddC exposure.</p><p id="P51">Despite its nucleoid localization, c17orf80-deficient cells showed no major signs of mtDNA replication impairment or changes in nucleoid morphology. We also did not detect gene expression defects, as OXPHOS complexes I, III, IV and V were fully assembled and functioning in KO cells.</p><p id="P52">In summary, we identified c17orf80 as a novel membrane-associated resident of mitochondrial nucleoids. It is important to note that it is possible that the molecular function of c17orf80 is not relevant for the type of cells and growth conditions used in this study. In such manner, c17orf80 may be more active only, for instance, under specific stress conditions, such as rapid mtDNA depletion, and may be involved in a molecular process related to mtDNA protection or compensatory gene expression. Further studies are certainly required to define the specific molecular role of c17orf80 in nucleoids from other cell types and tissues, especially under stress caused by mtDNA replication inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Sequence analysis</title><p id="P53">The homology of the C-terminus with the F1FO-ATP synthase subunit f and the low level of overall sequence conservation of c17orf80 hampers large scale automatic orthology detection.

Complex II (ClI) is shown as loading control as it does not contain mtDNA-encoded subunits.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS157562-f008"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Antibodies used for IF detection</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="all"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-c17orf80</td><td align="left" valign="top">Rabbit IgG</td><td align="left" valign="top">Proteintech</td><td align="left" valign="top">27762-1-AP</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-TFAM</td><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse IgG</td><td align="left" valign="top">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="top">ab89818</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-Cyclophilin D</td><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse IgG</td><td align="left" valign="top">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="top">ab110324</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:400</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-BrU</td><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse IgG</td><td align="left" valign="top">Roche</td><td align="left" valign="top">11170376001</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:50</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-DNA</td><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse IgM</td><td align="left" valign="top">Progen</td><td align="left" valign="top">61014</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:100</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-Tom20</td><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse IgG</td><td align="left" valign="top">Santa Cruz</td><td align="left" valign="top">sc17764</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:100</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-MRPL12</td><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse IgG</td><td align="left" valign="top">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="top">ab58334</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:400</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-mtSSB</td><td align="left" valign="top">Rabbit IgG</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma</td><td align="left" valign="top">SAB4502859</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-POLRMT</td><td align="left" valign="top">Rabbit IgG</td><td align="left" valign="top">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="top">ab32988</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:100</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-Twinkle</td><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse IgG</td><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="2">gift from Anu Suomalainen Wartiovaara</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:50</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
