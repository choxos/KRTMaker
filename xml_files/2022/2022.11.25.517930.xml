Treatment of these infections is increasingly frustrated by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) diminishing the number of effective therapies available to clinicians. Incidence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) is not uniform across the phylogenetic spectrum of <italic>E. coli</italic>. Instead AMR is concentrated in select lineages, such as ST131, which are MDR pandemic clones that have spread AMR globally. Using a gnotobiotic mouse model we demonstrate that an MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> ST131 is capable out-competing and displacing non-MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> from the gut <italic>in vivo</italic>. This is achieved in the absence of antibiotic treatment mediating a selective advantage. In mice colonised with non-MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, challenge with MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> either by oral gavage or co-housing with MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> colonized mice results in displacement and dominant intestinal colonization by MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> ST131. To investigate the genetic basis of this superior gut colonization ability by MDR <italic>E. coli</italic>, we used a functional pangenomic analysis of 19,571 <italic>E. coli</italic> genomes revealing that carriage of AMR genes is associated with increased diversity in carbohydrate metabolism genes. The data presented here demonstrate that independent of antibiotic selective pressures, MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> display a competitive advantage to colonise the mammalian gut and points to a vital role of metabolism in the evolution and success of MDR lineages of <italic>E. coli</italic> via carriage and spread.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Infections by multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens now represent one of the greatest global public health challenges of our generation, with the World Health Organisation declaring them of utmost international importance. Chief amongst these pathogens is MDR <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which are responsible for an alarming rise in the incidence of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) blood stream and urinary tract infections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. MDR in <italic>E. coli</italic> is heavily associated with the carriage of large MDR plasmids carrying genes encoding extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) and carbapenemases such as NDM, KPC, and Oxa-48 which confer resistance to 3<sup>rd</sup> generation cephalosporins and carbapenem classes of antibiotics respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Intriguingly such plasmids are very rarely found in intestinal pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> such as <italic>E. coli</italic> O157 or common enteropathogenic and enterotoxigenic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. Rather MDR plasmid carriage is concentrated in a number of lineages responsible for extra-intestinal pathogenesis such as blood stream and urinary tract infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Extra-intestinal pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (ExPEC) is the name given to <italic>E. coli</italic> strains capable of causing extra-intestinal infections, but do not represent a phylogenetically distinct group of organisms. Rather ExPEC are found across the species phylogeny mainly in phylogroups B2, D, and F<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Recent longitudinal surveys of national blood stream infection isolates have shown the most common ExPEC lineages to be ST131, ST73, ST69, ST95, ST410, and members of the ST10 complex including ST167<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Equally as intriguingly, MDR plasmids are not evenly distributed amongst these ExPEC lineages but rather their carriage is concentrated in a small number of highly successful, globally disseminated clones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The most successful of these clones is clade C of ST131, the most common cause of MDR blood stream and urinary tract infections worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Other common MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> lineages include ST69, ST410, ST167, and ST648<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">What makes certain clones or lineages of <italic>E. coli</italic> successful MDR pathogens is an ongoing question. Recent analysis of longitudinal blood stream infection isolates from Norway shows that ST131 strains successfully emerged to be dominant in the absence of MDR plasmid carriage indicating MDR alone is not the driver of their success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Analysis of longitudinal UK isolates shows that MDR alone is not sufficient to drive strains to complete dominance of the epidemiological landscape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Recent evidence suggests an important phenotype that differentiates MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> from other lineages is their ability to rapidly and asymptomatically colonise the intestinal tract of humans. The COMBAT study of 1847 people travelling from the Netherlands to Asia, Africa and South America found that 34% of those travelling acquired an ESBL <italic>E. coli</italic> in their intestinal tract during their journey, with that number increasing to 75% of those travelling to Asia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Of those colonised in the study, 11% were colonised for up to 12 months. A small scale study of University of Birmingham students found that all participants travelling to Asia became colonised by an ESBL <italic>E. coli</italic>, with genomic analysis confirming that this was due to acquisition of a new MDR strain and not the resident commensal <italic>E. coli</italic> becoming MDR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. A recent study of medical personnel travelling to Laos sampled travellers in real time to show that every single person was colonised by an MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> during travel, with colonisation occurring within days after arrival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. A very recent study by our group deploying metagenomic sequencing on the COMBAT study samples showed that when people were colonised by an MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> there was no detectable impact on diversity or composition of the wider gut microbiome as a result of MDR colonisation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Whilst observational studies have yielded hypothesis-generating data suggesting stain-to-strain competition, this has never been directly tested in vivo.</p><p id="P5">Studies investigating genetic determinants differentiating MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> lineages from the rest of the population have also uncovered a number of parallel observations. Studies comparing clade C ST131 to its ancestral population show a collection of adaptive nucleotide substitutions in chromosomal promoter regions associated with the specific plasmid caried by the strain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, a pattern which has also been seen in ST167 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. A high resolution study of ST131 using a pangenome approach to identify allelic variations in genes found a highly elevated number of nucleotide substitutions in genes involved in mammalian colonisation including anaerobic metabolism, iron acquisition, and adhesins. This pattern was not seen in successful non-MDR ExPEC lineages such as ST73 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Such allelic diversity in anaerobic metabolism genes has also been seen in ST167 and ST648 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and it was also shown that recombination of new alleles of <italic>fhu</italic> iron acquisition genes was the key evolutionary event underpinning the emergence the carbapenem resistant B4/H24RxC clone in the ST410 lineage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. We hypothesise that these genetic adaptations may contribute to more effective colonisation of the mammalian gut.</p><p id="P6">Here we use a gnotobiotic mouse model of intestinal colonisation to directly test the hypothesis that MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> can outcompete commensal <italic>E. coli</italic> to establish dominant colonization the intestinal tract <italic>in vivo</italic> in the absence of any antibiotic selection. We demonstrate that an MDR ST131 strain can out-compete a commensal strain to establish intestinal colonization in gnotobiotic mice. Furthermore, when introduced into the gut of mice pre-colonized with commensal <italic>E. coli</italic>, MDR ST131 could displace commensal <italic>E. coli</italic> from the gut to establish dominant colonization. Displacement of the resident commensal strain occurs within 48 hours of cohousing with mice colonized by MDR ST131, with ST131 becoming the dominant strain in all co-housed mice. We also show that colonization with MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> ST131 stimulated a distinct pro-inflammatory cytokine response in the host caecum compared to mice colonized by a commensal strain. We then utilised a curated dataset of 19,571 genomes representing the full phylogenetic and AMR diversity of <italic>E. coli</italic> to identify a significant link between metabolism and carriage of AMR genes. We find that MDR lineages of <italic>E. coli</italic> display an increased nucleotide diversity in genes associated with core energy metabolism and carbohydrate utilisation which may afford competitive advantage for colonizing the mammalian gut compared to commensal <italic>E. coli</italic> strains.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mouse colonisation</title><p id="P7">Mouse colonisation experiments were conducted at the International Microbiome Centre, University of Calgary, Canada.

Mice were inoculated with 10<sup>9</sup> CFU of each strain via oral gavage and bacterial growth was measured by enumeration of CFU from the faeces as well as strain specific qPCR. Under these conditions all strains could individually monocolonise germ free mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3</xref>). Competitive colonization between strains was investigated by orally gavaging GF mice with a 1:1 ratio of 2 strains in combination (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref> for combinations) followed by quantification of each strain in the faeces over the subsequent week.

By day 21 the MDR ExPEC strain accounted for 80.4% of the CFU in the faeces. In contrast, this displacement is not observed when commensal-mice colonised are challenged with the non-MDR ExPEC strain, which results in an equilibrium of 50-50 colonisation of both strains within 4 days and remains equivalently co-colonized at 21 days post-challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B and D</xref>). Conversely, when MDR ExPEC monocolonized mice are challenged with a commensal strain, the commensal is unable to displace the resident MDR ExPEC strain, accounting for 20.4% of the CFU at day 4 and further diminishing to 15.3% at day 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B and E</xref>). These results are not due to changes in commensal colonisation as growth remains stable in the control group throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>).

Within 1 week of co-housing, MDR ExPEC is observed in the faeces of all mice, and in fact becomes the dominant coloniser in all mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>).

Antibiotic resistance genes are concentrated in 5 ExPEC lineages: ST38, ST69, ST131, ST167 and ST648 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Incidence of Beta-lactamase resistance genes is strongly correlated with incidence of resistance genes of any class as a proportion of the lineage (R2=0.935 and P value=4.07e-12).

This setting allows us to specifically look for unique alleles of core genes as those unique alleles then become part of the accessory genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.

Genomic identification of antibiotic resistance genes in our global dataset highlights that AMR is concentrated in a number pandemic lineages. This is most evident when examining the average number of resistance genes per genome; ST167, ST648, ST38 and ST131 all display on average in excess of 7 resistance genes per genome. This result is not driven by many resistance genes within a small sub-population, as ST167, ST648, ST38 and ST131 all have in excess of 80% of their population possessing multiple resistance genes highlighting the success of these lineages. This observation is aligned with numerous other studies which frequently report these populations as major MDR pathogens, confirming previous observations that AMR carriage is not equal across the <italic>E. coli</italic> population with AMR being concentrated in certain lineages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">Successful pandemic clones must transmit from the environment to individuals, or between individuals rapidly in order to spread globally. Here we demonstrate that an MDR ST131 strain can readily colonise new hosts even when those hosts are pre-colonised with commensal <italic>E. coli</italic>. The invading ST131 becomes the dominant colonising strain in mice, both when the invading strain is introduced artificially via oral gavage and when mice are co-housed. It is important to emphasise that this transmission is occurring in the absence of any antibiotic treatment conferring a selective advantage to ST131. Typically it has been required that mice are treated with streptomycin to allow <italic>E. coli</italic> strains to colonise them, however more recent studies, alongside data presented here, indicate that ST131 strains do not require antibiotic treatment in order to competitively colonise mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. In our study the ST131 out-colonises another ExPEC strain of the common ST73 lineage. This implies that ST131 possesses some mechanism by which it can out-compete commensals that is lacking in another highly successful but non-MDR ExPEC lineage ST73. Our observations from mouse colonisation are supported by previous studies which have observed MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> as frequent colonisers of healthy travellers in the absence of antibiotics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Within household transmission has also been observed for ST131 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Studies of healthy individuals who travel to regions where antibiotic resistance is endemic have reported varying levels of colonisation of between 30% and 70% upon return <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Sampling travellers during their trip revealed a much higher rate of colonisation rate of 95%, of which <italic>E. coli</italic> was the most common colonising bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. From our data the resident commensal strain was not completely displaced, similar observations have been made of human travellers, specifically individuals colonised by MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> had a recurrence of their original commensal <italic>E. coli</italic> at the end of their travels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">Three weeks after mice were challenged with ST131 we detected increased mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF<italic>α</italic>, IL1<italic>β</italic>, IL-6 and CXCL1 in the caecum. Expression of TNF<italic>α</italic> by plasma cells has been implicated in pathogen clearance in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, while IL-1<italic>β</italic> is only produced by mononuclear phagocytes upon exposure to pathogens and not commensals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. IL-1<italic>β</italic> has also been implicated as important for repair of the epithelial barrier following colitis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. CXCL1 is released from epithelial cells to recruit neutrophils to aid in pathogen clearance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, lastly IL-6 has diverse pro-inflammatory effects including effector cell differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Together the up-regulation of these cytokines suggest that the host is responding to MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> ST131 as a pathogen and that it is attempting to clear it from the intestine. Our observed increase in inflammatory cytokines is confined to the caecum, whilst the other assayed tissues displayed alterations in cytokine expression that were not unique to ST131. Previous work has demonstrated that ST131 colonisation burden is highest in the caecum compared to other compartments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, an observation we also make. There have been limited investigations into the human immune response to colonisation by MDR bacteria however it has been reported that traveller’s diarrhoea is the most frequently reported symptom by those who are colonised <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, suggesting that there may be a mild inflammatory response in humans following colonisation. What is striking is that our observations are similar to those made for the initial colonisation of pathogenic <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> in the mammalian gut, whereby localised inflammation facilitates outcompetition of commensal bacteria by the invading pathogen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">To identify the underlying genetic mechanisms underlying MDR pandemic <italic>E. coli</italic> clones ability to dominantly colonize the mammalian gut, we used a functional pangenome analysis pipeline. Previous pangenome analysis identified metabolic loci as being enriched in nucleotide diversity in ST131 compared to other ExPEC, specifically anaerobic metabolic genes were exhibiting increased genetic variation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Our functional pangenome analysis supports these observations, revealing that there is a significant correlation between carriage of AMR genes and genetic diversity in metabolism genes. Specifically, there is increased variation in genes encoding carbohydrate metabolism in lineages with a high rate of antibiotic resistance carriage. Previous analyses have focussed on individual lineages whereas here we present data on multiple MDR ExPEC lineages, revealing that metabolic variation is a shared adaptation of MDR <italic>E. coli</italic>. Together these point towards a pivotal role for metabolism in MDR lineage formation. Experimental evolution studies have identified that <italic>E. coli</italic> can evolve resistance to antibiotic stress through mutations in core metabolic genes, particularly those involved in carbon and energy metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. These observed mutations occur at low frequency and were only detected through sequencing of multiple isolates from a population; however, they were still detectable in datasets of clinical samples demonstrating their relevance. A large scale bacterial genetic screen to test the effect of allelic variation in key metabolism genes on the ability to colonise and displace commensal <italic>E. coli</italic> in the mammalian intestinal tract would seem attractive. However the signal observed in our dataset occurs in multiple genes and pathways and genetically investigating such a polygenic trait is far from trivial. We suggest further investigation of our findings will need to combine classical genetics with long term and complex experimental studies attempting to recapitulate MDR clone evolution.</p><p id="P28">Collectively, our data demonstrate that MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> is highly capable of host intestinal colonisation, displacing resident commensal <italic>E.</italic> coli to become the dominant strain and readily transmitting between hosts. Our pangenomic analysis implicates metabolism as a pivotal factor in the evolution of AMR linked to the incredible gut colonisation ability of MDR <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec
