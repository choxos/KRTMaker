The military and police force require ballistic armour to ensure the safety of their personnel, while the aerospace industry requires materials that enable the capture, preservation and study of hypervelocity projectiles. However, current industry standards display at least one inherent limitation. To resolve these limitations we have turned to nature, utilising proteins that have evolved over millennia to enable effective energy dissipation. Specifically, a recombinant form of the mechanosensitive protein talin was incorporated into a monomeric unit and crosslinked, resulting in the production of the first reported example of a talin shock absorbing material (TSAM). When subjected to 1.5 km/s supersonic shots, TSAMs were shown not only to absorb the impact, but to capture/preserve the projectile, making TSAMs the first reported protein material to achieve this.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">When impacted by a projectile, a material is exposed to a variety of phenomena simultaneously. To survive the impact a material must contend with wave propagation (elastic, shock and plastic), fragmentation, perforation and spallation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Thus, installing a mechanism within a material to enable effective energy dissipation is essential for multiple applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Body armour is commonly used by military and civilian forces to protect the wearer against penetration from projectiles, such as bullets or shrapnel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Frequently, this armour consists of a multi-layered system, commonly a ceramic face backed by a fibre-reinforced composite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. This multi-layered design enables the hard brittle ceramic to destroy the projectile tip, in turn distributing the kinetic energy over the backing which reflects the tensile wave and captures the shattered ceramic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Despite the effective penetration blocking of these armour systems, a remainder of the kinetic energy is still distributed to the wearer, often resulting in behind armour blunt trauma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Furthermore, during impacts this form of armour is irreversibly damaged, compromising its structural integrity for further use. The aerospace sector utilise impact energy dissipating materials for the unique task of capture and preservation of space debris, space dust and micrometeoroids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. These captured projectiles contribute towards our understanding of the local environments of aerospace equipment, including that of the international space station<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Data from these experiments facilitate aerospace equipment design, improving the safety of astronauts and the longevity of costly aerospace equipment. Aerogels are the current industry standard for projectile capture and preservation, achieving energy dissipation through conversion of projectile kinetic energy into both mechanical and thermal energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, the resulting temperature elevation, further enhanced by the remarkable insulating properties of aerogel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, can cause the aerogel structure to melt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Furthermore, these elevated temperatures may compromise the structure of the captured projectiles, altering its chemical composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. This thermal and mechanical energy, causes chemical bond breakage, rendering the aerogel irreversibly damaged post-impact. It is apparent from the aforementioned examples that a material utilising an energy dissipation mechanism that reforms following the removal of force would alleviate inherent issues seen with the industry standard materials. Additionally, specifically for the aerospace sector, energy dissipation that does not result in the conversion of kinetic to thermal energy would be beneficial.</p><p id="P3">Within the animal kingdom, proteins that offer unique mechanical properties are rife; silk fibroin displays modifiable macroscale properties in its assembled fibre form, while elastin instils elasticity in animal tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Although there are many proteins analogous to these examples, very few researchers have tapped into these natural resources for development of materials with novel mechanical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>; even fewer have tested these materials for real world applications outside of the biomedical sector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Talin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) is the epitome of a mechanical protein, mediating the connection between the actin cytoskeleton and the integrin extracellular matrix receptors, acting as a mechanosensor. Previous work determined that, through unfolding/refolding events of its thirteen four/five helical rod domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> when stretched within the physiologically relevant range, talin is able to maintain the average force experienced by the protein below 10 pN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, upon removal of force, refolding of the talin rod domains occur with high fidelity over numerous force cycles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> confirming talin as a cellular shock absorber.</p><p id="P4">Here, we have engineered a recombinant form of talin, termed pGEL, which comprises three rod domains of talin, R1-R3, that are modified (with internal cysteine residues mutated to serine and cysteine residues introduced at either end of the protein) for use as the monomer with which to form a polymer. When exposed to force, these three domains provide a stepwise unfolding, with the wild type domains exhibiting threshold unfolding forces of 20, 15 and 5 pN respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. We hypothesised that, upon application of force (i.e. shear strain or impact), the three rod domains within each protein monomer would unfold, dissipating energy through the endothermic process of protein unfolding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-i</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Using compounds <bold>1</bold> (control monovalent crosslinker) and <bold>2</bold> (trivalent crosslinker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1-3</xref>), pGEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) was formed into a hydrogel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-e</xref>) via tri-substitution of the terminal cysteines with crosslinker <bold>2</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). The resulting hydrogel, which we have termed TSAM (Talin Shock Absorbing Material), therefore contains monomeric units capable of refolding upon removal of force, retaining its energy dissipating mechanism following any potential impact events. Due to the endothermic energy dissipating mechanisms of protein unfolding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> in TSAM, the heating of the captured projectiles seen in aerogels would not be observed, offering a solution to several of the limitations seen with current state of the art impact absorption materials.</p><sec id="S1"><title>TSAM structural characterisation</title><p id="P6">The R1-R3 domains of talin incorporated in the pGEL monomer were confirmed to retain alpha helical folding, using circular dichroism and <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC nuclear magnetic resonance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5-8</xref>). Following formation of TSAM, characterisation of the internal network structure was conducted. His-tagged gold immunostaining of the TSAM, imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), confirmed the presence of pGEL in a lattice formation, displaying pore sizes of approximately 100 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Following this, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed TSAM to contain a porous like structure on the micrometre scale typical of hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), with long fibres of width ≈2 μm and pores of ≈10 μm. Elemental dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirmed the observed fibres in the SEM images consisted of sulphur and carbon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), pGEL representing the only component of the xerogel containing these atoms. Together these findings indicated pGEL molecules linked with crosslinker <bold>2</bold> form a lattice on the nanometre scale, morphing into larger fibrillar like structures on the micrometre scale. When handling TSAMs high levels of extensibility were observed, presenting extension of &gt;3-fold when under tension, and returning to original size upon removal of force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d-e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Evidence for pGEL domain unfolding in TSAM</title><p id="P7">Subsequent rheological characterisation of TSAMs provided strong evidence for the induced unfolding of the talin domains within the material when exposed to shear strain, indicating that the energy dissipating mechanisms of talin were successfully incorporated into TSAMs. Specifically, for the first applied oscillatory shear strain sweep on the TSAM, the dynamic shear storage (G’) and loss modulus (G”), as a product of shear strain presented a linear viscoelastic region (LVER) for the full range of shear strain tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Following a two-minute recovery period, a subsequent sweep was performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>), once again followed by a two-minute rest period. This protocol was conducted a total of five times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9-13</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Owing to the unfolding and refolding kinetics intrinsic to R1-R3, we predicted viscoelastic properties would be retained upon repeated exposure to shear strain. The TSAMs presented G’ &gt; G” confirming viscoelastic behaviour for all five consecutive oscillatory shear strain sweeps. Moreover, the complex modulus (G*) (sum of G’ and G”) increased concomitantly with accumulated sweeps, indicating TSAM presented increased resistance to deformation upon repeated exposure to shear strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Strain stiffening as a consequence of fibre reorganisation is a well-documented phenomenon occurring in hydrogels formed from biopolymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, causing the elastic modulus to increase with strain. Strain stiffening presents here as the positive gradient observed in sweeps 3-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). The peak maxima for G’ was reached between 1-5% for sweeps 3-5, shifting to the right and increasing in amplitude for each subsequent sweep. As stated, we propose this phenomenon to be due to strain stiffening, resulting in a tighter, more rigid network structure with a greater number of talin domains arranged in parallel to the axis of the fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). As a consequence of the increased network rigidity, strain can become imparted on the internal structure of the fibres themselves. When a maximum fibre strain is reached, mass chain unfolding of the protein domains occur, causing the positive slope to transition into a negative gradient as a result of the sudden introduction of slack from the extension of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-h</xref>). Due to the sudden introduction of slack, a lag between the controlled shear strain and measured shear stress sine waves occur, presenting as a sudden shift towards more viscous-like behaviour, hence the negative gradient of G’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>) and decrease in G*. Alongside the observed bell-shaped trend of G’ and G” with accumulating sweeps, an increase in phase angle was observed, also presenting a bell-curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). Interestingly this pattern was shifted to higher strains, with the peak of the bell occurring between 10-15% strain, directly correlating with the negative slope of G’. The large quantity of slack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>) introduced into the system following a mass unfolding event allows for increased flow, observed as a drastic phase shift towards 45 degrees, and decreased rigidity, seen as a drop in G*. With increased application of shear strain, this phase shift peak eventually declines as tension within the fibres begin to increase again. Upon removal of shear strain, unfolded proteins may then refold, and the resulting TSAM displays an enhanced rigidity (higher G* at the start of the next sweep) due to fibre network reorganisation. Shear stress vs. shear strain correlations corroborate these results, revealing an exponential increase in shear modulus (G), a measure of rigidity, with accumulated sweeps, further illustrating the strain stiffening within TSAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>). Furthermore, sweeps 4 and 5 reach shear yield points, beginning to move into viscous stress as seen by the induction of a slope, subsequently transitioning back into a linear gradient indicating the reoccurrence of elastic behaviour. In summary, the linear elastic region at low shear strain is a result of reordering of the network structure and gradual tension accumulating in the fibres, the following curving transition indicates sudden mass unfolding of talin rod domains, and subsequent linear region reports elasticity reoccurring once tension is again applied to the fibres with increasing shear strain.</p><p id="P8">To confirm that the unfolding of the talin domains within the TSAM is directly responsible for the rheological characteristics/material properties observed, a green fluorescent protein tagged-vinculin domain 1 protein (GFP-VD1) was employed. GFP-VD1 is capable of selectively binding to the unfolded state of each of the rod domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>), preventing domain refolding and ‘locking’ the extended conformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Here the GFP-VD1 was introduced into the TSAM pre-amplitude sweep as a 2 mg/mL solution through a material swelling process. The rheological properties of these materials were then elucidated and compared to the results of analogous studies in which the same TSAM material underwent the same material swelling process in a solution of GFP or buffer only. The resulting G’ and G” as a product of shear strain for the three conditions tested are summarised in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>.</p><p id="P9">When plotted as shear stress against shear strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>) the GFP and buffer controls presented the same linear trend as obtained in the first amplitude sweep for the non-treated TSAMs, indicating purely elastic behaviour. In contrast, the TSAM treated with GFP-VD1 reached a yield point between 46-68% shear strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>) as a result of VD1 binding events. To further confirm the binding of GFP-VD1 to the TSAM fibres, a series of comparative fluorescence microscopy experiments were conducted. Here, fibre like structures exhibiting the same diameter as those observed in our previous SEM studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) were found to have localised GFP-VD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c-d</xref>), confirming binding. In contrast, the GFP control treated TSAM fibres appeared as darker regions, with void spaces presenting higher GFP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e-f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>TSAMs capture and preserve projectiles from supersonic impacts</title><p id="P10">Following the rheological evidence for TSAMs retention of talin’s endothermic energy dissipation mechanism, we moved on to test the performance of the TSAM as an impact absorbing material, investigating TSAM performance upon supersonic projectile impact. Specifically, velocities of 1.5 km/s were tested, as this is a speed relevant to the aerospace and defence industries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> For instance, particles in space impact both natural and man-made objects at speeds &gt;1 km/s<sup>27</sup>, while muzzle velocities from firearms commonly fall between 0.4-1.0 km/s<sup>28</sup>. Here the TSAM, in addition to a commercially available polyvinylpyrrolidone hydrogel control, were placed in the target chamber of a light gas gun (LGG) and the following material properties elucidated: (1) the ability of the TSAM to survive impact; (2) the ability of the TSAM to reduce the force of the projectile before impacting an aluminium back plate; and (3) the ability of the TSAM to capture the projectile in a preserved state.</p><p id="P11">Spherical basalt particles between 20-70 μm were used as projectiles, loaded in a sabot as buckshot. A schematic for this experiment is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-c</xref>. When shot at 1.5 km/s, the control gel was destroyed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>), with a visible hole in the tape behind the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), and a crater of 1.33 mm in diameter produced in the aluminium back plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Therefore, this material control showed no detectable impact absorption properties. However, under analogous experimental conditions, the TSAM appeared mostly intact from the frontal perspective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>), with no projectile permeation detected to either the supporting tape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>) or the aluminium backplate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>). In addition, subsequent SEM analysis identified the basalt particles embedded in the TSAM post shot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j</xref>), confirming that the TSAM had completely absorbed the impact of the basalt buckshot. The transparency of the TSAM shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 16</xref> is an additional desirable property, allowing for the easy removal of caught projectiles from the TSAMs. To conclusively determine if TSAM also enabled preservation of the captured basalt projectiles, SEM was performed on the impacted TSAM. Multiple basalt particles presenting a preserved circular shape were observed in the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j-k</xref>), confirmed as basalt with EDX analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 17</xref>). Thus, supporting that TSAM enables projectile preservation. Moreover, during one of the TSAM shots, shrapnel from the aluminium (Al 7075) burst disk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) struck the TSAM in combination with the basalt, as confirmed through SEM and EDX analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 18</xref>). Such an impact often destroys aerogel materials used as the industrial standard within the aerospace industry for projectile capture, providing evidence that TSAMs are able to overcome this limitation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Discussion and Outlook</title><p id="P12">In summary, we present the first example of a talin shock absorbing material (TSAM) known to literature – a SynBio material constructed from monomeric units containing force-dependent mechanical switch domains. In addition, we show that TSAMs can absorb impacts by basalt particles and larger pieces of aluminium shrapnel, providing the first example of a protein material capable of absorbing supersonic projectile impacts. These results lend the TSAMs towards application within the aerospace and defence industries, e.g. as a backing for multi-layered armour where shattered ceramic capture is required, and in hypervelocity impact experiments in which the projectile needs to be preserved for further study. As a consequence of the endothermic energy dissipating mechanism of talin, it is very unlikely any elevation of projectile temperature was induced during the LGG experiment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, offering a distinct benefit over aerogel materials. This energy dissipating mechanism was confirmed using rheology while, GFP-VD1 binding experiments supported the presence of talin unfolding events within these processes. Through the reversible refolding of talin domains within TSAM following the removal of force, the material also demonstrates potential for iterative use. Finally, as talin contains thirteen helical domains, each with unique unfolding forces, these TSAMs may be tuneable by modifying the talin domains featured in the monomer unit, offering the potential for tailoring toward a diverse array of mechanical properties and resulting applications.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S6"><title>Protein engineering</title><p id="P13">The genes encoding pGEL, GFP-VD1 and GFP were constructed in pET151 vectors.
