We used fluorescent particle sorting to determine mRNA enrichment in three unenclosed cytoplasmic compartments: the canonicaI rough endopIasmic reticuIum (CRER), the TIS granule-associated rough endopIasmic reticuIum (TGER), and the cytosol. Focusing our analysis on non-membrane protein-encoding mRNAs, we observed that 52% have a biased subcytoplasmic localization pattern which is determined by a combinatorial code of 3’UTR-bound RNA-binding proteins. Compartment-biased mRNAs differed in the functional classes of their encoded proteins. TGER-enriched mRNAs encode low-abundance proteins such as transcription factors, whereas CRER-enriched mRNAs encode highly expressed proteins. TGER/CRER-enriched mRNAs are more stable than cytosolic mRNAs, thus influencing protein output in a compartment-dependent manner. We observed that redirecting cytosolic mRNAs to the ER increases their protein expression by two-fold, independently of the bound RNA-binding proteins. In summary, the cytoplasm is functionally compartmentaIized by local translation environments.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cytoplasmic organization</kwd><kwd>spatial regulation</kwd><kwd>mRNA localization</kwd><kwd>unenclosed cytoplasmic compartments</kwd><kwd>functional compartmentalization</kwd><kwd>translation environment</kwd><kwd>regulation of protein expression</kwd><kwd>condensates</kwd><kwd>rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane</kwd><kwd>3’UTRs</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding proteins</kwd><kwd>CLIP analysis</kwd><kwd>TIS11B</kwd><kwd>TIAL1</kwd><kwd>LARP4B</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In polarized cells such as neurons, intestinal epithelial cells, or cells of the early fly embryo, the majority of mRNAs have a distinct spatial localization pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Huttelmaier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lecuyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Moor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Tushev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Glock et al., 2021</xref>), which enables the local control of protein production and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Moretti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buxbaum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Biever et al., 2019</xref>). In non-polarized cells, local protein synthesis has primarily been studied for membrane and secretory proteins, which are predominantly translated on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Reid and Nicchitta, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fazal et al., 2019</xref>). However, the cytoplasm is compartmentalized by additional membrane-bound and membraneless organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ma and Mayr, 2018</xref>). Compartmentalization allows reactions to occur in parallel and may enable the generation of unique biochemical translation environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ma and Mayr, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Peeples and Rosen, 2021</xref>). Subcellular localization within the cytoplasm was observed for specific mRNAs enriched on the mitochondrial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fazal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Qin et al., 2021</xref>). However, it is currently largely unknown to what extent mRNAs that encode non-membrane proteins differentially localize to the ER or the cytosol or if the amount of protein synthesis differs depending on the subcytoplasmic location of an mRNA.</p><p id="P3">We recently discovered a cytoplasmic condensate, called TIS granule network, that is generated through assembly of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) TIS11B together with its bound mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ma and Mayr, 2018</xref>). According to single cell RNA-seq data, <italic>TIS11B</italic> mRNA is expressed in more than 100 human cell types and was detected in all cell types analyzed, suggesting that TIS granules are widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Han et al., 2020</xref>). TIS granules are present under steady-state cultivation conditions and form a network-like structure that is associated with the surface of the rough ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ma and Mayr, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). With respect to their functions, it was shown that translation of specific mRNAs in TIS granules allows assembly of protein complexes that cannot be established when the mRNAs are translated on the ER but outside of TIS granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ma and Mayr, 2018</xref>). These results suggested that in addition to the canonical rough ER (CRER), the ER contains another region that is associated with TIS granules, called TIS granule ER (TGER).</p><p id="P4">To investigate the broader biological significance of TIS granules, we set out to determine the mRNAs enriched in TGER, CRER, and the surrounding cytosol. Several methods were developed to investigate subcellular transcriptomics. They include RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) after biochemical fractionation, APEX-seq, MERFISH, and fluorescent particle sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Mili et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Khong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Moor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Xia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fazal et al., 2019</xref>). Application of these methods identified mRNAs that localize to cellular protrusions of migrating fibroblasts and distinguished between mRNAs that localize to the apical or basal sides of gut epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Mili et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Moor et al., 2017</xref>). These methods also determined the transcriptomes of cytoplasmic condensates such as P bodies or stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Khong et al., 2017</xref>) and identified mRNAs associated with membrane-bound organelles such as the ER or mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fazal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Qin et al., 2021</xref>). To identify mRNAs enriched in TIS granules, we used fluorescent particle sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>). This decision was based on the observation that TIS11B protein (also called ZFP36L1) is present in cells in two assembly states. It exists in an unassembled state in the cytosol and assembles together with its bound mRNAs into TIS granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ma and Mayr, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Ma et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P5">We applied fluorescent particle sorting to isolate TGER and CRER-associated mRNAs and compared them with digitonin-extracted cytosolic mRNAs. In addition to ~1,700 mRNAs that encode membrane proteins, we detected more than 2,100 mRNAs that encode non-membrane proteins with a biased localization to TGER or CRER, indicating that the ER membrane is a general translation compartment and is not restricted to membrane and secretory proteins. We focused our analysis on mRNAs that encode non-membrane proteins. For more than half of them, we observed a biased localization to one of the three subcytoplasmic compartments. The localization pattern was largely controlled by a combinatorial code of the 3’UTR-bound RBPs TIS11B, TIA1/L1, and LARP4B. Compartment-enriched mRNAs differed substantially in their production and degradation rates as well as in the functional classes and expression levels of their encoded proteins. In addition to RBPs, we found that the location of translation has an independent effect on protein expression. We observed that redirecting cytosolic mRNAs to the rough ER membrane increased their steady-state protein expression levels by two-fold, indicating that the ER environment promotes protein expression.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Approach to determine subcytoplasmic mRNA localization</title><p id="P6">We set out to study differential mRNA localization across three major unenclosed cytoplasmic compartments in non-polarized human HEK293T cells under steady-state cultivation conditions. We determined the mRNAs enriched at the cytosolic surface of the ER – the largest cytoplasmic organelle, and TIS granules, an ER-associated condensate network, as well as the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). For simplicity, we consider here the sum of the three compartments as the universe of cytoplasmic mRNAs.</p><p id="P7">To identify TIS granule-localized mRNAs, we used fluorescent particle sorting followed by RNA-seq. After transfecting cells with fluorescently tagged TIS11B to label TIS granules, we used mechanical lysis and differential centrifugation to isolate the cytoplasmic membrane fraction which was followed by flow cytometry-based sorting of TIS11B-positive particles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A, S1B</xref>). DAPI staining allowed us to identify and discard nuclei that were still associated with the ER and TIS granules and to isolate TIS11B-positive particles free of nuclei. To investigate if the obtained particles were pure TIS granules or if they contained ER membrane, we doublelabeled TIS granules and the rough ER membrane, followed by particle sorting and confocal microscopy. This revealed that the TIS11B-positive particles cannot be separated from the rough ER membrane and therefore, we call them TIS granule ER (TGER) particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To isolate the canonical rough ER (CRER), we labeled the rough ER membrane with fluorescently tagged SEC61B and isolated CRER particles with the same strategy. We obtained particles similar in size to TGER particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). To isolate cytosolic mRNAs, we used digitonin extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Liu and Fagotto, 2011</xref>). The extracted cytosol was not contaminated by nuclei or the ER, but it contained cytosolic proteins, including unassembled TIS11B protein and GAPDH which was used as positive control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We performed RNA-seq to determine the mRNA composition in the three fractions. The biological replicates of the compartment samples were highly reproducible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E</xref>). We focused our analysis on protein-coding mRNAs. Previous analyses showed that most mRNAs that encode membrane or secretory proteins are translated on the ER, whereas mRNAs that encode non-membrane proteins are translated in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fazal et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed distinct partitioning patterns between the two groups across the three compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>mRNAs that encode membrane and secretory proteins are strongly enriched on the CRER membrane</title><p id="P10">Based on the different partitioning patterns, we analyzed the mRNAs that encode membrane or secretory proteins separately from the mRNAs that encode non-membrane proteins. Proteins that contain either a signal sequence or transmembrane domain are defined as secretory or membrane proteins and are encoded by 23% of mRNAs expressed in HEK293T cells, whereas the remaining 77% encode non-membrane proteins. We determined the compartment-specific partition coefficients in each group: For each gene, we calculated the fraction of mRNA transcripts that localize to TGER, the CRER, or the cytosol and observed the expected baseline distributions across the three compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1F</xref>).</p><p id="P11">For mRNAs that encode membrane/secretory proteins, we observed 69% (<italic>N</italic> = 1,476) to be enriched at the CRER (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1G</xref>). When comparing the CRER membrane-enriched mRNAs with analyses from alternative isolation methods, we detected approximately 80% overlap among the ER membrane-enriched mRNAs, supporting the validity of our purification strategy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Reid and Nicchitta, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fazal et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>A third of mRNAs that encode non-membrane proteins have an ER-biased localization</title><p id="P12">For mRNAs that encode non-membrane proteins, the baseline partitioning across the three compartments was more even. For a typical mRNA, we observed that roughly a third of transcripts localizes to TGER, CRER or to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1F</xref>). Next, we identified mRNAs whose transcript localization was biased towards a single compartment. We considered an mRNA to be compartment-enriched if the fraction of transcripts that localize to one compartment is 1.25-fold higher than the median fraction observed in the compartment. With this strategy, we identified 1246 mRNAs enriched in TGER, 919 non-overlapping mRNAs enriched on the CRER, and 1481 mRNAs enriched in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1I</xref>). The remaining 3369 mRNAs were not enriched in a single compartment and are considered to have an unbiased localization pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). To illustrate the compartment-biased localization, for individual mRNAs, we depicted the fraction of transcripts observed in the three compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Presented are examples obtained from the top 10%, bottom 10% and the median fraction of compartment-enriched transcripts, showing that the transcript enrichment is relative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Overall, we found that 52% of mRNAs that encode non-membrane proteins have a biased localization pattern to a single subcytoplasmic compartment in steady-state conditions of non-polarized cells.</p><p id="P13">Taken together, for the two ER-associated compartments (TGER and CRER), we found enrichment of mRNAs that encode membrane or secretory proteins, but we detected even more mRNAs that encode non-membrane proteins enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Dozens of these mRNAs have been found previously by several other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lerner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Diehn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Reid and Nicchitta, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Voigt et al., 2017</xref>) but the extent of localization of mRNAs that encode non-membrane proteins to TGER or CRER was previously unknown. This suggests that the rough ER membrane is a general translation compartment not restricted to membrane or secretory proteins. All remaining analyses were performed on mRNAs that encode non-membrane proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Validation of subcytoplasmic mRNA localization patterns by single-molecule RNA-FISH</title><p id="P14">To validate mRNA localization across the three compartments, we performed single-molecule (sm) RNA-FISH on endogenous mRNAs predicted to localize to TGER or to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boraas et al., 2021</xref>). The TGER domain was visualized using fluorescently tagged TIS11B. To quantify compartment localization for individual mRNAs, we determined the area occupied by TGER or the cytosol in each cell and calculated the expected distribution of mRNA foci across the two compartments. We determined the fold-change between the foci observed in each compartment and the foci expected to be in each compartment. Our smRNA-FISH experiment confirmed enrichment of all candidates predicted to be overrepresented in the TGER domain. mRNAs predicted to be biased to the cytosol were not enriched in the TGER domain and were even excluded from the TGER domain in some samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G, 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1J, S1K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The fine reticulated structure of the ER membrane makes it challenging to perform a similar colocalization analysis for the CRER. ER-localized mRNAs are tethered to the ER and are relatively resistant to digitonin extraction compared to cytosolic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lerner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cui et al., 2012</xref>). To validate the enrichment of mRNAs on the CRER, we performed smRNA-FISH before and after digitonin extraction and calculated the fraction of retained mRNAs. We observed significantly higher retention rates for mRNAs predicted to be CRER-localized compared to mRNAs predicted to be cytosolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I, 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1L, S1M</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Based on our high validation rates for mRNAs that localize to the three investigated cytoplasmic compartments, we conclude that about half (52%) of mRNAs that encode non-membrane proteins have a biased subcytoplasmic localization pattern.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>mRNA and protein levels strongly correlate with the location of translation</title><p id="P16">Next, we characterized the features of compartment-enriched mRNAs and found substantial differences in their steady-state mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, 2B</xref>). We observed that TGER-enriched mRNAs have the lowest steady-state expression levels and encode proteins with the lowest expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, 2B</xref>). To examine if the low mRNA levels are caused by mRNA degradation, we estimated mRNA half-lives by analyzing Precision Run-On sequencing (Pro-seq) and RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Patel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Blumberg et al., 2021</xref>). Pro-seq values can be treated as transcription rates and RNA-seq data can be viewed as a measure of RNA concentration to estimate RNA decay rates required for a steadystate equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Blumberg et al., 2021</xref>). For TGER-enriched mRNAs, we observed that the low steady-state mRNA levels were not primarily caused by a low mRNA stability. Instead, these mRNAs had the lowest transcription rates which suggests that these mRNAs are either produced at a low rate or have high cotranscriptional degradation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Smalec et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Cytosol-enriched mRNAs showed the highest degree of mRNA regulation with high production and high degradation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, 2D</xref>). CRER-enriched mRNAs encode proteins with the highest expression levels, particularly when considering their intermediate steady-state mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, 2B</xref>). The compartment-enriched mRNAs also showed differences in their gene architectures. Cytosolic mRNAs have shorter 3’UTRs that are GC-rich and contain fewer AUrich elements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B-D</xref>).

Our analysis suggests that proteins that need to be expressed at low levels, such as transcription factors, are translated in the TGER domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, 2B, 2E</xref>). To obtain direct evidence for translation in the TGER domain, we applied the SunTag system to simultaneously visualize mRNAs and their nascent proteins in TGER and in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F, S2G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Yan et al., 2016</xref>).

However, the proportion of mRNA translated was similar in TGER and the cytosol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2H, S2I</xref>). Taken together, our data show that the TGER translation environment is not repressive and that the low expression level of TGER-translated proteins is predominantly a result of their low nuclear gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Lack of 3’UTRs in expression constructs causes default mRNA localization to the cytosol</title><p id="P20">Our next goal was to identify the RBPs responsible for mRNA enrichment in the three compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, 1E</xref>). As TIS11B is the scaffold protein of TIS granules, we performed iCLIP of TIS11B in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A, S3B</xref>). We confirmed that the top binding motif of TIS11B in 3’UTRs of mRNAs is the canonical AU-rich element (UAUUUA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>).

Altogether, we correlated the 3’UTR binding pattern of 170 RBPs with mRNA enrichment in the three subcytoplasmic compartments. Among them, we found that the 3’UTR CLIP peak distributions of 25 RBPs were biased towards one of the three compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>).

According to the prevailing model, mRNA stability is regulated by the mRNA-bound RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gebauer et al., 2021</xref>), meaning the RBPs that bind to AU-rich mRNAs would stabilize them. However, our data also support an alternative model that takes into account subcellular localization. In this model, mRNAs with AU-rich 3’UTRs use RBPs to preferentially localize to the rough ER, a region that might be inherently protected from degradation. This latter model is supported by our reporter experiments. Although we did not measure mRNA stability rates, we observed that redirecting mRNAs to the rough ER membrane increased their protein levels independently of 3’UTR sequence, which was kept constant in the relocalization experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>).</p><p id="P47">Our study revealed a surprisingly high degree of cytoplasmic compartmentalization. This is the basis for the translation of functionally related proteins in defined environments that strongly affect mRNA stability and protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E</xref>). Our results highlight the contribution of spatial regulation whose consequences go beyond the effects mediated by the mRNA-bound proteins. In the future, our findings may provide the basis for biotechnology applications that make use of engineered 3’UTR sequences to boost protein expression in experimental settings or to increase protein production of mRNA vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Limitations of our study</title><p id="P48">To obtain sufficient material for TGER and CRER particle sorting, we used transfected, fluorescently labeled proteins instead of endogenous proteins.

However, despite their tight association, TGER- and CRER-enriched mRNAs that encode non-membrane proteins differed substantially in their functional gene classes and in their mRNA and protein features, suggesting that our purification method was successful.</p><p id="P49">The reporter relocalization experiments showed that the subcytoplasmic location of translation strongly influences steady-state protein expression.

All expressed genes were separated into mRNAs that encode membrane/secretory proteins or non-membrane proteins. If a protein contains a signal sequence but not a transmembrane domain, it is considered as secretory protein. All proteins with transmembrane domains are considered membrane proteins and all remaining proteins are classified as non-membrane proteins. Among the 9155 mRNAs expressed in HEK293T cells, 2140 were classified as membrane/secretory proteins, whereas 7015 were classified as non-membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S61"><title>Compartment-specific partition coefficients</title><p id="P83">The sum of RPKM values obtained from TGER particles, CRER particles, and the cytosol was considered as total cytoplasmic mRNA expression.

The median partition coefficient of membrane/secretory mRNAs in the cytosol was 0.09. If the cytosolic partition coefficient of an mRNA was greater than 0.36, it was considered enriched in the cytosol. If the CRER and TGER-specific partition coefficients were similar and the cytosolic partition coefficient was smaller than 0.18, the mRNA was assigned to the CRER, whereas it was considered not localized if the cytosolic partition coefficient was smaller than 0.18 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S63"><title>Compartment-specific enrichment of mRNAs that encode non-membrane proteins</title><p id="P85">For all mRNAs that encode non-membrane proteins, the medians of the partition coefficients for each compartment were calculated. For TGER particles the median was 0.32, for CRER particles, it was 0.30 and for the cytosol, the median was 0.34. An mRNA was considered to have a biased localization to a specific compartment if its compartment-specific partition coefficient exceeded 1.25-fold of the median partition coefficient of the compartment. For example, the minimum partition coefficient for TGER-enriched mRNAs was 0.42, it was 0.38 for CRER-enriched mRNAs, and 0.43 for CY-biased mRNAs. If the enrichment was observed in two compartments, the mRNA was assigned to the compartment with the higher value. This strategy resulted in 1246 mRNAs considered to be TGER-enriched, 919 mRNAs to be ER-enriched, and 1481 mRNAs to be enriched in the cytosol.
