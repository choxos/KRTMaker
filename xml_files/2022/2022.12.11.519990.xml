Enhancing the efficacy of vaccine antigens to induce robust and specific antibody responses remains central to developing highly effective formulations. The direct fusion of immunoglobulin (IgG) Fc domains or other immune-stimulating proteins to antigens has shown promise in several mammalian species but has not yet been tested and optimized in commercially-relevant ruminant species. Here we show that the immunization of sheep with fusions of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 to ovine IgG2a Fc domains promotes significantly higher levels of antigen-specific antibodies compared to native RBD or full-length spike antigens. This antibody population was shown to contain elevated levels of neutralizing antibodies that suppress binding between the RBD and soluble hACE2 receptors <italic>in vitro</italic>. The parallel evaluation of a second immune-stimulating fusion candidate, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), induced high neutralizing responses in select animals but narrowly missed achieving significance at the group level. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the antibodies induced by these fusion antigens are transferred from maternal serum into colostrum/milk. These antibodies also demonstrate cross-neutralizing activity against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants including delta and omicron. Our findings highlight a new pathway for recombinant antigen design in ruminant animals with applications in immune milk production and animal health.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Immune milk</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>Fc domain</kwd><kwd>Fc fusion</kwd><kwd>coronavirus</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>ruminant</kwd><kwd>antigen design</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Background</title><p id="P2">The COVID-19 pandemic has focused global efforts to develop new therapies that mitigate the severity of the disease at the individual and population level. While vaccination provides excellent prophylactic protection against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, the rapid evolution of new variants (e.g delta B.1.617.2, omicron B.1.1.529 and omicron BA.5) and the current inability to vaccinate within certain demographics (e.g. infants) has necessitated the development of alternate strategies to both limit disease transmission and treat COVID patients. One potential solution is to create formulations of neutralizing polyclonal antibodies derived from ruminant animals immunized with SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. A significant advantage of this approach is the inherent scalability enabled by integration into existing ruminant farming systems.</p><p id="P3">SARS-CoV-2 viral entry is mediated by spike protein S1 binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor (hACE2) through its N-terminal receptor-binding domain (RBD). The distribution of hACE2 receptors on cells defines viral tropism within the host. In humans, these receptors are expressed most abundantly in epithelial cells of the respiratory and digestive tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hamming et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Neutralizing antibodies that block this interaction are demonstrated to provide protection against certain SARS-CoV-2 variants, with FDA approval granted for several monoclonal antibody products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hwang et al., 2022</xref>). While highly effective against early pandemic variants, these monoclonal antibodies have reduced activity to new and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants as escape mutations arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cao et al., 2021</xref>), which has led to the FDA revising the authorizations for multiple mAb SARS-CoV-2 approvals (e.g. bamlanivimab and etesevimab, REGEN-COV; casirivimab and imdevimab, and sotrovimab) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cavazzoni, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mullard, 2022</xref>). This, in turn, has focused attention on alternative treatment strategies with polyclonal or cocktails of monoclonal antibodies as a way of providing broader coverage against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alape-Girón et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Due to high global demand for COVID-19 treatments, the immunization of ruminant animals has been proposed as a cost-effective approach to produce large quantities of polyclonal SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in serum or colostrum/milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ainsworth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Arenas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jawhara, 2020</xref>). The resulting hyperimmune fractions could either be formulated directly as a functional food supplement or processed to extract purified pathogen-specific antibodies for direct therapeutic use. Such strategies have previously demonstrated protection against a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Luke et al., 2016</xref>), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kramski et al., 2012</xref>), Rotavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Mitra et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sarker et al., 2007</xref>), Enterotoxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Savarino et al., 2017</xref>) and <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Steele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">van Dissel et al., 2005</xref>). In addition to neutralization via steric hindrance of interactions essential for pathogen infection, ruminant antibody fractions may also engage with elements of the human immune system to mediate potent effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Ulfman et al., 2018</xref>). Most recently, Kangro et al. immunized pregnant cows with the RBD subdomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and formulated the resulting colostral antibodies for nasal application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kangro et al., 2022</xref>). Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were reported to persist in the nasal mucosa for at least four hours in a small clinical trial; a timescale that potentially confers protection against viral infection. This study also demonstrated that the protective capacity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune formulations is closely correlated with the abundance of pathogen-specific neutralizing antibodies induced by immunization. Approaches to improve neutralizing antibody levels in colostrum/milk are of particular importance as titers decline within hours of calving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Elfstrand et al., 2002</xref>). Colostral/milk antibodies are accumulated primarily from the systemic circulation, via active FcRn transport, with a more minor contribution from local production in the mammary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hurley &amp; Theil, 2011</xref>). Therefore, high antibody titers in colostrum/milk are most likely achieved by strengthening and improving the duration of serum response to antigens.</p><p id="P5">Several studies have reported the use of immunostimulant technology to improve antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and thereby improve specific antibody titers. The RBD region comprises 222 amino acids, representing around 17% of the full-length viral spike protein (1273 amino acids). Antigens based on this smaller region avoid the expression challenges associated with using heavily glycosylated full-length spike proteins, and may also focus antibody responses towards critical viral neutralizing epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kleanthous et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Combination or fusion of the RBD with immune-stimulating proteins can further boost antibody levels following immunization. One such fusion partner widely used in non-ruminant species is the IgG Fc domain, which promotes antigen half-life extension and targets the antigen to Fc receptor expressing cells that mediate antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Czajkowsky et al., 2012</xref>). Multiple murine studies have shown that fusion of the RBD to murine IgG Fc regions induces robust neutralizing responses upon immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Qi et al., 2020</xref>). Similar results have also been observed in non-human primates where a human IgG1 Fc RBD fusion vaccine provided protection against challenge with live SARS-CoV-2 virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). Beyond Fc fusions, the concurrent administration of other soluble immune-stimulating factors including cytokines (e.g. GM-CSF) have also shown promise in enhancing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Vernet et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Here we report the development of new ruminant-specific antigens for the induction of antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 immunity. In particular, we show the fusion of ovine IgG2a Fc regions to the RBD domain induced high and sustained serum neutralizing titers in sheep. Further, these antibodies persist in ovine colostrum/milk following lambing and have broad SARS-CoV-2 cross-variant neutralizing potential. Our antigen designs have direct application in the production of high potency SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune milk and could be further adapted as recombinant vaccines for animal health in commercially important ruminant species. To our knowledge this is the first use of immune regulatory elements incorporated in to antigenic fusion proteins to improve the nature of the immune response in ruminants.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Antigen production</title><sec id="S4"><title>Antigen design</title><p id="P8">Antigen designs are summarized in the main text (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>), with sequence data provided as a supplement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional file 1: Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). 14,429 spike protein sequences were downloaded from the GSAID database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Shu &amp; McCauley, 2017</xref>) (accessed: 10 Aug 2020) and aligned to obtain a consensus sequence. All antigen designs were based on this consensus sequence, which mapped to the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 sequence with an additional D614G mutation. Ovine IgG2 Fc cDNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Clarkson et al., 1993</xref>) were obtained from the IMGT database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lefranc, 2011</xref>) (IMGT accession number: X70983, bases 313-987). The nucleotide sequence of ovine GM-CSF was back-translated from the amino acid sequence obtained from the UniProt database (UniProt accession number: P28773, amino acids 18-144).

Heavy and light chain plasmid sequences for producing monoclonal antibodies LY-CoV555, REGN-33, and REGN-87, were a kind gift from Professor Sai Reddy (ETH Zurich). DH5α <italic>E. coli</italic> stocks for each construct were produced by transformation into chemically competent cells. Transfection-ready plasmids were purified from bacterial cultures by maxiprep (Invitrogen, #K20006). Expi293 HEK cells (Thermofisher, #A14527) were expanded and passaged in Expi293 expression media (Thermofisher, #A1435101) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, cells were grown in suspension at 125 RPM on a shaking platform (Thermofisher, #88881102) at &gt;80% humidity, 37 °C and 8% CO2. Cells were transfected at a density of 3×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL with 1 μg of plasmid per mL of culture according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Monoclonal antibody plasmids were mixed at a 2:1 light chain to heavy chain ratio prior to transfection. Supernatants were harvested at day 6 post-transfection by centrifugation of the culture media for 20 min at 6000 g. The cell pellet was then discarded, and the centrifugation step repeated to further remove cell debris. Each supernatant was then filtered through 0.22 μm filters (Corning, #430773) in preparation for purification.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Protein purification</title><p id="P10">Antigen purifications were performed on a BioRad NGC chromatography system.

With the exception of omicron B.1.1.529 RBD, which was obtained commercially (Acro Biosystems, USA), all RBD variants (wuhan, beta B.1.351, delta B.1.617.2), and RBD GM-CSF antigens were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Supernatants from each culture were dialyzed into 1.5 L 1X PBS for 24 hours using 6-8 kDa molecular weight cut off (MWCO) dialysis tubing (Repligen, #132655). Dialysed samples were collected and imidazole was added to a final concentration of 20 mM. Each sample was then loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap FF Ni-NTA column (Cytiva, #17525501) pre-equilibrated with 10 column volumes (CV) 1X PBS containing 20 mM imidazole (Buffer A). The column was washed with 5 CV Buffer A before elution with a 4-100 % gradient of 1X PBS containing 500 mM imidazole over 5 CV.

The signal intensity of the product ions from the targeted peptides was compared to the corresponding signal intensity of synthetic tryptic peptides of known abundance from a 9-point calibration curve.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S18"><title>Design of and production of ruminant specific SARS-CoV-2 antigens</title><p id="P21">We designed a series of His-tagged antigens that linked ovine IgG2a Fc domains or ovine GM-CSF cytokine sequences to the C-terminus of SARS-CoV-2 RBD or full-length spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a, b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1</xref>). Due to incomplete information about functional ovine IgG2a hinge region sequences, we performed an alignment to the human IgG1 sequence and selected ovine residues that align to the “DKTH” motif (residues 221 - 224 by the Eu numbering system), which we have previously used to generate functional Fc domains that retain Fc receptor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Jung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kelton et al., 2014</xref>). The unstructured hinge region of IgG2a Fc was hypothesized to act as a flexible linker sequence between the antigen and the Fc domain. We further modified the full-length spike antigen sequence to remove the N-terminal furin site to prevent cleavage of the Fc fusion upon expression. In parallel, we designed an RBD fusion with ovine GM-CSF by incorporating the full ovine GM-CSF coding region except for the N-terminal signal sequence (residues 18-144). The construct included a GGGGS linker sequence between the RBD domain and the GM-CSF to prevent steric hindrance influencing antigen or cytokine function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). To mediate soluble expression in mammalian cells, we added a rabbit Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain signal peptide sequence at the N-terminus of each design.</p><p id="P22">Antigen purity exceeded 80% for all antigens when analysed by SDS-PAGE gel and scanning densitometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c;</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1</xref>). We used Protein G resin as a conformational ligand for purification of IgG2a Fc fusions that additionally confirmed the correct dimerization of these domains. All other antigens were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. As an additional verification of functional antigen production, we evaluated binding to recombinant hACE2 receptors by ELISA. All purified antigens showed considerably higher binding to hACE2 compared to Ovalbumin control protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). We also observed a stronger signal from the antigen fusions (RBD IgG2 Fc, Spike IgG2 Fc, RBD GM-CSF) than from the unfused antigens (RBD, Spike), presumably due to a greater availability of hACE2 binding epitopes in native conformations following hydrophobic plate coating.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>RBD-Fc fusions induce elevated levels of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in ovine serum</title><p id="P23">The ability of our antigen designs to induce high anti-SARS-CoV-2 titers in the serum of ruminant animals was investigated using sheep as a model ruminant species. Here, we randomly allocated groups of hoggets (median age 12 months; median weight 52 kg; n= 7) into eight groups for immunization with the designed antigens (RBD IgG2 Fc, Spike IgG2 Fc, RBD GM-CSF), native antigens (RBD, Spike high, Spike low) and controls (Ovalbumin, and adjuvant alone) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Antigens were normalized by both molecular weight and purity such that 0.3 nmol of total antigen was injected into each animal, with the exception of group E where the yield of Spike IgG2a Fc allowed only 0.1 nmol of antigen per injection. For this reason, an additional control group of spike protein alone (Group E, Spike low) was included as a control for this group. Our normalization scheme resulted in each group receiving different masses of antigen but an equivalent number of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Animal health was tracked by physical examination during each blood draw and via animal weights over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Immunization was well-tolerated; a slight, but non-significant, decrease in animal weight was observed at week nine, though this was consistent across all groups including those dosed with control antigens.</p><p id="P24">To quantify the magnitude of the serum response, we analyzed polyclonal antibody responses against RBD antigen by ELISA screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c;</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1</xref>). These assays revealed a significant 3.1-fold increase in anti-RBD titer for the RBD IgG2a Fc antigen design compared with RBD antigen alone, with peak antibody responses observed three weeks after the second boost at week nine (IgG2 Fc titer IC50 = 4.1 x 10<sup>4</sup> ± 0.9 x 10<sup>4</sup>, RBD titer IC50 = 1.2 x 10<sup>4</sup> ± 0.4 x 10<sup>4</sup>, p = 0.0038) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1</xref>). Antibody responses persisted until the 16-week time point with titers ~40% of the peak response (RBD IgG2a Fc titer IC50 = 1.6 x 10<sup>4</sup> ± 0.5 x 10<sup>4</sup>). By comparison, no significant difference in titer was observed between Spike IgG2 Fc and Spike antigen alone, although this is likely due to the measurement of anti-RBD responses rather than anti-spike responses by ELISA. Likewise, the RBD GM-CSF antigen did not elicit antibody titers significantly above the RBD control suggesting lesser immunostimulation by this fusion. No RBD binding signal was observed for either the adjuvant-only or the ovalbumin control groups.</p><p id="P25">As RBD titers do not provide a direct estimate of neutralization potential, we performed surrogate viral neutralization assays with a dilution series of the hyperimmune sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a;</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1</xref>). The clinical neutralizing antibody LY-CoV555 antibody was included as a positive control. Compared to the variation in our positive control samples, a large degree of variation is observed predominantly within the RBD IgG2a Fc and RBD GM-CSF cohorts, with multiple high-responding animals mixed with those considered as low-responders (neutralization titers below the positive control signal). In contrast to RBD antibody titers in serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>), we found the highest neutralization capacity in multiple cohorts was generated at week 6 rather than week 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b;</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1</xref>). We also observed that the RBD IgG2a Fc immunized cohort had consistently higher neutralization titers over a range of time points compared to the RBD antigen alone cohort, with IC50 values of 282 ± 79 verses 83 ± 28 (a 3.4-fold increase; p = 0.02) at week six and 168 ± 55 verses 52 ± 18 (a 3.2 fold increase; p = 0.03) at week nine.</p><p id="P26">To further investigate whether individual antigens polarize the antibody response towards neutralizing epitopes within the RBD, we first performed Pearson correlation testing on log-transformed serum titer and serum neutralizing titer data for each cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). The regression generated power law coefficients that generally centred around 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1</xref>), indicating proportional increases in neutralizing antibody levels as anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers increased.

While some individual animals in the RBD GM-CSF group demonstrated high levels of neutralizing antibodies (D718, D727, D755), there were no significant differences between the group means at either week 6 or 9 (Week 6 RBD GM-CSF vs RBD p = 0.11, Week 9 RBD vs GM-CSF p = 0.099).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are trafficked into colostrum and milk</title><p id="P27">While polyclonal antibodies can be extracted from ruminant serum, colostrum and milk are readily obtained non-invasively at scale. Based on the highest observed anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers in serum, we selected the RBD IgG2a and RBD GM-CSF cohorts for analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody transfer into colostrum/milk. RBD and adjuvant-only groups were selected as positive and negative controls respectively. Single low-responding animals from the serum trial were excluded from each of the RBD GM-CSF and RBD cohorts. Sheep were mated and then boosted with antigen approximately three weeks before lambing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Of the 26 animals carried through into the second phase of the trial, two further animals from the RBD GM-CSF (D716) and RBD IgG2a cohorts (D743) died or were euthanized for health reasons unrelated to the trial. Periodic blood and colostrum/milk samples were collected up to 32 days after lambing. After boosting, serum antibody titers against the RBD antigen were sustained at similarly high levels to those observed in the initial phase of the trial (RBD IgG2a Fc 3.1 x 10<sup>4</sup> ± 1.7 x 10<sup>4</sup> at day 251) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Anti-RBD antibody titers were highest in RBD IgG2a Fc immunized animals at 1.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> ± 0.8 x 10<sup>5</sup> in the first colostrum and rapidly decreased by day 4 in all cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1</xref>). The decline in titer coincided with a sharp drop in total antibody concentration from 75.6 ±12.0 mg/mL at day 0 (colostrum) to 4.8 ± 0.7 mg/mL at day 4 (milk) as determined by mass spectrometry analysis and was expected with the transition from the colostrum to milk phases of the lactation (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1</xref>). We then used surrogate viral neutralization assays to evaluate the neutralizing capacity of colostrum taken at day 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1</xref>). Colostrum samples from individual animals were diluted fivefold and compared against the LY-CoV555 positive control antibody. A large variation in individual animal responses resulted in non-significant differences between the cohorts despite several very high responding animals observed in the RBD IgG2a Fc cohort (IC50 749 ± 571 RBD IgG2a Fc vs 106 ± 44 RBD alone; p = 0.5). To establish broader trends as to how serum titer translates into antibody transfer to the colostrum/milk we fitted power law functions to log transformed titer data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional File 1</xref>). For each day analyzed (0, 4, 16, 32), significant correlations (p≤0.05) were observed that indicate greater antibody accumulation in the colostrum/milk is a function of higher serum antibody concentration. However, we observe steeper gradients at later sampling timepoints (Day 16, 32) suggesting an accumulation of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies in early colostrum is not as sustained as milk production begins. The correlation between colostrum anti-RBD titer and colostrum neutralizing potential at Day 0 was also highly correlated with an r value of 0.93; p&lt;0.0001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f</xref>).</p><p id="P29">We finally sought to establish whether the fusion of immunomodulatory domains to RBD antigens alters the immunoglobulin subclass profile in colostrum or milk. IgM, IgA and IgG1 levels (including both antigen specific and non-specific populations) were quantified by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4g</xref>). In colostrum averaged across all cohorts on day 0, 91.0 ± 0.5% of the total immunoglobulins were IgG1, which reduced after the first four days to 81.4 ± 1.2%. The observed IgM and IgA proportions increased from 3.0 ± 0.2% and 5.9 ± 0.4% to 6.7 ± 0.6% and 11.8 ± 1.0% respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4g</xref>). No significant differences in antibody subclass ratios were observed between the cohorts indicating that the antigens did not bias the antibody subclass composition in colostrum/milk.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Hyperimmune colostrum has broad cross-variant neutralizing potential</title><p id="P30">It is now well established that human vaccines containing native (Wuhan) spike protein sequences are less effective at generating protective immunity against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Tseng et al., 2022</xref>). We therefore evaluated the ability of pooled colostrum (Excluding low-responding animal D708) from the RBD IgG2 Fc cohort to cross neutralize native, beta, delta, and omicron RBD variants using our established surrogate viral neutralization assays. Clinical antibodies REGN-33 and REGN-87 were included as controls that bind distinct RBD epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). REGN-33 performed comparably well against the native and delta RBD with average IC50s of 0.41 ± 0.03 μg/mL and 0.42 ± 0.03 μg/mL respectively but had significantly reduced activity against the beta (average IC50 1.5 ± 0.22 μg/mL) and omicron (average IC50 not determined) RBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). In contrast, REGN-87 performed comparably against all the RBDs tested except omicron where IC50 value were not reliably determined (average IC50s; native 0.53 ± 0.12 μg/mL, beta 0.91 ± 0.08 μg/mL, delta 0.40 ± 0.06 μg/mL). Hyperimmune colostrum provided broader cross-neutralization than any individual monoclonal antibody although required high antibody concentrations in the mg/mL range presumably due to only a fraction of the total immunoglobulins being RBD specific (average IC50s; native 0.27 ± 0.01 mg/mL, beta 0.50 ± 0.01 mg/mL, delta 0.21 ± 0.01 mg/mL, omicron 0.48 ± 0.03mg/mL). We additionally observed low levels of naive colostrum neutralizing activity against native, delta and omicron RBD domains despite this cohort receiving only adjuvant during immunization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">The production of polyclonal antibodies in ruminant animals has long held promise as a scalable source of cost-effective therapeutics and diagnostic reagents. Maximizing the production of pathogen-specific neutralizing antibodies is critical to producing high-efficacy formulations derived from serum or colostrum/milk. In this study, we increased antibody titers in sheep by enhancing antigen immunogenicity through the fusion of IgG2a Fc domains derived from the host immune system. Using SARS-CoV-2 RBD subunit model antigens, we observed elevated levels of serum antibodies that were subsequently transported into milk following lambing.</p><p id="P32">Polyclonal antibody preparations from sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dart et al., 1997</xref>), and horses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Boyer et al., 2009</xref>) remain the standard of care for envenomation and are approved clinically as single-use heterologous injectables with neutralizing activity. In most cases, F(ab’)2 molecules are generated to reduce unwanted immunogenicity and prevent other unwanted inflammatory immune interactions mediated by the equine Fc domain. More recently, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has generated renewed interest in prophylactic ruminant antibodies that potentially limit household viral transmission with at least one clinical trial currently underway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Uusküla et al., 2022</xref>). High antibody titers are key to the commercial viability of polyclonal preparations from ruminants, especially since the concentration of total IgGs in bovine colostrum drops rapidly from ~50 g/L to ~0.5 g/L in milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Elfstrand et al., 2002</xref>) and antigen-specific antibodies may be less than 2% of total colostral antibodies following bovine vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chambers et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P33">To improve antibody titers upon immunization, we selected IgG2a Fc domains for antigen fusion for two key reasons; first, this class of antibodies is poorly transported from serum into colostrum/milk and thus reduces the chance of undesired antigen contamination of downstream products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nash et al., 1990</xref>). Second, in ruminant species the half-life of IgG2a in serum is frequently longer than for IgG1, which enables extended antigen persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cervenak &amp; Kacskovics, 2009</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of recombinant Fc fusion technology being used for the immunization of ruminant animals. However, the use of Fc fusion technology in other species has been observed to enhance immunization responses via well understood mechanisms. Fc domain engagement with FcRn receptors on host cells mediates the recycling of fusion proteins thus reducing the rate of catabolism and increasing antigen persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Rath et al., 2015</xref>). Our observed increases in serum titers correlates with those seen in studies with other species. For example, the 2.4-fold increase in serum titer at week 6 (three weeks after the first boost) is similar to the 1.6-fold increase in serum titer observed for RBD Fc-fused antigens in boosted mice (two weeks after the first boost) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). An increase in both serum and neutralizing titer was also observed for IgG2a Fc fused to the full-length spike (but was not significant at p 0.05) but these increases were not as substantial as for RBD IgG2a Fc fusions. These differences may in part be due to the use of RBD antigens for serum titer analyses, which present only a proportion of the epitopes present within the full-length spike construct.</p><p id="P34">Further improvements to the immunogenicity of Fc-fused antigens might be made via multimerization, which enables the binding of the Fc domain to proinflammatory Fc receptors to promote antigen uptake and processing by antigen-presenting cells that initiate antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Nimmerjahn &amp; Ravetch, 2008</xref>). Cui et al., recently demonstrated this approach by creating tetrameric Fc fusions with gp350 antigens from Epstein-Barr virus that were up to 25-fold more immunogenic in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cui et al., 2013</xref>). We also expect manipulation of antibody responses (both magnitude and isotype distribution) could be achieved by investigating alternative antibody isotypes as Fc fusions, particularly since IgG1 fusions may traffic to the mammary gland to induce localized antibody responses in colostrum/milk. Deeper exploration of isotype bias will require the isolation of antigen specific antibodies, as we did not observe significant differences in isotype distribution in bulk colostrum or milk.</p><p id="P35">We also selected a second fusion, GM-CSF, as an immunofusion partner in an attempt to stimulate higher levels of antibodies following immunization. While some individual animals responded strongly, there was not a significant enhancement in neutralizing titer with the group sizes used in this study. GM-CSF has a broad range of immunological functions with known roles in the development of both antibody and cellular immunity, driven in part by the enhancement of antigen presenting cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Ushach &amp; Zlotnik, 2016</xref>). Our findings suggest GM-CSF fusions should be revisited in future trials with greater statistical power. In either case, we note high animal-to-animal variation in response to immunization, particularly in the IgG2a and GM-CSF cohorts; a phenomenon well-established in sheep and other ruminant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hernández et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jouneau et al., 2020</xref>). In part, this is a consequence of the use of an outbred animal population in the study but could be resolved by using early serum titer testing to identify low-responding animals that could be subsequently removed from a dairy production herd. It is also likely that there is a genetic component to antibody immune responsiveness that may be exploitable in obtaining higher yielding production systems through selective breeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">McRae et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P36">The rapid and continual evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants has proved a challenge for the development of monoclonal antibody therapeutics. Polyclonal antibody preparations against SARS-CoV-2 may provide broader cross reactivity and we observe the neutralizing response generated in ovine colostrum covers several SARS-CoV-2 variants, albeit with slightly reduced efficacy against the omicron sublineage. These findings parallel observations in humans boosted with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on the spike protein antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Andrews et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lopez Bernal et al., 2021</xref>). However, further characterization of the colostral anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response is required. For instance, we have not tested neutralization potency with live virus. There also remain outstanding questions as to the pharmacokinetics of the injected antigens. While the IgG1 subclass is preferentially trafficked into colostrum/milk, we have not ruled out the presence of IgG2a Fc fusions in the colostrum though concentrations are likely very low, if present at all. Tackling this question will require more sensitive methods than the ELISA approaches developed here, potentially using mass spectrometry to screen for RBD peptide presence in colostrum/milk. Nonetheless, the use of fusion proteins to stimulate antibody responses in ruminants may enable new pathways for efficient hyperimmune milk generation as well as in the development of next generation vaccines against ruminant pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P37">Technologies to increase the levels of circulating antibodies in ruminant animals are important for biotechnology and animal health applications. We explored the potency of immunomodulatory fusion proteins IgG2a Fc and GM-CSF to enhance the antibody response upon immunization. Our results show that fusion of ovine IgG2a Fc domains to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD model antigen elicits significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers in sheep than with the RBD antigen alone. Fusion of GM-CSF cytokines to the RBD was unsuccessful at increasing neutralizing titers, despite the observation of several high-responding individual animals. We further demonstrate that antibodies resulting from the fusion proteins are trafficked into milk following lambing and due to the polyclonal nature of the response are able to neutralize several SARS-CoV-2 variants. We suggest that the action of our antigenic fusions is mediated by Fc receptor engagement and that future designs could further improve immunogenicity via multimerization or the use of alternative isotypes as Fc domain fusions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Additional File 1; Supplementary information</label><media xlink:href="EMS158518-supplement-Additional_File_1__Supplementary_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d14aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the staff of the animal facility (AgResearch, Hamilton, New Zealand) for their help with trial management.

Neutralization generates a loss of ELISA signal as hACE2-HRP binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD is reduced by antibody blocking, with such approaches comparable in specificity and sensitivity to live viral assays (Bayarri-Olmos et al., 2021; Tan etal., 2020).<bold>b</bold> Plots showing relative inhibitory concentrations for RBD interaction with hACE2 for each trial group at weeks 6 and 9 as measured by serum dilution factor.
