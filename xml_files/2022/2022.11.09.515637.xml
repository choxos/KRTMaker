By this stage, all embryonic cells have already committed either to one of the somatic lineages (ectoderm, endoderm, mesoderm) or to the germline. The lack of pluripotent cells in adult life may be linked to organismal aging. Cnidarians (corals, and jellyfish) are an early branch of animals that do not succumb to age, but the developmental potential of their adult stem cells remains unclear. Here, we show that adult stem cells in the cnidarian <italic>Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus</italic> (known as i-cells) are pluripotent. We transplanted single i-cells from transgenic fluorescent donors to wild type recipients and followed them <italic>in vivo</italic> in the translucent animals. Single engrafted i-cells self-renewed and contributed to all somatic lineages and to gamete production, co-existing with and eventually displacing the allogeneic recipient’s cells. Hence, a fully functional, sexually competent individual can originate from a single adult i-cell. Given that some of their cells remain pluripotent beyond embryogenesis and throughout life, we conclude that <italic>Hydractinia</italic> embryos never complete gastrulation. Pluripotent i-cells underlie a regenerative, plant-like life history in these animals.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Pluripotency, the ability of a cell to differentiate to all somatic lineages and to germ cells, is a state that, in most animals, is restricted to early, pre-gastrulation embryos. <italic>In vitro,</italic> mammalian pluripotent cells can self-renew indefinitely while maintaining their plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Yilmaz and Benvenisty, 2019</xref>). Post gastrulation and throughout adulthood, most animals renew their tissues using lineage-restricted stem cells, collectively known as tissue stem cells. The limited ability of tissue stem cells to self-renew causes most animals to decline over time and eventually die.</p><p id="P3">Known exceptions to this rule are clonal invertebrates such as cnidarians and planarians. Some of these animals show little or no evidence for aging and can regenerate whole-bodies, including germ cells, from small tissue fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Issigonis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Khan and Newmark, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Martinez, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Sahu et al., 2017</xref>). Well-studied clonal animals possess adult stem cells but their properties at single cell resolution have only been studied in two animals – one planarian and one cnidarian. Single adult stem cells in the planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> (known as neoblasts) were shown to contribute to all somatic lineages. However, their germ cell competence remains uncertain, given that single cell experiments were only carried out with an asexual strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, stem cells in the cnidarian <italic>Hydra magnipapillata</italic> (known as i-cells) can give rise to cells of the neuroglandular lineage and to germ cells, but apparently not to the two epithelial layers of the body wall; the latter constitute distinct, self-renewing lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bode, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bosch and David, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Juliano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Siebert et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Both <italic>Schmidtea</italic> and <italic>Hydra</italic> are clonal yet solitary animals. Here, we addressed the developmental potential of i-cells in the clonal, colony-forming cnidarian <italic>Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Using single i-cell transplantation from transgenic fluorescent donors to wild type recipients, we find that these cells are pluripotent. A single i-cell can differentiate to all somatic cell types and to gametes under physiological conditions. The presence of embryonic-like, pluripotent cells throughout adult life raises questions about the timing of the gastrulation process in these animals and underlies their ability to grow indefinitely in a plant-like fashion.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>i-cells and their proliferative activity</title><p id="P5"><italic>Hydractinia</italic> i-cells derive from early blastomeres, first appearing lodged in the interstitial spaces of the embryo’s internal tissue. They are marked by <italic>Piwi1, Piwi2,</italic> and <italic>Soxb1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chrysostomou et al., 2022</xref>). Post metamorphosis of the swimming larva, the animal enters a sedentary life, attached to the substratum. It forms colonies that are composed of modular, clonal units called polyps, interconnected by a network of gastrovascular tubes known as stolons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>Hydractinia</italic> colonies grow indefinitely in a plant-like fashion by elongating their stolons and budding new polyps, showing no signs of age-related deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Gahan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The cell cycle of i-cells lacks a pronounced G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chrysostomou <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>) but whether these cells continuously cycle is unknown. We found that animals incubated in EdU for 4 days had nearly 100% of their polyp i-cells labeled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1</xref>). However, many stolonal i-cells remained EdU free even after 12 days of EdU incubation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2A</xref>). To investigate whether these non-cycling i-cells can re-enter the cell cycle, we injured the animals at day 12 of EdU incubation to induce a regenerative response, exposed them to BrdU for 24 hours, fixed them, and visualized the EdU, BrdU, and Piwi1 protein (an i-cell marker). We found many i-cells that were only BrdU positive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2B &amp; C</xref>). These cells had been quiescent for at least 12 days but re-entered the cell cycle following injury. We concluded that while polyp i-cells continuously cycle, stolonal i-cells include a pausing sub-population. Since isolated polyps are well able to regenerate stolons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bradshaw et al., 2015</xref>), the slow cycling stolonal i-cells are unlikely distinct from their fast-cycling counterparts in polyps.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The developmental potential of single i-cells</title><p id="P7">At the population level, it has been shown that i-cells proliferate, migrate, and differentiate to replace disposable somatic cells and also generate gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bradshaw <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">DuBuc et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Künzel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Müller, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Müller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Weismann, 1883</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether i-cells constitute several distinct, lineage-restricted stem cells or a pluripotent population. To address this question, we aimed to transplant a single, transgenic fluorescent i-cell into a wild type recipient. As i-cell donor, we used a female animal (clone 106) that carries two fluorescent reporter transgenes: one is a <italic>Piwi1-driven</italic> GFP; this reporter is only active in i-cells and germ cells but is downregulated following differentiation to somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">DuBuc <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). The other transgene is a <italic>β-tubulin</italic>-driven mScarlet; this transgene is expressed by all differentiated cells but suppressed in i-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">DuBuc <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). Hence, i-cells in this animal are readily identifiable, being only bright green but not red fluorescent. i-cell progeny and terminally differentiated cells are bright red and dim green due to the long half-life of GFP. Early germ cells express Piwi1::GFP and as they mature, also β-tubulin:: mScarlet. They are anatomically restricted to sexual polyps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">DuBuc <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). Our rationale was to transplant a single, green-only i-cell from feeding polyps to a wild type host. Products of self-renewal should remain green only, while all their differentiating/differentiated progeny should turn red and their green GFP fluorescence gradually dissipate. As recipient host, we selected the wild type male clone 291-10. The two animals are genetically histocompatible, accepting tissue grafts from each other to generate stable chimeras. The opposite sex of donor and recipient provided an additional genetic marker to distinguish between donor and host gametes, in addition to donor fluorescence. This was possible because sex in <italic>Hydractinia</italic> is genetically determined by an XY system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chen et al., 2022</xref>) and gamete production depends on the genetic sex of their i-cell progenitors rather than on the somatic gonadal environment. Therefore, male/female chimeras can contain eggs and sperm in the very same gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Mali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Müller, 1964</xref>). <italic>Hydractinia’s</italic> unlimited clonal growth allowed us to generate multiple genetically identical copies of both animals, facilitating biological repeat experiments in the same genetic background.</p><p id="P8">We first attempted to generate allogeneic mixed cell aggregates; these can regenerate a fully functional individual. Donor and recipient polyps were dissociated into a single cell suspension by incubating them in calcium- and magnesium-free seawater.</p><p id="P9">Dissociated cells were reaggregated by centrifugation. The resulting cell pellet regenerated an intact animal by day five post-aggregation. Adding many donor cells to wild type recipient cell suspension resulted in successful engraftment and chimera establishment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S3</xref>). However, when lowering the donor cell numbers to few or single i-cells, all our attempts to recover the fluorescent donor cells from the regenerated polyps failed, suggesting that engraftment under these conditions is highly ineffective. Indeed, on average, a cell pellet made of 25 dissociated polyps gave rise to a single polyp, showing that most cells are lost during dissociation and reaggregation.</p><p id="P10">We then attempted to inject fluorescent i-cells to intact hosts. For this, we dissociated donor animals under a fluorescence stereomicroscope and picked up a single, green-only i-cell using a microinjector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S4A</xref>). We then injected the cell to wild-type animals in different life stages. However, none of the injected i-cells could be found in the hosts’ tissue 24 hours later, showing that engraftment of injected i-cells is ineffectual as well.</p><p id="P11">Poor engraftment of i-cells could have resulted from the physical stress associated with tissue dissociation and mechanical handling. To transplant i-cells from donor to recipient without exposing them to unnecessary stress, we used whole tissue grafts. In their natural habitat, <italic>Hydractinia</italic> colonies grow on the surface of hermit crab shells. If a single shell is colonized by more than one larva, post metamorphosis, when the resulting polyps grows clonally, extending stolons of two allogeneic colonies may come into contact. The outcomes of these encounters depend genetically on sharing alleles at the highly polymorphic allorecognition complex. Colonies that share at least one allele of the complex can fuse and form chimeras that exchange migratory i-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Künzel <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010</xref>) whereas no shared alleles results in an aggressive rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cadavid et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Nicotra, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We positioned wild type, 291-10 colonies close to a growing stolon of transgenic fluorescent donors (clone 106) on glass slides. Stolons of both histocompatible colonies established contact, fused, and fluorescent i-cells were observed migrating from the female 106 colonies to the male 291-10 tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B &amp; C</xref>). We attempted to isolate a section of 291-10 stolon with only one, green donor i-cell. However, initial immigrating i-cells were too numerous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, we generated chimeras in which most cells were wild type, 291-10-derived, with only few fluorescent cells from the 106 clone. We then grafted 291-10 colonies to the chimeras. Because the number of fluorescent i-cells in the chimera was low, green immigrating i-cells were rare, allowing us to isolate sections of 291-10, wild type stolons with only one green fluorescent (106-derived) i-cell by cutting away the rest of the donor and recipient tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The size of these isolated stolonal pieces, which included no polyps, were less than 300 μm long, 40 μm wide, and 15 μm thick. This was small enough to exclude the presence of additional donor cells using fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) but contained sufficient cells to regenerate a whole new animal.</p><p id="P13">A total of five single cell grafts were successfully prepared. We allowed them to bud new polyps, feed, and become established colonies while taking daily observations under the fluorescence stereomicroscope. In each one of these animals, the single, green-only i-cell proliferated and gave rise both to new, green-only i-cells and to differentiated progeny that expressed red mScarlet and were dim green (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). High resolution confocal microscopy of live, anesthetized polyps (to prevent them from moving during imaging) revealed various cell types, all derived from the single transplanted i-cell. By morphology, they included the major <italic>Hydractinia</italic> cell lineages: epitheliomuscular cells, neurons, stinging cells (nematocytes), and germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Other cell types, such as gland cells, are difficult to identify <italic>in vivo</italic> within the tissue. Of note, all fluorescent germ cells were oocytes, consistent with the sex of the donor animal. They co-occupied the gonads alongside wild type sperm of the recipient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S4B</xref>). Spawned eggs were fertilized with 291-10 wild type sperm and became embryos that completed development to larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S1</xref>) and metamorphosed to young fluorescent colonies, the sexual offspring of the single transplanted i-cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S4C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The female clone 106 grows faster than the male clone 291-10 under laboratory conditions. Therefore, over time, the proportion of fluorescent cells in chimeras increased gradually, resulting in polyps with varying levels of transgenic, 106 representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). We selectively pruned tissues that contained only few or no fluorescent cells, thereby tipping the balance in favor of donor cells. Eventually, some polyps in these chimeric colonies became completely red/green without apparent wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S5</xref>). Spectral flow cytometry of dissociated polyps from 291-10 colonies that had received a single 106 i-cell showed that some of these animals were no longer chimeric as no wild type cells were detectable in their tissues, confirming that a total takeover by donor cells had occurred and that all cells of these individuals were exclusively derived from the one transplanted i-cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B-D</xref>). The same takeover dynamics occurred in each one of the five chimeras that had received a single donor i-cell. We concluded that the adult population of <italic>Hydractinia</italic> i-cells is mostly composed of pluripotent stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Pluripotent i-cells sustain a plant-like clonal growth</title><p id="P15"><italic>Hydractinia</italic> i-cells are a relatively rare cell population, comprising only 1% of the animal’s cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chrysostomou <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">DuBuc <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). Our data suggest that most if not all i-cells, marked by high <italic>Soxb1, Piwi1,</italic> and <italic>Piwi2</italic> expression, are pluripotent stem cells. Arguably, they represent the most effective solution for long-living clonal animals that generate plant-like colonies without a defined size or shape. By analogy, <italic>Hydractinia</italic> stolons resemble plant stems and shoots, feeding polyps are equivalent to plants’ leaves, and sexual polyps fulfill the role of flowers. If i-cells were a mixed population of lineage restricted stem cells, competition among lineages could result in local or global shortage of progenitors for certain cell types. A single, pluripotent stem cell population ensures that new stolons and polyps (both feeding and sexual) can develop at any region of the colony, providing that at least one i-cell is present at that location.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The time course of gastrulation in clonal animals</title><p id="P16">Two major events occur around the time of gastrulation. First, all embryonic cells lose pluripotency, committing either to one of the somatic germ layers (i.e., ectoderm, endoderm, mesoderm) or to the germline. Second, coordinated cell/tissue movements place the germ layers in their correct position. Like other cnidarians that lack a distinctive mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Technau, 2020</xref>), <italic>Hydractinia</italic> embryos undergo a morphogenetic process that resembles gastrulation, generating a bi-layered larva, composed of what appears to be an ectoderm and an endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Kraus et al., 2014</xref>). However, germ layer commitment occurs only partially during embryogenesis because i-cells remain pluripotent beyond this stage. Moreover, as i-cells migrate, proliferate, and differentiate, eventually, all adult tissues will have been derived from i-cells rather than from embryonic ectoderm or endoderm. We conclude that instead of being completed in embryogenesis, <italic>Hydractinia</italic> gastrulation lasts for a lifetime. Perpetual gastrulation continuously generates disposable somatic cells and gametes from a population of self-renewing i-cells that remain pluripotent and do not age. The <italic>Hydractinia</italic> body, therefore, is partly adult and partly embryonic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Animal culture and strains</title><p id="P17">Adult <italic>Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus</italic> clones were cultured in artificial seawater (salinity 28-32 ppt) at 20-22°c under a 14:10 light:dark regime.

Full spectrum signatures were obtained both for unstained and for Hoechst stained wild type cells (Clone 291), from the single transgenic Piwi1::GFP polyps (clone 107) and from single transgenic β-tubulin::mScarlet polyps (clone 102) to allow spectral unmixing and subtraction of autofluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">File S1</xref>). Following this, all Hoechst-stained controls were analysed. Single, nucleated cells were gated based on Hoechst-staining (positive vs negative for Hoechst emission spectra) and size (FSC-H vs FSC-A). Subsequently, single positive cells for GFP (GFP<sup>+</sup>), mScarlet (mScarlet<sup>+</sup>), and double positive cells for both GFP and mScarlet (double<sup>+</sup>) were gated as subpopulations, based on GFP<sup>+</sup> vs mScarlet<sup>+</sup> in the single stained controls. Hoechst stained double transgenic (clone 106) and Hoechst stained recipient samples were analysed based on this gating strategy and the percentage of cells within the combined GFP<sup>+</sup> or mScarlet<sup>+</sup> or double<sup>+</sup> gate was obtained. The percentage of cells within the combined gate in each of the recipient samples was normalised against the double transgenic donor (clone 106) sample as a percent of a percent. For the purpose of displaying the data, all plots show down sampled data based on the gate for single, nucleated cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Video S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS156931-supplement-Video_S1.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d72aAdDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS156931-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d72aAdDcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Patricia Calcagno, Amy Duclaux, and Laura Ryan for animal culturing, and all members of our lab for discussions and advice.
