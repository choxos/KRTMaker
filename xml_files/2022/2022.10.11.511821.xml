Despite recent improvements in TB diagnostics and increasing access to anti-tubercular therapy, TB mortality remains high with an estimated annual death rate of 15% of the 10 million annual TB incidents, with 21% of those deaths attributable to co-infection with HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). An important challenge to eliminating TB is that <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) infection presents as a dynamic continuum, ranging from rapidly cleared <italic>Mtb</italic> infection to active TB (ATB) disease. Currently available diagnostic tools are imperfect and are incapable of accurately identifying the different stages of TB pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Considering that there are no direct tests of mycobacterial burden, people who have immunological evidence of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and who are clinically free of disease have historically been considered to have “latent TB infection” (LTBI), although use of this term is increasingly criticized because of its inherent imprecision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). It has been estimated that 30% of people in the world have LTBI and PLWH who have LTBI are at higher risk of progressing to active disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Preventative therapies, including 6-9 months of isoniazid and more recently tested shorter courses of multiple drugs, like 3 months of rifapentine and isoniazid (3HP), have been successful in reducing the short-term risk of progression to ATB in PLWH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The impact of TB prevention therapies has been limited by the indirect nature of diagnostic tests for LTBI. The tuberculin skin test (TST) uses purified protein derivatives (PPD) from <italic>Mtb</italic> and has significant rates of cross-reactivity with the <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG strain used to vaccinate infants in TB endemic countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IGRA tests have improved specificity for <italic>Mtb</italic> and are therefore the current gold standard for determining <italic>Mtb</italic> infection status, however, both tests (TST and IGRA) rely on T cell immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and therefore fail to determine whether viable <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is present. Additionally, both tests perform less well in immunocompromised people with decreased T cell function, including PLWH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Moreover, the indirect nature of these tests limits the field’s ability to precisely define the pathogenesis of LTBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), which is required to design more effective TB prevention strategies that are targeted to the optimal stage in the spectrum of TB disease.</p><p id="P8">In this study, we sought to measure rates of and characteristics associated with LTBI in a peri-urban setting in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa by comparing <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IFN-γ and <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IgG antibodies in otherwise healthy HIV-negative and HIV-positive adults.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Study population and clinical characteristics</title><p id="P9">Data and plasma from participants who were screened for the Phefumula cohort, a research bronchoscopy study described previously in Muema <italic>et al,</italic> 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) and Khuzwayo <italic>et al,</italic> 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), were used for this analysis.

Sixty-five of them were HIV-negative, and 53 were HIV-positive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). To meet enrollment criteria, participants had to be feeling well, have no prior history of TB or other co-morbidity. All the HIV-positive participants were newly diagnosed and antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve. The majority of participants were female (69%), with sex distribution balanced between the HIV-positive (71% females) and HIV-negative groups (66% females) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.6969). The HIV-positive group was slightly older than the HIV-negative group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0234). CD4 T-cell count was measured for all study participants and the median (interquartile range, IQR) for the HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants was 358 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (IQR: 210 - 575) and 870 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (IQR: 710 - 1 201), respectively (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).

To test this hypothesis, we stratified the entire cohort into quartiles by CD4 T-cell count. Quartile 1 included only HIV-positive individuals and quartile 4 included only HIV-negative individuals; Quartiles 2 and 3 each contained HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. When compared within CD4 quartile, HIV-positive people had higher QFT positivity than HIV-negative people (<italic>p</italic> = 0.008, and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 for quartiles 2 and 3 respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).

There was a significant positive correlation for some <italic>Mtb</italic>-related antigens i.e. HspX-specific IgG (<italic>r</italic> = 0.3337, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0003), Ag85a/b-specific IgG (<italic>r</italic> = 0.3101, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0009), PPD IgG-specific (<italic>r</italic> = 0.3216, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0006), ESAT-6/CFP-10-specific IgG (<italic>r</italic> = 0.2152, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0233), while others including Apa-specific IgG, GroES-specific IgG, Crystallin-specific IgG, LAM-specific IgG (and the non-<italic>Mtb</italic> control Flu/HA-specific IgG,) did not correlate with total IgG titer. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The absence of correlation of total IgG with influenza HA-specific IgG, in contrast to positive correlations seen in multiple <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens, suggests an <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific process, that is not adequately explained by hypergammaglobulinemia alone. However, when participants were stratified by HIV status, there was no significant correlation between total IgG and any <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific antibodies, suggesting that those correlations observed in the unstratified group were driven by HIV status. Thus, HIV-mediated hypergammaglobulinemia does not appear to entirely explain the increased <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IgG levels found in HIV-positive individuals in this cohort.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Lowest ESAT-6/CFP-10 IFN-γ production but highest ESAT-6/CFP-10 IgG in HIV-positive people with low CD4 cell counts</title><p id="P23">The QuantiFERON assay measures <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific T cell immune response to specific <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens ESAT-6/CFP-10 by quantifying IFN-γ produced in response to these antigens. Measurement of ESAT-6/CFP-10-specific IFN-γ and IgG in the same individuals, stratified by CD4 cell count quartile demonstrated that people in the lowest CD4 count quartile produced the lowest levels of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IFN-γ (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0005) and the highest levels of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IgG (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">In a group of well characterized of HIV-negative and antiretroviral-naïve HIV-positive people from KZN, South Africa we identified discordant results between levels of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IFN-γ and IgG, which was most striking in HIV-positive people with low CD4 cell counts. We found that 58% of adults in our study population were latently infected with <italic>Mtb,</italic> as defined by a positive QFT test. Male sex, older age and higher CD4 count were associated with QFT positivity. In contrast, in the same group of people, ESAT-6/CFP-10<italic>-</italic>specific IgG was significantly higher in people who were HIV-positive and had low CD4 cell counts. Notably, in participants in the lowest CD4 count quartile, levels of ESAT-6/CFP-10-specific IFN-γ released were lowest and levels of anti-ESAT-6/CFP-10<italic>-</italic>specific IgG antibodies were highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Antibodies to 6 of 7 <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific antibodies followed this same pattern, while a control antibody specific to the hemagglutinin protein of influenza, did not. These results suggest that the QFT assay may underestimate LTBI among immunosuppressed people with HIV and <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IgG may be a useful alternative biomarker for <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p><p id="P25">The current gold standard for the diagnosis of LTBI are interferon gamma release assays like the QFT, which rely on host T cell function to produce IFN-γ in response to <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation. Interestingly, in our study HIV status was not an independent modulator of QFT positivity, while CD4 count was. Across the entire study population, there appeared to be no difference between QFT rates in HIV-negative and HIV-positive participants. By stratifying participants into CD4 count quartiles, we observed that HIV-positive people with relatively preserved CD4 counts (429 – 923 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) had higher QFT positivity when compared to HIV-negative individuals with similar CD4 counts. Quantitative analysis of IFN-γ production in response to ESAT-6/CFP-10 showed that HIV-positive participants in the lowest CD4 quartile produced significantly lower levels IFN-γ compared to HIV-positive people in the higher CD4 count quartiles. In the absence of plausible explanation behind why people with lower CD4 cell counts, would have less exposure to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, it is likely that these results are due to CD4 T cell depletion and/ or exhaustion causing false-negative QFT tests in this group. Our QFT positivity results are in line with previous studies that have found lower rates of IGRA positivity in people with lower CD4 T cell count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) and the underestimation of QFT positivity in PLWH is consistent with prior literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P26">We also found that increasing age was an independent predictor of QFT positivity and that is consistent with a cumulative <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure over years of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Male sex was also an independent predictor of QFT positivity in this study and is consistent with reports from other settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). The mechanisms for higher rates of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and TB disease in males is not precisely defined, but is thought to be due to a combination of social factors that may promote <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure, such as environmental and occupational exposures and tobacco use, and increased biological susceptibility due to the differential effects of sex hormones on TB immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p><p id="P27">IgG antibodies against <italic>Mtb</italic>-related antigens were considered potentially useful markers for <italic>Mtb</italic> infection over a decade ago, but further development of diagnostic modalities utilizing them was discouraged by WHO (2012) in favor of using the available methods at that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Here, using a customized Luminex assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), we found that HIV-positive individuals had higher levels of ESAT-6/CFP-10 IgG compared to HIV-negative people; this finding contrasted with the similar QFT results observed in HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups. Older age and decreased CD4 count were also associated with increased ESAT-6/CFP-10-specific IgG, congruent with the QFT results. For QFT, we observed the lowest rates of positivity in individuals in the lowest CD4 count quartile, in contrast to the <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific plasma circulating anti-ESAT-6/CFP-10-specific IgG antibodies which had the highest concentration in this group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Antibodies to 6 of the 7 <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens assessed followed the same pattern as anti-ESAT-6/CFP-10-specific IgGs while the non-<italic>Mtb</italic>-related IgG control (the hemagglutinin protein of influenza) did not vary between HIV or CD4 groups, suggesting that the finding of higher <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific antibodies was pathogenspecific. Interestingly, LAM-specific IgG was not influenced by HIV infection or low CD4 count. A possible reason for this is that LAM is not specific to <italic>Mtb,</italic> and is found in the cell wall of other species of <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> that are ubiquitous in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Hypergammaglobulinemia which has been linked to HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) may be a non-specific reason for elevated Mtb-specific antibodies in PLWH. Consistent with prior literature, in this study, total IgG titers were higher in HIV-positive participants. Hypergammaglobulinemia may partially explain higher anti-<italic>Mtb</italic> antibodies in PLWH, but we observed contrasting patterns between hemagglutinin-specific (<italic>Mtb</italic> non-specific) and <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IgG, indicating that hypergammaglobulinemia alone does not explain higher anti-<italic>Mtb</italic> antibody levels in those with low CD4 counts. Further experiments with independent and larger cohorts are required to determine whether elevated levels of anti-<italic>Mtb</italic>-related IgG can be detected independent of or when controlling for generalized hypergammaglobulinemia and whether detection of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific antibodies may be a useful diagnostic strategy, particularly in HIV-positive participants with low CD4 counts. Overall, our results point to a potential diagnostic role for <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific antibodies to provide a way of defining <italic>Mtb</italic>-infection status that is not dependent on T cell function.</p><p id="P29">This study has several limitations. These data were collected from a convenience sample and are therefore not population representative, which limits generalizability. All HIV-positive individuals assessed were antiretroviral therapy naïve, which also limits generalizability. Limitations of the data include the lack of positive/negative cut-off thresholds or absolute quantification for the beads-based <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IgG assays used here. The assay also measures relative concentration rather than an absolute quantitative measure of concentration that would allow direct comparison to total IgG concentrations, which would be required to address the contribution of hypergammaglobulinemia more definitively. Future work that combines well-defined HIV-positive (including people on antiretroviral therapy) and HIV-negative individuals from areas of high and low TB endemicity will be needed to advance the evaluation of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IgGs as alternative biomarkers for LTBI detection.</p><p id="P30">Even with its limitations and possible under-estimate of LTBI in HIV-positive people with low CD4 counts, our finding of QFT-confirmed LTBI in 58% of 18-50 years old adults is higher than has previously been reported in a generalized South African population. In a previous study using TST, only 34.3% of adults in South African urban townships around Johannesburg were reported to have LTBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Mathematical models estimation using TST data supports the above results, reporting 30-40% South Africans having LTBI according to those estimations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). A TST survey among gold miners in Johannesburg showed LTBI rates as high as 85%, which correlates with the higher levels of active TB cases identified within gold miners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). A survey in a Cape Town township showed that about 40-50% of adolescents had LTBI using QFT assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), in line with the rates we report here. However, a survey of adolescents in rural KZN using QFT showed a much lower rate of 23% LTBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). With high rates of latent TB infection, South Africa is prioritizing preventative therapies, and to this end less expensive, easier and more accurate tests for LTBI especially in HIV-positive people are urgently needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Overall, our data suggest high rates of latent TB infection among HIV-negative and HIV-positive adults and that the QFT assay likely underestimates LTBI in HIV-positive people with low CD4 count. Eliminating TB remains challenging due to the limitations in diagnosing TB at various stages along the infection spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Furthermore, while increasing access to TB preventative therapy is a global priority, very limited screening for LTBI in South Africa has been done, in part because of the indirect nature and complexity of interpretation required by the current assays. <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IgG antibodies may hold promise as alternative biomarkers for LTBI, especially in people with low CD4 count.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We appreciatively acknowledge the following: the Phefumula study participants who were all based at the KwaDabeka Clinic in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa; the Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI) Clinical core study team for recruiting participants and collecting samples in KwaDabeka clinic; AHRI Biorepository team for their assistance with sample transport to AHRI laboratories, sample distribution and long-term storage of samples and the AHRI Data team for facilitating data collection and data management.</p></ack><sec id="S23" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data sharing</title><p id="P32">Deidentified participants data used to generate results for this work will be available upon request.

is the current gold standard for determining latent TB infection. However, since these tests measure immunoreactivity to Mtb peptides, they are indirect measures of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and their performance characteristics are impacted by co-infections and comorbidities that influence immune responses, including HIV. Recently, a human phenotype has been defined in people who are highly exposed to <italic>Mtb</italic> but consistently test negative for evidence of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection by IGRA and tuberculin skin test (TST). These individuals have been observed to have a unique profile of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific antibodies when compared to the classical IGRA positive LTBI group, suggesting that <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific antibodies may identify additional people with a history of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection or exposure when compared to IGRA alone. Comparison of IGRA and Mtb-specific antibodies in people living with HIV has not previously been performed.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Added value of this study</title><p>Here, we concurrently assessed <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IFN-γ production and IgG in a cohort of 118 well-defined HIV-negative and antiretroviral naïve HIV-positive individuals from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, a highly TB endemic area. We found a discrepancy between <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IFN-γ and <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IgG levels, particularly in HIV-positive individuals with low CD4 cell counts. Notably people with the lowest CD4 counts had the highest levels of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IgG levels in the plasma, and the lowest levels of QTF positivity.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Implications of all evidence available</title><p>IGRAs may underestimate <italic>Mtb</italic> infection status, especially in people with HIV infection or who have T cell depletion or dysfunction. <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IgG antibodies indicate development of a B cell response to <italic>Mtb</italic> and may have promise as an alternative biomarker of TB immunoreactivity that does not depend on T cell function.</p></sec></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Factors associated with QuantiFERON positivity.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Participants (n = 118) stratified according to HIV status and QuantiFERON test results expressed as percentage (%) positive (red bars) or negative (blue bars) per group.
