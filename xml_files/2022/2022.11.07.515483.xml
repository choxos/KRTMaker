There are currently 113 known Ad types infecting humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), in addition to an even larger diversity of non-human Ads infecting other species including primates. Thanks to their high manufacturability, gene delivery efficiency, genetic stability and ability to package large transgenes, Ad-derived vectors are the most prominent type of vectors used in gene therapy or vaccine development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Notably, the AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-nCoV19, derived from chimpanzee Ad type Y25, hereby termed ChAdY25) and Janssen (derived from human Ad26, hereby designated after its capsid as Ad26) COVID vaccines have already been administered well over 2 billion times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), and established Ad vaccines as one of the most powerful tools against pandemics.</p><p id="P5">However, clinical applications of Ad vectors still face several obstacles, among which the ability of certain Ad types to interact with blood proteins after systemic administration or local injection, including with prothrombin, the most abundant coagulation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Moreover, Ad type 5 (Ad5) displays a strong and potentially pathological liver tropism due to its binding to the coagulation factor X (fX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) on the fifth and seventh hypervariable regions (HVR) of its hexon protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), the main Ad capsid protein. Likewise, the ChAdY25 and Ad26 vaccines have been associated with very rare cases of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), with an incidence in the order of magnitude of 1 case per 100,000 vaccinated persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). This disorder usually occurs within 5 to 20 days after the first vaccine injection, involves thrombosis in the cerebral venous sinus, the splanchnic vein or other unusual thromboembolic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), and is lethal in 23-40% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). It was recently discovered that VITT is caused by the binding of the vectors to platelet factor 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) (PF4, also known as CXCL4), which can activate a cascade of immune reactions, notably the production of auto-antibodies, leading to severe adverse effects in a small subset of patients. PF4 is a 7.8 kDa cationic protein secreted by activated thrombocytes whose physiological function is thought to be the recruitment of thrombocytes on glycosaminoglycans exposed in vascular injuries and / or the opsonization of the negatively charged surfaces of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). PF4 blood concentrations lies usually around 10 ng/mL, but can reach 3-15 μg/mL in case of platelet activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The development of safer vaccine and gene therapy vector platforms may protect patients from rare but fatal side effects and improve public trust in medical treatments and prophylaxes. Therefore, we aimed to identify Ad types with lower PF4 binding. We screened a collection of 23 reporter gene carrying Ad vectors from different types, representative of the natural diversity of human-infecting Ads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). To this purpose, we established a variety of on-target techniques for fast, robust and sensitive assessment of protein-virus interactions. Our techniques revealed that Ad34 lacked detectable PF4 binding. Furthermore, using a series of Ad5 variants carrying genetic or chemical hexon modifications, we found that HVR1 deletion or shielding also ablated PF4 binding. This confirmed the hypothesis that PF4 binds adenoviruses on the hexon protein, and identifies the HVR1 hexon loop as one critical interaction site.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Screening of an Ad collection indicated that Ad34 lacked PF4 binding</title><p id="P7">In order to rapidly screen a large Ad collection, we established the ELISA-qPCR technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1</xref>) with which we could confirm preexisting data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) by detecting PF4 binding of Ad5, ChAdY25 and Ad26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Using ELISA-qPCR, we screened 23 different human Ad types for PF4 binding. Ad34 and Ad50 were the only types for which PF4 binding could not be detected in any of the experimental repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Since PF4 binding on Ads may be driven by electrostatic interactions between the negative hexon protein and the positive PF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), we studied by electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) whether Ad binding strength to PF4 was correlated with a net negative surface charge measured as zeta potential. However, the more negative potential of Ad34 compared with other Ads showed that a negatively charged surface was not sufficient for PF4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2b</xref>). These measurements nevertheless indicated that our Ad50 suspension contained viral particle (VP) aggregates and its apparent lack of PF4 binding may be an artifact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>PF4 increased aggregate formation, cell binding and infection of permissive cells by Ad5 and Ad69 but not Ad34</title><p id="P10">We sought to confirm the results obtained so far by screening with independent techniques a subset of vectors which had shown varying PF4 binding strength, namely Ad5, ChAdY25 (strong binding), Ad69 (weak binding), and Ad34 (no detectable binding). First, we used the novel Aggregate Pull-Down (APD) technique to quantify Ad VP aggregates that may form upon interaction with PF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3a</xref>). As expected, we observed PF4-induced aggregation of Ad5, ChAdY25 and Ad69, but not Ad34, confirming the lack of PF4 binding of this Ad type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Ads are able to bind to erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), leading to substantial vector sequestration and retargeting following systemic administrations. Therefore, studying the influence of Ad-PF4 interactions on erythrocyte binding may yield interesting first hints into their <italic>in vivo</italic> consequences. We observed that PF4 had no influence on Ad34 but substantially increased erythrocyte docking of a fiber-modified Ad5 with ablated CAR tropism (Ad5-ΔCAR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We finally tested whether PF4 binding impacted Ad infectivity. Incubation of Ad5 or Ad69 particles with PF4 increased VP uptake in A549 cells by around 2 to 3 fold in average, while PF4 did not influence Ad34 internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3d</xref>). PF4 effect on infectivity was not significantly altered by deletion of CAR (primary receptor of Ad5 and Ad69 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>)) or CD46 (primary receptor of Ad34 and Ad69 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>)) in target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3d</xref>). In order to test whether PF4 enhanced productive infections by Ad5 and Ad69 or only abortive internalizations, we measured Ad-driven luciferase expression in infected cells and detected an increase for both Ads and in all tested cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3e</xref>). Likewise, PF4 increased Ad-driven GFP expression in cells infected by Ad5 and Ad69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3f</xref>). For Ad34, PF4 did not modify the mean GFP fluorescence intensity but was associated with a 14% increase in the proportion of GFP-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The hexon HVR1 loop is necessary for Ad5 binding of PF4</title><p id="P13">Baker <italic>et al</italic>. predicted by brownian dynamics modeling that PF4 binds to hexon HVRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), with HVR1 being the most likely candidate for the ChAdY25 vaccine. In order to gather further information on the location of PF4 binding site(s), we compared by ELISA-qPCR the PF4 binding of Ad5 variants with chemically or genetically modified hexons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4a</xref>). Point mutations in HVR1, HVR5 and HVR7, the latter being known to ablate fX binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), did not prevent PF4 binding, contrary to deletion of the full HVR1 loop. PEGylation of HVR1 and HVR5, i.e. covalent linking of a large inert polymer which sterically prevents interactors to bind near its linkage site, also inhibited PF4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4b</xref>). The lack of PF4 binding by the HVR1-deleted Ad5 was confirmed by APD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P14">SKOV-3 cells are permissive to Ad5-fX complexes, but largely refractory to free Ad5 VPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). We observed that Ad5 incubation with PF4 prior, simultaneously or following incubation with fX inhibited fX-driven SKOV-3 cell infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4c</xref>). Since this phenomenon occurred irrespective of the incubation order, this may suggest that there is no competition between PF4 and fX for binding on Ads.</p><p id="P15">We compared the hexon structure and sequence of Ad34 with other Ad types, including the closely related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) but PF4-binding Ad35 and Ad14, in order to identify structural elements unique to Ad34 which may explain its apparent lack of PF4 binding. A large proportion of residues unique to Ad34 are clustered in HVR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4d</xref>), corresponding to the most likely binding site candidate identified by Baker <italic>et al</italic>. HVR1 is predicted to be the only hexon site with substantially different conformation in Ad34 compared with Ad35 and Ad14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary video 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">Here we establish an armamentarium composed of user-friendly, scalable and affordable techniques for the study of virus–protein interactions including ELISA-qPCR, APD and infectivity assays. We confirmed the specificity of ELISA-qPCR in the case of a few known interactors of Ad5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1a</xref>). This method also displayed a relatively high sensitivity, as shown by the significant detection of PF4-Ad5 binding even at low VP concentration and despite the relatively low affinity of this interaction (K<sub>D</sub> = 789 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>)). Our assays almost systematically yielded concordant results and constitute a panoply of independent techniques facilitating the screen of large Ad collections for PF4 binding with results robust across experimental conditions. However, our assays remain so far only qualitative and appeared sensitive to the quality of virus preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2</xref>). Further experiments using varying concentrations of VPs and proteins are warranted to elucidate their sensitivity cut-offs. Finally, additional tests should assess the range of applications of our new techniques, which in theory extend to all virus-protein interactions in the case of ELISA-qPCR.</p><p id="P17">We started to investigate the consequences of PF4 binding on Ad tropism and potential <italic>in vivo</italic> interactions. PF4 induced a strong increase in erythrocyte binding of a fiber-modified Ad5 vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3c</xref>). Likewise, PF4 induced a strong increase in Ad5 and Ad69 infectivity of permissive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3d,e,f</xref>). Measurements of Ad5 luciferase expression (at 24 hours post infection) indicated a lower PF4-induced infectivity increase than VP uptake measurements (at 3 hours post infection), and could not be conducted in A549-ΔCAR cells, because of Ad5 toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3e</xref>). We therefore used a replication-deficient Ad5 vector with a WT capsid for our GFP fluorescence measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figures 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). For both Ad5 and Ad69, a similar increase in infectivity was observed in cells lacking the virus primary receptors, suggesting that the infectivity increase does not result from specific interactions between PF4 and a cellular receptor. We hypothesize that it instead stems from a partial neutralization of Ad particle surface, which decreases electrostatic repulsion with the extracellular matrix, similar to cationic polymers used to improve the delivery of non-viral particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). In order to test if the PF4-mediated infectivity increase is explained only by the formation of VP aggregates (as observed by APD) or if PF4 also increased the infectivity of free VPs, we also quantified Ad-driven GFP fluorescence in infected A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3f</xref>). Since not only the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) but also the proportion of GFP-positive cells was increased by pre-incubation of Ad5 and Ad69 (but once again not Ad34) with PF4, we favour the second hypothesis.</p><p id="P18">In the same experiment, PF4 surprisingly appeared to induce a small but significant increase in the percentage of GFP-positive cells after Ad34 infection. This contradicted all other results regarding Ad34, which until then had never been affected by the presence of PF4. This may stem from an influence of PF4 on cell viability or metabolism affecting GFP expression, decrease in virus samples quality over time, or indicate a very weak PF4 binding by Ad34 that remained under the detection threshold of the other methods used. In our opinion, this does not exclude Ad34 as a promising candidate for vectors with reduced PF4 binding, but warrants testing its PF4 affinity with more accurate methods such as SPR.</p><p id="P19">The inhibition of PF4 binding by HVR1 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4b</xref>) and PEGylation of HVR1 and HVR5 (which is spatially very close to HVR1) proved that PF4 binds to the hexon of Ad5. Moreover, these results and the comparison of hexon structures and sequences of PF4 binder versus non-binder Ad types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4d</xref>) point to HVR1 as the most likely binding site. Furthermore, the inhibition of fX-dependent SKOV-3 infection by Ad5 after coincubation with PF4 and fX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4c</xref>) suggested that PF4 inhibits an infection step downstream of fX. Indeed, the affinity of Ad5 for PF4 is substantially lower than its affinity for fX (K<sub>D</sub> = 789 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) versus 1.83 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) or 2.7 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>)), thus fX would probably prevail over PF4 if a competition occurred, even though other factors such as PF4-fX interactions may be at play. Combined with the observation that mutations that ablate fX binding had no impact on PF4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4b</xref>), this suggested that the PF4 binding site is separated from that of fX. However, the study of additional hexon variants would be required to fully elucidate the binding site of PF4 and whether it interferes with fX for hexon docking. Furthermore, given the flexibility of hexon HVRs, it can be envisioned that PF4 does not have a unique binding site.</p><p id="P20">Like other <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, our investigation of PF4 binding to Ads either in optiMEM, PBS or immobilized on an ELISA plate may not fully recapitulate the interactions occurring in the blood or in tissues, which are more complex environments in which other interaction partners can be involved. In particular, understanding the immunological consequences of the modified Ad cell binding and infection patterns observed here will require dedicated investigation. Still, we can reasonably expect that the Ad types for which we detected no PF4 binding would at least display lower binding <italic>in vivo</italic> than other Ads.</p><p id="P21">Adenoviral vaccines, gene therapy vectors and oncolytic vectors without VITT risk may prevent a number of patients deaths and even more non-fatal complications, as well as improve the public trust in medical treatments and adherence epidemics containment measures. Since we have not observed conclusive PF4 binding to Ad34, using several techniques and three different virus preparations of confirmed quality, this type should be considered as a promising vector candidate. Adding to its potential high safety profile, Ad34 has a very low seroprevalence (Wang <italic>et al</italic>., Journal of Virology, in press). Alternatively, the safety of existing vaccine platforms may be directly improved by HVR1 deletion or pseudotyping with Ad34 HVR1. Moreover, Ad types not included in this study, notably simian Ads, may be screened for PF4 binding using the panoply of techniques established in this article (ELISA-qPCR, infectivity assays and Ad-PF4 aggregates or erythrocytes pull-down) in order to identify novel candidates and gather new insights about Ad-blood interactions and VITT.</p><p id="P22">Our data unequivocally demonstrated that polymer shielding is a means to control the unwanted interaction with PF4. Future developments on polymer modification of non-Ad5 types will be required to assess its full potential, notably in the context of repeated Ad delivery as often required by vaccination or therapy regimens.</p><p id="P23">Thrombotic disorders have been associated not only with adenoviral vaccines, but also adeno-associated gene therapy vectors (AAVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Even though the AAV-associated thrombotic microangiopathy differs from the Ad-related VITT in its clinical presentation, it is striking that the AAV9 type associated with all identified cases binds to PF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Thus, investigations on PF4 binding of non-Ad viral vectors and the potential pathologic consequences are warranted.</p><p id="P24">To conclude, we establish here a novel technique armamentarium facilitating fast, affordable, sensitive and specific assessment of virus-protein interactions. Furthermore, we identified several Ads, most notably Ad34 but also Ad5 hexon variants such as an HVR1-deleted mutant, which lack PF4 binding. These results may represent a milestone in the development of safer Ad vectors.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Vector acquisition</title><p id="P25">The Ad-GLN library, already described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), contains vectors from different types that express TurboGFP, NanoLuc luciferase and the selection marker kanamycin/neomycin under a synthetic CAG promoter in the deleted E3 region.

VPs were incubated 10 min. at 37°C in optiMEM with or without 10μg/r⋂L of PF4, before being allowed to infect cells at 20 vpc. 24 hpi, Ad-expressed GFP mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and proportion of GFP-positive cells (% GFP+ cells) were measured by flow cytometry. Ad34 and Ad69 were obtained from the Ad-GLN library, while an El-deleted, GFP-expressing Ad5 vector was used. N≥9, three to four independent repeats. Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were used to assess whether PF4-associated fold increases are significantly different from 1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS159657-f004"/><graphic xlink:href="EMS159657-f005"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>PF4 do not compete with factor X for binding on Ad5 hexon.</title><p><bold>(a)</bold> Schematic representation of the Ad5 hexon genetic and chemical variants studied. These variants include: D151C and T273C point mutations; covalently linking a cysteine residue with a 5kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG) polymer, which prevents binding on part of the hexon surface by steric competition; deletion of the HVR1 loop; and T425A substitution, which ablates the binding of fX. The El-deleted, GFP-expressing Ad5 vector was used as control (Ad5). HVR: hyper-variable region. PEG: poly-ethylene glycol.

The El-deleted, GFP-expressing Ad5 vector was incubated (from left to right) in optiMEM, with fX, PF4, or both proteins simultaneously or fX first or PF4 first. VPs were then allowed to infect SKOV-3 cells. Infectivity was measured either by quantification of GFP fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry 3 days post infection (top) or qPCR titration of internalized genomes 3 hours post infection (bottom). qPCR genome copy numbers and fluorescence intensity were normalized on the average of the, Ad5 alone” sample. N=9, three independent repeats. For both measurement types, pairwise comparisons were conducted by Mann-Whitney U test between the „Ad5 + fX” sample and each of the other samples, always indicating significant difference with p&lt;0.001. <bold>(d)</bold> Hexon residues specific of Ad34 cluster in HVR loops. The hexon sequences of serotypes with strong (Ad5, Ad14, Ad26, ChAdOx), weak (Ad35, Ad69) or no (Ad34) PF4 binding were aligned with the MAFFT online tool. HVRs are indicated by blue rectangles, residues specific to Ad34 among the chosen serotypes in red, and ChAdOx1 residues with high or medium probability of interaction with PF4 according to Baker <italic>et al</italic>. modelisation in purple.
