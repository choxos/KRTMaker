Each of these protein-protein interactions is therefore a potential drug target. These host-virus interactions often involve a disordered protein region on one side of the interface and a folded protein domain on the other. Here, we used proteomic peptide phage display (ProP-PD) to identify peptides from the intrinsically disordered regions of the human proteome that bind to folded protein domains encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Eleven folded domains of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were found to bind peptides from human proteins. Of 281 high/medium confidence peptides, 23 interactions involving eight SARS-CoV-2 protein domains were tested by fluorescence polarization, and binding was observed with affinities spanning the whole micromolar range. The key specificity determinants were established for six of these domains, two based on ProP-PD and four by alanine scanning SPOT arrays. Finally, two cell-penetrating peptides, targeting Nsp9 and Nsp16, respectively, were shown to function as inhibitors of viral replication. Our findings demonstrate how high-throughput peptide binding screens simultaneously provide information on potential host-virus interactions and identify ligands with antiviral properties.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P1">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has overwhelmed hospitals around the world and pushed public health facilities to their limits in the past years. Rapid vaccine development has drastically reduced this burden, but given the high rate of vaccine breakthrough cases, better post-infection therapeutic interventions are needed. Currently, many academic and industrial laboratories are working to develop new drugs or testing the effect of repurposing existing drugs against SARS-CoV-2. For example, molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue targeting viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, and paxlovid is a combination of two protease inhibitors, one previously used against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the other developed to target the 3C-like protease of coronaviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. However, to be prepared for future epidemics and pandemics, it is important to continue developing new broad-spectrum antivirals such that emerging viral threats can be treated directly and immediately with approved drugs, preferably administered orally. This is particularly important for SARS-like coronaviruses, given the efficiency of human-to-human transmission, and has been demonstrated by recurrent outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P2">While most drugs work by inhibiting enzymes, the pharmaceutical industry is turning its attention to the more challenging but largely untouched area of protein-protein interaction interfaces. To this end, several approaches have been developed to identify novel drug targets by mapping the virus-host protein-protein interactome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In a particular class of protein-protein interactions, an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of a protein interacts with a folded domain of the binding partner. The most common interaction modules in IDRs are short linear motifs (SLiMs). SLiMs are usually less than 10 amino acid residues long and degenerate, with only 3-4 residues accounting for most of the specificity and affinity. Consequently, SLiMs can evolve <italic>ex nihilo</italic> through accumulation of a few mutations. Because viruses evolve relatively rapidly, viral mimicry of host protein SLiMs has been proposed as a commonly used strategy, and several examples have been described across most viral clades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Proteins expressed from viral genomes therefore often contain SLiMs which compete with native host protein-protein interactions to hijacking cellular machinery. Conversely, folded domains of the viral proteome can interact with both human and viral SLiMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Each scenario provides a drug target, <italic>i.e</italic>., the folded domain of human or viral protein can be targeted with a peptide or peptidomimetic.</p><p id="P3">The SARS-CoV-2 proteome consists of 29 proteins, encoded by 14 open reading frames (ORF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The first two reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, encode 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1 to Nsp16), formed after post-translational proteolytic cleavage by viral proteases. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 genome codes four structural proteins: spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E), as well as nine accessory proteins (ORFs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, 9c, and 10) <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>)</bold>. Non-structural proteins facilitate viral mRNA replication and translation. Nsp1 is responsible for suppressing host translation while simultaneously promoting viral mRNA translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Nsp2 promotes viral evasion of the innate immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Nsp3 serves as a central hub coordinating different steps of viral replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. It consists of several stably folded globular domains, namely two ubiquitin-like domains (Ubl1, Ubl2), an ADP-ribose-1”-(phosphatase) hydrolase (ADRP), three SARS-unique domains (SUD-N, SUD-M and SUD-C), a papain-like protease domain (PLpro) and a nucleic acid binding domain (NAB). In addition to Nsp3, Nsp4 and Nsp6 are also involved in double membrane vesicle formation and organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Nsp5 serves as the main protease (MPro), that proteolytically processes the ORF1a and ORF1b into final proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Nsp7, Nsp8, and Nsp12 form the core replication complex with Nsp12 being the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and Nsp7/Nsp8 forming a hexadecameric complex, that enhances processivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In addition, Nsp9 also associates with the replication complex to promote 5’-capping of viral RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The addition of a 5’ cap to the viral RNA is crucial for RNA stability as well as efficient translation and requires several steps, with the Nsp10/Nsp14 and Nsp10/Nsp16 complexes also contributing to the final steps of the process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In both cases, Nsp10 activates the catalytic activity of Nsp14 and Nsp16. Apart from its function in the 5’-capping process, Nsp14 also functions as an exoribonuclease facilitating the proofreading function of the replication complex. Finally, Nsp13 is a helicase, that unwinds the RNA and promotes efficient transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, while Nsp15 serves as a uridine-specific endoribonuclease that facilitates the evasion of the host immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">To investigate the virus-human protein-protein interactome of folded protein domains encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome and SLiMs in the human proteome, we created a collection of protein domain expression constructs from SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These protein domains were used as baits in proteomic peptide phage display (ProP-PD) screens against a Human Disorderome (HD2) peptide library that displays 1 million peptides from the human proteome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The screen identified peptide-binding SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human peptide ligands that were validated with binding assays and tested in a SARS-CoV-2 infection assay. Our results suggest that protein domains of SARS-CoV-2 may serve as targets for the design and development of peptidomimetic antivirals.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Large-scale identification of SLiM-based interactions and interaction motifs of SARS-CoV-2 proteins</title><p id="P5">We generated a collection of 31 expression constructs of known or predicted modular domains from 22 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including two catalytically inactivated protease variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The domains were expressed as GST-tagged fusion proteins, and 26 of the 31 protein constructs were produced in sufficient quantities to be used as baits in phage display selections. The GST-fusion proteins were immobilized for triplicate selections in a 96-well plate and used in ProP-PD selections using our HD2 peptide phage-display library. This library displays 16 amino acid overlapping peptides that tile the intrinsically disordered regions of the human proteome on the surface of M13 phage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The peptide-coding regions of the binding-enriched phage pools were analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Using previously established quality metrics (peptides found in replicate selections, overlapping peptides identified, high NGS score and/or containing motifs) we found 281 high/medium (8/273) confidence peptides from 239 proteins interacting with 11 SARS-CoV-2 domains of nine viral proteins (Nsp1, Nsp3 (Ubl1, ADRP and SUD-M), Nsp5, Nsp8, Nsp9, Nsp16, Orf8, Orf9b and N NTD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). The vast majority (118) of identified interactions involve Nsp9, followed by Nsp1 (47) and the catalytically inactivated Nsp5 Mpro (32). Based on the peptides identified by ProP-PD selections, consensus motifs could be established for two proteins (Nsp5 [FLM][HQ][AS] and Nsp9 G[FL]xL[GDP]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). For Nsp5 (Mpro), the ligands may serve as potential substrates because the recognition motif resembles the preferred proteolytic site of the protease (LQ↓[GAS])<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">The enrichment analysis of the Gene Ontology (GO) terms for the combined dataset revealed enrichment of ligands associated with biological processes related to transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>; q &lt; 0.001; PepTools). By comparing with the information available in protein interaction databases (collected August 2022, See Materials and Methods for details) we found that eighteen of the protein-protein interactions identified here are supported by reported interactions from previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). The low overlap with other host-SARS-CoV-2 protein-protein interaction studies likely reflects technical differences between the approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Here, we specifically searched for SLiM-based interactions, which are often missed by other methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">We selected 27 interactions for validation in a fluorescence polarization (FP) based binding assay, in which we first establish a valid fluorescein (FITC) labelled probe peptide, which was subsequently displaced in a second experiment with unlabelled peptide(s). The following SARS-CoV-2 protein domains were included in these binding experiments: Nsp1, Nsp3 Ubl1, Nsp3 ADRP, Nsp3 SUD-M, Nsp3 NAB, Nsp8, Nsp9, Nsp16, Orf9b, and N-NTD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). For Nsp1 and Nsp3 NAB we did not detect binding with the probe peptides tested whereas weak, non-saturating binding was observed for Nsp8, Orf9b and N NTD, indicating that the tested interactions are of low affinity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1, Table S4</xref>). In contrast, we conclusively confirmed the peptide binding capacity of five SARS-CoV-2 domains: Nsp3 Ubl1, Nsp3 ADRP, Nsp3 SUD-M, Nsp9 and Nsp16, as described below.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Characterization of SLiMs binding to distinct domains of Nsp3</title><p id="P8">Coronavirus replication occurs primarily in double-membrane vesicles, derived from the host endoplasmic reticulum membrane, that provide protection from the host immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Recently, the hexameric Nsp3 assembly was shown to form pores that span the double membrane and serve as a vital connection between the site of viral RNA synthesis inside the vesicle and the site of viral RNA translation in the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Despite great recent efforts to map and characterize the SARS-CoV-2 interactome, the Nsp3 has been largely neglected due to its size and complexity, and therefore the functions of the various domains are poorly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We expressed and purified all globular domains of Nsp3 and subjected them to Pro-PD selections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Phage selections yielded a set of medium confidence ligands for Nsp3 Ubl1 (6 peptides), ADRP (3 peptides) and Nsp3 SUD-M (14 peptides) but without a clear consensus motif for any of the domains, in part due to the small number of retrieved peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). We determined the equilibrium dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) using the FP assay for at least two human peptides for each of the three globular Nsp3 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), which confirmed the binding of six of the tested peptides with affinities in the range of 20 to 300 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Three peptides derived from the protein NYNRIN (NYNRIN<sub>1031-1046</sub>; CPSLSEEILRCLSLHD), the Nuclear receptor coactivator 2 (NCOA2) (NCOA2<sub>1074-1089</sub>; SDEGALLDQLYLALRN), and from the Chromatin complexes subunit BAP18 (BAP18<sub>40-55</sub>; AKWTETEIEMLRAAVK) were selected for affinity measurements with the Nsp3 Ubl1. The measurements confirmed the binding of Nsp3 Ubl1 to NYNRIN1031-1046 and NCOA21074-1089 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>), but not to BAP18<sub>40-55</sub>. The two binding peptides shared some sequence similarity, and possessed a putative LxxLxL motif, which is known to adopt alpha helical conformation upon binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. One such interaction exists between the NCBD domain of CBP/p300 and the CID domains of the NCOA2 protein family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We therefore tested the binding of Nsp3 Ubl1 to the entire CBP interaction domain (residues 1071-1110) of NCOA2 as well as to the two human paralogs NCOA1 and NCOA3 (residues 924-965 and 1045-1086 respectively). We did not detect any displacement for the two paralogues suggesting that the conserved LxxLxL motif is not the main driver of the interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1, Table S4</xref>). To clarify which residues of the NCOA2 peptide are involved in the interaction, we performed a peptide SPOT array alanine scan, which revealed that the leucine residues in position 1 (P1), together with a tyrosine in position P5, was critical for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that the Nsp3 Ubl1 binding motif in the NCOA2<sub>1074-1089</sub> is LxxxY. This finding clarified the lack of binding of NCOA1 and NCOA2 paralogues in which valines are located at the corresponding tyrosine position. Similarly spaced hydrophobic residues are also found in the other Nsp3 Ubl1 binding peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To test how the peptides might bind to Nsp3 Ubl1 we performed an <italic>in silico</italic> prediction using ColabFold, which is based on AlphaFold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Both the NCOA2<sub>1074-1089</sub> and the NYNRIN<sub>1031-1046</sub> peptides were predicted with a high per-residue confidence score (pLDDT &gt; 80) to form an alpha helix bound in the hydrophobic binding pocket between alpha helix 1 (α1) and helix 3 (α3) of Nsp3 Ubl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Intriguingly, a recently reported highaffinity interaction between the disordered region of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N; 219-LALLLL-224) and Nsp3 Ubl1 also engages the same hydrophobic binding pocket of Nsp3 Ubl1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In this case, the interaction is enhanced by an additional polar motif of N, that binds to Nsp3 Ubl1 in a distinct site. Therefore, to investigate if the ligands identified in this study directly compete with N for binding to Nsp3a Ubl1, we attempted to displace the FITC-labelled NCOA2<sub>1074-1089</sub> peptide probe from the Nsp3 Ubl1-probe complex with full length N. However, the FP signal increased upon addition of N to the premixed Nsp3 Ubl1-probe sample as well as upon addition of N to the sample containing only the probe peptide, rendering the displacement experiment inconclusive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Next, we focused on the binding of peptides to the other two Nsp3 domains, ADRP and SUD-M. The peptides that bind to Nsp3 ADRP were derived from Lysophospholipid acyltransferase 1 (MBOAT1<sub>16-31</sub>; GSTYLHPLSELLGIPL) and Protein mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP10 (PARP10<sub>700-715</sub>; DGGTDGKAQLVVHSA), with the MBOAT1 peptide being the ligand with higher affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2 and Table S4</xref>). The peptide SPOT array showed a strong signal for binding of the MBOAT1<sub>16-31</sub> peptide to Nsp3 ADRP, suggesting that the central <sub>21</sub>-HPLSE-<sub>25</sub> residues are critical for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, residues in bold). A similar <sub>4</sub>-YLSE-<sub>7</sub> segment was also identified in AZIN2, an additional Nsp3 ADRP ligand found in the ProP-PD selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). The ColabFold predictions of the Nsp3 ADRP binding peptides did not converge with high confidence (pLDDT of ~30; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). However, manual inspection indicated that the peptide binding was restricted to the surface between the N-terminal beta sheet (β1) and the C-terminal alfa helix (α6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Finally, we note that PARP10 is upregulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and is known to mono-ADP-ribosylate amino acid residues as a part of host response to viral infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The Nsp3 SUD-N (also called Mac1) domain of SARS-CoV-2 is in turn a mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Thus, although the affinity of the Nsp3 ADRP-PARP10 interaction is relatively low (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> ≈ 300 μM), the interaction might be of relevance in the context of the virus counteracting the host’s response to viral infection.</p><p id="P12">The peptides used to study binding to Nsp3 SUD-M were from the PR domain zinc finger protein 14 (PRDM14<sub>197-213</sub>; FTEEDLHFVLYGVTPS) and Methylcytosine dioxygenase TET3 (TET3<sub>324-339</sub>; PMAELEQLLGSASDYI). These were the most enriched peptides in the selection against Nsp3 SUD-M, and of these two, PRDM14<sub>197-213</sub> was the ligand with higher affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2 and Table S4</xref>). The ColabFold analysis of Nsp3 SUD-M in complex with either PRDM14<sub>197-213</sub> or TET3<sub>324-339</sub> exhibited moderate pLDDT scores (between 50 and 70, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). While the two peptides did not share a specific binding motif, the SPOT array alanine scan showed distinct patterns of alternating amino acid residues interacting with Nsp3 SUD-M for both peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>).

A minor effect was also observed upon mutation of the isoleucine at the position P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Based on these results, we adjust the motif to GΦxΦ[GDP], where Φ is a hydrophobic residue. To define the binding pocket of the motif, we performed ColabFold prediction for peptide binding to either monomeric or dimeric Nsp9.

The substantial overlap of chemical shift perturbation changes upon binding of the three peptides suggested an overall conserved binding interface. We focused on the residues that exhibited chemical shift changes of at least one standard deviation above average for all three peptides. The data suggested significant rearrangements of residues in the hydrophobic core of Nsp9 in the β1-β5 region while β6 and β7 remained unperturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6H</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">I</xref>).

Because the molecular weight calculation from τ<sub>c</sub> is highly dependent on the shape of the molecule, the experiments provide an estimate of the size, which nonetheless correlates well with the predicted molecular weight for a Nsp9 homodimer (25.7 kDa) and a Nsp9 monomer bound to the NOTCH4 peptide (14.7 kDa) implying that the addition of the peptide disrupts formation of the Nsp9 homodimer. To further test whether the peptides bind via the C-terminal helix we constructed a Nsp9Δα construct, which is missing 20 residues of the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).

Labelled peptide (10 nM) was pre-incubated with protein such that approximately 50-60% of the labelled peptide was bound to protein (Nsp3 Ubl1: 150 μM, Nsp3 ADRP: 75 μM, Nsp3 SUD-M: 100 μM, Nsp9: 17.4-25 μM, and Nsp16: 7 μM). Unlabelled peptide was then added at increasing concentration to compete out the binding of the labelled peptide. Results were analyzed in GrafPad Prism (version 9.4.1). From this data set, the sigmoidal dose-response fitting function was used to obtain IC50 values. These IC50 values were further converted to <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> (=<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) of unlabelled peptide as described by Nikolovska-Coleska et. al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</title><p id="P34">Before NMR experiments the <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>N Nsp9 sample was dialyzed into 50 mM potasium phosphate buffer pH 6,7 supplemented with and supplemented with 1mM TCEP and 10% D2O.
