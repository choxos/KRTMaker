The development of novel effective small molecule therapeutic strategies in this space has remained challenging. An orthogonal approach, therefore, is to explore biomaterials with physical modes of action which have the potential to generate antimicrobial activity and in some cases even prevent antimicrobial resistance. Here, to this effect, we describe an approach for forming silk-based films that contain embedded selenium nanoparticles. We show that these materials exhibit both antibacterial and antifungal properties while crucially also remaining highly biocompatible and non-cytotoxic towards mammalian cells. By incorporating the nanoparticles into silk films, the protein scaffold acts in a two-fold manner; it protects the mammalian cells from the cytotoxic effects of the bare nanoparticles, while also providing a template for bacterial and fungal eradication. A range of hybrid inorganic/organic films were produced and an optimum concentration was found, which allowed for both high bacterial and fungal death while also exhibiting low mammalian cell cytotoxicity. Such films can thus pave the way for next generation antimicrobial materials for applications such as wound healing and as agents against topical infections, with the added benefit that bacteria and fungi are unlikely to develop antimicrobial resistance to these hybrid materials.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Biomaterials derived from natural sources, including proteins and peptides, provide a unique opportunity to create biocompatible structures for biomedical applications. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> The self-assembly of these protein molecules can lead to functional complexes that have tunable three-dimensional structures, ranging in size from nanometers to centimeters. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, these structures offer promising routes for loading, carrying, and releasing cargo molecules to selected targets.

In order to do this, we first optimised the formation of selenium nanoparticles through the reduction of sodium selenite by ascorbic acid. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> By varying the concentration of sodium selenite from 100-1000 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, we were able to form nanoparticles of different sizes. Using electron microscopy, we determined the size distribution of the nanoparticles over a 6-day period. We found that nanoparticle diameters varied (60-130 nm) as a function of the sodium selenite concentration. Additionally, the stability over time was monitored and it was found that the nanoparticles agglomerated as time progressed, with complete agglomeration happening by day 6. This issue was addressed by combining the nanoparticles with silk fibrils, which acted as stabilisers and did not allow the nanoparticles to clump together. These hybrid silk-selenium films demonstrate unique malleability and have a homogeneous nanoparticle distribution within the protein matrix. Finally, we looked at the potential use of these films as antimicrobial agents. Three different bacteria and fungi were investigated; the gram-negative bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic>, the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and the fungi Candida parapsilosis. In all systems, it was determined that the films displayed potent antifungal and antibacterial properties, killing the majority of the bacteria/fungi. More importantly, however, we found that by incorporating the selenium nanoparticles within the films, mammalian cells were protected against the cytotoxic effects of the bare nanoparticles. Therefore, we were able to not only retain the antimicrobial effect of the nanoparticles, but also ensure that our material was highly biocompatible, making these silk-selenium films ideal for use as topical antimicrobial agents.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="P5">In order to generate a material which displayed antimicrobial properties while also being biocompatible, we chose to investigate a hybrid inorganic/organic system. As selenium has been shown to exhibit antimicrobial properties, selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) were synthesised using a redox reaction. The SeNPs were then integrated with pre-formed silk fibrils, before being left to self-assemble, resulting in the formation of a Silk-SeNP film (the schematic of which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The films were then tested with fungi, gram negative and gram positive bacteria, and it was found that in all cases microbial death was observed. Finally, viability assays were conducted with mammalian cells and it was determined that crucially, the films remain highly biocompatible.</p><p id="P6">As described above, selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) were first synthesised. A range of sodium selenite concentrations were investigated, while the ascorbic acid solution, which was in excess with respect to the sodium selenite, was kept constant at a concentration of 56.7 mM. Following the reduction reaction, the solution was left at room temperature for 24 hours in order to promote SeNP formation. Selenium nanoparticles were imaged by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). From the TEM micrographs, it was determined that the average sizes of the nanoparticles for the 7 different concentrations of sodium selenite investigated, ranged from around 60 to 130 nm. Moreover, depending on the concentration of sodium selenite, we could systematically control the nanoparticle size. The largest SeNPs were formed using a sodium selenite concentration of 200 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL.</p><p id="P7">For each sodium selenite concentration used, the size of more than 100 nanoparticles was measured. The mean size (μ) and the standard deviation (σ) of the nanoparticles was thus determined. The average coefficient of variation (which is the ratio of σ to <italic>μ</italic> and gives an indication of the dispersion of the distribution) for these samples was calculated as 9.8%, demonstrating a fairly narrow distribution for most of the nanoparticle systems synthesised. The average sizes of the SeNPs for the 7 conditions tested can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>, while some representative TEM and SEM micrographs of the nanoparticles can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2b-c and 2d-e</xref>, respectively.</p><p id="P8">Next, we explored the stability of the SeNPs over time. It is known that with time, nanoparticles have the tendency to degrade and form aggregated structures, resulting in changes in their size distribution. In order to monitor this process, we looked at the size distribution of the SeNPs for all 7 systems over a period of 144 hours. TEM was employed to monitor the time dependent size distribution and again, more than 100 nanoparticles were measured for each bar graph, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>. It was determined that for all the systems, SeNPs remained stable over time with minimal size discrepancies. The different colours in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref> represent the different nanoparticle concentrations, while the colour gradient corresponds to the day on which the measurements were made. It is clear that the size distribution of the SeNPs follows the same trend in day 2 as well as in day 6.</p><p id="P9">Moreover, in order to probe the elemental composition of the nanoparticles, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was performed on a nanoparticle sample. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure S2</xref>, the Se peaks at 1.5 keV confirm that the nanoparticles imaged were in fact selenium-based, with other peaks characteristic of the copper grid used for sample deposition and of the staining agent, uranyl acetate. Furthermore, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was conducted on a 600 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL nanoparticle solution. The peak positions (shown in red) are representative of a pure hexagonal phase of selenium crystals with lattice parameters a = 4.366 and c = 4.9536<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure S3</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To monitor the stability of the nanoparticles, the use of UVvisible absorption spectroscopy was employed. Absorption spectra of SeNPs were taken and are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3a-b</xref>. The absorption intensity of the nanoparticles at their characteristic wavelength (265 nm) is an indication of the stability, where the higher the intensity, the more stable the nanoparticles. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> From the absorption spectra in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>, which correspond to the different sodium selenite concentrations tested, it can be seen that the most stable system is at 1000 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, while the least stable nanoparticle system is at 330 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Moreover, by monitoring an intermediate stability nanoparticle system over time, at 200 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, it was determined that there is a clear decrease in the absorbance at 265 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>), which indicates that the nanoparticles start to clump and aggregate over time.</p><p id="P11">It was determined that the nanoparticles aggregated for all concentrations tested. Moreover, even though this agglomeration process was initiated from day 3 onwards, complete agglomeration occurred by day 6, as can be seen in the TEM micrographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3c-e</xref>. This was also corroborated from the absorbance spectra at 265 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>), where it is clear that the intensity of the nanoparticle spectra decreases over time. Furthermore, massive clumps, on the order of millimetres, were seen after 2 weeks of formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure S1</xref>). In order to address the issue of nanoparticle agglomeration, regenerated silk fibroin (RSF) was used. RSF is an FDA approved protein, which has the propensity to self-assemble into nanofibrils. By combining SeNPs with silk nanofibrils, we were able to stabilise the nanoparticles and prevent agglomeration. The nanoparticles had the tendency to adsorb to the fibrillar network and were therefore spatially immobilised. This mechanism of stabilisation was confirmed via TEM, and some typical micrographs can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3f-h</xref>.</p><p id="P12">Having established that silk fibrils stabilise SeNPs against aggregation, we next sought to form a material capable of exhibiting antimicrobial properties. The silk fibril-SeNP (SF-SeNP) hybrid inorganic/organic solution was mixed with a 40% ethanol solution (which is a strong gel promoter) at a 1:1 ratio, and the final mixture was left to dry at room temperature for one day. The experimental procedure used to make the films is shown in the schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>. This process resulted in the formation of a SF-SeNP film (as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figures S4b-c</xref>). By allowing the solution to dry at room temperature, a film with a uniform nanoparticle distribution could be formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). In order to monitor the antimicrobial properties of the films, we prepared SF-SeNP films for the seven different concentrations tested, i.e. the 50 500 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL concentration range. The films were then cut using a hole puncher and placed in a 96-well plate, in order to conduct absorbance and fluorescence related assays using a plate-reader experiment.</p><p id="P13">Before investigating the antimicrobial properties of the SF-SeNP films, we first characterised the films using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Micrographs of both silk films with and without selenium nanoparticles were taken. High magnification SEM micrographs revealed the highly dense fibrillar network with the silk films (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4c-d</xref>). A representative image of a silk film without nanoparticles can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>. It contains a homogeneous distribution of the self-assembled protein network. Moreover, in the micrographs of the SF-SeNP films (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f</xref>), the nanoparticles can clearly be seen, with yellow arrows pointing towards the selenium nanoparticles within the film.</p><p id="P14">Following film formation, we then evaluated the antibacterial activity of the SF-SeNP films against <italic>E. coli</italic>. Direct assessment of bacterial viability of <italic>E. coli</italic> was carried out using live/dead viability analysis. This was achieved through use of Syto9 (a dye that stains and indicates live bacteria) and propidium iodide (a dye that stains and indicates dead bacteria). Following 24h of treatment, bacterial cell death was observed for samples treated with the SF-SeNP films (bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5a</xref>). This effect was observed for a range of nanoparticle concentrations, with the 500 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL system showing the highest potency. Furthermore, the control and silk film treated bacteria remained viable and proliferated over time, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref> (top and middle panels, respectively).</p><p id="P15">Moreover, the effect of selenium nanoparticle concentration on bacterial cell death was investigated. This was done by conducting a kinetic growth inhibition analysis. <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures, grown to an OD of 0.2, were added to the nanoparticle containing films and to the corresponding controls. The bacteria were incubated overnight and absorbance measurements at 600 nm were conducted over time. It is evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref> that there is a dose-dependent trend, with the higher the nanoparticle concentration, the more potent the antibacterial properties of the film. Treatment with the silk films alone did not affect bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). Moreover, it was observed that the SF-SeNP films with concentrations of 225 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and above, had &gt;70% bacterial death.</p><p id="P16">In order to assess whether the SF-SeNP films retain their antibacterial potency as opposed to using just bare nanoparticles, the kinetic inhibition analysis was also performed for free nanoparticles in solution. The bacteria were again incubated overnight and absorbance measurements at 600 nm were conducted over time. It is evident from SI <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref> that a similar dose-dependent trend is observed, as in the case of the SF-SeNP films. It was found that with bare nanoparticles, a similar amount of bacteria were killed (~70% bacterial death) for nanoparticle concentrations up to 400 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Therefore we can conclude that our SF-SeNP films retain their antibacterial action and have similar performances to using free nanoparticles.</p><p id="P17">Furthermore, the antibacterial activity of the films on a gram-positive bacterium, <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, was investigated. It has been shown that due to the selenium nanoparticles having an overall negative charge, they are more potent on gram-positive bacteria. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> It was therefore expected that for the same nanoparticle concentrations, the antibacterial activity of the films would be more potent on B. subtilis than on the gram-negative bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic>. Bacterial viability was again assessed using Syto9 and propidium iodide. Following 24h of treatment, bacterial cell death was observed for samples treated with the SF-SeNP films (bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6a</xref>), whereas the control and silk film treated bacteria remained both viable and proliferated over time (top and middle panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>, respectively).</p><p id="P18">We next quantified the viability of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> as a function of nanoparticle concentration within the films, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>. This was done by counting the live/dead cells from the confocal images taken. For each film condition, an average of 10 images was used, which resulted in hundreds of cells being counted per condition. Our results indicate that at a concentration of 300 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and above, total bacterial eradication was observed, whereas at a concentration of 225 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, more than 92% of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was killed. It can be seen in the live/dead viability analysis that even at really low nanoparticle concentrations (50 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), ca. 60% bacterial death was observed.</p><p id="P19">Moreover, the antifungal activity of the films was investigated on the fungi <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic>. Previous literature has shown that selenium nanoparticles have good antifungal activity. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> We found that our hybrid films had a very potent antifungal effect. Fungal viability was assessed using Syto9 and propidium iodide. Samples were again incubated for a total of 24 h at 30°C. It was observed that for samples treated with the SF-SeNP films (bottom panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6c</xref>) total fungal death was observed, whereas the control and silk film treated fungi remained viable and also proliferated over time (top and middle panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6c</xref>, respectively). We quantified the effect of the films on C. parapsilosis by counting the live/dead cells from the confocal images, using the same approach as previously mentioned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>). The antifungal effect of the SF-SeNP films is more potent than their antibacterial effect, with around 73% fungal death observed for the films with nanoparticle concentrations as low as 50 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. More importantly, the concentration which kills the majority of fungi (&gt;95%) is 225 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and above.</p><p id="P20">In order to gain a mechanistic insight into the mode of action of the SF-SeNP films, a membrane permeation assay was conducted with SYTOX Blue. SYTOX Blue is a cationic dye that cannot enter an intact cell, but rather it can only enter if the membrane has been disrupted. The dye binds to intracellular nucleic acids and is fluorescent when excited at 405 nm. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> Samples treated with SF-SeNP films had significantly higher fluorescence signal compared to control samples, indicating that membrane disruption was evident, and is thus the probable mode of action behind the antimicrobial effect of the SF-SeNP films (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Finally, in order to assess the ability of these films as agents for treating topical infections, the biocompatibility of the antibacterial films with mammalian cells (HEK-293) via an MTT-based cell viability assay was evaluated. HEK-293 cells were grown in 96-well plates overnight in the presence of the films and controls. Cell viability was not affected by the presence of a silk film. Moreover, in the presence of films containing low nanoparticle concentrations (100 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and below), high cellular viability was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7b</xref>). Cellular viability was reduced to just over 85% when treated with films containing a Se NP concentration of 225 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. However, the viability was reduced to around 20% when the cells were treated with films containing 400 and 500 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7b</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Additionally, a live/dead analysis of HEK-293 cells which were treated in a similar manner indicated the same results. Calcein AM staining (indicating live cells) and ethidium homodimer-1 (indicating dead cells) was conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7a</xref>). From the images, it is clear that there is minimal cell death in the presence of films, both with and without nanoparticles (top three panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">figure 7a</xref>). However, in the presence of free nanoparticles, cell viability is greatly reduced, with high cellular death and inhibition of normal cell proliferation (bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">figure 7a</xref>). Our results thus show that by encapsulating the nanoparticles within these silk films, mammalian cells can be shielded from the cytotoxic effects, making them more biocompatible, whilst also providing high antimicrobial activity.</p><p id="P23">Taken together, the biocompatability results and the antimicrobial results strongly suggest that an optimum concentration of SF-SeNP films exists. Using a concentration of 225 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL we were able to eradicate the majority of bacteria (&gt;70% for <italic>E. coli</italic> and &gt;92% for B. subtilis) and fungi (&gt;95%), whilst also protecting and keeping the majority of HEK-293 cells alive (&gt;85%). This is evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7c</xref>, which shows the graph of B. subtilis death (in red) and HEK-293 cell viability (in green) as a function of silk-selenium film concentration.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P24">Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly major healthcare problem of increasing urgency. It has become clear that alternative routes, in addition to conventional antibiotic and antifungal treatments, need to be developed. In this study we have combined selenium nanoparticles with silk fibroin in order to form biocompatible films that exhibit strong antimicrobial action. Two different bacteria, gram-negative <italic>E. coli</italic> and gram-positive <italic>B. subtilis</italic> were tested, while the fungi <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> was also investigated. In all cases, it was found that the films displayed potent antibacterial and antifungal properties. Furthermore, the biocomatibility of the films was investigated via an MTT-based cell viability assay. HEK-293 mammalian cell viability was monitored and it was established that in the presence of films containing low nanoparticle concentrations, high cellular viability was observed. This is primarily because the protein scaffold has the ability to shield and protect the mammalian cells from the cytotoxic effects of the bare nanoparticles. By combining the results from the antimicrobial assays and the mammalian cell viability assays, it was determined that the optimum concentration which displays both high biocompatability and high bacterial and fungal death was 225 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. This optimum film condition had the ability to kill the majority of bacteria and fungi whilst also keeping the majority of HEK-293 cells alive. As bacteria and fungi are unlikely to develop antimicrobial resistance to the nanoparticles embedded within the films, these hybrid organic/inorganic bioinspired materials provide a basis for potential biomedical and biotechnological applications, especially for use as topical antimicrobial agents.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Formation and Purification of Regenerated Silk Fibroin</title><p id="P25">Regenerated silk fibroin was obtained from Bombyx mori silkworm cocoons, following a previously determined protocol. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> In summary, cut cocoons were boiled for 30 minutes in a solution of 0.02 M sodium carbonate.

Ascorbic acid (200 L, 56.7 mM) was added dropwise to the sodium selenite solution and was mixed thoroughly to obtain the selenium nanoparticles. A color change occurred upon nanoparticle formation from translucent colorless to translucent red.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Characterization of Selenium Nanoparticles</title><p id="P27">TEM, SEM, UVvisible absorption spectroscopy, DLS, and PXRD were carried out to characterize our products. The size and distribution of the selenium nanoparticles were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM micrographs were recorded using a Thermo Scientific (FEI) Talos F200X G2 electron microscope. Samples were prepared over a period of six days in which nanoparticles were drop-casted on carbon-coated TEM copper grids and dried after 30 seconds of exposure. The resulting TEM micrographs were analyzed using Siemens Totally Integrated Automation (TIA) software and ImageJ software.</p><p id="P28">Scanning Electron Microscopy was employed to image the nanoparticles using a FEI Verios 460 SEM at a current of 5 kV. The selenium nanoparticle solution was mounted onto a silicon wafer by adding 1 μL of solution and letting the sample air dry. This wafer was placed onto a multipin specimen holder, and a 10 nm platinum layer was sputter coated onto the sample.</p><p id="P29">Selenium nanoparticles were also characterized by UVvisible absorption spectroscopy (Implen NanoPhotometer NP80). The samples were diluted by a factor of 100 and the spectra were recorded within a 200400 nm wavelength range over a period of 6 days. The average particle size (hydrodynamic diameter) of the synthesized nanoparticles was measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS). The samples were diluted by a factor of 1000 and the spectra were recorded on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano instrument. Nanoparticle composition was characterized using a Bruker D8-QUEST PHOTON-100 diffractometer. The resulting crystallite size was compared to the standard crystalline selenium diffraction pattern.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Incorporation of Selenium Nanoparticles into Silk Fibroin Films</title><p id="P30">A solution of regenerated silk fibroin was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with ethanol.
