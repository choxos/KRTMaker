However, information on the AML blast phenotype regarding their maturational arrest has started to regain importance due to its predictive power on drug responses. Here, we deconvolute 1350 bulk RNA-seq samples from five independent AML cohorts on a single-cell healthy BM reference and demonstrate that the morphological differentiation stage (FAB classification) could be faithfully reconstituted using estimated cell compositions (ECCs). Moreover, we show that the ECCs reliably predict <italic>ex-vivo</italic> drug resistances as demonstrated for Venetoclax, a <italic>BCL-2</italic> inhibitor, resistance specifically in AML with CD14+ monocyte phenotype. We further validate these predictions using in-house proteomics data by showing that <italic>BCL-2</italic> protein abundance is split into two distinct clusters for NPM1-mutated AML at the extremes of CD14+ monocyte percentages, which could be crucial for the Venetoclax dosing for these patients. Our results suggest that Venetoclax resistance predictions can also be extended to AML without recurrent genetic abnormalities (NOS), and possibly to MDS-related AML and secondary AML. Collectively, we propose a framework for allowing a joint mutation and maturation stage modeling that could be used as a blueprint for testing sensitivity for new agents across the various subtypes of AML.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematological cancer of the myeloid lineage. AML is caused by a combination of relatively few genetic alterations that are predominantly somatically acquired and cooperatively induce a maturation arrest in combination with rapid uncontrolled proliferation of immature myeloid precursor cells. The prognosis of AML is highly dependent on the presence of such recurrent genetic alterations and varies from &gt; 90% cure rates to less than 10%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, the current WHO classification primarily defines AML subtypes according to the presence of eleven recurrent genetic aberrations (RGA) changes and an added heterogeneous umbrella subtype composed of a highly diverse set of relatively rare RGAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Only AML cases that lack any detected RGA are characterized according to their maturation stage according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Recently, the maturation and differentiation stage of AML blasts has gained importance due to a striking association with sensitivity or resistance to new drugs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. AML differentiation stage can be assessed by diagnostic flow cytometry more objectively than by morphological examination alone. However, flow cytometry is limited to a relatively low number of differentiation markers. Gene expression profiling by bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is an attractive alternative technique as it allows both calling of genetic aberrations and estimation of cell subsets, i.e. estimated cell composition (ECC) from the same sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Reported attempts to estimate ECCs by deconvoluting bulk AML samples utilizing single-cell RNA-seq as an <italic>in-silico</italic> reference, were mostly focused on detection of survival differences without performing thorough validation of the ECCs and/or used leukemic samples as reference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, which prevents assessing whether ECCs are tissue- or sample-specific.</p><p id="P4">Here, we perform deconvolution of 1350 AML transcriptomic samples via a healthy single-cell reference while validating our findings with our in-house flow cytometry data. Of note, we demonstrate that the ECCs recapitulate the entire FAB landscape (M0-M7). Then, using these ECCs we predict <italic>ex-vivo</italic> drug resistance data from literature and show the agreement of these results at protein level with the help of in-house proteomics data in AML patients, for whom we also had acquired gene expression data. To conclude, we hereby propose a transcription-based single-cell guided deconvolution framework to assess the drug effectiveness to different maturational stages of AML. We also provide our framework as a CRAN R package available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/eonurk/seAMLess">https://github.com/eonurk/seAMLess</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Deconvolution pipeline recapitulates healthy and malignant hematopoiesis</title><p id="P5">We initially created a healthy bone marrow (BM) reference atlas from single-cell transcriptomics data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). For this purpose, we integrated data from 69,101 cells covering 439 genes from three publicly available datasets (two full-transcriptome and one targeted) from two studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, Methods). As expected, T-cells and B-cells formed separate clusters in the UMAP plot, whereas the myeloid lineage cells clustered together. To differentiate early myelopoiesis, we distinguished more than 3,349 hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and 1,432 erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMP), 2,939 lymphoid multipotent progenitors (LMPP), as well as 3,508 granulocytes-monocytes progenitors (GMP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Inter-individual variability, possibly due to age differences, mostly affected T- and B-cells and did not influence overall clustering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1A</xref>). Homogeneous distribution of the studies on the UMAP plot showed successful integration of the different datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We next performed <italic>in silico</italic> experiments to validate our deconvolution set-up. We first used the healthy BM reference to create <italic>in silico</italic> mixed bulk samples with known cell compositions. Pseudobulk profiles were simulated with one abundant cell type (80% of the cells) with the remaining cells being a mix created by random selection (Methods). Then, MuSiC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> with the default settings was used to deconvolute the simulated pseudobulk profiles into their respective cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1C</xref>). To validate on an independent dataset, we also simulated pseudobulks from 40,000 healthy bone marrow cells of the human cell atlas (HCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1D</xref>) and performed deconvolution via MuSiC. All simulated pseudobulk profiles were successfully deconvoluted into their respective cell types (matching to the most abundant cell type) apart from EMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). For this profile, the annotations were shared mostly among EMP (14%) as well as HSC (25%) and Early Erythrocytes (23%). This discrepancy might be explained by the transcriptional similarity of these cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Next, we analyzed our in-house diagnostic flow cytometry data (EuroFlow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> panels; see Methods) for 22 AML samples with matched bulk RNA-seq data. An overview of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values for these samples’ abnormal cells after staining with antibodies for 33 markers distributed over 7 tubes (1 Orientation + 6 AML assignment tubes) is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1E</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In line with our expectations, the most abundant cell types for all samples were in the myeloid lineage for both flow cytometry analyses and estimated cell compositions (ECCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). To investigate whether monocytic AML can be accurately distinguished from AML with more stem cell-like phenotypes, we plotted CD14+ monocyte percentages as determined by deconvolution against MFI values of antibodies of monocytic markers (CD11b, CD64, IREM2, and CD14) on all BM cells without gating, and observed statistically significant correlations for 3 markers (CD11b, CD64, IREM2), with CD64b being most significant (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.43, P &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1F</xref>). Also, percentages of AML cells assigned to the monocytic subset by EuroFlow panels and ECCs showed statistically significant correlations (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.64, P &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Lastly, we downloaded publicly available TARGET AML and ALL (B-ALL and T-ALL) data and deconvoluted these samples (n=719) with the healthy BM reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) to show that different leukemic phenotypes could be captured by deconvolution. The estimates of cell type abundances in the three immune lineages (myeloid, B- and T-lymphoid) were visualized using a ternary plot. As expected, each type of acute leukemia was closer to their respective cell type of origin (ECCs), most compact being B-ALL (yellow samples on the right corner), showing the ECCs’ ability to capture the patients’ immune phenotypes at major cell type levels. Together, these benchmarking and validation analyses demonstrated that given a healthy single cell BM transcriptomic atlas, the cell type proportions can be recapitulated faithfully via deconvolution from bulk transcriptomic leukemia cases.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Deconvolution of bulk AML transcriptomics reveals the dominating immune fraction</title><p id="P9">To investigate heterogeneity in cell composition of AML, we next applied our framework to deconvolute five independent bulk transcriptomic AML studies, i.e. TCGA-LAML<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> (n=151), BEAT-AML<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> (n=460), TARGET-AML<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> (n=187), LEUCEGENE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> (n=452) and our cohort LUMC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> (n=100) totaling in 1350 samples from 1,267 patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2A</xref>). The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> as a heatmap where each sample was decomposed into the 22 cell types from the healthy BM reference. We also added information on patients’ clinical blast counts, FAB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, WHO 2016<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, and ELN 2017<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> classes for an overarching picture of AML landscape, and we also calculated the stemness score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, which is a gene expression signature for patient prognosis trained on engraftment capacity of AML in immunodeficient mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Each sample was assigned to the most abundant cell type as determined by deconvolution (AML phenotype) and arranged according to their fractions within each phenotype. The data showed a clear dominance of one immune cell type for most of the cases, clearly indicating that maturational arrests and lineage skewing are leukemic properties that can be readily assessed using transcriptome sequencing. The majority of AML cases was typically estimated to be dominated by myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2A, S2B, S3D</xref>). As notable exceptions, a few pediatric AML samples from the TARGET cohort showed ECC profiles dominated by T-cells or B-cells. This effect is most likely caused by prominent infiltration of the bone marrow by these types of lymphocytes besides the AML blast population and therefore precludes the assignment of the AML blasts to a distinct myeloid cell type. As previously reported these cases can nevertheless be considered as a special subgroup of pediatric AML, and specifically T-cell dominated patients were recognized for poor survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in line with previous reports, patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), classified as AML-M3 by FAB, were correctly assigned to have a cell composition dominated by granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs). Besides APL, there are also AML cases dominated by GMP and large groups of AML assigned as monocytic AML or AML with an earlier HSC or EMP phenotype, again demonstrating that bulk transcriptomics can be used to capture the stage of arrest of AML during hematopoiesis by deconvolution.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Deconvolution of bulk AML transcriptomics agrees upon stemness score</title><p id="P10">To comprehensively visualize changes in ECCs in relation to metadata, ECCs of AML samples were visualized using a UMAP plot. As expected, samples with similar ECCs clustered, as shown after annotating the samples for their most abundant cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> – left panel). When superimposing the deconvoluted percentages of 6 major cell types on the same UMAP plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> – right panels), gradual shifts in cell composition became apparent, in particular, APL samples populated the extreme extension of the GMP cluster. Moreover, a gradient towards monocytic outgrowth and conversely to a high stemness was also observed. Comparisons with the clinical blast percentage and previously published stemness score showed an overall agreement with ECCs, HSCs and EMPs having a higher score than CD14+ Monocytes and GMPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S3A, S3B</xref>). Late Erythrocyte also had high stemness score, albeit with large variation. By dividing AML into cases with high and low stemness scores, we observed similar compositional changes with abundance of HSCs and EMPs in AML with high stemness scores in all cohorts. Late erythrocytes, however, were not consistently enriched in all cohorts. Furthermore, we noticed that in TARGET, T cells are abundant in AML with high stemness scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S3C</xref>). This raises the question whether the stemness score, which has been trained on adult AML, is useful to predict prognosis of pediatric patients particularly considering that large subtypes of adult AML such as APL and AML with mutated NPM1 are rare in pediatric AML. The consistent enrichment of HSCs and EMPs in AML with high stemness scores in all cohorts, however, further supports correct determination of the cell composition of AML by deconvoluting bulk transcriptomics.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Estimated cell composition recapitulates FAB classes</title><p id="P11">Clear associations were also observed between cell type assignments by ECC and FAB classification status (left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, distinct distributions of cell type-defining gene expression profiles became evident for each FAB AML type by plotting continuous values of deconvolutions rather than categorical assignments: M0 (minimally differentiated AML) cases had high levels of the HSC-defining signature, whereas these levels decreased and EMP- and GMP signatures appeared in M1 (AML without maturation) and M2 (AML with maturation). As expected, M3 (APL) cases were almost completely dominated by the GMP signature, while M4 (Acute Myelomonocytic Leukemia) and M5 (Acute monoblastic/monocytic leukemia) samples resembled CD14+ monocyte cells and GMP. The small groups of M6 (Acute Erythroleukemia) and M7 (Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia) AML were dominated by the signatures of Late Erythrocytes and Megakaryocyte Progenitors, respectively. These data demonstrated and confirmed that our single cell guided deconvolution strategy successfully captures the maturational arrest of AML cells at different differentiation stages of hematopoiesis.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Estimated cell composition captures genetic subtype-specific resistances to various drugs</title><p id="P12">To explore whether ECCs convey information on drug resistances, <italic>ex vivo</italic> drug response data of 122 small molecule inhibitors provided as area under the curves (AUC) for 363 AML samples from BEAT were downloaded. A higher AUC indicates that cancer cells are relatively resistant since higher drug concentrations are needed to induce cell death. To predict drug resistance for AML samples with calculated ECCs, we trained random forest (RF) models per drug via leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) setting and then calculated the Spearman ρ values of these models’ predictions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S5-S7</xref>). We also stratified these results according to WHO classifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Drug responses to the EGF-R inhibitor Erlotinib (Spearman ρ = 0.376 and the mTOR pathway inhibitor Rapamycin (Spearman ρ = 0.368) showed high correlations with AML with mutated NPM1 (n = 77, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.29, P= 3.7x10<sup>-7</sup>), and inv(3) (n = 6, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91, P= 3.2x<sup>-3</sup>), respectively. Notably, responses to Flavopiridol (Spearman ρ = 0.325), a CDK kinase inhibitor, showed strong correlations with ECC within the group of AML-NOS (n = 77, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.31, P= 3.7x10<sup>-7</sup>) while showing higher resistance towards AML with more stem cell like cell phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S5A, S5B</xref>). The strongest correlation (Spearman ρ = 0.509), however, was observed for Venetoclax (ABT-199), a BCL2 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5C</xref>). Annotation with primary diagnosis from WHO classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) revealed that PML-RARA-carrying APL samples (n = 8) are dominated by GMPs are sensitive for Venetoclax, whereas AML with CBFB-MYH11 (n = 7) had the best fit (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.78, P = 0.009) for Venetoclax resistance, although the small sample size of CBFB-MYH11 cases prohibits drawing robust conclusions. Larger groups of AML, however, such as NPM1 mutated cases (n = 55, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.33, P &lt; 0.001), and AML-NOS (n = 42, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.17, P = 0.007), together accounting for approximately 58% of AML, also showed a clear trend for Venetoclax resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Annotating drug responses with predicted resistances by deconvolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5C</xref>) revealed that CD14+ Monocytic AML are relatively resistant to Venetoclax. This resistance of monocytic AML was also clear by overlaying the AUC for Venetoclax onto the UMAP plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) or boxplots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5D</xref>) (one-way ANOVA p = 6.31x10<sup>-13</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S9</xref>). Also, within the group of NPM1 mutated samples, which is the largest class of AML, CD14+ Monocyte dominated cases were most resistant to Venetoclax (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5E, S5F</xref>; one-way ANOVA p = 7.6x10<sup>-4</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S10</xref>). Briefly, these findings suggest that information on the ECCs of AML might yield therapeutic implication seven within one genetic subtype.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Estimated CD14+ Monocyte percentages predict Venetoclax resistance better than <italic>BCL-2</italic> mRNA expression</title><p id="P14">Since Venetoclax is targeting the anti-apoptotic <italic>BCL-2</italic> protein, we next checked <italic>BCL-2</italic> mRNA expression levels in AML and overlaid the CD14+ Monocyte percentages for these cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).

However, a few samples were resistant despite relatively high <italic>BCL-2</italic> expression (samples at upper right corner in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). As the majority of these cases had a CD14+ Monocyte phenotype, we univariately associated <italic>BCL-2</italic> expression and CD14+ Monocyte percentage to investigate which factor best explains the Venetoclax response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We also associated metadata such as reported blast percentages, ELN status and primary diagnosis to determine their effect sizes and significance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S11</xref>).

As expected, based on their low AUC for Venetoclax response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), two AML cases with PML-RARA had high <italic>BCL-2</italic> protein expression (n=2, dark green). We also confirmed the strong variability in AUC for Venetoclax response within the group of AML with mutated NPM1 (n=18, green) by showing two distinct groups at the extremes of CD14+ Monocyte percentages which correlated with <italic>BCL-2</italic> protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Within the group of AML patients with mutated NPM1, CD14+ Monocyte percentage associated stronger with both <italic>BCL-2</italic> protein abundance (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.56, P &lt; 0.001) than <italic>BCL-2</italic> gene expression (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.52) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C, 4D</xref>). In conclusion, the data demonstrate the relevance of our deconvolution approach on bulk RNA-seq to separate AML, especially those with mutated NPM1, with high and low monocyte percentages to predict the patient’s response to Venetoclax.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">In this work, we utilized single cell guided deconvolution to decompose bulk transcriptomics data from five independent AML cohorts and show that the obtained estimated cell compositions (ECCs) faithfully reconstitute the FAB landscape (M0-M7). Moreover, using same-sample flow cytometry, we were able to validate our deconvolution framework. Hence, following our previous work using deep transcriptomics to call various types of leukemia-defining genetic aberrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, our current findings further underpin the power of transcriptomic-based approaches as a comprehensive and versatile platform for AML diagnosis. We next illustrated the potential use of our deconvolution framework for precision medicine applications, by correlating the estimated ECC to the results of an <italic>ex vivo</italic> drug resistance screening of 122 small-molecule inhibitors in the BEAT-AML study. For the <italic>BCL-2</italic> inhibitor Venetoclax we show that higher levels of the estimated ECC subset ‘CD14+ Monocyte’ correspond to a higher resistance, and intriguingly, that estimated CD14+ Monocyte levels is a better explanatory variable of resistance to Venetoclax than <italic>BCL-2</italic> expression alone. Nevertheless, using same-sample in-house proteomics data in 39 patients, we show that the estimated CD14+ Monocyte levels accurately mark BCL protein expression, and that for <italic>NPM1</italic>-mutated patients the presence or absence of a CD14 monocytic outgrowth corresponds with a distinct NPM1 protein abundance.</p><p id="P18">As Venetoclax was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2020 for its use in clinics for untreated AML patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, other researchers also experimented with it and also observed a similar phenomenon that we had observed. For instance, Kuusanmaki <italic>et al</italic>. reported that monocytic differentiation of AML reduced sensitivity to Venetoclax ex vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Similarly, Pei <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the different monocytic subclones in vivo created resistance to Venetoclax treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and also recently, White <italic>et al</italic>. showed that <italic>BCL-2</italic> inhibitor resistance could be predicted via the genes associated with monocytes. Recently, using the flow cytometry data from untreated MDS patients Ganan-Gomez <italic>et al</italic>. showed that after relapse and becoming secondary AML (sAML) patients, those patients with less maturated cell types (EMP) before treatment had a faster complete remission (CR) and longer relapse free status compared to more matured cell type (GMP) with Venetoclax treatment, supporting our hypothesis that ECCs could also predict Venetoclax resistance for MDS and sAML patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Collectively, these studies suggest that Venetoclax has different resistances at different maturational stages, and especially higher resistance for patients with CD14+ Monocyte dominated phenotype as we have shown in this manuscript, and we provide an open-source framework, <italic>seAMLess</italic>, for replicating our results or applying it to other clinically relevant datasets.</p><p id="P19">Our findings may potentially have important implications on drug use especially for genetically uncharacterized patients (AML, NOS) currently accounting for ~40% of all AML as well as other well-characterized patients such as NPM1 mutated samples. For instance, one interesting case report was from Korea <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, an elderly AML patient was treated with Venetoclax along with Azacitidine, and even though the patient had a favorable NPM1 status this treatment lead into tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and patient ended up in ER 12 h into the treatment. Although the manuscript does not indicate the FAB status, AML cells expressed CD33, CD117 and myeloperoxidase, demonstrating a more stem cell than monocytic phenotype, thus one possible hypothesis could be the patient having a more sensitive cell types (e.g., EMP, GMP) to Venetoclax and thus causing immediate apoptosis of these cells and leading to TLS.</p><p id="P20">One limitation of our deconvolution strategy is that it cannot distinguish the cancerous cell types as it uses a healthy bone marrow as a reference. The reason we wanted to emphasize this is, for instance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref> there is a relapsed NPM1 patient with 41% of CD14+ Monocytes, as deconvolution percentage might not be exact, this patient could potentially have a healthy monocytic population but rather the reason for his relapse could be due to a different cell type, possibly 17% EMP as it is the second most abundant cell type for this patient. However, we have two rationales behind not using a single cell reference with cancerous cells. First, without mutation calling for all cells, one cannot be sure whether a cell is cancerous or not. Strategies like predicting cancer cells based on their transcriptional similarity of cells with mutation calling, proposed by Van Galen <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, adds another level of ambiguity to already not perfect deconvolution pipelines. Secondly and more importantly, heterogeneity of AML causes further sub-clustering within individual AML cases (e.g. UMAP plots of Triana <italic>et al</italic>., 2021), therefore creating a not well-characterized cell type signature but rather patient specific clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Additionally, using healthy subsets as reference allows our framework to provide more interpretable and intuitive results for clinicians and doctors, as it reports immune phenotypes and percentages on contrary to score-based prognostic values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. To summarize, we believe our proposed pipeline could be a blueprint for assessing new drugs’ resistances on different cell types of AML and along with our framework, they may provide better insights for clinicians and help paving the way into precision medicine in AML.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="S12"><title>Creating the healthy BM single-cell reference</title><p id="P21">We downloaded three different healthy BM datasets from two different studies, namely Van Galen et. al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> (full-transcriptome, n=6,915), and Triana et. al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (full-transcriptome, n = 13,165; 462 targeted mRNA, n=49,057).

Each column represents a sample, which is deconvoluted into 22 cell types (bottom part with blue) via healthy single cell BM reference. Top part of the annotations shows the provided meta data (FAB, WHO and ELN classifications, origin, sex and reported blast percentages) for these cohorts. Each patient was assigned to its most abundant deconvoluted cell type (AML phenotype) and samples within each assignment were sorted according to the assigned phenotype. <bold>B</bold> UMAP plot of deconvolution levels annotated via most abundant cell type as the left panel; and on the right, ECCs of 6 out of 22 cell types were shown in continuous scale (HSC, CD14+ Monocytes, Late Erythrocytes, GMP, EMP and cDC). <bold>C</bold> Similar to UMAP plot in (B) but colored with FAB classifications (left panel), and the fractions of cell types for each of these FAB classifications (right panel).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS163135-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title><italic>Ex-vivo</italic> drug response predictions</title><p><bold>A</bold> Correlation of predicted AUC and normalized AUC of <italic>ex-vivo</italic> drug resistances split by WHO classes (top 10 drugs).
