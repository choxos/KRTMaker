In common with most viruses that replicate in the host cell cytoplasm, RSV induces the formation of cytoplasmic compartments within infected cells to sequester replicative processes from host countermeasures. The best characterised organelle formed during RSV infection is the inclusion body â€“ the primary site of viral RNA synthesis - thought to form as a membrane-less biomolecular condensate. Fluorescence microscopy of cellular compartments using probes directed at the structural proteins of RSV and the intergenic regions of the RSV genome have identified a second class of organelles termed assembly granules. Here we use correlative microscopy to identify assembly granules in the cytoplasm of frozen hydrated RSV infected cells for imaging using cryogenic soft X-ray tomography and cryogenic electron tomography. We show that these compartments are membrane bound, enclosing large numbers of vesicles, some of which contain RSV ribonucleoprotein complexes. Further we show that these organelles are frequently adjacent to mitochondria and surrounded by ER-like membranes. We also observe vesicles connected by junctions suggesting mixing of contents and a mechanism for the different viral proteins to come together within the assembly granule prior to budding. Collectively, our data provides novel insights into the RSV assembly process.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory disease, causing bronchiolitis in infants and acute respiratory failure in the elderly. It is estimated to cause more than 30M infections globally each year in children under the age of five, resulting in ~3M hospital admissions and 60,000 in-hospital deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. In older adults an estimated ~330,000 hospital admissions lead to 14,000 in-hospital deaths globally each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].</p><p id="P3">RSV is an enveloped virus, classified within the <italic>Orthopneumovirus</italic> genus of the Mononegavirales, a group of non-segmented, negative sense RNA containing viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The viral genome is 15.2 kb and encodes eleven gene products in ten open reading frames [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Throughout the viral replication cycle, the genome is encapsidated along its length by multiple copies of nucleocapsid protein (N) forming a helical ribonucleoprotein complex, known as the nucleocapsid. Nucleocapsids associate with proteins involved in viral transcription and genome replication; the large RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase subunit (L); phosphoprotein (P); and M2-1 protein, forming holonucleocapsids.</p><p id="P4">RSV assembles filamentous virions that contain multiple holonucleocapsids, as well as N-RNA rings. These are surrounded by a layer of helically ordered matrix (M) protein that is in turn enclosed within the viral envelope studded by viral glycoproteins F, G and SH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Following G mediated attachment of a virion to a new host-cell, F drives fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], leading to release of holonucleocapsids into the cell cytoplasm, where they commence synthesis of viral RNA: mRNAs corresponding to each of the viral genes, and antigenomes that in turn act as templates for the synthesis of new genome copies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Viral replication takes place exclusively in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Accumulation of virus-encoded proteins and genome copies leads to the production of progeny filamentous virions that bud from the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P5">In previous work, fluorescence microscopy studies characterised the relationships between RSV RNA and proteins, defining their location within infected cells at different times of infection. At early times, the RSV genomic RNA and L, P, N and M2-1 proteins co-localised in small puncta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. As the infection progresses the puncta increase in size to form a second type of compartment: large inclusion bodies, which have been shown to be sites of RSV RNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The inclusion bodies are membrane-less structures that have properties of liquid-liquid phase-separated organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Anecdotal evidence suggests that they are densely packed. For example, while inclusion body-associated RSV genome RNA has been detected with standard fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) probes, it was not readily detected using chemically modified RNA probes targeting the RSV genome, known as MTRIPs (multiply labelled tetravalent RNA imaging probes). In addition, immunofluorescence labelling of N and P proteins primarily detected them at the inclusion body surface, likely indicating epitope occlusion in the inclusion body interior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Later times in infection mark the appearance of a third type of compartment containing RSV ribonucleoprotein structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. These cytoplasmic granules also contain the viral M protein, the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins and are thought to be important in bringing together viral components required for virion assembly. Based on these observations they have been tentatively termed assembly granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Assembly granules appear to have different biophysical properties than inclusion bodies: whereas inclusion bodies seem to be dense and partially impenetrable, assembly granules are permeable to MTRIP probes, and N and P proteins can be readily detected throughout, rather than predominantly at the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. While considerable work has been performed to characterise RSV inclusion bodies, little is known regarding the properties of assembly granules.</p><p id="P6">Detailed characterisation of the diverse cellular compartments formed during RSV infection is a key step towards mechanistic properties being properly ascribed to well-defined organelles. To begin to address this challenge, we used correlative fluorescence microscopy under cryogenic conditions to identify compartments of interest for imaging using both soft X-ray tomography (cryo-SXT), and electron tomography (cryo-ET). These techniques provide a means of imaging cells in a near-native, frozen-hydrated state, without chemical fixation that may cause artefacts or perturbation of important features. Cryo-SXT provides high contrast imaging of intact cells, to reveal cellular ultrastructure by operating in the â€˜water-windowâ€™ of X-ray light. This is the spectral range between the absorbance edge of carbon (284 eV) and that of oxygen (543 eV). Thus, images generated by X-rays at an energy of ~500 eV give much greater absorbance contrast for carbon and nitrogen containing materials such as protein and lipids, compared to oxygen containing water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Cryo-SXT gives a wide field of view (potentially many tens of Î¼m) with resolution ranging between 25 and 40 nm depending on the optical system used. Cryo-SXT is therefore particularly suited to imaging membranous cellular compartments. Cryo-ET provides complementary three-dimensional imaging of unfixed frozen-hydrated cellular samples, providing a higher resolution view (typically in the 1-2 nm range), but over a smaller field of view of ~1-2 Î¼m. The limited penetrating power of electrons in the transmission electron microscope restricts sample thickness to &lt;300 nm. To overcome this limitation, cellular specimens may be milled using a focused ion beam, to produce lamellae of appropriate thickness (cryoFIB milling) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p id="P7">We used multi-modal cryomicroscopy imaging to investigate the structure of cellular compartments formed during RSV infection, focusing on assembly granules, which were detected using RSV genome targeted MTRIPs and G-specific lectin probes. The images obtained revealed that assembly granules are multivesicular compartments that contain both nucleocapsids and N-RNA rings and demonstrate evidence of vesicle-vesicle fusion events that could allow different viral components to be brought together.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>RSV MTRIP-labelled compartments are distinct from canonical inclusion bodies</title><p id="P8">RSV MTRIP probes (RSV MTRIPs), which target an intergenic region of the negative sense genome RNA, are particularly suited to live-cell imaging, making them ideal probes for cryomicroscopy without chemical fixation. To characterize the different organelles detected by RSV MTRIPs, RSV protein co-localisation studies were performed using laser-scanning confocal microscopy on cells that had been fixed at 24 h post infection (pi). Bright cytoplasmic puncta were observed with MTRIP staining, which was specific to RSV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1A &amp; 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Fig S1</xref>). Co-localisation analyses indicated a complex array of RSV-infection associated cellular compartments. Co-staining with MTRIPs and N-specific antibody revealed at least three types of cytoplasmic compartments. MTRIP and N co-localization was observed but confined to small compartments at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1C &amp; 1D</xref>) and inside budding filamentous virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1E-1H</xref>). In addition to these N and RSV genome containing compartments, many small granules were positive only for MTRIP-labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K &amp; 1L</xref>). This is a surprising finding because it is thought that RSV genome RNA only exists in encapsidated form. It is possible that in these compartments, RNA-bound N protein adopts a conformation that occludes the antibody epitope, or that they contain viral genome RNA (or a fragment of genome RNA) that is not encapsidated. In addition to these relatively small compartments, N-specific staining was present in larger compartments, with strong staining at the periphery, but weaker staining at the centre. These larger structures, which exhibit the established staining characteristics of canonical RSV inclusion bodies were devoid of any MTRIP labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1I &amp; 1J</xref>) corroborating previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. MTRIP co-staining experiments with an RSV P-targeted fluorescent antibody confirmed that P was largely detected in inclusion bodies, showing a similar pattern of staining to that of N (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figs S2A-S2G</xref>). Like N however, co-localisation of P and MTRIP staining of RSV RNA was observed in some small granular structures as well as RSV filamentous virions along the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figs S2H-S2K</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Viral glycoproteins F and G play a key role in RSV infection. F is required for virion fusion with the cell membrane and subsequent entry into cells, while G mediates virion attachment. Both G and F could be found co-localised with MTRIPs, in small cytosolic compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Taken together, these data confirm that MTRIP probes are excluded from N- and P- containing inclusion bodies, but label cytoplasmic organelles that contain N, P, G and/or F proteins, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. These latter compartments are likely to have a different function than the RNA production activities of inclusion bodies and the data collected by ourselves and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] are consistent with them being an RSV-induced organelle, termed an assembly granule, that serves as a hub for collection of viral components prior to budding of RSV filamentous virions at the plasma membrane. The presence in these compartments of viral G-protein and N-RNA complexes that assemble through different pathways, argues against them being a cellular response to protein over-expression.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cryo-Soft X-ray Tomography reveals the ultrastructure of assembly granules</title><p id="P11">The laser scanning confocal microscopy experiments described above confirmed the validity of G and MTRIP labelling for the identification and localisation of putative assembly granules, but G antibody labelling is not compatible with fixative-free cryogenic microscopy methods. Therefore, Alexa 488-conjugated lectin soyabean agglutinin (SBA) was used for fixative-free detection of G protein. SBA is a live-cell probe that specifically labels RSV G protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4D</xref>). A549 cells were propagated directly on gold electron microscopy grids, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], infected with RSV and subsequently labelled with MTRIPs and SBA at 24 h pi to detect RSV genomic RNA and G protein. The grids bearing labelled, virus infected cells were then plunge frozen in liquid ethane. Frozen-hydrated grids were imaged at liquid nitrogen temperature by both epifluorescence and brightfield microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>) to identify cells of interest exhibiting bright fluorescent labelling. Mock-infected cells were also stained, frozen and examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig S4</xref>). Having defined the regions of interest (ROI) by light microscopy, a montage of images that encompassed the whole grid was correlated with X-ray image montages of ROIs from the same samples using cryo-soft X-ray microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Preliminary X-ray imaging allowed for assessment of ice quality and cell integrity as well as the presence of fiducial-markers, gold beads added to the specimen prior to freezing that enable accurate alignment of image tilt-series for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. Alignment and correlation of the X-ray and fluorescence microscopy image montages identified ROIs for tilt series data collection, targeting areas of the cytoplasm that showed RSV genome and G protein staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3C and 3D</xref>). Overlaying slices from the resulting X-ray tomograms with the fluorescence microscopy data revealed that the fluorescent staining corresponded with the presence of cytoplasmic compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3E-3H</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Overall, 33 image tilt-series were collected for ROIs in RSV infected cells, while 17 image tilt-series were collected on representative cytoplasmic regions of mock-infected cells. The resulting tomograms revealed a cytoplasm full of membranous compartments in both infected and uninfected cells. Mitochondria were particularly evident and recognised by the presence of cristae. Lipid droplets were seen as dense bodies while an abundance of smaller compartments was also seen, presumably endosomes, lysosomes and similar. The cell nuclei, nucleoli and nuclear membranes were also readily observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary videos 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">2</xref>). Guided by fluorescence microscopy data we identified membrane-bound, multi-vesicular compartments that correlated with the MTRIP and SBA staining, implicating them as assembly granules containing both viral RNA and G-protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4A, 4C, 4D, 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary video 1</xref>). Importantly these granular structures were evident only in RSV-infected samples and were not seen in mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4E, 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">supplementary video 2</xref>). Assembly granules were observed to range in diameter from 435 nm to 762 nm and enclosed an abundance of smaller vesicles within them. They were often found to be closely apposed to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4A, 4H</xref>), with both organelles often enwrapped in membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4A, 4I</xref>). These membranous changes seemed to originate from the periphery of the nucleus where we also observed blebbing of the nuclear membrane, suggesting that these membranes are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P13">RSV filamentous virions budding from the cell membrane were observed. These sites of virion assembly were occasionally found to be close to assembly granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 A and B, G and H</xref>). As well as the fluorescently labelled multivesicular compartments, we saw several other structures in infected cells that were not seen in mock infected cells. These included large compartments that were denser than the cytosol but lacked a membrane, and that may be inclusion bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4A, 4B</xref>). We also saw many highly contrasted structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4C, 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary video 1</xref>). In the absence of specific labelling however we are unable to definitively ascribe a viral origin to these features.</p><p id="P14">These data provide a mesoscale view of the changes wrought upon cell architecture by RSV infection, showing an abundance of novel cellular compartments, consistent with the previous fluorescence imaging studies. With the aid of correlative microscopy, cryo-SXT shows that compartments labelled both for RSV genome and G protein are membranous, multi-vesicular organelles.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Assembly granules contain an abundance of uni- and multi-lamellar vesicles that enclose macromolecular assemblies likely composed of RSV nucleocapsid protein and RNA</title><p id="P15">To achieve a higher resolution view of the assembly granules, we used correlative fluorescence microscopy to guide focused ion beam milling under cryogenic conditions (cryo-FIBSEM). This approach uses a specialised cryo-scanning electron microscope, fitted with an ion-beam source, to etch thin-sections from frozen-hydrated cells propagated directly on the cryo-EM grid. These â€˜windows into the cellâ€™ are known as lamellae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Frozen-hydrated, RSV-infected A549 cells were imaged using epifluorescence microscopy to screen for MTRIP fluorescence and thereby determine ROIs likely to contain assembly granules for subsequent milling by cryo-FIBSEM. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). Grids were imaged using the scanning-electron microscope probe at low (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>) and medium magnifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S5B and S5C</xref>) allowing selection of cells that had previously shown good fluorescent labelling of puncta. The ROI was then milled using the gallium ion-beam to prepare a thin lamella (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5D-E</xref>). Grids bearing milled lamellae were carefully transferred to the cryo-TEM for tilt-series acquisition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5F</xref>). The workflow for preparing lamellae is labour intensive and prone to build up of frost contamination and devitrification of the frozen materials. Despite the presence of some frosting, we were able to collect data on several lamellae that had remained wholly or mostly vitreous. In these preparations, cellular compartments were clearly visible in the cryo-EM at low magnifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5G and S5H</xref>). Dose-symmetric tilt series of selected ROIs were collected at a nominal magnification of 34,000Ã—, corresponding to 3.48 Ã…/pixel at the specimen scale. These data were processed to calculate three-dimensional reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Upon close inspection of the reconstructed tomograms, we see that each ROI contains a membrane bound compartment with complex ultrastructure comprising many smaller vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">supplementary video 3</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The membranous organelle we see by cryo-ET has features consistent with those compartments seen at lower magnification by cryo-SXT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5A and 5B</xref>). Overall, the compartments range in diameter between 488 and 755 nm. Bound within the organelle are many tens of sub-compartments ranging in diameter between 35 nm and 240 nm. These vesicular sub-compartments are often flexible in shape deviating significantly from spherical form and sometimes folding around each other. Furthermore, these vesicles may be unilamellar, or multi-lamellar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5C, 5E</xref>). Many of the vesicles are densely packed with contents, especially the smaller ones, while others appear to have fewer contents. Vesicles occasionally appear to be connected by junctions, with some having the appearance of being in a hemi-fusion state, suggesting dynamic mixing of contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5D, 5F-5H</xref>). Within many larger sub-compartments, we noted the presence of ring-shaped and filamentous structures. We hypothesise that these macromolecular assemblies are likely N-RNA rings, loosely- and tightly-coiled helical nucleocapsids and/or holonucleocapsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5I, 5J</xref>). The rings and helices ranged in diameter between 10 and 12 nm and are morphologically similar to holonucleocapsid and N-RNA rings seen previously in cryo-ET reconstructions of budding filamentous RSV virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Consistent with our cryo-SXT data, mitochondria were seen to be closely associated with these assembly granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5A, B, C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">When viewing 3D tomographic reconstructions, sections through the reconstructed density maps do not readily convey the complexity of the volume information. To better visualize the 3D information present in these tomograms, we annotated an assembly granule by segmentation to produce a pseudo 3D representation of the organelle ultrastructure and surrounding cellular environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K</xref>). The abundance of vesicular structures enclosed within the assembly granule, as well as the presence of N-RNA rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5J</xref>) is more easily appreciated in this representation, as is the proximity of a mitochondrion. ER-like membrane partially enwraps the assembly granule suggesting a possible role for ER-derived membrane in the formation of these compartments, a hypothesis supported by our cryo-SXT data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">The formation of protein containing organelles in RSV infected cells has been documented in numerous studies. While the most frequently described are inclusion bodies, recent work has revealed that there are different types of structures with distinctive properties, as well as differences in associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. These findings are substantiated by the confocal microscopy analysis presented here, which revealed at least four types of distinctive structures: viral filaments at the plasma membrane, inclusion bodies, structures containing viral genome RNA, but not detected with other viral proteins, and assembly granules. In this study, we imaged RSV infected cells at a late time-point, when virions are assembling at the plasma membrane, to focus on assembly granules, structures that could be detected using live-cell probes and that contain viral genomic RNA and the G glycoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p id="P19">Assembly mechanisms differ across the non-segmented negative strand RNA viruses, even between closely related viruses, but in all cases examined to date, the process requires convergence of viral holonucleocapsids, matrix protein and surface glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. In the case of RSV, holonucleocapsids are generated in viral inclusion bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Release of RSV holonucleocapsids from inclusion bodies is dependent on matrix protein, which transiently associates within inclusion bodies through interaction with the viral M2-1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. The F protein also plays a role; it can be found localized within small puncta at the perimeter of inclusion bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Transport of M and holonucleocapsids away from inclusion bodies and viral filament formation are dependent on the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of F protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] and microtubules, Rab11 and other components of the recycling endosome pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. The G protein is trafficked to the plasma membrane independently of M and F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. It is then internalized into vesicles in a clathrin-dependent manner and merges with granules containing viral holonucleocapsids and F protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. It is these vesicles where the F- and M-associated holonucleocapsids and G proteins co-localise that are referred to as assembly granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p id="P20">The high-resolution multimodal analysis presented here shows for the first time the ultrastructural details of the assembly granules. Importantly, these tomogram images were captured by cryogenic vitrification of live RSV infected cells, preserving features that might have been lost or altered by fixation and staining. The data show that assembly granules are complex multi-vesicular structures. These are clearly distinct from the inclusion body RNA synthesis factories, which are membrane-less structures whose boundaries are defined by liquid-liquid phase separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Each assembly granule consists of multiple, different types of vesicles collected within an organelle bounded by a single membrane. Some vesicles clearly contained viral nucleocapsids and N-rings, whereas others did not. There was evidence of channels and potential fusion events between these different vesicles. While we were not able to detect the glycoproteins or discern whether cellular or viral fusogens drive this process, such fusion events could allow vesicles containing RSV G protein to merge with vesicles harbouring F, M and viral holonucleocapsids, bringing the virion glycoproteins into the same membrane, with M and holonucleocapsids proximal to their cytoplasmic tails.</p><p id="P21">Unlike most other enveloped viruses RSV is not dependent on the ESCRT pathway for virus budding and fission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. This raises questions about how the budding process occurs. Live-cell and confocal microscopy studies of assembly granules showed that G- and F-containing vesicles distend into filaments which subsequently become loaded with genome RNA, indicating that assembly granules (and the vesicles within them) may play a role in virion formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. However, another study showed that virions assemble at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Both findings are consistent with earlier EM studies that suggested that budding virions could be detected within intracellular vesicles as well as at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. It is possible that there is more than one pathway by which budding can occur. The images we collected do not show viruses budding within assembly granules, although considerably more images would need to be collected to rule out this possibility. However, we did observe close proximity of an assembly granule to budding virions at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 A, B, G and H</xref>). It is possible that assembly granules function to transport the virion components to the plasma membrane and that vesicles within assembly granules then deposit their contents at the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane to begin the budding process. However, the complexity of these organelles makes it challenging to hypothesise mechanisms by which this may occur. Further high-resolution correlative cryo-EM studies may elucidate the processes leading to virion assembly.</p><p id="P22">In conclusion, to our knowledge this is the first study using state-of-the-art multimodal cryogenic correlative imaging methods to carry out high-resolution ultrastructural characterisation of RSV assembly granules in live cells <italic>in situ</italic>.
