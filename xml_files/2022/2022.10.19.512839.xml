targeted with small molecules. Multi-omics analysis revealed that NRAS-mutated melanoma cells with a mesenchymal transcriptional profile adopt a quiescent metabolic program to resist cellular stress response induced by MEK-inhibitor resistance. However, as a result of elevated baseline ROS levels, these cells become highly sensitive to ROS induction. <italic>In vivo</italic> xenograft experiments and single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated that intra-tumor heterogeneity requires the combination of a ROS-inducer and a MEK-inhibitor to target both tumor growth and metastasis.

In recent years, targeting the MAPK pathway in BRAF-mutant melanoma has led to a dramatic improvement in the 5-year overall survival of BRAF-mutated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. However, intensive efforts to develop small molecules that directly bind to mutated NRAS proteins have failed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Given the lack of targeted therapies for patients with NRAS-mutated melanoma, immunotherapy is the recommended first-line treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. MEK inhibition in NRAS-mutated melanoma can prolong progression-free survival and has been suggested as a treatment option after immunotherapy failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Since targeting MAPK signaling in NRAS-mutated melanoma is only beneficial to a small subset of patients (response rate for binimetinib is 15-20%), it is unclear whether other vulnerabilities in these cells might be druggable, for which genome-wide screens have been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Cell metabolism is an important hallmark of cancer and has an impact on tumorigenesis and metastasis, leading to deregulation of the intracellular redox balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Consequently, alterations of intracellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels dictate cellular phenotypes and modulate oncogenic signaling. Elevated ROS levels have been demonstrated to promote carcinogenesis and cancer progression by amplifying genomic instability through DNA damage and directly stimulating cancer-promoting signaling pathways in tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Oncogenic BRAF mutations and the resulting hyperactivation of MAPK signaling increase the glycolytic phenotype in melanoma, thereby delivering antioxidant defense mechanisms through the pentose phosphate pathway, which ensures cancer cell survival and proliferation by linking glycolysis to intracellular ROS control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. In contrast to the Warburg effect, in which tumors produce energy (in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate)) through glycolysis, recent studies have shown that melanomas treated with MAPK pathway inhibitors have reduced glycolysis and elevated oxygen consumption levels, and therefore high oxidative phosphorylation rates (OXPHOS), resulting in elevated beta-oxidation and altered generation of superoxide anions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. A similar intensive analysis of the inhibition of the MAPK pathway and the resulting metabolic phenotype in NRAS-mutated melanoma is lacking. In non-cancer cells, ROS are produced at low concentrations and are therefore effectively scavenged by the potent cellular antioxidant system. Therefore, targeting ROS in aggressive cancer cells with elevated ROS levels and impaired ROS-scavenging systems is a promising treatment strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p id="P6">In this study, we employed a high-throughput screening approach to target NRAS-mutated MEK inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells. This led to the discovery of neocuproine, which targets changes in the energy metabolism of NRAS-mutated melanoma cells by increasing the ROS levels. Because of the high sensitivity of NRAS-mutated, treatment-resistant, and mesenchymal melanoma cells to neocuproine, we were able to elucidate novel differences in the metabolism of MEK inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells and their connection to transcriptional cell states and phenotype plasticity. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> tumor analysis, xenograft responses, and broad cancer cell line panel screening point towards a general clinical potential of ROS inducers in the treatment of cancer as well as in combination with kinase inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Primary human melanoma cell lines and treatments</title><p id="P7">Patient-derived melanoma cell lines were provided by the Melanoma Biobank, University Hospital Zurich, which were established from surplus material from primary cutaneous and metastatic melanoma removed by surgery. Written informed consent was obtained from patients and the study was approved by the local IRB (EK647 and EK800; BASEC-Nr.2017-00494; BASEC-Nr.2014-0425). Melanoma cells were isolated from the tissue biopsies and grown as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Melanoma cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Cat# R8758) supplemented with 5 mM glutamine (Gibco, Cat# 25030-081), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# S8636), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, Lonza, Switzerland) and cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2. Small-molecule kinase inhibitors: BRAFi (Selleckchem, Encorafenib, Cat#S7108); MEKi (Selleckchem, Binimetinib, Cat#S7007)) and all STO compounds were derived from the ActiTarg-K Kinase Modulators Library (TimTec, Delaware, USA). The other compounds used in this study were N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#A7250), dichloroacetate (DCA, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#347795), and neocuproine (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#N1501).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Proliferation assay</title><p id="P8">Cell proliferation and IC50 values (half-inhibitory concentration) were determined using Resazurin reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#R7017).

MEK inhibitor-sensitive and MEK inhibitor-resistant melanoma cell lines (three sensitive and three resistant) were seeded in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. On the day of the assay, 1 μM of each of the 960 compounds was added to each well of a 96-well plate and incubated for an additional 72 h. Cell proliferation was measured using a Resazurin solution, as described above. The fluorescence values were normalized to [0, 100] using positive and negative controls. Positive controls consisted of 10 μM Taxol (Paclitaxel, Selleckchem, Cat#S1150) or 10 μM ERK inhibitor (SCH772984, Selleckchem, Cat#S7101), which resulted in the lowest viability. Negative controls were treated with 0.1% DMSO. The normalized fluorescence was calculated as follows: (raw fluorescence – taxol/ERK) / (DMSO – ERK) × 100.

Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 1.5% agar dissolved in RPMI medium and incubated under UV light in laminar flow for 30 min. 2x10<sup>3</sup> cells/well were seeded on top of the agar and 3D sphere formation was observed 24-48 hours later under a light microscope. In experiments using line M160915, 3D spheroids were generated using ultra-low attachment surface spheroid microplates (Corning, Cat# 4520). 3D spheroids were collected carefully in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and rested on ice. Per 3 ml of collagen-matrix 2.3 ml Collagen type I (from rat tails, Corning, Life Sciences, Cat# 354236) was mixed on ice with 0.3 ml DMEM base medium, 0.3 ml FCS, 25 μl glutamine, 60 μl sodium bicarbonate (7.5% solution, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# S8761) and 30 μl antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, Cat# 15240-062). The access medium was carefully removed from the 3D spheres, and the spheres were mixed with 100 μl collagen-matrix and transferred to an agar-coated 96-well plate. 3D spheroids were incubated for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to polymerize the collagen matrix and overlaid with 100 μl of melanoma cell line medium. Once the first sign of cell invasion was visible under a light microscope (16-24 hours), the melanoma cell line medium was removed and replaced with compound-containing melanoma cell culture medium. Treatments were replenished once every 5 days, after which the cell culture medium was replaced with one containing 8 μM calcein-AM (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# 17783) and ethidium homodimers (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# 46043) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Quantification was done using single point calibration by comparing the area under the peak of each ceramide species to the area under the peak of the internal standard. Quality controls using a mixture of all samples were used at four concentration (1x,0.5x,0.25xand 0.125 ×). Triplicates of the QCs were measured, and the CV% for each of the lipids reported was below 20%. The following classes were identified in the current study: aclycarnitites, phospholipids (phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols,phosphatidylglycerols, and phosphatidyserines), sphingolipids (sphingoid base phosphates, ceramides, deoxyceramides, monohexosylceramides, and sphinogmeylins), and glycerolipids(diacylglycerol, triacylglycerol). Mass spectrometric data analysis was performed using Treacefinder software 4.1 (ThermoScientific) for peak picking, annotation, and matching to the in-house fragmentation database.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P47">All experiments in this study were performed with at least three replicates.

We used patient-derived melanoma cell lines with confirmed NRAS mutations, including those which showed resistance to the MEK inhibitor binimetinib ((n=6; sensitive (M130515, M130429, M130427) resistant (M131205, M130219, M130227), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">suppl.

Only four of the 960 compounds significantly inhibited the growth of melanoma cells by more than 50% on average across our cell panel at a concentration of 1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

Interestingly, two compounds (STO13881 and STO12435) reduced the growth of NRAS-mutated MEK inhibitor (binimetinib)-resistant cells more compared to sensitive once (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S1a</xref>). All four compounds were manually validated on the same NRAS-mutated melanoma cell panel (n=6) with dose-escalating concentrations to determine the precise IC50 values of each compound for the growth rate of the individual cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S1 c-d</xref>). Only compound STO13881 significantly impaired cell growth more in MEK inhibitor-resistant cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 b-c</xref>). We confirmed STO13881 and neocuproine to have overlapping HPLC profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S2</xref>). We used patient-derived primary cell cultures of fibroblasts, melanocytes, and keratinocytes to show that heathy cells were not affected by neocuproine treatment at similar concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S1 b</xref>). We confirmed that neocuproine targets resistant cell lines in an additional ten patient-derived melanoma lines with confirmed NRAS mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Table ST1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Table ST2</xref>). We observed significant differences in the sensitivity to neocuproine between MEKi-sensitive and resistant melanoma lines (hereafter referred to as sensitive and resistant, respectively; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S3 a-b</xref>)). To assess the additional benefit of neocuproine treatment and account for differences in sensitivity to MEKi, we calculated the IC50 ratio of neocuproine and MEKi (binimetinib) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Table ST1</xref>). We plotted the neocuproine/MEKi ratios and observed significant separation between the resistant and sensitive cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 d</xref>). Next, we wanted to confirm our findings on resistant melanomas with NRAS mutations in a physiological cell culture model reflecting key features of solid tumors like cell-cell contacts as well as a microenvironment. We performed 3D spheroid invasion assays in a collagen type I matrix and examined the viability and area of invasion of 3D spheroids derived from the resistant and NRAS mutated melanoma cell line M160915 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1 e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3 c-d</xref>). We found that neocuproine and its combination with MEKi had a significant effect on cell viability and invasion area. We recently reported that BRAF-mutated melanomas can acquire MAPK pathway resistance through additional NRAS mutations in the same cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. We also investigated whether these cells were sensitive to neocuproine. 3D spheroids derived from M121224 (NRAS/BRAF-mutated) cells were embedded in a collagen I matrix and treated with BRAFi (i.e., encorafenib), MEKi, neocuproine, or their combinations. This patient progressed under encorafenib treatment, and we found that the co-occurrence of an additional NRAS mutation during treatment was associated with resistance to BRAFi. Consistent with this observation, spheroids thrived in the presence of BRAFi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S3 e-f</xref>). Interestingly, although the MEKi can target these cells in vitro, we found that 3D spheroids were still viable and invaded the collagen matrix under MEKi treatment. However, the viability and invasiveness of 3D spheroids was abrogated by neocuproine and the addition of MAPKi significantly enhanced this effect in a concentration-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="S37"><title>Neocuproine impairs cell growth through ROS-induction</title><p id="P49">Neocuproine is known as a copper-chelating agent, which is rapidly reduced to neocuproine-Cu (I) complexes upon binding of Cu (II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. In contrast to copper-chelating agents neocuproine is a “copper ionophore” which transports Cu from the extracellular space through cell membranes. The activity of ionophores is strictly Cu-dependent, and Cu ionophores are inactive under Cu-depleted conditions. Therefore, we used the copper-chelator trientine to deplete copper from the cell culture medium and reversed the effects of neocuproine on melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S4 a</xref>). Although neocuproine-Cu complexes are stable, it has been observed that neocuproine-Cu (I) in combination with glutathione (GSH) can induce DNA breaks through oxidative mechanisms. Antioxidants, such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), are ROS scavengers that reverse their cellular effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. We found that the growth-inhibitory effects of neocuproine could be rescued by the antioxidant NAC, suggesting that this effect is caused by oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 a</xref>). Consistently, in 3D spheroid assays, collagen matrix invasion was significantly rescued by NAC co-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S4 b-d</xref>). An early cellular response to DNA damage involves accumulation of γH2AX at DNA strand breaks induced by UV exposure, metabolic stress, and ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Consistent with the observed upregulation of oxidative stress, we found a significant accumulation of γH2AX only in resistant melanoma cells treated with escalating doses of neocuproine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 c</xref>). The observed DNA damage was also accompanied by an increase in resistant cells in the G2-phase in resistant cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S4 e</xref>). It has been demonstrated that neocuproine-Cu complexes decrease mitochondrial membrane potential, which results in increased ROS production in astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. We found that, while cytoplasmic ROS were significantly upregulated in resistant melanoma, differences in superoxide production at the mitochondrial cell membranes were not detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. FigureS5a</xref>). We observed a significant upregulation of cytoplasmic ROS upon neocuproine treatment only in resistant cells, which were sensitive to neocuproine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 d</xref>). This effect was rescued by NAC, confirming the induction of ROS by neocuproine. Increasing evidence points towards the carcinogenic role of intracellular redox imbalance and aberrant ROS levels, which is consistent with the observed higher baseline ROS levels in our resistant melanoma lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. In contrast, high levels of ROS are thought to induce cell death by inducing apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the induction of apoptosis by neocuproine. We observed increased caspase 3/7 activity, as well as an increased fraction of apoptotic cells in resistant melanoma cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2 e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S5 b-c</xref>). Consistent with these observations, we detected increased cleavage of PARP when resistant cells were treated with neocuproine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5 d</xref>). However, in the NRAS/BRAF double-mutated melanoma cell lines (i.e., M12224), we detected decreased levels of apoptosis as measured by caspase 3/7 activation compared to the NRAS-mutated and resistant cultures, suggesting that there are other mechanisms involved in cell death compared to cells that only harbor NRAS mutations. Thus, resistant cells experienced high basal ROS levels, which were further elevated by neocuproine to induce cell death via apoptosis. We then tested the hypothesis that cell lines resistant to MEKi are associated with high basal ROS levels, resulting in a resistant cell phenotype that corresponds to neocuproine sensitivity. Therefore, we analyzed our melanoma cell lines for basal ROS levels and responsiveness to neocuproine and MEKi. Basal ROS levels significantly correlated with MEKi inhibitor sensitivity (p&lt;0.001, R-square 0.8) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S6 a</xref>). Applying MEKi-sensitivity as a categorical variable according to IC50 (i.e., whether a cell line was considered sensitive or resistant based on an IC50 threshold), we found a significant correlation with basal ROS levels (p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Table ST1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S6 b</xref>). Finally, we tested for a correlation between the MEKi phenotype and neocuproine responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 f</xref>) and found a strong relationship between basal ROS levels, inhibitor sensitivity, and responsiveness to neocuproine in NRAS-mutated melanoma (p&lt;0.001).</p></sec><sec id="S38"><title>Sensitivity to neocuproine is associated with a mesenchymal cell phenotype and low metabolic activity</title><p id="P50">The “phenotype switching” model proposes that melanoma cells can toggle their transcriptional profiles in a dynamic process with similarities to the model of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) described for epithelial cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Genetic alterations are thought to modulate the stability and strength of the cellular phenotype and the threshold level of phenotype switching but may not drive transcriptional intra-tumoral phenotype switching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Moreover, melanoma phenotypes influence sensitivity to MAPK inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. We performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering on bulk RNAseq data from our NRAS mutated melanoma cohort and observed a splitting into the original melanoma cell phenotypes (“proliferative,” “intermediate” and “invasive”) described by Hoek et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl Table ST3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Cell lines with a mostly “proliferative” phenotype are sensitive to MEKi, but resistant to neocuproine. In contrast, we could associate most MEKi resistant cell lines with the “invasive or intermediate phenotype” described by Hoek et al, which we now call the “mesenchymal” state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. In recent years, considerable evidence has demonstrated that melanoma cells in this mesenchymal state have lost melanocytic differentiation markers and adapted EMT-like signatures attributed to drug tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Proteomics-based technologies have been recognized as powerful tools for understanding cell heterogeneity and resistance mechanisms in melanomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. To understand the driving forces of our two cell phenotypes (sensitive vs. resistant to MEKi), we applied proteomics followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to compare the pathway activity of sensitive and resistant melanoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S5</xref>). We performed differential protein expression analysis and hierarchical clustering of the proteomic data and ranked the 15 most informative proteins for sensitive and resistant melanoma cell lines. Consistent with our previously published transcriptional signatures of proliferative and invasive melanoma phenotypes by Hoek et al., we found that sensitive melanoma cells upregulated Mitf-driven and melanocyte-specific factors that are also involved in pigmentation (PMEL and MART1) or factors involved in the trafficking of melanocytic-associated factors (RAB38 and RAB32). Additionally, we identified several upregulated proteins that play roles in metabolism and energy production (i.e., UPP1, ABCD1, GALE, SLC7A5, and IDH1). Consequently, we observed downregulation of Mitf, Mitf-targets, and melanocytic protein expression in resistant melanomas, but upregulation of EMT-related proteins (e.g., TGM2, NT5E, SPARC, PLAT, and PRNP), proteins involved in drug resistance (IGFBP1 and PTRF), or those antagonizing glycolysis like PRKCDBP (Cav3), which is associated with lipid rafts, and loss of this factor induces Warburg metabolism and lactate production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. GSEA revealed that melanoma cells sensitive to the melanocytic phenotype exhibited upregulated pathways involved in RNA transcription, MAPK pathway activation, and glucose metabolism. Resistant and mesenchymal melanoma cells down-regulate the MAPK pathway and glycolytic metabolism while upregulating twodistinct pathways known to drive metastatic cancer cell phenotype and impact on EMT: “extracellular matrix organization” and “cell junction organization” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. After treatment with neocuproine, we found only one pathway enriched in the sensitive (and neocuproine-resistant) cell cohort: “packaging of telomere ends” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 b</xref>). “Packaging of telomere ends” includes mostly histone cluster 1 H4 upregulation, which might protect the DNA from oxidative stress. We did not identify any factors that were significantly associated with neocuproine responsiveness in the resistant cell lines.</p><p id="P51">The enrichment of pathways involved in glycolytic processes in sensitive cell phenotypes prompted us to further investigate metabolic differences between sensitive and resistant melanomas. It is well known that metabolic pathways like glycolysis drive cellular detoxification by recycling of oxidized glutathione through NADPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Therefore, we performed mass spectrometry-based metabolomics on cell lysates from our cohort of NRAS-mutated melanomas. We confirmed enrichment of metabolites belonging to “Glycolysis,” “Gluconeogenesis,” “Phosphate pathway (PPP)” as well as “Mitochondrial beta-oxidation of long chain saturated fatty acids” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6 c</xref>). We did not find any metabolic pathways to be significantly enriched in resistant cell lines compared to sensitive ones, suggesting that resistance to MEKi is associated with a “silent” metabolic phenotype. Mass spectrometry-based lipidomic analysis of our cell cohorts revealed the separation of sensitive versus resistant cells based on their lipid profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S7 a</xref>). Consistent with the metabolomic analysis, most of the significantly altered lipids were downregulated (75/89) in resistant cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S7 b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Table ST6</xref>). Most of these lipids are involved in energy metabolism (in red: Acylcarnitines, FAs, DAGs, and TAGs) and others essential for keratinocyte differentiation and phenotype switching (in green: Ceramides, Sphingomyelins, and Hexosylceramides) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. These data further support the “silent” metabolism and undifferentiated state of resistant melanoma cells already observed via metabolomics.</p></sec><sec id="S39"><title>Low Glycolysis and PPP activity sensitizes resistant melanoma cells to ROS</title><p id="P52">Metabolomics revealed that treatment of sensitive cell lines with 1 μM neocuproine for 24 hours further increased the metabolites related to glycolysis, glycolysis-related metabolic pathways (e.g., “Gluconeogenesis,” “Lactate synthesis,” “Pentose phosphate pathway”), and “Transfer of Acetyl Groups into Mitochondria,” Citric acid cycle” and “Plasminogen Synthesis” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S6 b</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the defense against ROS induction generated by neocuproine is achieved through antioxidant scavenging by metabolic pathways, some of which are known to recycle GSH through NADPH (e.g. PPP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 d</xref>). To determine glycolytic cell capacity and the level of oxygen consumption, we employed Agilent Seahorse technology. We found that at baseline, sensitive melanoma cells (M130429 and M010817) had a significantly higher metabolic turnover rate determined by the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR, p&lt;0.001), as well as a significantly higher oxygen consumption rate (OCR, p&lt;0.001), in contrast to resistant melanoma cells (n=4; M130219, M130227, M160915, M121224) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 a-b</xref>). To confirm the metabolomics data, which revealed a strong upregulation of glycolysis after the addition of neocuproine to sensitive melanoma cells, we measured the induction of ECAR during treatment. In response to neocuproine, sensitive melanoma cells significantly upregulated their glycolytic rate (measured as glycolytic reserve), whereas resistant cells did not, but in contrast, significantly decreased their glycolytic rate. Treatment of resistance cells with MEKi, significantly downregulated their glycolytic rate, suggesting strong regulation of glycolytic pathways through MAPK signaling in NRAS-mutated melanomas with melanocytic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 c-d</xref>). Upregulation of glycolytic pathways (e.g PPP) through intact MAPK signaling can supply sensitive melanoma cells with antioxidant defense metabolites (GSH and NADPH) through which they are protected from neocuproine-induced ROS. As a proof of concept, we treated sensitive melanomas with a combination of neocuproine and dichloroacetate (DCA), known to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and PPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. We observed a significant decrease of neocurpoine’s IC50 in the presence of DCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 e</xref>). We also measured cytoplasmic ROS levels with DCF-DA and found a significant induction of ROS in sensitive cells treated with the combination of neocuproine and DCA, suggesting that inhibition of glycolysis/PPP is sufficient to sensitize cells to elevated ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 f</xref>). DCA was used in a concentration of 10 and 20 mM for these assays and DCA alone had an IC50 of about 30 and 23 mM for M130429 and M010817, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S 6e</xref>). Moreover, the glycolysis inhibitors 3-Bromopyruvate (3-BP) and 2-Desoxy-D-glucose (2DG) did not sensitize the cells to neocuproine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S6 f</xref>). These data indicate that the dynamic regulation of the PPP protects NRAS-mutated melanoma cells from oxidative stress and that the activity of the MAPK pathway is essential for this regulation.</p><p id="P53">ROS defense is achieved intracellularly through the GSH-NADPH axis. In the glycolysis pathway, NADPH has two different intracellular sources: PPP and TCA pathways through isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). In order to determine if the reduced PPP could increase basal ROS levels of resistant cells, we performed flux experiments with 13C-labled glucose to estimate the conversion of glucose molecules to lactate via glycolysis and PPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 g</xref>). Here, we found significantly reduced PPP activity in resistant melanoma cells, which could explain the lack of antioxidant defenses in resistant melanomas. Reduced GSH is considered one of the most important intracellular scavengers of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>].

Fresh tumor material was sectioned using a vibratome in 400 μm slices and maintained in cell culture medium on cell culture inserts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 a</xref>). They were treated with either MEKi (binimetinib), neocuproine, or a combination of both. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> slice cultures were incubated for an additional 72h under culture conditions, and immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate tumor area and cell proliferation using S100 and Ki67 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S9</xref>). We found that two of the three patients were initially MEKi resistant, suggesting an intrinsic resistance mechanism; whereas, the third patient was partially but significantly sensitive to MEKi. In all cases, treatment with neocuproine significantly reduced the proliferation of tumor slice cultures, although no significant synergy was observed with the combination of MEKi. The lack of synergy between neocuproine and MEKi may be due to the lack of cell plasticity in this model and the short timing of 72h.</p><p id="P55">Next, we validated neocuproine in a broader cohort of <italic>ex vivo</italic> clinical samples of the Tumor Profiler (TuPro) consortium. The TuPro study performed a multi-omics analysis in an approved clinical study (BASEC-2018-02050) in which ex vivo patient samples were assessed for their drug responsiveness employing different technologies beyond classical pathological and mutational analysis to guide treatment decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. Pharmacoscopy, a method to measure single-cell drug responses by immunofluorescence, automated microscopy, and image analysis, is part of the TuPro platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. Neocuproine alone or in combination with binimetinib was assessed in tumor digests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 c</xref>). A total of 62 melanomas were analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Table ST7</xref>). Of these, 49 (79%) were resistant to binimetinib. Most of the 49 tumor samples that were resistant to binimetinib were either sensitive to neocuproine monotherapy (10/49), combination with binimetinib (8/49), or both (12/49). Thus, the proportion of binimetinib failures that were sensitive to neocuproine monotherapy or in combination with binimetinib was significantly larger than those that were not (30/49 vs. 19/49, p = 0.023, 2-sample test for equality of proportions). Interestingly, 17 melanoma tumors were BRAF-mutated, highlighting the potential of neocuproine as a compound that can target resistant melanoma independent of their mutation status. In addition, part of the multi-level depiction of melanoma tumors was single-cell analysis using CyTOF technology on a panel of 53 pre-selected markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S10 a</xref>). Using these data, we searched for proteins associated with the pharmacological response to neocuproine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S10 b</xref>). We found that a general downregulation of signaling pathways (e.g., MAPK or AKT) measured by their proteins and phosphorylated kinases was associated with sensitivity to neocuproine and binimetinib combination. To identify biomarkers distinguishing samples that responded to neocuproine and binimetinib combination, but not binimetinib alone, we identified the upregulation of CAV1, a protein that we recently reported to be associated with resistant and mesenchymal melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. These data highlight that cells with low signaling activity but a mesenchymal phenotype can benefit from neocurpoine treatment alone or in combination with binimetinib. We validated these findings also on the original tumor material by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 10d</xref>). Clearly, the response to Binimetinib and neocuproine was associated with higher CAV1 staining but lower staining for pErk, pS6, or the melanocytic marker TYRP.</p><p id="P56">We recently demonstrated that phenotypic switching from melanocytic to mesenchymal melanoma sensitizes these cells to ferroptosis-inducing compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. In that study, cell lines with high mesenchymal scores were sensitive to ferroptosis-inducing compounds and dependent on GPX4. The significant relationship between melanoma cells with intrinsic high oxidative stress, mesenchymal phenotype, low cellular activity, and response to neocuproine prompted us to expand this observation to other cancers by taking advantage of the cell line screening platform at the Broad Institute (CCLE), which includes 486 cancer cell lines originating from different cancer entities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>].

Therefore, we further analyzed the mRNA and protein biomarkers that were correlated with sensitivity to neocuproine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 d-e</xref>). The mRNA network analysis resulted in pathway-enrichments in “Selenoamino-acid metabolism” or “cellular response to starvation” as well as “metabolism of amino acids and derivates” and “Eukaryotic translation initiation”.

We found that MEKi and neocuproine were both effective in inhibiting M160915 tumor growth compared to tumor growth in vehicle-treated mice (neocuproine (p&lt;0.005) and MEKi (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S12 a</xref>). Nevertheless, the combination therapy showed significantly superior inhibitory effects compared to the single treatments (MEKi vs. Combi p&lt;0.0003; neocuproine vs. combi p&lt;0.0125), as well as an improved survival benefit (MEKi: p=0.037, hazard ratio (HR)=0.34; neocurpoine: p=0.31; HR=0.6; combined: p=0.001, HR=0.13).</p><p id="P58">The major cause of death from melanoma is the spread of metastases through the blood, lymph, and visceral organs, which experience higher levels of oxidative stress than the established subcutaneous tumors in mice. Therefore, these cells are highly dependent on an intact antioxidant defense mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. The use of compounds that increase intracellular ROS, such as methotrexate, has been demonstrated to inhibit metastasis but not primary tumor growth. Here, we hypothesized that combining MEKi with neocuproine would have a significant impact on tumor growth and metastasis. We injected melanoma cells (M130227) that had metastasized to the draining lymph nodes. When tumors had grown palpable, mice were treated with vehicle alone, MEKi, neocuproine, or a combination of MEKi+ neocuproine (combi) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S12 b</xref>). We observed a statistically significant reduction in tumor volume when mice were treated with MEKi compared with the vehicle-treated group (p&lt;0.0001) and the combination of MEKi and neocuproine compared with MEKi treatment alone (p&lt;0.0001). No significant effect on tumor growth was observed in mice treated with neocuproine alone. Treatment with the combination of MEKi and neocuproine also significantly prolonged survival compared to vehicle treatment (MEKi: p=0.134, HR=0.45; neocuproine: p=0.27, HR=1.85; combi: p=0.001, HR=0.048) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S12 b</xref>) To examine metastasis formation, we removed the draining lymph nodes (DLN) and checked for the presence of human DNA using the Taqman PCR assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Four out of eight DLNs in the vehicle treatment and MEKi treated groups contained detectable human DNA; treatment with neocuproine or the MEKi-neocuproine combination resulted in DLNs without detectable human DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 c</xref>). Although neocuproine did not inhibit tumor growth in the primary tumor, it did inhibit metastasis, suggesting that neocuproine targets invasive cell features that are sensitive to ROS induction. To investigate the specific effect of neocuproine on the inhibition of cancer cell dissemination, we used a zebrafish in vivo model. In this study, we injected fluorescently labeled M130227 cells into the yolk of 3-day-old zebrafish larvae following treatment with neocuproine, MEKi, or their combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 d-e</xref>). We performed whole-body imaging of zebrafish larvae and quantified the disseminated tumor cells. Melanoma cells in zebrafish remained resistant to MEK inhibitor treatment after addition of MEKi. Administration of neocuproine significantly reduced the number of disseminated tumor cells on its own, while MEKi did not, which is in line with our observations in mouse DLN. We observed no synergistic effects when administering a combination of neocuproine and MEKi, suggesting that the duration of the experiment (5 days) may be too short to induce phenotypic switching and heterogeneity, which would be essential for the benefit of the combination therapy.</p><p id="P59">Intra-lesion heterogeneity is a hallmark of melanoma and represents a major obstacle for the treatment with targeted therapies. Homogenous melanoma cell cultures can give rise to heterogeneous lesions that reflect the human situation; therefore, combination therapies are required to target all cancer cell phenotypes important for disease expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. Therefore, we analyzed tumors from the M130227-mouse experiment to determine changes in intra-tumor heterogeneity using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We found that the resistant cell line M130227 had a mesenchymal cell phenotype, which was also distinct from that of tumor cells. These cells did not express melanocytic markers, as revealed by scRNA sequencing, but rather mesenchymal marker genes, such as activin A (INHBA), N-cadherin (CDH2), or TGFβ (TGFBI) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S13 a</xref>). This is in line with the differential expression of the bulk RNA-seq data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 a</xref>. This cell line correlates with the invasive/mesenchymal phenotype. After injection, the homogeneous melanoma cells resulted in heterogeneous melanoma tumors, with cells expressing either melanocytic or mesenchymal markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S12 a and (b)</xref>). ScRNA sequencing analysis of fractions of melanocytic or mesenchymal markers among the treatment groups also showed that proliferating, vehicle-treated tumors had high melanocytic melanoma cell content. MEKi treatment significantly increased the proportion of melanocytic melanoma cells, suggesting a transient increase in melanocytic cells as a mechanism of resistance to MEK inhibition. Only the combination treatment of MEKi with neocuproine dramatically reduced the amount of proliferative melanocytic melanoma, suggesting that cells escaping the melanocytic state (from neocuproine treatment) regained sensitivity to MEK inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S12 b</xref>). Marker heterogeneity was also confirmed on xenograft tumors by immunohistochemistry using cell phenotype markers MelanA and INHBA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Figure S12 d</xref>).</p><p id="P60">Our <italic>in vivo</italic> data suggest that targeting only one cellular phenotype in heterogeneous melanoma may not effectively inhibit tumor growth. Moreover, ROS inducers might have great clinical potential but are not suitable for use as single agents, especially in melanoma, in which combination with targeted therapy is important. In 2013, a clinical trial comparing paclitaxel alone or in combination with the ionophoric copper-chelator and ROS inducer elesclomol highlighted that elesclomol did not improve progression-free survival (PFS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. Given our results with neocuproine, we treated melanoma tumors with either MEKi, elesclomol, or their combination and observed a statistically significant survival benefit with the combination therapy of elesclomol and binimetinib (p&lt;0.001, HR 0.052) compared to binimetinib (p=0.024, HR=0.26) and elesclomol (p=0.531; HR=0.725) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S12c</xref>). In line with the ionophoric copper-chelator neocuproine, depletion of Cu ions from the cell culture medium also prevented growth inhibition by elesclomol in melanoma cell cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Figure S12e</xref>). Disulfiram (DSF), a clinically approved drug for treating alcoholism by irreversible inhibition of the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, has also been shown to have anticancer activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. Its mechanism of action is believed to involve the conversion of DSF to diethyl dithiocarbamate (DDC). DDC is another ionophoric copper-chelator whose cytotoxic activity is dependent on Cu ions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 12f</xref>). Xenograft animals were treated with DSF, binimetinib, or a combination of both drugs. We found that binimetinib and disulfiram significantly inhibited tumor growth (p&lt;0.0001), but the combination of both compounds was more effective than DSF treatment alone (DSF vs. Bini+DSF (p&lt;0.0018); Bini vs. Bini+DSF (p&lt;0.18). Unfortunately, the combination of DSF and binimetinib caused severe toxicity in mice (mainly intestinal inflammation); therefore, the study was limited in time. Although ionophoric copper-chelators share a common mode of action, they appear to have different safety profiles <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our studies suggest that the ionophoric copper-chelator neocuproine, together with binimetinib, could be a potent and safe treatment for MEK-resistant and heterogeneous melanomas.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S42" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P61">Clinical management of melanomas with NRAS mutations is challenging. Although oncogenic mutations are well described and immunotherapies are an option, targeted therapies against this tumor entity are lacking. Heterogeneity is a major obstacle in melanoma treatment; while MEK inhibitors target melanocytic melanoma cells with NRAS mutations, mesenchymal cells do not respond to MEKi, suggesting their independence of MAPK signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. In general, melanoma tumors consist of a complex network of heterogonous cancer and stromal cells, and metabolic programs need to be adapted to meet the demand of uncontrolled growth and disease progression in these complex environments. One of the best studied examples of this metabolic adaptation is the Warburg effect were cancer cells increase glucose use in order to achieve rapid production of ATP through the conversion of glucose to lactate via the anabolic pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The PPP is also essential for DNA/RNA synthesis as well as for NADPH recycling, which protects dividing cells from oxidative stress. This metabolic switch is supported by oncogenic mutations which accelerate the transition, but are also energy consuming. In order to escape the metabolic addiction to oncogenes (e.g. MAPK mutations) and withstand targeted therapies, cells can adapt their metabolism to other pathways. Others and we have described for BRAF mutated melanomas that resistance to MAPK inhibitors drive metabolic reprogramming and activation of OXPHOS or fatty acid oxidation (FAO). In complex heterogonous tumors like melanoma this is shaped by the microenvironment or the metastatic niche were neighboring cells like adipocytes or fibroblasts facilitate metabolic adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>].</p><p id="P62">In contrast, we show that NRAS-mutated melanoma, when becoming resistant to MEK inhibitors, become metabolically <italic>“silent”</italic>. A recent proteomics analysis of a large cohort of tumors with respect to their response to immunotherapies also revealed an association between BRAF mutations and elevated levels of mitochondrial OXPHOS proteins; whereas, in BRAF-WT mutated melanomas (including NRAS mutations), metabolic protein upregulation was not observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>]. In BRAF-mutated melanoma, targeting these altered metabolic pathways is possible by targeting elevated OXPHOS or FAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. For NRAS-mutated melanoma, we did not find a superior activated metabolic pathway associated with MAPK resistance, but we found that in the metabolic <italic>“silent”</italic> cellular phenotype, elevated ROS levels become the Achilles’ heel of resistant cells.</p><p id="P63">It was shown for metastasizing cells to largely depend on NADPH-recycling pathways (e.g., the folate pathway). Given the strong transcriptional correlation between resistance and elevated ROS levels in NRAS-mutated melanoma, it is logical that resistant melanoma upregulates PHGDH, an enzyme that metabolizes serine in the folate pathway and links MEKi resistance to melanoma metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>]. It has recently been shown that successfully metastasizing melanomas suffer from high ROS levels owing to their low PPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>]. Melanoma cell metabolic heterogeneity can give rise to efficient metastasis of cancer cells and the loss of the lactate transporter MCT1 plays a key role in jeopardizing the PPP pathway, resulting in high basal ROS levels. This is in line with the correlation between mesenchymal phenotype melanoma, low PPP, and high basal ROS levels described here.</p><p id="P64">It was recently reported that elesclomol, which is another ionophoric copper chelator, induces a special death program called “cuproptosis”, which is defined by caspase-independent apoptosis and sensitivity through targeting upregulated mitochondrial respiration rate. Importantly, and contrary to our results with neocuproine, this ROS inducing agent was not rescued by the NAC antioxidant. Unlike with cuproptosis, we have shown here that in NRAS-mutated melanoma cells, the mode of death with neocuproine is caspase-dependent and specifically targets cells with low mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, the effect is rescued by NAC, which suggests that neocuproine works through non-cuproptosis based mechanisms. Heterogeneity in melanoma and resistance to targeted therapy has been shown to be a dynamic process, which involves several transient phenotypes <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Xenograft tumors derived from a homogenous NRAS-mutated and MEKi -resistant melanoma culture led to heterogeneous tumors, as shown by scRNA-seq, where phenotypic switching allowed therapeutic escape. The strategy of cancer cells to survive as treatment-persistent residual tumor cells between the phase of partial response and relapse has recently been described, where tumor cells use an embryonic diapause-like adaption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>].</p><p id="P65">This “arrested development” results in a downregulation of metabolism (e.g., mitochondrial activity), protein synthesis, and proliferation, but on the other hand the authors observed upregulation of processes related to ECM reorganization and cell adhesion, processes also observed by us in the invasive/mesenchymal melanoma-phenotype. It was further shown that cancer cells can enter the persistent-cell stage upon transcriptional quiescence without the acquisition of new mutations or rare pre-existing clones to drive entry into the diapause-like state. It appears that mesenchymal and resistant melanoma cells enter a diapause-like cell state to confer resistance. With the acquisition of a <italic>“silent”</italic> metabolism, which seems to be beneficial for persistence, cells cannot recycle important detoxifying compounds such as NADPH and GSH. These factors are used by enzymes of the PPP or folate pathway, which subsequently slows down and eventually disappears. Here, we can link this cell state of persistence of NRAS-mutated melanoma closely with the upregulation of cytoplasmic ROS and use the altered cell metabolism for novel therapeutic combination therapy. We speculate that these “silent” melanoma cells use vesicle trafficking to passively uptake carbon sources and building blocks from the microenvironment and the surrounding stroma. One advantage is also that by this process, cancer cells can adapt to a new microenvironment by driving their metabolic program depending on the availability of extracellular nutrition. We found that CAV-1, a protein associated with caveolae formation and a lipid chaperone, was a predictive biomarker to the response of neocuproine in association with low signaling activity (pErk and pS6) and melanocytic marker expression (TYRP). CAV-1 was shown to be a prognostic marker also in other cancers and is associated with extracellular vesicle trafficking, endo- and exocytosis of lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>].</p><p id="P66">Interestingly, we found that the <italic>“silent”</italic> cell state could be further used as a biomarker for predicting the response to neocuproine. During the screening of the CCLE cell panel we observed that three biomarkers (XBP1, SRFS1, and EIF4EBP1) were not only indicators of cellular stress but also known to actively downregulate cellular activity, keeping a “<italic>silent</italic>” cell state in the times of crisis (e.g. during drug treatments). EIF4EBP1 is a transcription factor that is activated in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the unfolded protein response (UPR) in an attempt to defend against high intracellular ROS levels. Oxidative stress drives the dephosphorylation of EIF4EBP1, thereby inhibiting the formation of the initiation complex and decreasing overall protein translation in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. SFRS1 is an mRNA-splice factor and binding protein in which chaperones untranslate RNA into stress granules during cellular stress, inhibiting the translation of “housekeeping” genes. Accumulation of cytoplasmic SFRS1 increases the formation of stress granules, contributing to translational depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. A similar result was observed in our TuPro analysis of <italic>ex vivo</italic> patient biopsies, where significant correlations with the response to neocuproine/binimetinib were only seen in tumors with low signaling pathway activity and upregulation of the mesenchymal cell state marker Caveolin-1. Altogether, cellular silencing, close to the concept of “arrested development” described in the above mentioned publications, leads to higher intracellular ROS which can be used to target these cell phenotypes, and not only in melanoma.</p><p id="P67">By combining small molecules targeting melanocytic and mesenchymal melanoma cells simultaneously, we showed significant impairment of tumor growth and metastasis. Moreover, metastasizing melanoma cells, which have been shown to produce high ROS levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>], were targeted by neocuproine alone, thereby avoiding the invasion of melanoma cells into the lymph node. Our data suggest that the combination of MEKi with small molecules, which induces intracellular ROS, targets melanoma, especially with NRAS mutations, thus putting clinical trials with ROS inducers (e.g., SYMMETRY trial using elesclomol) into a new light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. We have shown <italic>in vivo</italic> that neither a MEK inhibitor nor a ROS inducer alone sufficiently impairs the combination of tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting clinical trials that combine both compounds. This novel approach would put not only MEK inhibitors back on stage for melanoma patients with NRAS mutations, but also other compounds that would synergize with ROS inducers to target silent metabolic states that sensitize these tumor cells to ROS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"
