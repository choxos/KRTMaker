Here we show that the master lipid regulator SREBP1 couples the phospholipid scramblase TMEM41B to constitute a host “metabolism-to-manufacture” cascade that maximizes membrane supplies to support coronaviral genome replication, harboring biosynthetic enzymes including Lipin1 as druggable viral-specific-essential (VSE) host genes. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of Lipin1, by a moonlight function of the widely-prescribed beta-blocker Propranolol, metabolically uncouples the SREBP1-TMEM41B cascade and consequently exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral effects against coronaviruses, Zika virus, and Dengue virus. The data implicate a metabolism-based antiviral strategy that is well tolerated by the host, and a potential broad-spectrum medication against current and future coronavirus diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The global pandemic of acute respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in ~600 million confirmed cases and &gt;6.5 million deaths as of November 2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). One major lesson from the current pandemic centers on the constant mutation of the highly contagious coronavirus, which is projected to cohabit with the world population and may continue to evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Moreover, while antibodies or small molecule drugs directly targeting viral factors have been developed and approved for emergency uses, viral mutations may arise or even be selected to escape their inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Agents targeting the structural engagement between viral proteins and cell surface receptors, however, may also be outpaced by viral mutations. These counterplays by the viral pathogens therefore highlights the necessity of targeting host pathways, as a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy that bears much lower mutation rates and therefore less risks of drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Despite such advantages, host-based antivirals must exploit and target vulnerabilities of viruses, <italic>en fait</italic> cellular processes that are essential to the virus but not to the host, to ensure both efficacy and safety.</p><p id="P3">Coronaviruses belong to a highly diverse family of enveloped positive strand RNA viruses that, upon entry into host cells, express and rapidly replicate their genomic RNA for self-amplification and new rounds of infection of the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). The currently-ravaging SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta-coronavirus (βCoV) subfamily, which also includes the well-studied model coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). A common requirement in the replication of RNA viruses, coronaviruses included, is the induction of the replication organelle (ROs), an elaborate membranous structure characterized by double membrane vesicles or spheres (DMV or DMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). These spatial platforms harbor and enrich specific viral replication factors and host proteins, and may protect the replicating RNA from degradation and surveillance by host innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Additionally, the membranous encapsulation might even shield viral factors from small molecular inhibitors. Hence, dissolving RO has been proposed as a host-based, broad-spectrum antiviral strategy, which may combine the effects of dissembling the viral replication machinery and increasing their exposure to disabling or degrading agents. Of note, ROs intricately connect with the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the majority of membrane bilayers are being produced and assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), thereby indicating the involvement of lipid metabolism in the host cells.</p><p id="P4">Several unbiased genetic screens have identified TMEM41B as a critical yet enigmatic host factor for multiple RNA viruses, including particularly SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). TMEM41B was recently identified as an ER-localized phospholipid scramblase, capable of catalyzing the trans-bilayer shuttle of bulk amphipathic phospholipids in an ATP-independent manner <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Importantly, loss of TMEM41B <italic>in vivo</italic> leads to distorted ER membranes and failure in the ER retention of the master lipid regulator SREBP/SCAP, cumulating into severe tissue damages and metabolic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Hence, while the exact role of TMEM41B in the viral life cycle remains to be fully established, the profound side effects caused by TMEM41B inactivation may nonetheless prevent direct targeting of the factor essential to both the virus and the host.</p><p id="P5">SREBPs are master transcription factors in lipid metabolism and promote the production of cholesterol, fatty acids and triglycerides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), and are extensively exploited by many viruses including the coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). The activation of SREBPs from their ER-resided precursors requires the transmembrane chaperone SCAP, in a manner tightly controlled by cholesterol or fatty acids to constitute a delicate negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Of note, SREBP in Drosophila is negatively regulated by phospholipids, thereby implicating SREBP/SCAP as a transmembrane sensor for ER membrane structure and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Nevertheless, the role of SREBPs in phospholipid metabolism and especially membrane biogenesis is much less understood, compared to those of cholesterol or fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Here we show that SREBP1 and TMEM41B constitute a host cascade to couple phospholipid synthesis (metabolism) and bilayer assembly (manufacture), thereby maximizing membrane supplies to house viral replication. Serendipitously, the metabolism-to-manufacture cascade also exposes a metabolic vulnerability of coronaviruses, harboring enzymes such as Lipin1 that is required for the life cycle of viruses but not of host cells. Consequently, the widely-prescribed medicine Propranolol can be employed to inhibit Lipin1 and uncouple the SREBP1-TMEM41B cascade, producing broad spectrum antiviral effects via disrupting RO formation. Propranolol effectively counters multi-tissue pathogenesis in murine models of coronavirus infection, implicating an accessible and broad-spectrum treatment option against coronaviruses at the current or future times.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Direct regulation on TMEM41B by SREBP1 constitutes a membragenic cascade</title><p id="P7">We first sought to delineate the regulations on the recently identified phospholipid scramblases, which could equilibrate the intrinsic asymmetry resulted from the leaflet-specific synthesis of phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Interestingly, immunoblotting (IB) showed that active SREBP1 selectively upregulated TMEM41B, but not related enzymes such as TMEM41A or VMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, quantified in 1B</xref>). The upregulation of TMEM41B was comparable to established SREBP1 targets in lipid biosynthesis, including fatty acid synthase (FASN) and the phosphatic acid phosphatase Lipin1, implicating the scramblase as a <italic>bona fide</italic> target of the master transcription factor of lipid metabolism. Accordingly, active SREBP1 selectively upregulated mRNA levels of TMEM41B, but not TMEM41A or VMP1, also at levels comparable to FASN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Collectively, the data suggested an unexpected regulation from the very upstream regulator SREBP1 to a specific scramblase catalyzing the final step in bilayer manufacture.</p><p id="P8">To delineate the molecular basis by which SREBP1 regulates TMEM41B, we unbiasedly surveyed public chromatin-immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CHIP-Seq) datasets. The data revealed SREBP1 occupancy (<italic>in-trans</italic>) at the promoter regions of the <italic>TMEM41B</italic> gene, which contain DNA sequences (<italic>in-cis</italic>) resembling the sterol-responsive-element (SRE) consensus of SREBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Moreover, active SREBP1 upregulated the expression of the luciferase reporter fused with wild type <italic>TMEM41B</italic> promoter, whereas the upregulation became blunted when the SRE motif was mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). To further confirm the role of SREBP in TMEM41B regulation, we employed mice lacking hepatic SCAP, the transmembrane chaperone required for the ER-Golgi escorting and therefore activation of SREBP. Consistent with the gain-of-function data, mRNA levels of <italic>Tmem41b</italic> or <italic>Fasn</italic>, but not <italic>Tmem41a</italic> or <italic>Vmp1</italic>, were diminished in <italic>Scap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers compared to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The direct regulation of TMEM41B by SREBP1 suggest that, in response to demands for elevated membrane biogenesis, the intrinsic imbalance between bilayer leaflets needs to be resolved by adequate lipid scrambling. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the advances in ratiometric spectrum imaging that combined live cell super resolution microscopy with the biocompatible and solvatochromic nature of the lipid dye Nile Red (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). The dye labels intracellular membranes and lipid storages, exhibiting blue shifts in its emission spectrum in a less polar environment in membrane organization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1</xref>). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), ratiometric depiction of the emission indexes (EI) from the red and the blue channels confirmed that the ER membranes and the core of the lipid droplets represented the lowest and highest values in wild type Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G, model depicted in G’</xref>), respectively. By contrast, TMEM41B-deficent cells displayed blue-shifted emission index in the ER regions compared to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H, depicted in H’</xref>), suggesting that defective lipid scrambling caused unmatched bilayer leaflets with decreased polarity of local lipid environment.</p><p id="P10">Interestingly, induction of lipid biogenesis by ectopic expression of active SREBP1 caused modest yet significant blue shifts in the emission index of the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I, quantified in 1K</xref>), further suggesting that leaflet imbalance is a general phenomenon during membrane biogenesis and needs to be adequately equilibrated by lipid scrambling. Consistent with this notion, SREBP1 expression synergized with TMEM41B deficiency to cause large blue shifts in the emission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J, quantified in 1K</xref>), revealing greater unmatching of ER bilayers caused by an elevation of asymmetric phospholipid flux plus defective lipid scrambling (also depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J’</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Taken together with previous reports that loss of TMEM41B causes drastic ER membrane distortion and uncontrolled SREBP activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), the results revealed a feedback circuit between SREBP1 and TMEM41B in phospholipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1L</xref>, left). Moreover, this novel regulatory scheme appears to mirror the well-established SREBP-dependent regulatory circuit that robustly controls cholesterol metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) (also depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1L</xref>, right). Therefore, by coupling phospholipid <italic>production</italic> and bilayer <italic>assembly</italic>, the SREBP1-TMEM41B cascade could maximize membrane supply, together streamlining a “metabolism-to-manufacture” process.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Host membrane manufacture exposes a metabolic susceptibility of coronaviruses</title><p id="P12">The functional pairing of two essential host factors, SREBP1 and TMEM41B, pointed to a mechanism that could be exploited by the virus for maximizing membrane supply from the host, through the hijacking of host phospholipid production and the subsequent bilayer assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Consistent with this “metabolism-to-manufacture” hypothesis with respect to the host SREBP1-TMEM41B cascade in viral life cycle, ratiometric spectrum imaging revealed substantial membrane alterations in primary hepatocytes infected with the model beta-coronavirus (βCoV) murine hepatitis virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, quantified in 2C</xref>). The data thus implied an upregulation of phospholipid production in need of bilayer equilibration by coronaviruses. Consistent with this notion, ectopic supply of phospholipids by ER-targeted liposomes or expression of active SREBP1 both led to an increase in βCoV loads in wild type cells compared to controls, suggesting that phospholipid supply represents a limiting factor for coronavirus amplification in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, left three columns). In cells lacking TMEM41B, however, viral production became absent in control, phospholipid-supplied, or SREBP1-expressed conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, right three columns). These data therefore confirmed the requirement of bilayer assembly downstream of the metabolic supply of phospholipids to support viral life cycle, together orchestrated by the host SREBP1-TMEM41B cascade.</p><p id="P13">The above data further indicated a metabolic flux of phospholipids towards the TMEM41B scramblase that generates bilayer membranes to support viral life cycle. To test this hypothesis, we adapted a “click-chemistry” based chemo-metabolic labelling approach to track the production of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the most abundant form of membragenic phospholipids in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref> illustrates that choline with a two-carbon alkyne tag (Alkyne-choline) can be converted into PC at the ER through the Kennedy pathway, and the newly-synthesized PC may be visualized after biorthogonal conjugation with fluorophores in cells. Of note, βCoV infection caused a significant upregulation of alkyne-PC signal compared to un-infected cells, reflecting an induction of phospholipid production that may support viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F, quantified in 2G</xref>). Alkyne-PC signals became reduced in <italic>Scap</italic>-deficient hepatocytes, supporting the role of SREBP in phospholipid production. Importantly, βCoV-induced alkyne-PC signals were blunted upon loss of SCAP, further implicating SREBPs in the induction of membragenesis triggered by coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F&amp;G</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The upregulation of host phospholipid metabolism by coronaviruses culminated into the possibility of limiting the metabolic flux through the host SREBP1-TMEM41B cascade to counter the viral pathogen, furthering that phospholipid enzymes within the cascade may be required for the life cycle of viruses but not of the host. To identify such <underline>v</underline>iral-<underline>s</underline>pecific <underline>e</underline>ssential (VSE) genes harbored within the host SREBP1-TMEM41B cascade, we designed a targeted CRISPR screen based on the cell lethality caused by coronavirus infection. In essence, we hypothesize that loss of VSE genes could generate grossly healthy “mutant” cells that could escape the coronavirus-caused fusion and eventually death in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>, left). Moreover, as coronavirus often induces cell syncytia and likely collateral damage to healthy host cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S2</xref>), we reason that a targeted screen would generate a homogeneous cell population that allow direct inspection of cell health, while avoiding the loss of the coronavirus-resistant cells as an under-represented population in pooled screens due to potential collateral damages from the coronavirus-sensitive cells. In parallel to the targeted genetic screen in cells, we also performed a virtual screen to search for host factors that are essential for the virus, but not to the host cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>, right). Such “ideal” host factor, however, would need to be broadly distributed to counter the multiple tissue pathogenesis of coronaviruses and have clinically approved targeting agents that support the safety while allowing subsequent application.</p><p id="P15">Interestingly, the targeted CRISPR screen identified that the SREBP1-TMEM41B cascade was enriched with biosynthetic enzymes as essential host factors for βCoV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>, highlighted by yellow), implicating the membrane manufacture cascade as a metabolic susceptibility of the virus. Loss of these metabolic genes (including GPAT4, CDS1, LIPIN1, and CHKA) abolished βCoV-induced syncytia formation and death in human lung A549 cells stably expressing the βCoV receptor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S2B</xref>). When combined with the virtual screen, LIPIN1 stood out as a druggable VSE gene among these newly-identified host factors, as a broadly expressed yet non-essential gene in either human or mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S3</xref>). The pharmacological targeting of the Lipin1 enzyme by clinically approved medicines with respect to viral inhibition will be investigated in the later part of the study. Collectively, the data suggested that the SREBP1-TMEM41B cascade drives membrane production to constitute a metabolic susceptibility of coronavirus, and importantly, the biosynthetic enzyme Lipin1 within the cascade may represent a VSE factor that can be safely targeted to counter the viruses without endangering the host.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Lipin1 inhibition targets metabolic susceptibility of coronaviruses</title><p id="P16">Consistent with the above screening experiments in A549 cells, loss of Lipin1 but not Lipin2 also diminished βCoV load in primary hepatocytes, as did with <italic>Scap</italic> or <italic>Tmem41b</italic> ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Unlike SCAP or TMEM41B, however, Lipin1 inactivation didn’t appear to decrease cell viability or fitness over time (data not shown), consistent with previous reports that even complete deficiency of the gene didn’t cause lethality from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). These results together reflected the non-essential nature of the enzyme in the host, thus allowing its inhibition for antiviral applications safely. Biochemically, Lipins dephosphorylate phosphatic acid (PA) to diacylglycerol (DAG) as precursors for the production of PC and PE, together accounting for ~80-90% of membragenic phospholipids in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), further suggesting a unique dependence of membrane supply in the viral life cycle. Consistent with this notion, while Lipin1 deficiency diminished βCoV loads in primary hepatocytes, phospholipid replenishment via liposomes largely rescued the inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Taken together, the data suggested that phospholipid production and membrane manufacture operated by the SREBP1-TMEM41B cascade represents a limiting resource for the life cycle of coronaviruses, and importantly, Lipin1 ablation could metabolically block the host process to counter the viral pathogen.</p><p id="P17">Of particular note, the phosphatic acid phosphatase (PAP) activity of Lipin can be effectively inhibited by the lipophilic beta-blocker Propranolol as a moonlight function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Indeed, Propranolol diminished the accumulation of Alkyne-choline signal upon TMEM41B deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D, quantified in 3E</xref>), further confirming that the drug uncoupled the SREBP1-TMEM41B cascade by limiting the metabolic flux of membragenic phospholipids. Propranolol has been widely used to treat cardiovascular complications with minimal toxicity, and has also been repurposed for a number of novel therapeutic indications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). These applications further suggest that inhibition of Lipin could be well tolerated in humans in clinically relevant manners, leading us to examine the anti-coronaviral effects with Propranolol in cells. Consistent with an active requirement of membragenesis in coronavirus infection, βCoV induced an increase in cellular PAP activity, which was blunted by Propranolol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). As seen with genetic ablation of <italic>Scap</italic>, metabolic tracing following Alkyne-choline conversion to Alkyne-PC also revealed that Propranolol diminished the production of PC in primary hepatocytes induced upon βCoV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G, quantified in 3H</xref>). Consistent with the required role of SREBP1-TMEM41B and membragenesis for viral life cycle, Propranolol decreased βCoV load in primary hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 at 6.39 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>, red line). By contrast, Propranolol exhibited little effects on βCoV binding to cell surface or entry into hepatocytes (data not shown), nor did it cause overt cytotoxicity up to 100 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>, blue line). Taken together, the results suggested that Propranolol effectively exploited the viral vulnerability harbored in the host SREBP1-TMEM41B cascade, thereby countering coronavirus by limiting the metabolic flux and blocking membrane manufacture that are required by the viral pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Metabolic blockade by Propranolol enables a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy</title><p id="P18">The above antiviral effects intrigued us to directly examine the impact on the viral life cycle upon Propranolol-enabled metabolic blockade, by performing volumetric tomography on coronavirus-infected cells with the focus ion beam coupled scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM). As previously established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), βCoV infection in primary hepatocytes potently triggered the formation of the membranous replication compartments, featured with the characteristic double membrane enclosed vesicles (DMV) and double membrane enclosed smaller spheres (DMS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, left and enlarged panels, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">movie S1</xref>). These ROs were often in conjunction with the host ER membranes which have also undergone drastic morphological changes. Strikingly, Propranolol treatment largely eliminated DMV or DMS structures induced by coronavirus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, right panel, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">movie S2</xref>), and maintained the reticular ER structures as also visualized by thin-sectioning and transmission EM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4</xref>). Taken together, the tomographic and EM analysis revealed an unexpected sensitivity of RO formation to the metabolic blockade by Propranolol, consistent with the notion of a high demand of membrane supply in constructing these viral replication compartments in cells.</p><p id="P19">ROs represent a common requirement for RNA replication of coronaviruses and flaviviruses in different cells, thus leading us to hypothesize that Propranolol may exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral effects. Indeed, Propranolol treatment diminished dsRNA of βCoV in both primary hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B, quantified in 4C</xref>) and A549 pneumocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D&amp;E</xref>). Moreover, viral dsRNA generated by the replicons of SARS-CoV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F&amp;G</xref>) and SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H&amp;I</xref>) were also eliminated by Propranolol treatment, as with luciferase reporter of SARS-CoV-2 in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J</xref>). Lastly, Propranolol also depleted virus load of Zika virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4K</xref>) and Dengue virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4L</xref>) after infection of U87MG cells, respectively. Interestingly, a survey of the real world data from the UK Biobank also revealed diminished incidents of Dengue fever or yellow fever in people taking Propranolol, though infections of these flaviviruses were rather rare in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4M</xref>). Collectively, the biochemical, ultra-structural, and functional data demonstrated the broad-spectrum antiviral effects by the host-based drug, further suggesting the feasibility of targeting the membragenic process driven by the SREBP1-TMEM41B cascade for viral defense.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Propranolol exhibits broad protection against coronavirus pathology in mice</title><p id="P20">The above cellular data led us to examine the antiviral effects of Propranolol-enabled metabolic blockade of the host SREBP1-TMEM41B cascade <italic>in vivo</italic>. We reasoned that the afore-described metabolism-dependent antiviral mechanism of Propranolol may bypass cardiac side effects based on β-adrenergic receptor blockade and broaden the potential anti-coronavirus application of the widely-prescribed medicine. Interestingly, Propranolol is manufactured and prescribed as an enantiomeric mixture of two chiral forms, with the S-enantiomer exhibits ~100 times more efficacy towards the β-adrenergic receptors than the R-enantiomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). By contrast, both chiral forms displayed similar antiviral effects against βCoV in hepatocytes compared to the enantiomeric drug, as did the 50%-50% mixture of R- and S-forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, two enantiomers shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S5A&amp;B</xref>). Similar chirality-independent inhibitory effects on Alkyne-PC production of Propranolol enantiomers were also observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S5C, quantified in S5D</xref>), further supporting a Lipin and metabolism dependent mechanism that could be safely explored to combat coronaviruses.</p><p id="P21">The chiral-independent and broad-spectrum antiviral mechanism by Propranolol thus allowed us to employ the <italic>in vivo</italic> model with βCoV (MHV-A59) infection in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), which represents an authentic form of coronavirus pathogenesis. This model also has the benefit of recapitulating the multiple organ pathologies seen with COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), and allows accurate delivery of substances/drugs via the intraperitoneal routes. Pilot experiments in a treatment regimen revealed that R-Propranolol displayed better efficacy against coronaviruses in mice compared to the S- or the enantiomeric form, likely reflecting cardiovascular effects of S-Propranolol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S6A&amp;B</xref>). Therefore, we focused on the R-form in the treatment regimen, in which a dose of 25mg/kg R-Propranolol (drug dose/body weight) was given to the animal every 12 hours for 7 days as the animals were infected with coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). When converted with respect to drug metabolism rates based on body surface areas (BSA) in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), the human equivalent dose (HED) of the above mice experiments is estimated to be ~2mg/kg (drug dose/body weight), which can be tolerated in humans in general. Compared to non-infected mice, coronavirus infection caused acute tissue damages in the lung of saline-treated mice after 7 days as revealed by histology analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, middle panels), including desquamation of the mucous layer of bronchioles and thickening of alveoli septa. The thickened alveoli walls were populated by increased number of type 2 pneumocytes and often infiltrated inflammatory cells, often with deposition of hyaline membranes that also indicated pulmonary injuries. Collectively, these pathologies generally resembled acute pneumonia and alveoli damages manifested in coronavirus diseases including those caused by COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Propranolol largely protected the animals from the viral-induced pneumonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, lower panels). Moreover, murine coronavirus also caused drastic liver damages in PBS-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, middle panels), as evidenced by gross morphology or histological analysis. Propranolol treatment also alleviated the hepatitis caused coronavirus infection in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, lower panels). As a result, Propranolol treatment reduced weight loss caused by coronavirus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Consistent with the pathological analysis, viral loads were decreased by ~99.7% in the liver of treated mice compared to untreated ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). The induction of inflammatory factors such as TNFα or IL6 was also blunted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G&amp;H</xref>). These data support the therapeutic potential of R-Propranolol in countering diseases caused by coronavirus infection that is independent of its original use as beta-blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Moderate dose of Propranolol as anti-coronaviral prophylactics</title><p id="P22">Although several antivirals have been approved to treat coronavirus diseases such as COVID-19, there is no approved drug for prevention to date, likely due to higher safety bars in prophylactic medicines. Propranolol has been widely prescribed, readily supplied and generally well tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Moreover, multiple new versions of beta-blockers have been developed and are extensively used for cardiovascular complications, yet apparently without considering Lipin inhibition. This discrepancy led us to perform a functional survey on different beta-blockers for their “moonlight” anti-coronavirus function mostly likely via targeting Lipin1. Interestingly, the different beta-blockers showed a wide range of anti-coronavirus effects in cells, with Propranolol, Nebivolol, and Penbutolol being most effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). The antiviral efficacy of these beta-blockers appeared to depend on their lipophilic nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>), correlating with the lipogenic role of Lipin as well as the molecular docking between Propranolol and Lipin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p><p id="P23">The wide prescription of Propranolol and related medicines intrigued us to examine preventative effects of Propranolol against coronavirus infection, particularly since its host-based antiviral mechanism may enable a broad-spectrum potential for countering the constantly-mutating coronavirus. To this end, a 3-day, moderate dose (5mg/kg/day) pre-treatment of Propranolol was combined with daily treatment for 7 days after coronavirus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). This dose is within the range of prescription to adults for cardiovascular complications, as well as of that could be prescribed to infants for treating hemangioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Of note, the preemptive strategy provided significant protection from pathologies in the lung caused by coronavirus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>, middle vs lower panels), largely eliminating the otherwise severe tissue damages. Similar protection on the liver was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). Accordingly, mice pretreated with a moderate dose of Propranolol displayed little if any weight loss compared to βCoV-infected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>), indicating an overall protection at the systemic level. On the molecular level, the drug drastically reduced viral load by over 4 orders compared to βCoV-infected animals without treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref>). Moreover, IB on viral proteins or qPCR of viral genes showed that the preventative measure reduced viral loads close to the background levels in non-infected mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S7A</xref>). Similar prevention of inflammatory gene induction such as <italic>Tnfa</italic> or <italic>Il6</italic> was also observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S7B&amp;C</xref>). Together with the mechanistic studies, the data support the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of the repurposed drug in preventing coronavirus infection, providing a metabolism-oriented strategy for developing host-based medications as safe and broad-spectrum antivirals to combat the current and future coronavirus diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">The high mutation rates, combined with high infectivity and stability, of zoonotic coronaviruses pose great challenges for developing effective antivirals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Besides inhibiting viral factors, targeting the host pathways required for the viral life cycle may therefore provide a parallel strategy for antivirals, with the potential of being broad-spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Moreover, mutation rates for host genes are thought to be much lower than viral genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), thereby slowing down the emergence of drug resistance. In this regard, our strategy of identifying the druggable VSE factors and the subsequent metabolic targeting may achieve both antiviral efficacy and host safety, therefore deserving further attention. Such factors may be identified through mining cellular networks of known host factors, or dissecting viral-specific events in the host. The replication organelle, a unique yet essential host structure induced by the coronavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), may represent an effective and plausible target to counter the pathogen. One may even speculate that limiting the membranous RO formation by Propranolol, as tested in the current study, could disrupt the spatial assembly of viral replication complexes and increase the accessibility of viral-based drugs for targeting these functional machineries. In principle, this combination strategy could alleviate the shortage of medicine, reduce the cost of therapy, and likely decrease the risk of the emergence of drug resistance.</p><p id="P26">The continuing unraveling of coronaviruses life cycle has in turn advanced our understanding of the biology in host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). As shown in the fundamental process referred as membragenesis, the master regulator SREBP1 concertedly turns on both the production of phospholipids (via metabolic enzymes such as Lipin) and the assembly of bilayer (via the TMEM41B scramblase). Coronaviruses therefore may particularly rely on the membragenic mechanism to boost the construction of membranous replication compartments and likely the subsequent assembly of virion envelopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), a mechanism shared by other RNA virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Moreover, given the universal demand of increased membrane supply with bilayer equilibration in numerous processes such as cell growth, division, differentiation, metabolism, etc., however, the SREBP1-TMEM41B regulatory circuit may emerge as a key “rheostatic” mechanism that deserves further investigation and warrants relevance to both cells and viruses. Consistent with the notion, the cytosolic enzyme Lipin represents a central and highly regulated node in glycerophospholipid production, and has been implicated in metabolism, cancer, as well as tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). Our finding that Propranolol could be repurposed as a potential broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus agent, though serendipitous, is indeed driven by the understanding of host lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) and particularly SREBP1-TMEM41B in membragenesis. One may foresee that additional specific inhibitors could be developed to limit the metabolic fluxes of phospholipids to target this pivotal host pathway.</p><p id="P27">Although our current study is limited to cellular and murine models of coronavirus pathogenesis, the work could be of broad clinical relevance, inasmuch that Propranolol has been once wildly prescribed with extensive sets of pharmacology and toxicology data in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Propranolol is generally safe, orally active, and available in generic forms. While the drug is commonly prescribed as a 50-50% enantiomeric mixture with the S-form being more relevant to cardiovascular complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), we found that both chiral forms effectively inhibit coronaviruses and R-propranolol may offer better therapeutic outcomes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Hence, different combination of the two chiral forms could allow additional leverage of Propranolol’s beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) that often exacerbate COVID-19, thereby further reducing mortalities and helping recovery from the disease. These additional indications, and most importantly the anti-coronaviral effects by Propranolol in patients in the treatment or particularly the prophylactic regimens, await support by real world data and/or demonstration by clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Materials and methods</label><media xlink:href="EMS162997-supplement-Materials_and_methods.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d22aAdHbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Movie S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS162997-supplement-Movie_S1.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d22aAdHcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Movie S2</label><media xlink:href="EMS162997-supplement-Movie_S2.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d22aAdHdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS162997-supplement-Supplementary_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d22aAdHeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S9"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Drs.
