It frequently leads to preterm delivery, maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality and life-long complications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. We currently lack efficient screening tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and early therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> to address PE. To investigate the early stages of early onset PE, and identify candidate markers and pathways, we performed spatio-temporal multi-omics profiling of human PE placentae and healthy controls and validated targets in early gestation in a longitudinal clinical cohort. We used a single-nuclei RNA-seq approach combined with spatial proteo- and transcriptomics and mechanistic <italic>in vitro</italic> signalling analyses to bridge the gap from late pregnancy disease to early pregnancy pathomechanisms. We discovered a key disruption in villous trophoblast differentiation, which is driven by the increase of transcriptional coactivator p300, that ultimately ends with a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of trophoblasts. We found a significant increase in the senescence marker activin A in preeclamptic maternal serum in early gestation, before the development of clinical symptoms, indicating a translation of the placental syndrome to the maternal side. Our work describes a new disease progression, starting with a disturbed transition in villous trophoblast differentiation. Our study identifies potential pathophysiology-relevant biomarkers for the early diagnosis of the disease as well as possible targets for interventions, which would be crucial steps toward protecting the mother and child from gestational mortality and morbidity and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pre-eclampsia</kwd><kwd>trophoblast differentiation</kwd><kwd>pregnancy pathology</kwd><kwd>trophoblast stem cell</kwd><kwd>juvenile syncytiotrophoblast</kwd><kwd>spatial multi-omics</kwd><kwd>senescence-associated secretory phenotype</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P4">Recent single-cell sequencing studies of healthy female reproductive tissues outside and during pregnancy have characterised the early maternal-fetal interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, trophoblast subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and the endometrium before pregnancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.

While the single-cell landscape of healthy placentae has been described well, this is not true for the uteroplacental tissue of those suffering from the hypertensive pregnancy disorder pre-eclampsia (PE). A multi-modal characterisation of PE would provide a deeper understanding of this early gestational pathophysiology and improve clinical management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy account for 14% of maternal deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.

Currently, diagnoses are made based on clinical signs which appear when PE has progressed, late in pregnancy, to a point that maternal and fetal morbidity is often already irreversible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> Specific, reliable early first trimester screening methods are lacking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The only pharmacological intervention known to reduce risk, low-dose aspirin, is accompanied by challenges such as insufficient effects in up to 60% of high-risk pregnancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. PE is also associated with a reduction of the lifespan of both mother and child due to complications from cardiovascular disease later in life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Highlighting the fundamental role for the placenta, the only therapy to end the maternal PE crisis, is to deliver the placenta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Here we integrated single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) with spatially resolved proteo- and transcriptomics and multicentric pre-eclampsia cohorts. We identified an early disruption in the villous trophoblast differentiation transition to the secretory trophoblast (syncytiotrophoblast, STB) lineage and premature senescence that leads to a fetal to maternal syndrome translation in eoPE. The markers and pathways we identifed in the fetal-maternal barrier can be considered as candidates for underlying molecular placental pathology in PE. In turn, these may act as prognostic biomarkers to identify eoPE before clinical symptoms arise, potentially offering crucial tools for the early diagnosis of this serious syndrome as well as therapeutic approaches.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Maternal-fetal crosstalk in early and late pregnancy</title><p id="P7">Since the placenta (fetal tissue) and decidua (maternal tissue) biopsy sampling in ongoing pregnancy increases the risk for adverse outcomes, there is a lack of comprehensive longitudinal studies and understanding of early pathomechanisms translating disease to late gestation. To better understand the early pathophysiology of maternal-fetal crosstalk in eoPE, we analysed diseased preeclamptic and healthy term tissue. In addition, we included early gestation tissue to set pathological findings in a temporal context. We performed snRNA-seq of fetal chorionic villi and maternal decidua in healthy pregnancies from first trimester (5-10 gestational weeks, n=79,885 villus-derived nuclei (v) and 15,367 decidua-derived nuclei (d), in total 95,252 nuclei; early control = e.ctrl; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-e</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1</bold>) and term (≥38 gestational weeks; n=39,663 nuclei; late control = l.ctrl; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-e</xref>). Additionally, we profiled villi and decidua from women who had developed eoPE (≤34 gestational weeks; n=35,662 nuclei; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-e</xref>). Single nuclei were harmonised across samples from healthy early and term late, as well as eoPE pregnancies. Differences of eoPE and l.ctrl were computationally adjusted for gestational age differences, since eoPE is defined as PE with pre-term delivery before the 34<sup>th</sup> week of gestation compared to normal term delivery in l.ctrl. Furthermore, we studied the spatial heterogeneity of cell types by integrating multi-omics data using snRNA-seq, <italic>Visium</italic> spatial transcriptomic assays, spatially resolved <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing (ISS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>), and spatial proteomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">We identified a rich diversity of cell types and cell states in the maternal-fetal barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Fig. 1</bold>). Variations in cell composition within the immune, vascular-endothelial, matrisome, and trophoblast compartments were evident at different gestational sampling times at the maternal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Fig. 1 and Table 4</bold>) and fetal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Fig. 1 and Table 3</bold>) interface, mirroring specific functional adaptiations at different stages of pregnancy. Syncytiotrophoblast (STB) populations were more prominent in late compared to early villi, and they tended to be more abundant in eoPE tissues (percent of total nuclei: 22.2% in e.ctrl, 83.3% in l.ctrl and 91.2% in eoPE, FDR &lt; 0.01 e.ctrl to l.ctrl, FDR=0.144 l.ctrl to eoPE). We identified nuclei in the decidua that are villous-derived and strongly positive for STB markers such as <italic>CGB</italic> and <italic>KISS1</italic>. We defined them as “deported STBs” found in decidua (dDSTB). These fragments released from the STB are found more frequently in eoPE decidua than in controls (eoPE= 980; l.ctrl=85, e.ctrl=0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b, e</xref> <bold>Extended Data Table 4</bold>), and are postulated to be the final product of senescent vSTB when shed into maternal circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Our integrative analysis of snRNA-seq and spatial data showed that STB exists in three transcriptionally different nuclei states, including a novel STB juvenile subtype (vSTBjuv) alongside vSTB1 and vSTB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, e and f</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Fig. 2</bold>). The vSTBjuv population is characterised by the notably higher expression of hormone genes including placental lactogen (<italic>CSH1, CSH2</italic>). It also exhibits exocytotic expression signatures (<italic>HSPB1, CD63, FURIN</italic>) in addition to more classical vSTB genes: <italic>KISS1, CGA, PGF, EBI3, TFPI</italic>. We postulate that vSTBjuv has a stromal function by regulating cytoskeletal stability and the extracellular matrix, as indicated by the expression of genes such as <italic>ACTB, TMSB10, SPARC</italic>, and <italic>VIM</italic> (<bold>Extended Data Fig. 2</bold>).</p><p id="P10">Next, we localised the vSTBjuv cell state within the STB layer. We identified markers that best distinguished vSTBjuv from vSTB1 and vSTB2, which were <italic>TENM3</italic> (log2FC=12.4), which promotes homophilic adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, and <italic>DLK1</italic> (log2FC=6.2), a paternally imprinted gene which is correlated with birthweight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation with <italic>DLK1</italic> and <italic>TENM3</italic> padlock-probes, we localised <italic>DLK1<sup>+</sup>/TENM3<sup>+</sup></italic>vSTBjuv within a β-hCG<sup>pos</sup> STB layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>; <bold>Extended Data Fig. 3</bold>). We validated the transcriptomic signatures of the STB and their progenitors, the cytotrophoblasts (CTBs), which are both components of the maternal-fetal barrier, by applying spatial proteomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-c</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Fig. 4a-d</bold>). The revealed signatures showed enrichment for signalling of RhoGTPases, MIRO and RHOBTB3, and enriched mitotic pathways in vCTBs. vSTBs exhibited an enrichment in oxidative stress-associated processes such as ROS production and enzymes known to be involved in metabolic disorders of biological oxidation (<bold>Extended Data Fig. 4</bold>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Activin and Hippo reciprocally drive physiological trophoblast transition</title><p id="P11">To resolve the trophoblast cell states and infer how their disturbed development may play a crucial role in eoPE, we recapitulated the transcriptional dynamics of human trophoblast differentiation from the progenitors CTBs to their final identities cell column trophoblasts (CCTs) or STBs. Modelling cell trajectories using pseudotime with proliferating vCTB (vCTBp) as the root, we detected two distinct lineages of this bipotent trophoblast. The trajectory expressed gene patterns computationally that predicted to be <italic>transition genes</italic> expressed along a trajectory branch. vCTB cell fate ran towards invading vCCT, or towards a secretory vSTB lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>).</p><p id="P12">In the CCT trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), vCTBs can commit towards vCCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, a cell type that expands and proliferates in the proximal part of cell columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, asterisk). Distally, it anchors villi on maternal decidua. These distal CCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, area circled in blue) then migrate and invade maternal decidua to remodel maternal vessels and partially replace maternal local endothelium (called decidual extravillous trophoblasts = dEVTs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). This so-called spiral artery remodelling results in low-flow, low-resistance vessels that prevents damage to the fetal trophoblast barrier. A faulty spiral artery remodelling initiated by vCCT has been postulated as a crucial event in the development of PE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Receptor-ligand analyses of vCCT prior to invasion and noninvaded maternal decidua suggested that vCCT may initiate maternal decidua reorganisation via several integrins <italic>(ITGB8, ITGA1), FLT1</italic>, and <italic>TGFBR1</italic> (<bold>Extended Data Fig. 4e</bold>). Key transition genes in the transition of vCTB towards the vCCT phenotype are <italic>HLA-G</italic> and <italic>NOTUM</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <bold>Extended figure 4f</bold>), so we investigated potential drivers of the vCCT phenotype. We observed dynamic increase of transcription factors <italic>FOS</italic> and the Hippo pathway member <italic>TEAD1</italic> along the pseudotime axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), which reflected the change from epithelial-like CDH1<sup>pos</sup> vCTB to vCCT, that are ready to migrate and invade.

Therefore, we investigated the fusion dynamics of STB progenitor cells with the goal to identify at which stage of eoPE cells depart from their normal developmental trajectory. These STB progenitor cells are <italic>ERVFRD-1<sup>+</sup></italic> CTB cells, previously described by Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, here: CTBpf). Notably, CTBpf was the only villous cell type that expressed the BMP-inhibitor <italic>GREM2</italic> (<bold>Extended Data Fig. 2, 8</bold>), and we showed that GREM2<sup>pos</sup> cells still expressed the classical CTB-marker CDH1 in early villous tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, c</xref>). The CDH1<sup>pos</sup> cell borders of CTBpf also show they are not yet fused with the multinucleated vSTB and are still a mono-nucleated vCTB subtype, which is why we named them CTBpf for their pre-fusion CTB cell state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P19">CTBpf also show high expression of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mRNA that encodes β-catenin. Spatial proteomics of the STB layer confirmed the presence of β-catenin (Supplemental Table 9), a Wnt regulator that is involved in CDH1 degradation. The appearance of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> in CDH1<sup>pos</sup> fusion-competent CTBpf cells underlines the importance of CTBpf in the transition from CDH<sup>pos</sup> vCTB to CDH<sup>neg</sup> vSTB. We performed flow cytometry with primary CDH1<sup>pos</sup> CTB isolated from first trimester placentae to corroborate these findings. We used snRNA-seq to identify the vCTBpf markers <italic>GREM2, ABTB2, CCR7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) that we then used in flow cytometry to identify and validate the vCTBpf. &gt;93% of CDH1<sup>pos</sup>/CD49<sup>neg</sup> were positive for CTBpf markers GREM2 and CCR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d, e</xref>; Extended Data Fig. 6f). This CTBpf fraction increased over time in culture, achieving a stable fraction of around 7-9% of live cells after day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). This was accompanied by a shift from G0/G1 phase to G2/M phase and an increase of DNA content (Extended Data Fig. 6g). These data support our proposal that the “pre-fusion CTB” cell state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> is a vCTB subtype and that, as cultured primary CTBs undergo spontaneous fusion, vSTB have passed this vCTBpf cell state. Based on the specific expression of BMP-inhibitor GREM2 in vCTBpf, we validated <italic>in vitro</italic> that BMP7 inhibited fusion induced by cAMP agonist forskolin (Extended Data Fig. 8). Temporary BMP inhibition by CTBpf seems to be a prerequisite for fusion from vCTBs to vSTB. This led us to investigate the activity of genes predicted to play key roles in modulating the development of STB and lineage commitment that starts with the CTBpf cell state. We identified a dysregulation of transition genes that drive trophoblast development (Supplementary Table 3). STBjuv show the highest percentage of dysregulated STB transition genes (18.1%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>) such as <italic>GDF15</italic> and <italic>LNPEP</italic> (Extended Data Fig. 5). In comparison to vSTBs, vCTBs have a relatively low fraction of transition genes within their DEG (13 transition genes of 349 total CTB DEG, 0.04%). Notably, <italic>GREM2</italic> was also highly upregulated in the microarray validation dataset of placenta whole tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Herewith, we can indicate that GREM2<sup>pos</sup> pre-fusion vCTBs are of importance in the aberrant trophoblast differentiation in eoPE. This CTBpf state was also more abundant in first trimester compared to late gestation (Extended Data Table 3), and therefore may be part of eoPE pathophysiology already in early pregnancy by impacting vSTB transition.</p><p id="P20">To make an assessment of the extent of global tissue dysregulation, we measured the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in eoPE compared to term control placentae. We found that between villi and decidua, villous cell types are the most profoundly disturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Table 4</bold>). Of the global tissue dysregulation, STB accounted for 58.2% of the total DEGs in villi (% of villous DEG, <bold>Supplementary Table 5</bold>). Of note, we found similar patterns in a larger microarray datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> of eoPE vs control (<italic>n</italic>=37; <bold>Extended Data Fig. 7</bold>), confirming our data in a larger cohort. We found some shared DEG between different villous cell types (<bold>Extended Data Fig. 7</bold>), speculating global dysregulating events. Interestingly, the gene <italic>FLT1</italic> encoding for the anti-angiogenic factor sFLT1 used in the clinic for short-term follow-up in cases of eoPE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, was upregulated in two cell types, the vSTB and the vVEC. In summary, eoPE is characterised by a massive dysregulation of the fetal barrier consisting of mainly vSTB, as observed in the high degree of dysregulation in these cell states.</p><p id="P21">vSTB is a multinucleated fused cell barrier towards the maternal circulation and showed the highest aberration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), so next we investigated dysregulation patterns of different STB states and analysed the DEGs shared between STB subtypes (22.6%; n=329 of 1084; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Of these, 99.5% (n=15) showed same directionality in gene expression, indicating a functional unit between vSTB1, vSTB2, and vSTBjuv states. We therefore carried out a regulatory analysis to map transcription factors (TFs) to binding motifs in downstream dysregulated targets shared between vSTB states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) to investigate the drivers of transition of the vSTB lineage under pathological conditions.

In summary, we identified <italic>EP300</italic> as hub TF with the highest number of targets within the DEGs shared between STB states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), and an involvement in fusion processes.</p><p id="P22">Congruently, we identified an overlap between EP300 target and fusogenic genes including CTBpf marker <italic>ERVFRD-1</italic> and <italic>GCM1</italic>, which are associated with fusion of cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Fig. 6d</bold>). Dysregulated EP300 target genes in eoPE were also found expressed early in pregnancy and are involved in the STB transition (<bold>Extended Data Fig. 6d, e</bold>)<italic>. EP300</italic> encodes the histone acetyltransferase p300, which is translocated to the nucleus upon activation. We show that the nuclear localisation of p300 in trophoblasts is higher in eoPE compared to l.ctrl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d, e</xref>). <italic>EP300</italic> was also found to be upregulated in whole-placenta lysates in eoPE compared to gestational age-matched preterm controls (pt.ctrl) in a multicentre cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). This suggests that the cause of dysregulation in eoPE may be the aberrant transition to STB, driven by <italic>EP300</italic>. This may subsequently cause an early differentiation or disproportionate shift towards the vSTB-lineage in eoPE. Altogether, we identified p300/EP300 as important driver in eoPE. Dysregulation in eoPE can be linked to the early transition of STB, at the intermediary fusion states CTBpf and STBjuv.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>eoPE is associated with a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) at the maternal-fetal interface</title><p id="P23">Our analyses suggest that eoPE is the result of a perturbation in the transition of STB via fusion cell states.

When comparing the DEGs of STB subtypes to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) atlas database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, we find that in eoPE, affected trophoblasts exhibit a higher increase in SASP gene activity than in late controls. 12% of the genes dysregulated in STBs during eoPE are annotated as SASP factors (<bold>Supplemental Table 7</bold>). The placenta is known to be essential in the pathology of PE and the placental syndrome eventually translates into a maternal systemic syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Altogether, this led us to carry out an analysis of focused receptor-ligand interactions that might affect fetal to maternal SASP translation. Here, we turned to a model that could be used as a proxy for the fetal to maternal crosstalk from trophoblast to the maternal vasculature that underwent changes during pregnancy. To this end, we analysed cell-cell communication between villous derived STB components and decidual vascular cells (dVEC, dSMC) to investigate how the dysregulated STB subtypes we described above could translate the fetal villous syndrome to the maternal system.</p><p id="P24">We defined anatomically relevant cell types which physiologically interact, and computationally analysed them for their ligand-receptor interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Among the upregulated factors, we found a predominance of secreted factors (of dysregulated vSTB genes were identified as secreted or extracellular exosome factors (GO:0005615, GO:0070062, GO:0032940; GO:0060627; GO:0048010)) that interact with receptors on the maternal vasculature (dVEC, dSMC) via the maternal circulation <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The interactions between vSTB-dVEC and vSTB-dSMC predominantly involved SASP genes (67%, 6 out of 9). <italic>GDF15-TGFBR2</italic> is found to be interacting via maternal blood between villi in vSTB and decidual endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). GDF15 is a secreted TGFβ superfamily protein and activin ligand that is abundant in the placenta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. In PE, it is observed in increased levels in maternal serum and placentae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. In addition, we demonstrated a significant upregulation of vSTB-derived ligands of <italic>LEP-</italic> and <italic>INHBA</italic> as well as interactions with their respective receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Upregulation of both <italic>GDF15</italic> and <italic>INHBA</italic> was independently validated in the multicentre eoPE cohort, where; they were significantly upregulated in patients compared to gestational with age-matched pre-term controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Additionally, GDF15 was detected by immunofluorescence to be elevated in eoPE patients compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). When we visualised all DEGs of vSTBs that were <italic>EP300</italic>-mediated SASP genes, we observed significant aberration profiles of vSTB cell states in eoPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). We robustly validated our findings using multiple lines of evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b-e</xref>). We conclude that overall, SASP drives the majority of fetal-to-maternal ligandreceptor interactions in eoPE via secretion into the maternal circulation.</p><p id="P25">Our next aim was to identify the localisation of senescence-associated molecules within the trophoblast wall of villi. To do this, we compared spatially resolved transcriptomes from healthy term controls vs eoPE using <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>). Transcripts were computationally assigned as villous wall structure and then qualified to have their proximity to vascular markers <italic>(CDH5, IDO2, KDR, TEK, ZEB1)</italic>, derived from vessels close to the trophoblast layer, evaluated (see <bold>Extended Data Fig. 8</bold>). One finding from <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing data was a divergence in the spatial expression of the senescence marker <italic>INHBA</italic>. In eoPE, <italic>INHBA</italic> was found more frequently in proximity to vascular transcripts, while in term controls, it was found to be significantly distant from vessels (l.ctrl; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5j</xref>). The overall increase of SASPs in vSTB, in combination with spatial disorganisation of these senescent vSTB, suggests that there are functional dysregulations in regions of maternal to fetal crosstalk where oxygen and nutrient transport across the STB from maternal blood to fetal circulation occur. Further evidence for the importance of <italic>INHBA</italic> in the development of eoPE comes from our multicentre cohort, whose villous tissue also exhibited increases in <italic>INHBA</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5k</xref>). The gene products uncovered in this study, as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), and their role in vSTB transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h-k</xref>) and maternal-fetal crosstalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i-j</xref>), might indicate a potential of these factors as an early predictor of eoPE.</p><p id="P26">Uteroplacental tissue analyses have been limited to cross-sectional studies at late timepoints due to the increased maternal and fetal risk for adverse outcomes following interventions during pregnancy. To evaluate the early predictive potential and pathomechanistic relevance of our identified markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), we turned to a prospective longitudinal cohort spanning from first trimester to delivery where clinical outcome of eoPE was verified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.

A serum sample was taken before carrying out a risk assessment to predict PE using the ‘Fetal Maternal Foundation’ (FMF) algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.

We used a conditional logistic regression model without prior risk stratification via the FMF algorithm for eoPE-prediction, and found that activin A also significantly contributed to predict eoPE already early in pregnancy (p=0.0123; <bold>Extended Data Fig. 10</bold>). Clinically, uterine artery pulsatility index measurements (UtA-PI) are performed to determine adverse pregnancy outcome. ROC analyses of UtA-PI in combination with Activin A and GDF-15 had a higher predictive potential compared to UtA-PI alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5m</xref>).

Here, we reconstruct the course of pregnancy where longitudinal sampling is limited, and link evidence from preeclampsia in later gestation to early pregnancy where underlying pathomechanisms are still unclear and diagnosis is not yet possible. Thereby, we present evidence that the preeclampsia syndrome arises from an early pregnancy disruption of trophoblast differentiation. We trace the faulty trophoblast differentiation to the specific event of transition from progenitor-like vCTB to post-fusion vSTB that create the fetal barrier to maternal circulation. Our model suggests that vSTBs undergo a accelerated premature differentiation associated with a dysregulation of the transcriptional co-activator p300. This drives the premature development of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype of vSTB subtypes that is specific to eoPE and impedes maternal-to-fetal crosstalk. Accordingly, we provide evidence that levels of senescence marker activin A and GDF15, detectable in serum at early stages of gestation, are contributing to a prediction-model to estimate risk for the later development of eoPE. In summary, this model defines preeclamptic disease as a response to altered syncytiotrophoblast lineage drivers, which result in a disturbance of placental processes of senescence translated to maternal circulation. This is in line with previous hypotheses that senescence and the shedding of necroptotic STB bodies might play key roles in PE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> and arise from disturbed trophoblast differentiation. We could capture these STB bodies in decidua and transcriptionally profile them (dDSTB). These dDSTBs are highly GDF15<sup>pos</sup> STB particles derived from villous tissue and are putatively carried by maternal blood into the maternal vasculature in PE. They are known to regulate transcription in target maternal endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">Early uteroplacental tissue analyses derived from terminations of pregnancy have been limited by the difficulty of predicting the future clinical course of a pregnancy. To overcome this issue, we compared tissues obtained from a window at the beginning of pregnancy, at which time the further progression was unknown, with a late window, when the disease has fully developed. We had access to a longitudinal cohort that phenotyped women from their screening in the first trimester all the way to delivery. By comparing outcomes of women with eoPE to healthy controls, we could computationally extend findings of late pregnancy back to an early gestational window prior to the appearance of overt symptoms of the disease. Further computational work will need to be done that integrates biospecimens across a longer gestational time to interpolate further important time frames in PE development and progression.</p><p id="P31">We identified an early dysregulation in pre-eclampsia where p300-linked transcription factor complexes may affect the defective regulation of trophoblast development that is associated with STB fusion. Congruently, we identified upregulation of genes that are unique for a pre-fusion vCTB (CTBpf) and involved in fusion itself, such as <italic>EVRFRD-1</italic> and <italic>GREM2</italic>. This might be explained by Hippo-based mechanotransduction of high-velocity arterial shear stress that occurs secondary to the high-resistance uterine arteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> phenotypical of eoPE. The disrupted trajectory of STB subtypes we described may act in concert with other influences – oxidative stress, altered perfusion, and other factors known to contribute to eoPE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> – to create a senescence-associated dysfunction of the maternal-fetal barrier. This means that eoPE may be marked by a cell fate diversion that increasingly drives vCTBs toward the STB fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), via an autocrine feedback loop that is very likely mediated by activin.</p><p id="P32">Our study also lays the groundwork for a novel understanding of the early pathophysiology of the early-onset subtype of PE. We carry out a precise analysis of the fetal-to-maternal translation, from STB in the villi wall to maternal vasculature on the cellular level. In general, our work confirms well-established biomarkers of eoPE such as sFlt1 (<italic>FLT1</italic>), <italic>PAPPA2</italic>, and <italic>PGF</italic>, and identified additional early pregnancy markers that interact with maternal vasculature and are activin-pathway associated SASP factors, such as GDF15 (<italic>GDF15</italic>) and activin A (<italic>INHBA</italic>). We have shown these factors are pathophysiology-relevant and imminent to trophoblast transition. Trophoblast differentiation is disrupted and as sequelae, premature senescence of STB with increased <italic>GDF15</italic> and <italic>INHBA</italic> expression ensues. While activin A was reported previously, we can now additionally extrapolate it’s central role in the pathomechanism of preeclampsia early on. GDF15 was shown to be predictive of PE in term pregnancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, and while it is putatively associated with cardiometabolic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, we found a new role connecting this with early pregnancy STB differentiation and early pathomechanisms.</p><p id="P33">Finally, we envision that the comprehensive multi-omics data we analysed will lead to the discovery of further pathomechanistic biomarkers and ultimately the development of new curative pharmacological approaches at early timepoints in gestation. These new approaches may finally prevent a syndrome that begins during a vulnerable period of the life of the child, and continues to affect them their entire lives. So far, the established symptomatic pre-eclampsia treatments, related to blood pressure management and preterm delivery, are primarily beneficial for the mother but have adverse effects on the fetus, thus posing a public health concern. We suggest that future molecular phenotyping and precision medicine in pregnancy should focus on the disturbed fetal trophoblast transition to prevent the pathogenesis of the fetus and subsequently of the mother.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Patient samples</title><p id="P34">Tissue sampling was done in a multicentre-design.

For the conclusive analysis routine, the in situ sequencing data was displayed as decoded spots of x and y coordinates of all detected mRNA molecules, each with an associated gene label. In total, three <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing slide scans were analysed (106KS, 107KS, 156KS). 156KS (early control) contained genes from the customized placenta/cell typing pane l that was designed for retrieving cell and tissue types, and both 106KS (late control) and 107KS (eoPE) contained genes from the custom/pathway panel which was targeted at analysing cell state and metabolic activity (code book for panels available via zenodo doi: 10.5281/zenodo.5243240).

Genes from the cell typing panel were conceptualized as cell type markers, with CTB, STB and HBC cell types considered for further spatial analysis and plotting since they had good marker coverage and constituted important spatial landmarks in the villi anatomy (with the walls being layered with STBs and CTBs, and HBCs forming distinct, compact cells in the intra-villous matrix).</p><p id="P87">Accordingly, a gene-cell-type affinity measure was derived through the gene molecule counts in the snRNA-Seq data set for CTB, STB and HBC. This was done per gene by contrasting molecule counts in the cells belonging to a cell type of interest in the snRNA-Seq data against the molecule counts of an opposing set of cells using plankton.py’s score_affinity function. Hence, for each analysis, two contrastive sets of cell types were defined: (i) CTB vs STB for CTBs; (ii) STBs vs CTBs for STBs; and (iii) HBC vs all other cells for HBCs. The transcriptome of CTB and STB cells could be expected to be more similar since both cells are trophoblasts. Therefore, to determine definitive cell type markers, CTB and STB were contrasted against each other, which would cancel out potential common trophoblast marker genes. Each genes’ mean molecule counts in all cells assigned to the two contrastive cell type sets was determined. The logarithm of the ratio of these mean count indicators was used as score for a gene’s affinity to a certain cell type. To improve visual clarity during plotting, a threshold of 0.5 was used to assign colour labels to each gene in both analyses. Genes exceeding this affinity score threshold determined markers for CTBs (<italic>ASPM, ATAD2, BRIP1, CD24, CDH1, CENPE, DIAPH3, FBN2, KANK1, SEMA6D, TIMP3</italic>), STBs (<italic>ADAMTS20, CGA, CYP19A1, ENTPD1, KISS1, KLRD1, LEP, LINC00474, MYCNUT, PAPPA2, PLAC4, PLXDC2</italic>), and HBCs <italic>(CD163L1, CD36, F13A1, FGF13, LYVE1, MEF2C, SPP1)</italic>, with the remaining genes assigned as ‘other’.</p></sec><sec id="S39"><title>mRNA molecule spatial context analysis in the placenta panel</title><p id="P88">Using the plankton.py’s run_umap function, a weighted neighbourhood graph was built using the 800 nearest neighbours of each molecule, with neighbours weighted according to their Euclidean distance using a Gaussian probability density function (PDF) at a bandwidth of 9 μm, which would roughly cover the area of a single cell and its immediate environment. Then, a model of local mRNA distribution was created over all genes by summing over each gene’s molecules’ weights. Furthermore, a regularization mechanism was introduced by increasing each distribution’s value of the gene of its molecule of origin by 1.15.</p><p id="P89">A 2D embedding of recurring spatial context was determined by applying the python umap-learn v0.5.3 algorithm to the local distributions. The number of neighbours in the UMAP algorithm was set to 24 and the minimal distance of points in the embedded representation was set to 0.2. UMAP used a Euclidean distance metric and was initiated at a random state of 42. The determined gene-celltype associations were used in a cell type visualization plot of the early placenta sample 156KS.

Villi walls were determined using a basic edge detection algorithm applied to matching DAPI signal, where villi walls were clearly remarked by dense nucleation. A greyscale rendering of the DAPI stain was smoothed using an optical Gaussian filter at a 2 μm bandwidth. Scikit-image’s (v0.19.2) feature.canny() implementation of the canny edge detection algorithm (using a sigma value of 3.7) was used to extract the villi walls in the smoothed image. Every molecule within a radius of 5 μm to any point of the detected edges was defined as being part of the villi walls, and all other molecules were discarded from further analysis. The wall filter algorithm was visualized by plotting the underlying DAPI stain in matplotlib’s violet-blue ‘magma’ colour scheme. The detected edges from the second step of the wall filter algorithm were plotted on top of the stain as orange lines.

Optical inspection of the scattered senescence and vascularization markers hinted that senescence marker topography was more structured in the control sample as compared to the eoPE sample, with senescence marker expression being reduced around vascularization clusters in the tissue.</p><p id="P93">To statistically model this observation, the villi wall molecules were subdivided into two categories depending on their location of expression: (i) a vessel proximal category that contained all molecules within regions of 5 μm of another vessel marker; and (ii) a vessel-distal category that contained the other molecules. A null hypothesis was formed, according to which the distributions of genes should be equal within the two categories. For each gene, we reported the p-value of the violation of this null hypothesis in a binomial test. Scipy’s (v1.8.1) stats.binom.cdf implementation was used, with parameters ‘p’ defined as the total percentage of ‘proximal’ molecules, ‘k’ the gene-specific number of proximal molecules and ‘n’ the total number of molecules of the respective gene in the sample. The sorted p-values for all genes present in the pathway sample were displayed in a vertical bar graph, with the bars coloured according to their membership to the categories ‘senescence’, ‘vascularization’, ‘trophoblast’ or ‘other’ (Extended Data Figure 6f,g).

We excluded patients that were prescribed prophylactic Aspirin from being part of the control group to reduce confounding. The serum samples from the 84 selected case and control patients (matched on maternal age, GA at first scan, and BMI) were then analysed for leptin, perlecan, GDF15 and activin A according manufactures protocol: human HSPG (Perlecan) ELISA Kit (ab274393; Abcam), human GDF-15 Quantikine ELISA Kit (DGD150; R&amp;D Systems), human/mouse/rat Activin A Quantikine ELISA Kit (DAC00; R&amp;D Systems) and human Leptin Quantikine ELISA Kit (DLP00; R&amp;D Systems).

gestation (early and late pregnancy) and in late pregnancy disease versus control (healthy term=l.ctrl, early onset preeclampsia=eoPE). Placental tissue was separately sampled surgically to collect villi and decidua from the same patients for snRNA-seq. Early tissues correspond to gestational ages between 5-10 weeks (e.ctrl), early-onset pre-eclampsia before 34 weeks (eoPE; range 27-33 weeks of gestation) and late healthy control at 39 weeks (l.ctrl; range is 38-40 weeks of gestation). The gestational age difference between healthy term controls (l.ctrl) and diseased pre-term eoPE were corrected for using additional scRNA-seq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> from preterm controls (pt.ctrl).
