Previous attempts to investigate genetic factors affecting DNMs have suffered from a lack of statistical power, due to the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of parent-offspring trios. Thus, the rare disease cohort of the UK’s 100k Genomes Project (100kGP), comprising more than 10,000 trios, represents an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the genetics of germline mutation. Here we estimate SNP heritability of DNM count in offspring, as a measure of the relative contribution of genetic factors to the variance of the trait, in a PCA-selected subset of the 100kGP cohort. We estimate separate SNP heritabilities for paternally and maternally transmitted mutations (based on parentally phased DNMs in offspring), computed using parental genetic variants at a range of minimum frequencies and a variety of methodologies. We estimate a heritability of 10-20% for paternal DNMs; by contrast, for maternal DNMs we find no significant evidence for non-zero heritability. We investigated the partitioning of heritability among genes with different expression profiles in different tissue or cell states, and found a relative heritability enrichment for genes expressed in gonadal tissues, particularly testis. Among germ cells in adult testes we observed relative enrichment of heritability in genes associated with the (undifferentiated) spermatogonial stem cell state.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Germline de novo mutations (DNMs) are DNA sequence mutations occurring within a generation on the lineage from parental to offspring zygote, and thus appearing as new genetic variants in all offspring cells. When they affect functional genomic regions they can cause adverse phenotypic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Veltman and Brunner, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Samocha et al., 2014</xref>), so understanding the factors contributing to germline mutation is important for the genetics of rare diseases and developmental disorders. However, DNMs are rare in the genome, and investigating them requires whole genome sequences from complete parent-offspring trios or larger pedigrees. Early studies of de novo point mutations in humans were therefore hindered by the cost and difficulty of whole genome sequencing, and the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies was crucial in overcoming these limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Koboldt et al., 2013</xref>). Over the last decade, the sizes of sequenced pedigree and trio cohorts have steadily increased, enabling DNM processes and the factors affecting them to be investigated with increasing statistical power.</p><p id="P3">Studies to date have focused on estimating the DNM rate in humans and the effects on it of parental age and genomic context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kong et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kessler et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Jónsson et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Goldmann et al., 2016</xref>). Cohorts with a typical parental age distribution reveal a mean DNM rate of 1.20×10<sup>−8</sup> per nucleotide per generation, or about 70 DNMs per individual from both parents, with the majority coming from fathers. Older parents contribute more DNMs to offspring, with paternal age having roughly four times the effect of maternal age; for example in a study of 1,548 Icelanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Jónsson et al., 2017</xref>) the number of DNMs from fathers increased by 1.51 per year, and from mothers only 0.37 per year. The causes of these age effects are somewhat unclear, since the prior model, in which the paternal effect was due to the greater number of cell divisions on the male germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Crow, 2000</xref>) seems incompatible with observations such as that the male-female DNM ratio remains constant with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Gao et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Other studies, both in trio cohorts and population genomic data, have detected the influence of local genomic factors such as histone modifications, recombination rate and replication timing on DNM rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Francioli et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Carlson et al., 2018</xref>). DNMs are also found to cluster spatially on the genome, and factors determining the distribution, composition and age effect of clustered mutations appear to differ between sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Jónsson et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Goldmann et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Germline mutation processes have also been investigated by analysing the distribution of DNM rates by substitution type, referred to as the mutation spectrum, and its decomposition into distinct mutational signatures. A wide range of signatures have been observed in somatic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alexandrov et al., 2020</xref>), of which only two have been found to contribute substantially to germline mutation. Both have been associated with age-related mutagenesis (i.e. accumulating steadily over time) in somatic tissues, one seemingly driven by C&gt;T mutations caused by spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Rahbari et al., 2016</xref>). Evidence from population genetic datasets has also revealed that the base composition and wider spectrum of germline mutation have varied over time and between human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Narasimhan et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Harris and Pritchard, 2017</xref>). Again, the causes underlying these changes are unknown, and a variety of genetic and environmental factors have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Carlson, DeWitt and Harris, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Indeed, it remains an open question whether differences in germline mutation are driven primarily by environmental mutagens or endogenous genetic factors. Environmental factors might include the effects of diet, ionising radiation or reactive chemicals, temperature, or any mutagenic factors exogenous to the individual in which mutations arise. Effects on the DNM count and spectrum have been identified in fathers exposed to ionising radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Holtgrewe et al., 2018</xref>) or chemoreactive agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ton et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kaplanis et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Genetic factors might include a population of mutator alleles, perhaps affecting the processes of DNA repair or replication, increasing or decreasing the likelihood of some or all categories of mutation throughout the germline or at some point in development or gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Seplyarskiy et al., 2021</xref>). Previous studies have failed to find evidence either for extant mutator alleles of large effect in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Seoighe and Scally, 2017</xref>) or for the heritability of DNM count as a genetic trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Jónsson et al., 2017</xref>), but their power was limited respectively by the removal of alleles with detectable effects through selection (Milligan, Amster and Sella, 2022) and small sample size. On a longer timescale, the mean germline mutation rate is known to differ between primate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chintalapati and Moorjani, 2020</xref>), and it has been argued that germline mutation rates across species are consistent with a balance between selection and drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lynch et al., 2016</xref>). These evolutionary considerations suggest that germline mutation in humans is or has been under genetic influence to a greater or lesser extent.</p><p id="P8">Here we investigate the heritability of germline DNM in a larger cohort than previously studied (13,949 parent-offspring trios), considering the number of DNMs passed by parents to offspring as a genetic trait. With a dataset of this size (903,525 DNMs, of which 241,063 were assigned to a parent of origin by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kaplanis et al., 2022</xref>)) we are able to separately estimate the heritability of paternal and maternally derived mutations, and investigate the enrichment of heritability in genomic regions associated with tissue-specific or gametogenetic stage-specific gene expression.</p><p id="P9">Heritability is a quantitative measure of the genetic contribution to a trait in a specific study cohort. In particular, narrow-sense heritability is defined as the proportion of the observed trait variance accounted for by the additive effects of inherited genetic variants, and is often estimated using twin and family-based studies. However, a genome sequencing dataset such as this enables us to identify genotypes at specific loci and evaluate the contribution of observed genetic variation to heritability individually and in total – a quantity called SNP heritability. Since any estimate of heritability is contingent both on the cohort studied and on the methodology used to estimate it, our interest here is as much in the comparison between sexes as in its absolute value. We therefore consider the results of multiple commonly used estimation approaches, both those using the individual genotypes directly such as Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Yang et al., 2011</xref>) or Linkage Disequilibrium Adjusted Kinships (LDAK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Speed et al., 2012</xref>), and those based on SNP summary statistics such as LD score regression (LDSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bulik-Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). (The latter, although lower in statistical power, is often used in cases where SNP data are restricted or unavailable.)</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P10">We analysed whole-genome sequence data from the 100kGP rare disease cohort. In order to minimise bias due to population stratification when estimating heritability by GCTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Krishna Kumar et al., 2016</xref>) we performed a principal components analysis (PCA) to identify population structure in the data, with the aim of selecting a more genetically homogeneous subset of the data. Based on this we restricted our subsequent analysis to a subset comprising a) individuals with self-identified 'White British' ethnicity; and, additionally, b) individuals with 'Not Stated' ethnicity lying in the same region of PCA space as those selected in (a). The resulting dataset comprised 7,985 individuals (Father) and 8,048 individuals (Mother) for the genotype.</p><p id="P11">DNMs were assigned to a parent of origin (phased) using nearby informative heterozygous sites as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kaplanis et al., 2022</xref>). In each parental category (maternal and paternal) we took the number of phased DNMs assigned to that category in offspring as the phenotype of interest and estimated its SNP heritability using the corresponding parental genotypes as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>. We varied the threshold minor allele frequency (MAF) of potential explanatory SNPs from 0.0003 (rare variants) to 0.05 (common variants) to evaluate the effect of this on estimated heritability. Also, to account for age effects, in each parental category the parental age at conception was used as a covariate in the heritability analysis.</p><p id="P12">Estimates of SNP heritability were made using several methods, each involving different assumptions about the relationship between genotype and phenotype: GCTA, LDAK, HYBRID (an approach combining GCTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Yang et al., 2011</xref>) and LDAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Speed et al., 2012</xref>)), and LDSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bulik-Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4">Methods</xref>). The resulting estimates for both parental sexes are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, each for a range of allele frequency thresholds. Several overall comparisons and trends are apparent. In both parental categories, heritabilities estimated from summary statistics tend to be lower than those estimated from individual genotype (and we note that in principle the latter estimation method has more statistical power than the former).</p><p id="P13">For paternal germline mutation, heritability estimates based on full genotype data range from around 10% to 20%, and increase with decreasing MAF threshold, from MAF 5% to 0.03%, by a factor of two or three depending on estimation method. This is consistent with the expectation that as more genetic variants are included, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by them increases.</p><p id="P14">The picture is less clear for maternally phased DNMs, where most of the estimated heritability values are not significantly different from zero, and the HYBRID estimates for MAF thresholds 0.01 and 0.05 did not converge. The two exceptions, both at MAF threshold 0.03%, indicate a much lower heritability than the corresponding values for paternal mutation.</p><p id="P15">As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, we also estimated our statistical power to detect a non-zero heritability by the GCTA method. We estimated a power of more than 80% in case of paternal DNMs, but considerably less for maternal DNMs. This is likely due to the lower number of maternally phased DNMs in the analysis cohort (47,203 maternal compared to 163,715 paternal DNMs). Hence, we conclude that there is good evidence for a non-zero heritability of paternal de novo germline mutation in this cohort, with values ranging from 10-20% depending on estimation method and variants included. On the other hand, the impact of genetic influence on maternal DNM is far less clear.</p><p id="P16">In order to explore potential sources of observed heritability, we then investigated the contribution to heritability of variation in genes that are associated, via gene expression, with particular tissues (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4">Methods</xref>). The results of this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>) suggest that heritability is particularly associated with variation in genes expressed in gonadal tissues (testis and vagina) compared to other tissues, but also nearby tissues such as cervix, prostate, bladder and suprapubic skin. In particular, SNP heritabilities in testis are enriched for both paternal and maternally derived DNMs, although we note that in general the number of maternal DNMs in a given category is substantially smaller, with correspondingly reduced power to discern enrichment.</p><p id="P17">To further investigate potential genetic factors mediated by biological processes in the germline, we performed a similar analysis partitioning heritability by gene clusters defined on the basis of expression in germline cells from adult testis samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Our analysis revealed variable contributions to heritability from genes whose expression profiles were associated with different processes and cell states during spermatogenesis. The highest contribution came from variation in genes associated with undifferentiated spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), compared with other clusters associated with processes such as differentiation, meiosis and spermatid formation. By contrast, one of the lowest contributions to heritability came from genes associated with meiosis, despite this being one of the larger clusters by number of genes.</p><p id="P18">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>, we see the same pattern regardless of the window size used to attribute SNPs to nearby genes, and also after normalising by the total number of SNPs attributed to each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">Genetic factors are known to play a role in somatic mutation, but prior to this study no significant influence had been detected on germline mutation (including an estimate of heritability in a much smaller cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kessler et al., 2020</xref>)). The results presented here demonstrate that, for paternally inherited DNMs at least, genetic factors do affect germline mutation. Indeed, in the cohort studied they make a substantial contribution which is not dissimilar to that for other polygenic traits. However, the magnitude of any heritability estimate depends on the method used, including for example the number of SNPs used and the threshold on their frequency, as well as the genetic architecture of the trait and its interaction with environmental factors in the cohort studied. Of potentially greater interest here therefore is the marked difference in the estimated heritabilities of paternal and maternal DNM counts, which is consistent across multiple alternative methodologies. This presumably reflects physiological and developmental differences between the male and female germlines, and in fact our estimates are consistent with an absence of genetic influence on maternal germline mutation. However, given the lower rate of maternally transmitted DNMs, a larger cohort would be necessary in order to more precisely estimate a heritability for this trait. Similarly, discerning potential genetic influences on other mutational phenotypes such as spectrum, age effect or clustering will be possible in larger study cohorts drawn from this and other populations.</p><p id="P20">The fact that estimated heritability is, as might be expected, relatively enriched in genes associated with gonadal tissues and other tissues proximal to the germline, provides confidence in the detected signal of heritability itself (in the sense that the observed variation is genuinely associated with germline mutation). It also encourages us that partitioning heritability in this cohort by associated tissue or cell type is feasible and potentially informative, for paternal DNMs at least. Our finding that within the male germline there is enrichment in genes associated with the SSC state is consistent with the fact that in males the germline spends the majority of its existence in this state. In particular, based on observed markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Guo et al., 2018</xref>), the SSC category in our analysis includes both active and seemingly quiescent (non-dividing) germline cells. Thus, the genetic factors we identify could be associated with either replicative or non-replicative mutation processes, or a combination of both. It is also notable that a low degree of relative enrichment comes from variation in meiosis-associated genes. Further investigation, again perhaps in larger cohorts, may discern individual genetic factors such as particular genes or pathways.</p><p id="P21">One issue to consider is whether any bias comes from the fact that offspring in the studied cohort are affected by rare genetic disease. For example, a higher mean DNM rate in affected cases than in unaffected cases could plausibly arise through correlation with paternal age or the ascertainment constraint of having a DNM with functional consequences (without any direct or causative connection with mutation processes). Therefore, it is conceivable a priori that details of our findings may have been affected. However, the cohort studied here covers over 190 different rare diseases. If most of these are due to causative mutations at specific developmental or other functional loci, we can reasonably expect the cohort to otherwise reflect the wider population in terms of genomic and mutational phenomena, including those investigated here. Therefore, we do not expect our estimates of heritability and its variation between sexes to be substantially biased by this aspect of the data.</p><p id="P22">Much remains unclear about the biological processes affecting germline mutation in humans and other organisms, and the causes of mutation rate change over evolutionary timescales. Recent studies have estimated similar values across multiple mammalian species for certain mutational parameters, such as the paternal age effect and the male/female ratio of mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">de Manuel, Wu and Przeworski, 2022</xref>). Given the variety of environments involved, it may be that these similarities are due to shared genetic or other endogenous factors in mammalian biology, and investigation in a non-human primate cohort, if feasible, would be informative about this. Furthermore, and perhaps more speculatively, the characterisation of genetic factors affecting germline mutation today in humans or other primates raises the possibility of estimating the genetic contribution to mutation rates in ancestral species and populations. Notwithstanding the important (and perhaps unmeasurable) influence of ancestral environments, and the many issues in applying polygenetic scores as cross-cohort predictors of trait values, this might be a way to improve branch length and speciation time estimates within the great apes and other primate groups.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Data</title><p id="P23">Analyses were carried out on a dataset of whole-genome sequences from 13,949 parent-offspring trio samples collected as part of the 100,000 Genomes Project Rare Disease cohort. All sequencing was carried by one sequence provider, using the Illumina platform, to a mean depth of 32x. Thus, little batch effect in 100kGP is expected to exist in our dataset. We started from a dataset of 903,525 de novo single-nucleotide variant calls (dnSNVs) (detailed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kaplanis et al., 2022</xref>)). After filtering to remove 20 hyper-mutated and other outlier individuals by looking at the z-score of DNM counts, this resulted in a dataset comprising 210,918 dnSNVs called in 10,749 trios, which were then phased by parent of origin (using reads and nearby informative heterozygous sites). Insertions and deletions (indels) were excluded from subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Heritability calculation</title><p id="P24">These variants were then used to compute the SNP heritability of offspring DNM count. We standardise the phenotype (phased DNM count) by computing a z-score for each proband, subtracting the mean phased DNM count across probands and then dividing these zero-centred values by the standard deviation of phased DNM count.</p><p id="P25">Some further filtering of genomic variants was applied before inclusion in the heritability calculation. We only included variants that have “PASS” in filters within VCFv4.2 format such as ‘q10’ if quality at this site is below 10 and ‘s50’ if less than 50% of samples have data. If the site passes all filters, “PASS”. Furthermore, in certain analyses we varied the minimum MAF, to select either common variants only (MAF 0.05 or 0.01) or both rare (MAF 0.0003) and common variants. The lowest (rare) MAF threshold was equivalent to the criterion that about 5 people among 8,000 participants have the variant. When more than 10% among all participants had a missing genotype at a certain variant, this variant was filtered out. In addition, we filtered out multi-allelic variants so that we only have a maximum of 2 alleles at a variant.</p><p id="P26">We estimated SNP heritability using several tools, each of which has different modelling assumptions about the random effect sizes of genotypes on the phenotype. Firstly, we used GCTA, which assumes the random contribution of each SNP to the phenotype in GCTA is identical across all SNPs. GCTA requires that all SNPs used be in linkage equilibrium, so we pruned our SNPs (using PLINK variant pruning) according to the criterion that pairs of variants in a window with r<sup>2</sup> correlation greater than the threshold are greedily pruned from the window until no such pairs remain. We set up that the window size is 50 kilobases, step size is 10 variant count, and r<sup>2</sup> threshold is 0.5. Furthermore, GCTA expects no genetic stratification in the population, otherwise maximum likelihood estimates computed by GCTA are biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Krishna Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we mitigated this bias by controlling for genetic population structure in the sampled data as represented in a PCA analysis, as described in the Results. In carrying out this PCA we filtered variants based on coverage, MAF, Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) pruning and other criteria.</p><p id="P27">We also estimated SNP heritability using LDAK, which assumes the random effect size for SNP is dependent on its allele frequency and the LDAK weightings of the SNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). When SNPs are in regions of high LD, their LDAK weightings tend to be lower and the weightings are calculated by adding our genotype data into LDAK. Since LDAK takes LD structure into account by itself, there is no need to prune our dataset before running it. Although both the GCTA and LDAK methods use the individual genotype data for estimation of heritability, the LDAK authors recommend using a hybrid method combining GCTA and LDAK if there is a big difference between the estimates from these two methods.</p><p id="P28">For additional comparison with estimates for other traits, we also estimated SNP heritability using LDSC, a method based on summary-statistics. To generate suitable summary statistics in our dataset, we first performed GWAS for each trait (parental and maternal phased DNM counts) using a linear regression model with parental age as a covariate.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Heritability enrichment</title><p id="P29">Besides the estimation of total SNP heritability with varying MAF thresholds, we also investigated the enrichment of heritability in specific tissues based on gene expression. We obtained genome-wide expression data for multiple tissues from GTEx (‘The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.’, 2013), and compiled a list of tissue-specific genes for each tissue, by computing t-statistics comparing the expression level of genes in a tissue of interest with that in other tissues, using the same approach as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Finucane et al., 2018</xref>). Genes in the top 10% by t-statistic for expression associated with a given tissue were considered to be associated with that tissue. For each tissue we then compiled a set of associated SNPs by including all SNPs within a certain distance of genes associated with that tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). Noting that most of the GWAS-indicated SNPs were located in non-coding regions, we defined windows based on the transcription start site (TSS) rather than exonic region of each gene, and used a 100-kb window size, which was found to yield robust signals of heritability enrichment in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Finucane et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Then for each tissue we estimated the mean per SNP-heritability of DNM count using only the relevant tissue-associated SNPs, in order to compare their relative contributions to heritability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>).</p><p id="P31">We carried out a similar analysis to identify genomic regions associated with biological processes during spermatogenesis. In this case we obtained gene expression data for spermatogonial cells which were classified into seven different clusters representing transcription/developmental states (or groups of states) by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). T-statistics for the association of genes with each cluster were then inferred as above, and a heritability enrichment analysis carried out on nearby SNPs. To further investigate if genes associated with cluster 1, representing the SSC stage of spermatogenesis, make a particular contribution to the heritability, we also compared mean per SNP-heritability between this cluster and another category comprising genes associated to all other clusters.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS158918-supplement-Supplementary_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d34aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S8"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Raheleh Rahbari for useful discussions.
