Despite the biological and neurocognitive importance of oxytocin signaling, methods are lacking to activate oxytocin receptors with high spatiotemporal precision in the brain and peripheral mammalian tissues. Here we developed and validated caged analogs of oxytocin which are functionally inert until cage release is triggered by ultraviolet light. We examined how focal versus global oxytocin application affected oxytocin-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave propagation in mouse mammary tissue. We also validated the application of caged oxytocin in the hippocampus and auditory cortex with electrophysiological recordings <italic>in vitro</italic>, and demonstrated that oxytocin uncaging can accelerate the onset of mouse maternal behavior <italic>in vivo</italic>. Together, these results demonstrate that optopharmacological control of caged peptides is a robust tool with spatiotemporal precision for modulating neuropeptide signaling throughout the brain and body.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Oxytocin is an evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide with essential roles in many tissues across mammalian and many non-mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Jurek &amp; Neumann, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gimpl &amp; Fahrenholz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Theofanopoulou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Froemke &amp; Young, 2021</xref>). In mammals, oxytocin is primarily synthesized in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Althammer &amp; Grinevich, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ludwig &amp; Leng, 2006</xref>). The release of oxytocin into the bloodstream is critical for a number of peripheral physiological processes, including inducing uterine contractions during parturition to facilitate childbirth, and milk ejection during nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Valtcheva &amp; Froemke, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Numan &amp; Young, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Burbach et al., 2006</xref>). Oxytocin is also released throughout the central nervous system and has been shown to facilitate social behaviors such as maternal care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Marlin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Carcea et al., 2021</xref>) and pair bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Keebaugh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Walum &amp; Young, 2018</xref>). Moreover, a deficit in oxytocin signaling is believed to be associated with several disorders, such that oxytocin supplements are being explored as a potential clinical treatment for obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Blevins &amp; Baskin, 2015</xref>), pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mazzuca et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Quintana, &amp; Guastella, 2020</xref>), addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kovács, et al., 1998</xref>), and psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, social anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and post-partum depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wagner &amp; Harony-Nicolas, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bertsch &amp; Herpertz, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Frijling, 2017</xref>). However, the mechanisms of how oxytocin release and oxytocin receptor signaling modulate various cell types, tissues, and brain areas to regulate internal states and social interactions remains unclear. Thus far, the inability to control oxytocin peptide levels with high spatiotemporal precision <italic>in vivo</italic>, have hampered these efforts. For example, stimulating endogenous release or providing systemic oxytocin receptor agonists/antagonists to regulate signaling at specific sites or tissues without off-target effects has been challenging. Furthermore, both peptide and synthetic oxytocin receptor ligands can effectively bind and activate multiple receptor types present on the same cell or nearby cells. Direct peptide application <italic>in vivo</italic> and in brain slices by perfusion, pressure injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Williams et al., 1982</xref>) or iontophoresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Travagli et al., 1995</xref>) produces slow, prolonged and spatially imprecise presentation of the peptide offering poor control over the concentration and gradients of peptide delivered. Therefore, it is imperative to design new tools to enable spatiotemporally precise oxytocin delivery for regulating physiology and behavior.</p><p id="P3">In the periphery, circulating oxytocin is primarily released from the brain into the blood via the posterior pituitary, but there are also other peripheral sources of oxytocin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Paiva et al., 2021</xref>). These sources converge on their peripheral targets via diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chini et al., 2017</xref>). Oxytocin receptor expression is found in both neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in various organs including uterus, ovaries, testis, prostate gland, mammary, kidneys, heart, thymus, adipocytes, pancreas, adrenal glands, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kimura et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gimpl &amp; Fahrenholz, 2001</xref>). Consequently, oxytocin regulates a variety of critical physiological functions ranging from reproduction and lactation to control of body fluid and heart homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kimura et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gimpl &amp; Fahrenholz, 2001</xref>). Despite how fundamental oxytocin is in the periphery, spatiotemporal optogenetic studies of these different systems and processes have been inaccessible. Unlike in the brain, where the optogenetic release of oxytocin is, for the most part, practical (with some limitations and caveats), it is infeasible in the periphery. This is partly due at least to the lack of known oxytocin projections into peripheral tissues beyond the spinal cord and a lack of means to activate them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Eliava et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In the brain, previous studies of endogenous oxytocin release <italic>in vivo</italic> (e.g., through chemogenetic or optogenetic activation of hypothalamic oxytocin neurons) have provided essential information on the modulation of social behavior, mainly in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Scott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Knobloch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Marlin et al., 2015</xref>). However, many hypothalamic cell types, including oxytocin neurons, are believed to co-express and release other neurotransmitters and peptides. Oxytocin-releasing neurons have been found to synthesize corticotropin-releasing hormone, cholecystokinin, and enkephalin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Martin &amp; Voigt, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Vanderhaeghen et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Levin and Sawchenko, 1993</xref>), each of which has various functions for regulating physiological states and behavior (and could be released under different physiological conditions). Co-transmission of neuropeptides and small-molecules even by a single neuron can affect microcircuit activity and behavior through multiple contributing mechanisms and over a range of timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Nusbaum et al., 2017</xref>). Also, the spatial extent at which oxytocin signaling can affect a target brain region remains unclear. Oxytocin fibers into different brain areas do not seem to make conventional synapses. Fiber density may be sparse in many regions, and oxytocin can be released from the dendrites of hypothalamic neurons, suggesting that volume transmission must occur at least across some distances and in some regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mitre et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Son et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, there are many examples of projection—receptor mismatch across many brain regions which are mainly modulated by volume transmission and it may be difficult to activate with optogenetic approaches. Thus, compared to classical neurotransmitters, the spatial and functional specificity of oxytocin and other neuropeptides may be limited. Therefore, while genetics-based approaches have been useful for examining peptidergic modulation of neural circuit function, it can be difficult to parse out the contributions of specific co-transmitters from a particular cell population or the action of oxytocin in specific spatial locations or time points. Moreover, these approaches might be difficult to adopt for other species in which genetic manipulation is more challenging.</p><p id="P5">Here we developed optopharmacological compounds, variants of caged oxytocin, to precisely establish how oxytocin release drives receptor signaling in peripheral (in mouse mammary gland) and brain tissue (in mouse hippocampus and cortex) and to ultimately control maternal behavior. Optopharmacology enables a light-meditated selective activation of oxytocin signaling within a defined target region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kramer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hüll et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Paoletti et al. 2019</xref>). This method complements optogenetics and pharmacology by endowing light sensitivity to specific biomolecular targets. It thus provides molecular control of a given system, in this case oxytocin receptor activation and regulation of mammary gland function in the periphery and neuronal activity in the central nervous system. This tool does not require genetic manipulations or viral expression and thus can be used in any organism that expresses the oxytocin receptor. Furthermore, our approach exemplifies that this technique can be generalized to small signaling peptides that target G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the brain and body and would be applicable to both peptide agonists and antagonists for spatiotemporal specificity.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Design and photophysical characterization of caged oxytocin analogs</title><p id="P6">Oxytocin is an ideal candidate for caging because of its small size (nine amino acids) and established role in various biological functions. Photosensitive caging has previously been successfully achieved for other peptides of similar size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Banghart et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Montnach et al. 2022</xref>). To generate oxytocin that is functionally inert until light exposure, we produced analogs where individual amino acids were replaced with photo-caged unnatural amino acid versions of the corresponding residue using solid-phase peptide synthesis. Previous functional studies of oxytocin have shown that the Cys and Tyr residues are important for receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Barberis, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Donaldson et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, the disulfide between the two Cys residues is responsible for the cyclic structure of oxytocin, which is important for the potency and metabolic half-life. Therefore, we hypothesized using photocage moieties on these residues would render oxytocin reversibly inert. Based on these considerations, we designed three caged oxytocin peptide analogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). For the first caged compound (‘cOT1’), we replaced Tyr with ortho-nitrobenzyl-tyrosine. The second analog (‘cOT2’) incorporated a 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl caging group at the N-terminus of Cys<sup>1</sup>. For the third caged oxytocin compound (‘cOT3’), we replaced both cysteines with 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl cysteine to impede cyclization through disulfide formation.</p><p id="P7">To predict if each photocaged oxytocin analog (cOT1, cOT2, and cOT3) would is inert we performed molecular simulations of each compound in comparison to oxytocin bound to the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), PDB: 7RYC using Autodock Vina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-e</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Meyerowitz et al., 2022</xref>). Each docked compound showed significant steric clashes residues within the binding pocket of OXTR and the weakest binding analog was cOT1, and then cOT3, and cOT2 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Indeed, this suggested photocaging oxytocin would modify its binding affinity is due to alterations in the peptide/protein interaction. Furthermore, these results are in agreement with structural studies of oxytocin bound to OXTR. For example, the cryo-EM structure (PDB: 7RYC) shows the tyrosine residue of oxytocin penetrates deeply into the binding pocket of the helical bundle to form strong hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with OXTR residues within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Meyerowitz et al., 2022</xref>). Undoubtedly, adding a bulky caging group (ortho-nitrobenzyl group) with starkly different chemical properties at this position as in the case of cOT1 will diminish its affinity for OXTR.</p><p id="P8">Photolysis of the selected caging groups can produce bioactive uncaged products on a millisecond time scale (Klán et al., 2012). Under optimal conditions, photorelease can proceed with &gt;95% yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Miller et al., 1998</xref>; Klán et al., 2012). We designed these caged oxytocin analogs for photorelease with 365 nm light and confirmed that the ultraviolet (UV) and visible absorption spectra of each analog corresponded to the uncaging wavelength of 365 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,g</xref>). The spectrum of each caged oxytocin analog irradiated with UV light over 30 minutes (365 nm LED, 3 mW) showed a significant change in absorbance corresponding to photo-uncaging and release of oxytocin with UV light while oxytocin remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h-k</xref>). Thus, oxytocin itself is stable towards 365 nm irradiation for durations of at least 30 minutes which is substantially higher than durations of irradiation that would be used in experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> validation of caged oxytocin analogs</title><p id="P9">We next determined if the caged oxytocin analogs cOT1, cOT2, and/or cOT3 are inactive at oxytocin receptors prior to photolysis and then become active after photolysis. We compared the activation of oxytocin receptors after uncaging to of the effects of oxytocin ligand wash-on using an <italic>in vitro</italic> functional calcium flux fluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Oxytocin receptors are believed to primarily couple to Gq/11, mobilizing intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gimpl &amp; Fahrenholz, 2001</xref>). Thus, this assay should be robust for sensing receptor activation. To demonstrate the utility of uncaging of cOT1 in cell culture, we carried out Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of CHO-K1 cells stably expressing oxytocin receptors and loaded the cells with the calcium-sensitive dye FLUO-8. We first treated cells expressing oxytocin receptors with Hanks balanced salt solution (HBBS) buffer and imaged under these control conditions before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, top) and after photolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, bottom) by full-field illumination with 365 nm UV light. We did not observe any change in fluorescence after UV illumination. We then treated these cells with 1 μM of cOT1 and again used full-field illumination with 365 nm UV light, observing a substantial increase in FLUO-8 fluorescence after photolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P10">In total, we carried out <italic>in vitro</italic> functional calcium flux fluorescence assay from CHO-K1 cells stably expressing oxytocin receptors and loaded with the calcium-sensitive dye FLUO-8, that were treated with HBBS buffer, oxytocin (1 μM), or one of the caged oxytocin analogs (cOT1, cOT2, cOT3; 1 μM) before and after photolysis with UV light with an LED (365 nm, 3 mW). Before photolysis, cOT1 and cOT2 demonstrated minimal activation of oxytocin receptors as inferred from calcium imaging, comparable to that measured in HBBS buffer but cOT3 showed significant activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>; HBBS, fluorescence: 14.1±2.0, n=5 cell culture wells; cOT1 LED off, fluorescence: 18.1±1.9, n=5 cell culture wells, p=0.23; cOT2 LED off, fluorescence: 22.8±2.1, n=5 cell culture wells, p=0.16; cOT3 LED off, fluorescence: 40.4±1.9, n=5 cell culture wells, p=0.0008; Student’s two-tailed paired t-test). After photolysis, both cOT1 and cOT2 produced robust calcium signals, similar to that produced by oxytocin itself when compared to HBBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>; HBBS, fluorescence: 14.1±2.0, n=5 cell culture wells; oxytocin, fluorescence: 142.4±1.8, n=5 cell culture wells, p=0.0004; cOT1 LED off, fluorescence: 18.1±1.9, n=5 cell culture wells; cOT1 LED on, fluorescence: 129.7±2.42, n=5 cell culture wells, p=0.0007; cOT2 LED off, fluorescence: 22.8±2.1, n=5 cell culture wells; cOT2 LED on, fluorescence: 121.1±1.4, n=5 cell culture wells, p=0.0008, Student’s two-tailed paired t-test). To compare the photo-release of pure oxytocin from cOT1 and cOT2, we used standard liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and we observed full photo-uncaging of cOT1 after 20 min and ~90% uncaging is observed for cOT2 after 30 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). These experiments confirm that the caged oxytocin analogs we synthesized can effectively photorelease oxytocin peptides. For the remainder of this study, we only used cOT1 because this reagent was the most inert of the caged-oxytocin analogs before photolysis and showed the most robust activation of oxytocin receptors after photolysis.</p><p id="P11">To demonstrate that the effects of cOT1 uncaging are specific for the oxytocin receptor, we performed similar UV photolysis experiments with cOT1 onto CHO-K1 cells expressing oxytocin receptors, and included the specific oxytocin receptor antagonist OTA in the bath. When inhibiting OXTR with OTA, cOT1 neither activates OXTR cells before or after photolysis, thus demonstrating the uncaging of oxytocin (cOT1) is specific to OXTR binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, for 1 μM OTA p=0.17, 10 μM OTA p=0.28). Furthermore, uncaging cOT1 in the presence of VA1 vasopressin receptor expressing cells shows less activation in comparison to uncaging cOT1 in the presence of OXTR expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>; OXTR: cOT1 LED off, fluorescence: 22.7±2.8, n=5 cell culture wells; cOT1 LED on, fluorescence: 130.1±2.9, n=5 cell culture wells, p=0.0005; VA1: cOT1 LED off, fluorescence: 19.3±4.5, n=5 cell culture wells; cOT1 LED on, fluorescence: 62.4±4.8, n=5 cell culture wells, p=0.0003; Student’s two-tailed paired t-test), as we would expect from the difference in affinity of oxytocin for the cognate receptor OXTR versus the V1A receptor.</p><p id="P12">To ensure that cOT1 had no detectable antagonism to OXTR in experimental concentration ranges, we carried out the same calcium flux assay described above. Increasing concentrations of cOT1 (0 μM, 0.25 μM, 0.5 μM, 1 μM, 10 μM) were applied in bath to CHO-K1 cells stably expressing oxytocin receptors loaded with the calcium-sensitive dye FLUO-8 and then subsequently treated with 1 μM of oxytocin and no UV light (LED off). Over the entire concentration range, there was no significant change (e.g., reduction) in the calcium signal when compared to cells treated solely with 1 μM oxytocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). However, when cells were treated with both 1 μM oxytocin and 10 μM cOT1 with LED on, there was an expected increase in calcium signal compared to oxytocin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>; 1 μM oxytocin LED off, fluorescence: 143.3.1±4.9, n=5 cell culture wells; 1 μM oxytocin 10 μM cOT1 LED on, fluorescence: 171.2±2.9, n=5 cell culture wells, p=0.0043, Student’s two-tailed paired t-test).

The affinity of cOT1 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.01 μM) is ~280 times less than oxytocin (IC<sub>50</sub> = 7.16 nM). After photolysis, the affinity of cOT1 for OXTR is similar to that of oxytocin (IC<sub>50</sub> = 9.24 nM). These data reveal caging at the Tyr residue of oxytocin has the most robust effect on its binding and activation of OXTR.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Photorelease of oxytocin in mammary tissue</title><p id="P14">Oxytocin is critically important for the milk ejection reflex; knockout mice lacking either oxytocin peptide or oxytocin receptors are unable to expel milk to support their young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Nishimori et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Takayanagi et al., 2005</xref>). With other methods such as systemic release or optogenetic stimulation of the hypothalamus, precise regulation of mammary function can be especially challenging because oxytocin is released into the bloodstream from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Thus, we next sought to demonstrate the utility of caged oxytocin in mammary tissue. During lactation, mammary glands express high levels of oxytocin receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). We performed three-dimensional time-lapse imaging of <italic>ex vivo</italic> mammary tissue from lactating GCaMP6f::K5CreERT2 mice treated with cOT1 and subsequently bathed with oxytocin. With a 405 nm laser, we uncaged a region of interest (ROI) at 100% laser power for 3 seconds at three different time points. Uncaging of cOT1 only occurred in the radius of the ROI, as measured by increases in cytosolic calcium and alveolar movement, but did not occur in cells distal from the ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). However, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Stevenson et al., 2020</xref>), the star-shaped basal epithelial cells robustly respond to oxytocin with an increase in intracellular calcium, followed by cell and alveolar contraction across all cells throughout the sample in a diffusive manner after bath application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). We observed that uncaging on one alveolar cluster typically led to local activation just of that cluster, and did not seem to induce global synchrony of calcium release and contractions throughout adjacent mammary tissue. This implies that global alveolar contraction and milk ejection requires a minimum concentration and more diffuse spatial distribution of oxytocin in the tissue.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Photorelease of oxytocin in neural tissue</title><p id="P15">To validate the ability to uncage cOT1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) to activate OXTR<sup>+</sup> neurons in the brain, we first sought to carry out a functional assay on the depolarizing effect of oxytocin previously identified in OXTR<sup>+</sup> neurons in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Tirko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Liu et al., 2022</xref>) OXTRs are highly expressed in CA2 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mitre et al., 2016</xref>), and their activation drives neuronal depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Tirko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Liu et al., 2022</xref>).

We characterized the photophysical and photochemical properties of each caged oxytocin peptide to ensure successful uncaging with UV light. We compared each caged oxytocin analog using calcium sensitive assays in cell culture as a proxy for the activation of OXTR in the absence and presence of UV light. cOT1 was caged at the Tyr residue hydroxyl group, and we found this compound to be the best performing of the caged oxytocin derivatives, without antagonistic effects on the oxytocin receptor under our experimental conditions. The binding affinity of cOT1 to the oxytocin receptor in the caged form is ~280X less than in the uncaged form, where after photolysis with UV light, its binding affinity for the oxytocin receptor is approximately the same as oxytocin (because the reaction yields native oxytocin). These results point to the Tyr residue of oxytocin as the most effective caging site to attenuate the potency of. In this study, we specifically used the ortho-nitrobenzyl photo labile group to cage cOT1, which has been successfully used in various biological applications, including the photocontrol of proteins such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Miller et al., 1998</xref>), protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Luo et al., 2017</xref>), and has been established as a general tool for turning off and on protein activity (applied to GTPases, kinases, RNA demethylases, caspases and bacterial effector proteins) through caging and decaging actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Other variations of caged tyrosine unnatural amino acids analogs have also been successfully used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Luo et al., 2017</xref>). The design of cOT1 serves as a scaffold for designing and tuning the photoactivation properties of caged oxytocin. For example, the caging group on the Tyr can be replaced with other caging functional groups with distinct chemical and physical properties such as to optimize for faster photolysis or multiphoton uncaging. Together, this study serves as a model for designing photoactivatable derivatives of similar neuropeptides of similar sizes, such as the closely related neuropeptide, vasopressin and can further be applied to endow photocontrol of specific peptidergic agonists and antagonists.</p><p id="P21">Oxytocin signaling is fundamentally important in non-neuronal tissues, most notably the mammary gland where oxytocin receptor activation triggers milk ejection in response to infant suckling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Valtcheva &amp; Froemke, 2019</xref>). Basal epithelial cells respond to oxytocin with increased intracellular calcium, followed by cell and alveolar contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Stevenson et al., 2020</xref>). Both stochastic and coordinated events have been observed in mammary tissue, and mechanisms for cell entrainment and tissue-level synchronization are the topic of ongoing investigations. Caged compounds may be particularly advantageous for deciphering cellular connectivity in the mammary gland by optical spatiotemporal activation, particularly since genetic methods present challenges in this epithelial system. We show that caged oxytocin can be released in thick, lactating mammary tissue with a brief 405 nm pulse, causing local release of oxytocin and alveolar unit contraction. These findings point to the utility of this synthetic compound, both with conventional microscopes and in non-neuronal systems.</p><p id="P22">As the toolbox of optical tools in biology continues to grow, combining these tools becomes an increasingly powerful approach for dissecting information within brain circuits and other organs. Combining these tools will allow for the control and monitoring of more signals simultaneously. For example, a useful feature of using caged oxytocin is that it allows for three-channel (potentially more) multiplexing for imaging studies, as we have shown with the imaging of contracting mammary tissue activated by uncaging oxytocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Specifically, uncaging oxytocin with 405 nm light (or 365 nm), and then online imaging of calcium dynamics using GCaMP6f and cell structural changes using CellTracker Red in the green and red channels correspondingly. This strategy has the potential to be useful in cases where oxytocin can be uncaged and have two different readouts in the green and red channels with a combination of sensors and/or structural markers. Additionally, uncaging oxytocin can be used in parallel with optogenetic stimulation and inhibition because of minimal spectral overlap in the excitation wavelength between the tools. In the oxytocin system, there are several studies that show how oxytocin signaling affects modulates fast neurotransmitter action, for example, oxytocin modulation of dopamine neurons in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Xiao, et al., 2018</xref>), and there is evidence that the oxytocin receptor can form heterocomplexes with other receptors like the dopamine and serotonin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Romero-Fernandez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chruścicka et al., 2021</xref>).

However, it is noteworthy that succeeding in uncaging cOT1 with 405 nm light broadens the access and utility of this tool because most standard microscope setups are equipped with 405 nm lasers. Additionally, this experiment demonstrates the potential for experiments where three wavelengths multiplexing could be useful. Here we uncaged oxytocin with UV light and tracked the cells in the red channel and calcium imaged in the green channel.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> electrophysiology</title><sec id="S19"><title>CA2 Hippocampus</title><p id="P40"><italic>In vitro</italic> recordings were performed in acute slices containing dorsal hippocampus prepared from male and female, 2-5 month old, OXTR-cre::Ai9 mice.

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Tirko et al., 2018</xref>), using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and pCLAMP version 10.7.0.2 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) for data collection. Signals were filtered at 10 kHz and sampled at 20–50 kHz with a Digidata 1440 data acquisition interface. During recordings, patch pipettes with a resistance of 3~5 MΩ were made from borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) with a Sutter Instrument P-97 micropipette puller (Novato, CA) and filled with a solution containing (in mM): 126 K-gluconate, 4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>-GTP, 10 phosphocreatine (pH to 7.2 with KOH).</p><p id="P42">To assess effects of oxytocin, a stable baseline was established for 5 min and 1 μM oxytocin (Tocris) in ACSF was washed on for 30 min. To assess effects of cOT1 uncaging, after baseline stability was achieved in ACSF, 1 μM cOT1 was washed in for another 5-10 min to maintain the stable baseline. Then a CoolLED pe-4000 illumination system was used to generate 365nm of UV light pulsed at 20Hz for 1 to 2 min over the slices through the objective. For further control experiment using OXTR antagonist OTA, OTA was continuously presented before the wash-in of cOT1 to the end of the recording. The whole set of experiments was conducted in dark as much as possible to avoid pre-emptive uncaging due to ambient UV light. Peak depolarization was measured as the mean membrane potential over a 2-minute period of highest membrane depolarization at least 10 minutes after uncaging of cOT1, subtracted from the mean membrane potential before the light stimulation. Input resistance and series resistance were monitored throughout the experiments, and recordings were rejected if series resistance increased to above 25MΩ or more than 20%.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title><p id="P43">Experiments were not performed blindly. In all cases, four or more animals with both sexes were used for each parameter collected and were pooled for analysis. Each recorded neuron came from one brain slice of one experimental animal. There was no repeated use of any brain slice. Individual sample sizes for slice patch clamp recording (n=number of neurons, included in each figure legend) are reported separately for each experiment. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9. Statistical comparisons before and after the uncaging of cOT1 were made using paired two-tailed Student’s t-test. Statistical comparisons for different groups were made using one-way or two-way ANOVA and post hoc Turkey’s test. Each statistical method is clearly stated in the result section or the figure legends. All statistical tests were two sided.

Following perfusion and decapitation, brains were removed and placed in the cold buffer solution, and slices (250–300 μm thick) were prepared with a vibratome (Leica P-1000). Slices were placed in warm artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, in mM: 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.5 MgSO4, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2.5 CaCl2, and 26 NaHCO3) (33–35 °C) for &lt;30 min, then cooled to room temperature (22–24 °C) for at least 30 min before use.

To assess the effects of oxytocin, a stable baseline was established for 3–10 min, and 1 μM oxytocin (Tocris, United Kingdom) in ACSF was washed on for 10–15 min, followed by a washout period. To assess the effects of cOT1, after baseline stability was achieved and following 5-10 minutes of cOT1 wash-in, 365 nm light was pulsed at 20-Hz for 1s over the recording chamber using a CoolLED pe-4000 illumination system. The peptide (cOT1) was pre-emptively kept in the dark as much as possible to avoid uncaging due to ambient UV light. Peak depolarization was measured as the mean membrane potential over the 2-minute period of highest membrane depolarization at least 10 minutes after wash-in of cOT1, subtracted from the mean membrane potential during the 2 minutes of the baseline period immediately before initiation of drug wash-in.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P47">Current clamp recordings were analyzed offline using Clampfit 10.7 (Molecular Devices, San Diego, CA).

Before implantation with an optofluidic cannula (details below), naïve virgins were prescreened for pup retrieval (detailed below) to exclude spontaneous retrievers or pup mauling. Typically, &lt;30% of naïve virgins retrieve at least one pup or maul pups during pre-screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Marlin et al. 2015</xref>). Dams were also pre-screened to ensure they retrieved pups before using them in this study.</p><sec id="S24"><title>Optofluidic cannula implantation</title><p id="P49">In brief, a total of 30 female C57BL/6 wild-type mice at 5 weeks of age were anesthetized and implanted with 1 mm Optical fiber Multiple Fluid Injection Cannula system (Doric Lenses, Canada) (part: OmFC_SM3_400/430-0.66_1.0mm_FLT_0.5mm) targeting the auditory cortical region—coordinates: AP: -2.8 mm and ML: -4.35 mm. The implant was attached to the skull with dental cement. Post-surgery the mice were group-housed (cannula was protected using a cap) for 4 - 5 weeks to allow recovery from the surgery. Daily food intake and body weights were monitored. Then each animal was screened again for spontaneous pup retrieval for the baseline experiment. 7 animals were removed during recovery due to bodyweight drop (1 animal) or spontaneous pup retrieval post-surgery (6 animals).</p><p id="P50">Post hoc verification of implantation was conducted after the completion of behavior tests. Animals were sacrificed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde via transcardial perfusion. Then, 100 μm brain slices were cut using a cryostat, and cannula and optic fiber tracks were viewed under a stereo microscope. Confocal images were taken using Zeiss LSM700 or LSM800 (Zeiss, White Plains, NY). Data from mice with incorrect cannula placement were excluded from the data analysis (2 animals).</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Pup retrieval</title><p id="P51">A single test session consists of 10 individual trials of pup retrieval for an individual mouse. The pup retrieval test was performed as pre-screening before surgery, baseline, and post-infusion with caged oxytocin (cOT1). The mice were placed in a behavioral arena (38 × 30 × 15 cm) for prescreening or a customized behavioral arena setup of identical size for the baseline and post-infusion sessions. The mice were first given 20 minutes to acclimate to the behavioral arena before each testing session. Subsequently, at least 4 pups ranging from postnatal day 1–4 was placed in a corner of the arena under nesting material. A single pup was removed from the nest and placed in an opposite corner of the arena for each trial. The experimental mouse was given ten two-minute trials to retrieve the displaced pup back to the nest. If the displaced pup was not retrieved within two minutes, the trial was scored as a failure, and the pup was returned to the nest. If the pup was retrieved back to the nest, the time of retrieval was recorded. This is repeated until ten trials are complete but each time removing a different pup from the nest. We consider reliable retrieval when the mouse successfully retrieves pups in at least two out of ten trials. After ten trials, the pups were returned to their home cage with their dam. An ultrasonic microphone (Avisoft, Germany) was used during all pup retrieval experiments to confirm that the isolated pups vocalized distress calls.</p><p id="P52">After the baseline test for pup retrieval was performed, each virgin mouse was cohoused with a dam and her pups. After 1 hour, the virgin mouse is placed back into the customized behavioral setup equipped for delivering fluid containing cOT1 and 365 nm light for uncaging using both a fluid microinjector (World Precision Instruments, United Kingdom) and an LED (Thor Labs 365 nm LED controlled by High-Power 1-Channel LED Driver with Pulse Modulation, Newton, NJ) respectively. All the female virgin mice were infused with cOT1 (50 μM in saline, 1.5 μl at 1 μl/min). Immediately after the infusion was complete, one group (n = 9) of the mice had the 365 nm LED light turned on (385 nm, 10 mW, 500 ms, 2 Hz) for the photorelease of native oxytocin and the other group (n= 12) had it off. The mice were then untethered from the LED and microinjector and allowed to complete the 20-minute acclimation period to the behavior arena before pup retrieval testing. Then the 10 trials of pup retrieval were carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Marlin et al., 2015</xref>). Pup retrieval was tested after infusion of cOT1 with or without light for the following time points: 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours. Fisher’s two-tailed exact test was used to compare the LED on group (uncaged) versus the LED off group (caged).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S26" sec-type="extended-data"><title>Extended Data</title><fig id="F7" position="anchor"><label>Extended Data Figure 1</label><caption><title>Analysis of Uncaging of cOT1 and cOT2 using LC-MS</title><p id="P53">(<bold>a-b</bold>) Representative set of LC-MS traces for cOT1 (<bold>a</bold>) and cOT2 (<bold>b</bold>) show an increase in oxytocin and simultaneous decrease in photocaged oxytocin upon 365 nm irradiation.
