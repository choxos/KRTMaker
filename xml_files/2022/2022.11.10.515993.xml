In this work, we compare and contrast intranasal (i.n.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administration of a SARS-CoV-2 self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine delivered by a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC). Both i.m. and i.n. vaccines induce potent systemic serum neutralizing antibodies, bone marrow-resident IgG-secreting cells, and robust lymphoid tissue T cell immune responses. The i.n. vaccine additionally induces robust respiratory mucosal immune responses, including SARS-CoV-2-reactive lung-resident memory and lung-homing T cell populations. As a booster following previous i.m. vaccination, the i.n. vaccine also elicits the development of mucosal virus-specific T cells. Both the i.m. and i.n. administered vaccines protect hamsters from infection-associated morbidity upon viral challenge, significantly reducing viral loads and preventing challenged hamsters from transmitting virus to naive cagemates. This saRNA vaccine’s potent systemic immunogenicity, and additional mucosal immunogenicity when delivered i.n., may be key for combating SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has led to the rapid advancement and development of novel vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since their introduction in late 2020, two now FDA-approved mRNA vaccines (Comirnaty and Spikevax) have had a remarkable impact on the trajectory of the pandemic and were developed at unprecedented speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). However, while these vaccines have displayed remarkable efficacy at preventing severe COVID-19 and slowing the worldwide pandemic, the lack of vaccine-induced local immunity in the respiratory tract allows for mild infection of vaccinated individuals, resulting in transmission of the virus, despite prior vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Between lack of vaccine induction of mucosal immunity, newly emerging variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), waning efficacy of currently approved mRNA vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), need for frequent booster doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), vaccine hesitancy in part fueled by a fear of needles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), and limited access to cold chain storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), global susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 remains high. Improved vaccines and associated technologies are therefore necessary to fully combat the epidemic.</p><p id="P3">We previously developed an intramuscularly (i.m.) administered nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC)-delivered self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), which induces both high serum neutralizing responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) and robust activation of systemic CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, responses that may be critical to sustained potent immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). This saRNA-NLC vaccine platform additionally has unique thermostability relative to other mRNA delivery systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), as it may be readily lyophilized and stored at room temperature for months or under refrigeration likely for years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p id="P4">However, we wanted to examine the potential for this vaccine to be administered intranasally (i.n.) to stimulate mucosal immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), which may be key to improving sustained, potent immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens. Unlike i.m. administered vaccines, i.n. vaccines induce critical immune cells within the mucosa and respiratory tract, generating IgA-secreting cells as well as specific effector cell subsets, including tissue-resident memory (T<sub>RM</sub>) T cells that are maintained within the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Such mucosal immunity, mediated by IgA antibodies and lung-resident memory T and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), can prevent early-stage infection and viral replication and shedding, minimizing chances for viral transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Effective i.n. vaccines can also induce cross-reactive antibodies and thus provide expanded protection to multiple strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Intranasal vaccination also presents many other advantages, such as easier needle-free administration, higher patient compliance, simpler pediatric dosing, and easier storage and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), and thus potentially increased vaccine uptake. However, while several i.n. vaccines are currently under development for SARS-CoV-2, most of these rely on older vaccine technologies, i.e., live-attenuated viruses and viral vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), creating a slow pathway to manufacturing, testing, and licensing. Fortunately, bridging RNA vaccine technologies to i.n. delivery is possible, combining the production speed of RNA vaccines with the mucosal immune stimulation of i.n. vaccines.</p><p id="P5">We now demonstrate that both i.n. and i.m. administrations of our saRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strongly induce systemic immunity in preclinical models and prevent viral transmission by vaccinated, virally challenged hamsters. Intranasal dosing uniquely induces strong mucosal T cell immunity, and a heterologous dosing strategy—i.m. prime followed by i.n. boosting—appears to show the greatest potential to maximize mucosal and systemic immunity, leading to prevention of viral transmission. This saRNA-NLC vaccine candidate combines the flexibility and manufacturability of RNA vaccines with potent induction of mucosal immunity using a thermostable formulation that represents a significant new tool for current and future pandemic responses.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Intranasal saRNA-NLC vaccine stimulates robust systemic immune responses</title><p id="P6">For development of an intranasally delivered saRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, we harnessed our previously developed and published long-term thermostable SARS-CoV-2 saRNA-NLC vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). This vaccine, currently in clinical trials using intramuscularly administered material, contains a codon-optimized Wuhan-strain D614G SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence driven by a Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV)-based replicon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). This saRNA is complexed to the exterior of AAHI’s proprietary NLC nanoparticle to create the final vaccine product AAHI-SC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To investigate the ability of the saRNA-NLC vaccine to generate effective immunogenicity when delivered intranasally, 6–8-week-old C57BL/6J mice were given prime and boost vaccine doses of 1, 5, or 10 µg, 3 weeks apart. Control mice were i.n. dosed with 10 µg of a non-immunogenic saRNA-NLC expressing the reporter protein secreted alkaline phosphatase 2 (SEAP). Systemic immunogenicity was compared between groups. Serum, bone marrow, lung, and spleen tissues were harvested after vaccination and tested for humoral (serum IgG and pseudovirus neutralization titers; bone marrow antibody-secreting cells [ASCs] by enzyme-linked immunospot [ELISpot]) and cellular (systemic T cell responses by intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry [ICS-flow] and T cell ELISpot of splenocytes; mucosal T cell responses by ICS-flow of lungs) vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2-directed immune responses.</p><p id="P8">The i.n. saRNA-NLC vaccine elicited high serum spike-specific IgG and SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-strain neutralization titers that would be predicted to be protective (&gt;1000 IC<sub>50</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) at all i.n. doses after prime and boost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Strikingly, at the 5 and10-µg doses, no significant differences were observed between i.n. and i.m. vaccines post-boost, suggesting equivalent induction of serum responses – the key correlates of protection for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) – by the i.n. vaccine. IgG1 and IgG2a serum antibody titers indicated that i.n. vaccination with the saRNA-NLC vaccine maintains the desired Th1 bias seen with our i.m. vaccine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Next, bone marrow-resident ASCs were assessed post-boost by ELISpot to determine if there was establishment of a memory niche for IgG-secreting ASCs. No differences were seen between the i.n. and i.m. vaccines at either the 5- or 10-µg dose i.n. as compared to the 10-µg dose i.m. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), further suggesting effective systemic induction by both delivery routes and suggesting durability of response established by both vaccines.</p><p id="P9">Cell-mediated immunity, particularly T cell immunity, is also thought to be critical to sustained, long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). We therefore investigated systemic cellular responses in i.n. and i.m. vaccinated mouse spleens after boost, both by ELISpot and ICS. Significant populations of IFNγ-secreting T cells were observed in both the i.n. and i.m. dosed (10-µg dose) mouse groups as measured by ELISpot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating effective induction of effector T cells primed to respond to SARS-CoV-2. While the cell numbers were significantly higher in the i.m. dosed group, both groups showed robust T cell responses. IL-5- and IL-17-secreting cells were seen at negligible populations in either group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F-G</xref>), suggesting a strong Th1-biased response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) induced by both the i.n. and i.m. vaccines with very little induction of a potentially harmful Th2 response associated with immunopathology and natural infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).</p><p id="P10">These robust, strongly Th1-skewed systemic CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses were verified using ICS-flow performed on mouse splenocytes collected post-vaccination. After prime-boost immunization, significant populations of spike-reactive polyfunctional (IFNγ<sup>+</sup>, IL-2<sup>+</sup>, and TNFα<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were observed in mice immunized with the 5- and 10-μg i.n. vaccine doses and the 10-μg i.m. dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H, I</xref>), demonstrating strong T cell-mediated responses induced by both i.m. and i.n. vaccines. The spike-reactive polyfunctional T cell populations of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells induced by the i.n. vaccine were lower than those induced by the i.m. vaccine (20-30% reduction between the i.n. and i.m. vaccines at a 10-µg dose, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0191); however, spike-reactive polyfunctional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations were not significantly different between the i.n. and i.m. vaccinated mice, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses induced by the i.n. vaccine were still high, demonstrating effective seeding of systemic T cell immunity across all i.n. and i.m. vaccinated mice. As seen with vaccine-induced antibody titers, a stronger induction of a Th1-specific response (secretion of IFNγ<sup>+</sup>, IL-2<sup>+</sup>, or TNFα<sup>+</sup>) compared to a Th2 response (secretion of IL-5<sup>+</sup> or IL-10<sup>+</sup>) or a Th17 response (secretion of IL-17<sup>+</sup>) occurred within the T cell compartment in both i.n. and i.m. vaccinated mice and across all doses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>), suggesting an overall systemic functional response to the virus. These data therefore indicate that the i.n. saRNA-NLC vaccine elicits humoral and cellular responses at levels predicted to be protective.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Intranasal vaccine administration induces specialized lung T cell populations</title><p id="P11">While both i.m. and i.n. vaccines induce excellent systemic immunity, a key objective to assessing i.n. immunization was to determine whether effective mucosal responses could be generated with i.n. administration of an RNA vaccine. To that end, the lung T cell compartment was analyzed from C57BL/6J mice vaccinated i.n. or i.m. with 10 µg of AAHI-SC2 3 weeks post-prime and 3 weeks post-boost; the lung T cell compartment was analyzed by ICS-flow for the presence of specialized T cell subsets that would indicate the development of long-lasting respiratory-specific immunity.</p><p id="P12">First, we examined post-vaccination lung infiltration of antigen-experienced memory T cells. These T<sub>RM</sub> cells are characterized by CD69 expression as well as CD103 expression in the CD8 compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). The percentage of T<sub>RM</sub> cells were significantly increased in the CD8 compartment with i.n. vaccination (median of CD69<sup>+</sup> cells &gt;20% of CD8<sup>+</sup>) compared to i.m. vaccination (median of CD69<sup>+</sup> cells &lt;10% of CD8<sup>+</sup>) following boost (CD69<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> cells, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0029; CD69<sup>+</sup> CD103<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> cells, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). While the fractions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> cells were equivalent post-prime, lung expansion of T<sub>RM</sub> cells followed boost administration in the i.n. dosed group only, suggesting seeding of these durable populations followed by recall and expansion upon boost dosing.</p><p id="P13">We then assessed CD154<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. CD154 (CD40 ligand [CD40L]) is often expressed on activated T cells and T follicular helper cells and is critical for licensing dendritic cells and engaging with B cells to enhance mucosal antibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Here, we found similar patterns to those seen with T<sub>RM</sub> cells; significantly increased populations of CD154<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in the lungs after i.n. saRNA vaccination post-boost compared to i.m. vaccination (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0029) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Collectively, these data show that i.n. administration appears to elicit an expansion of T<sub>RM</sub> and CD40L<sup>+</sup> activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within the lung. In contrast, i.m. vaccination elicits minimal levels of these cell subsets, suggesting that these specialized respiratory cells are not inducible by i.m. vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Intranasal administration elicits polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2 reactive mucosal T cell responses</title><p id="P14">While the lung T cell subsets were present in large populations post-i.n. administration, we wanted to verify that these cell subsets were functional effector cells and confirm that they responded to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we took mice that received the vector control or had been immunized and boosted with AAHI-SC2 i.m. (10 µg) or i.n. (1 µg, 5 µg, or 10 µg) and used ICS-flow cytometry to determine the frequency of polyfunctional lung IFNγ<sup>+</sup>IL-2<sup>+</sup>TNFα<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells following re-stimulation for 6 hours with overlapping spike peptides. Polyfunctional IFNγ<sup>+</sup>IL-2<sup>+</sup>TNFα<sup>+</sup>-secreting SARS-CoV-2 spike-responsive T cells composed a large fraction of the key T<sub>RM</sub>, CD69<sup>+</sup> population in the 5- and 10-µg i.n. immunized mice (12.8% and 9.11%, respectively), which was significant in the CD69<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> subset of these T<sub>RM</sub> cells compared to the i.m. immunized mice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0005 for the 5-µg dose and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0258 for the 10- µg dose), as well as in the CD69<sup>+</sup> CD103<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> subset (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0181) from 5-µg i.n. immunized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>). Intramuscularly immunized groups again induced consistently negligible levels of polyfunctional CD8<sup>+</sup> cells. We also examined the activated CD154<sup>+</sup>/CD40L<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the lung-homing CD194<sup>+</sup>/CCR4<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells. Similar to the T<sub>RM</sub> cells, CD154<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> cells showed significantly higher percentages of polyfunctionally responding cells at the 5-µg i.n. dose compared to the i.m. dose (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0006) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Likewise, CD194<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells were also induced by the i.n. vaccine at significantly higher percentages at the 5-µg dose (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0441 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0071, respectively) compared to the i.m. vaccine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-E</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Finally, we examined the quality of the response by lung T cells to confirm that i.n. administration elicited Th1-biased lung T cell responses, like what was observed in the spleen. The majority of the responses to both the i.n. and i.m. vaccines were Th1-specific responses, with negligible Th2 and Th17 responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>), similar to what was observed in the spleen. Th2 responses were not significantly different between i.m. vaccinated mice and mice receiving the vaccine via the i.n. route, did not scale with increasing vaccine dose, and were not significantly increased from buffer-only groups. Collectively, these data demonstrate that i.n. administration seeds specialized polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations in the lung – populations which are not elicited following i.m. administration.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Intranasal boosting of previous i.m. vaccination induces both systemic and mucosal immune responses</title><p id="P16">To understand whether i.n. administration could be viable as a boosting strategy for individuals previously vaccinated with an i.m. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we examined mice that were primed with an i.m. vaccine and then boosted with a medium dose (5 µg) either i.m. or i.n. Intranasally boosted mice showed equivalent serum anti-spike IgG levels and similar systemic neutralizing antibody responses to the i.m. boosted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). Within the splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment, i.n. boost immunization induced equivalent or increased spleen-resident polyfunctional T cell responses in CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0454) cells, respectively, compared to an i.m. boost immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C, D</xref>), indicating that an i.n. booster may effectively boost the systemic immunity developed in response to an original i.m. vaccination. With respect to mucosal immunity, the i.n. booster induced a higher but not significant percentage of CD40L<sup>+</sup> (CD154<sup>+</sup>) activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within the lungs than the i.m. booster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Most importantly, the i.n. booster elicited significantly more polyfunctional lung-resident CD8<sup>+</sup> CD69<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> cells (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0236) than the i.m. booster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>), indicating that just boosting with an i.n. dose may be sufficient to elicit the full mucosal immune-stimulating effect of i.n. vaccination. These data are consistent with other i.n. vaccines that suggest i.n. boosting can have enhanced efficacy systemically as compared to i.m. vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). This suggests that an i.n. boost vaccination strategy may be ideal to boost systemic and induce respiratory immunity in previously vaccinated individuals, reflecting the real-world scenario of second-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine rollouts.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>saRNA vaccination protects against SARS-CoV-2-induced disease in hamsters</title><p id="P17">Given our data showing that i.m. prime and i.n. boost with our saRNA-NLC SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicited strong systemic and pulmonary immunity in mice, we hypothesized that vaccination, particularly via the i.m./i.n. route, would be sufficient to protect animals from morbidity due to SARS-CoV-2 infection and would prevent these animals from transmitting the virus to naive bystander animals. To test this hypothesis, we co-housed hamster pairs (1:1) for several weeks to acclimate them to one another. Then, paired animals were separated and one animal in each pair was either sham-vaccinated or vaccinated with 5 µg of the saRNA-NLC SARS-CoV-2 vaccine given either i.m. or i.n (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). After 24 hours, the sham-vaccinated and vaccinated animals were re-paired with their naive (non-vaccinated) cagemates. On day 21, peripheral blood was collected from all animals. On day 28, all pairs of animals were separated, and the sham-vaccinated and vaccinated animals were boosted via the i.m. or i.n. route. All animals were re-paired with their naive cagemates after 24 hours and blood was collected from all animals five days later. As expected, vaccinated hamsters, particularly i.m.-dosed hamsters, demonstrated strong induction of spike-specific serum IgG post-prime, which was absent in the sham-vaccinated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) and in all the naive cagemates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Intranasally primed animals also showed development of significant serum IgG titers, albeit at titers significantly lower than those observed in i.m.-primed animals (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Boosting on day 28 did not result in a significant increase in systemic anti-spike IgG responses in any of the vaccinated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), perhaps due to the still ongoing robust primary response.</p><p id="P18">At 9 days post-boost (day 37), the vaccinated and sham-vaccinated hamsters were separated from their naive cagemates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Some sham-vaccinated hamsters were set aside to serve as uninfected negative controls (sham-vaccinated-uninfected), and all other vaccinated or sham-vaccinated hamsters were experimentally infected with 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> pfu SARS-CoV-2 USA/WA-1 strain delivered intranasally. We then compared morbidity of the vaccinated-infected and sham-vaccinated-infected animals to the sham-vaccinated-uninfected controls. As expected, the sham-vaccinated-uninfected hamsters exhibited a modest increase in weight over the next 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). In contrast, the sham-vaccinated-infected animals had increased morbidity with peak body weight loss of 9-10% by day 6 post-infection and minimal body weight recovery by termination of study. The vaccinated-infected animals (i.n.-i.n., i.m.-i.n., and i.m.-i.m. vaccination), on the other hand, showed minimal weight loss and exhibited rapid recovery in weight by day 3-4 post-infection, with statistically significantly reduced virus infection-induced morbidity when compared to the sham-vaccinated-infected group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0091, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0074, and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0206 for i.n.-i.n., i.m.-i.n., and i.m.-i.m. vaccinated-infected animals, respectively). Body weight loss after challenge did not correlate with systemic anti-spike IgG titers, suggesting that either all three vaccination regimens induced sufficient systemic IgG to protect against SARS-CoV-2-induced weight loss and/or cellular or mucosal responses played a role in protection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To further understand the dynamics of infection and transmission, total and subgenomic viral nucleocapsid (N) RNA was measured in nasal swipes from all infected hamsters across the first 10 days after infection. Total viral N RNA was detected in all infected hamsters as early as 1 hour post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>), which confirmed successful intranasal instillation of SARS-CoV-2. Total viral copies peaked between 24-48 hours in all infected groups. However, total viral N RNA copies were significantly lower in the vaccinated-infected groups compared to the sham-vaccinated-infected group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0003 for i.n.-i.n., i.m.-i.n., and i.m.-i.m., respectively). Next, subgenomic viral N RNA was quantified in the nasal discharge to compare infectious, actively replicating viral load between the sham-vaccinated-infected and vaccinated-infected hamsters. Subgenomic viral N RNA was detected in the nasal swipes from all infected hamsters. However, significantly diminished subgenomic viral N RNA copies were observed in all vaccinated-infected animals relative to the sham-vaccinated-infected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>) (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002, and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 for i.n.-i.n., i.m.-i.n., and i.m.-i.m. vaccine regimens, respectively). Moreover, the peak copies of subgenomic N RNA in nasal swipes were observed within 24 hours of infection in the vaccinated-infected hamsters, while subgenomic N RNA peaked in the sham-vaccinated-infected hamsters between days 1-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). Importantly, the vaccinated-infected hamsters had increased clearance of viral subgenomic N RNA that declined to undetectable levels by day 6 (i.m.-i.n. and i.m.-i.m. groups) and day 8 (i.n.-i.n. group) post-infection. In contrast, the sham-vaccinated-infected control animals had detectable viral subgenomic N RNA until day 10, indicating that vaccination promoted more rapid reduction in replicating virus.</p><p id="P20">The viral RNA measurements from nasal swipes suggested that none of the saRNA-NLC vaccination regimens induced sterilizing immunity following direct intranasal instillation with 1x10<sup>6</sup> pfu of SARS-CoV-2. To address whether the vaccinated animals made an immune response to experimental infection, we measured systemic anti-N IgG antibodies on day 35 post-infection. Indeed, anti-N IgG antibody was detected in the serum from all three groups of vaccinated-infected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>), indicating that the amount of N protein made by the infectious virus was sufficient to elicit a <italic>de novo</italic> N-specific antibody response in these hamsters. However, compared to the sham-vaccinated-infected animals, the amount of anti-N IgG antibody was significantly lower in the i.m.-i.m. and i.m.-i.n. vaccinated-infected hamsters (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0470, respectively) and modestly lower in the i.n.-i.n. vaccinated-infected hamsters, again consistent with a decreased viral load in all vaccinated animals.</p><p id="P21">Next, to assess SARS-CoV-2-induced pulmonary pathology, cross sections of the hamster lungs were examined and scored for histology by a board-certified pathologist. As expected, the sham-vaccinated-infected hamsters had mild to moderate histology scores confirming that the SARS-CoV-2 viral inoculum used to infect the hamsters caused detectable pulmonary immunopathology as late as day 35 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>). These sham-vaccinated-infected hamsters exhibited signs of inflammation that consisted primarily of accumulation of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear infiltrates in the alveolar interstitium and lumen, and adjacent inflammation around blood vessels and bronchioles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A</xref>). Conversely, all three groups of vaccinated-infected hamsters had significantly decreased total histology scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>) and exhibited only sporadic interstitial, perivascular, and peribronchiolar inflammation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6B</xref>) that were comparable to sham-vaccinated-uninfected negative control animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6C</xref>), suggesting that vaccination reduced the extent and severity of lung pathology following infection with a high dose of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, while vaccination did not prevent infection following a robust viral challenge, all vaccine regimens effectively prevented disease-associated morbidity as measured by weight loss, decreased peak viral copies in the nasal discharge, suppression of viral replication, increased viral clearance, and protection against SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>saRNA vaccination prevents viral transmission by virally challenged hamsters</title><p id="P22">Although all three groups of vaccinated-infected hamsters appeared to have been productively infected following experimental SARS-CoV-2 exposure, the amount of subgenomic viral N RNA in the nasal secretions of these hamsters had already declined significantly by day 2 post-infection relative to the sham-vaccinated-infected group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). To assess whether this reduction in infectious viral load was sufficient to prevent transmission, we re-paired the sham-vaccinated-infected and vaccinated-infected hamsters with their naive cagemates on day 2 post-infection (day 39 on timeline in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>; day 0 on timeline in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>) for a period of 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>) and assessed morbidity, nasal swipe viral RNA, serum IgG antibodies, and lung immunopathology in the naturally virally challenged cagemates. As expected, naive cagemates of the sham-vaccinated-infected animals began losing weight within 24 hours of re-pairing, reaching maximum weight loss of 6-7% by day 7 post-re-pairing and exhibiting minimal body weight recovery by termination of study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). In striking contrast, the naive cagemates of the vaccinated-infected hamsters exhibited no body weight loss following re-pairing (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0412, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0470, and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0478 for i.n.-i.n., i.m.-i.n., and i.m.-i.m., respectively).</p><p id="P23">Given the little morbidity observed in the naive cagemates co-housed with the vaccinated infected hamsters, we hypothesized that viral transmission between the vaccinated-infected animals and their naive cagemates would also be diminished. To test this, we measured total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>) and subgenomic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>) viral N RNA in the nasal swipes from the naive cagemates that were paired for 24 hours with the sham-vaccinated-infected and vaccinated-infected groups. Total viral N RNA, which reflects both replicating and non-replicating virus, was present in nasal swipes from all the naive cagemates as early as 24 hours post-re-pairing with infected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Interestingly, the naive cagemates paired with vaccinated-infected hamsters had on average 70-fold lower total viral N RNA at 24 hours post-re-pairing compared to naive hamsters that were co-housed with sham-vaccinated-infected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Hence, immediately following re-pairing, the viral load transmitted to naive cagemates by the vaccinated-infected animals was lower than that transmitted by the sham-vaccinated-infected animals. Importantly, total viral N RNA in nasal secretions from the naive cagemates paired with vaccinated-infected hamsters never surpassed 10<sup>4</sup> copies/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>) and remained just above the limit of detection starting at day 4 post-re-pairing (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 for all groups). Conversely, the naive cagemates paired with sham-vaccinated-infected hamsters had total viral N RNA nasal discharge titers that peaked at 10<sup>7</sup> copies/mL by day 2 post-re-pairing, with minimal clearance by end of study at day 8 post-re-pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Similarly, subgenomic viral N RNA in the nasal discharge, which is indicative of viral replication/infection, was detected at 24 hours post-re-pairing in the naive cagemates co-housed with sham-vaccinated-infected hamsters, peaked at 10<sup>5</sup> copies/mL by day 2-3 post-re-pairing and remained detectable even out to day 8 post-re-pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). This was in striking contrast to the naive cagemates of the vaccinated-infected animals, which had minimal to non-detectable levels of subgenomic viral N RNA in the nasal discharge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>) (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 for all three groups).</p><p id="P24">To assess whether the naive cagemates exposed to the vaccinated-infected animals were protected from active infection, we measured <italic>de novo</italic> anti-N serum IgG responses.

The naive cagemates co-housed with vaccinated-infected hamsters, on the other hand, exhibited negligible responses (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 for all vaccine regimen groups). Indeed, no anti-N IgG response was detected in the naive cagemates of the i.n.-i.n. vaccinated-infected group, and only one naive cagemate from the i.m.-i.n and the i.m.-i.m. vaccinated-infected groups developed a measurable anti-N IgG serum antibody response. Thus, all three vaccine regimens were effective at preventing significant transmission of infectious virus capable of inducing an immune response to naive cagemates.</p><p id="P25">Next, we compared the total histology score of each group of naive cagemates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>).

Naive hamsters co-housed with the vaccinated-infected hamsters, regardless of vaccination regimen, exhibited a significantly decreased histology score (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 for all vaccine regimen groups), with minimal lung pathology that was very similar to that observed in the vaccinated-infected cagemates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6B</xref>). Taken together, the data demonstrate that i.m.-i.m., i.n.-i.n., or i.m.-i.n. dosing of the saRNA-NLC spike vaccine was not only effective in preventing disease-associated morbidity in hamsters but also prevented the vaccinated and subsequently experimentally infected hamsters from transmitting infectious virus to naive cagemates, even at a time when viral load peaked in the nasal discharge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">Here we extend previous work on this saRNA-NLC vaccine platform to show delivery of an intranasal RNA vaccine that induces key respiratory mucosal immune responses.

Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate potential for this product as an i.n. booster of prior i.m. vaccine-induced immunity, a common real-life scenario given the largely COVID-experienced population at this point in the pandemic. This i.n. boost of prior i.m. vaccine-induced immunity significantly boosted systemic responses in addition to inducing mucosal T cell populations not stimulated by i.m. vaccine boosting. Lastly, we demonstrated that both i.n.-i.n., i.m.-i.m., and heterologous i.m.-i.n. vaccination regimens prevented virus-associated morbidity in the hamster model and, most importantly, prevented viral transmission and development of disease in naive cagemates.</p><p id="P27">Now in the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, second-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are urgently needed.

Increasing evidence of reinfection, both post-infection and post-vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), particularly with the Omicron variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), as well as ongoing viral transmission post-vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>), has negatively impacted vaccine credibility.

Increasingly, data are demonstrating that i.m. vaccination alone may not generate potent mucosal immunity that is predicted to be critical for early control and clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). Vaccinees still show evidence of viral RNA in the upper respiratory tract after viral exposure, suggesting ongoing viral replication and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>) even by vaccinated populations. However, breakthrough infection with SARS-CoV-2 allows vaccinees to elicit potent mucosal and nasal immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Thus, improving the induction of nasal and mucosal immunity following vaccination is a critical component for second-generation vaccines to finally achieve durable and flexible protection. However, data also show that generating this immunity is generally not possible via standard i.m. vaccination and likely requires administration of an i.n. vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Intranasal vaccines to date have primarily been developed as live-attenuated flu vaccines, including FluMist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>).

An RNA-based vaccine, in contrast, can be developed more rapidly, and allows cross-over i.m. to i.n. vaccination without developing a new vaccine, allowing for significantly greater utility in pandemic situations.

While CD4 and CD8 T cell populations are now being recognized as a major determinant of disease progression and critical to long-lasting immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), the main vaccines on the market elicit minimal peripheral T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>) and negligible mucosal/respiratory T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). The thermostability and ability to administer i.n. may make this vaccine substantially more desirable in the fight against respiratory viruses. These data demonstrate the potential for this i.n. saRNA-NLC vaccine candidate as an effective booster to pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity, outperforming an i.m. booster, showing that the additive effect of this i.n. vaccine to pre-existing systemic immune responses generated the greatest benefit of all vaccination regimens tested.</p><p id="P31">These data demonstrate that all immunization methods elicited full protection against virus-associated morbidity and viral transmission. While our original hypothesis was that only i.n. vaccination would prevent transmission, we were pleasantly surprised that all three delivery methods prevented transmission. These data bolster the overall strength of the vaccine by demonstrating that i.m. vaccination is protective as well. While it is unclear the specific cellular or serum components mediating this protection in i.m. vaccinated animals, which lack substantial lung T<sub>RM</sub> cell populations and significant mucosal IgA, it may be that sufficiently high systemic IgG so early after boost (9 days post-boost) may circulate and prevent transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>). Future studies examining protection and transmission by vaccinated hamsters at longer timepoints post-vaccination may more fully demonstrate the advantages of i.n. vaccine administration and induction of mucosal immunity on protection and transmission prevention relative to i.m.-i.m. or heterologous i.m.-prime, i.n.-boost vaccine regimens.</p><p id="P32">The i.n. saRNA vaccine may be most effective as a booster dose following an i.m. prime.

In our studies, i.n. boosting outperformed i.m. boosting particularly in mucosal immune measures, hinting at the potential for i.n. dosing to access novel cell compartments and mechanisms. Further work remains to fully optimize the i.n. saRNA vaccine formulation specifically for i.n. administration, potentially including use of nasal spray devices, with the goal of enhancing induction of immunity while avoiding toxicity and reducing heterogeneity in nasal delivery. As a first step in this further development process, this i.n.

While we showed robust systemic and mucosal immunity, protection, and transmission prevention, these data are developed in mice and hamsters, and these responses may not translate fully to primates and humans. Ongoing studies have been designed to investigate this issue. Our data are also limited by the heterogeneity in mouse immune responses when vaccinated i.n., related to a lack of consistent dosing devices for i.n. vaccination. Similarly, because mice are obligate nasal breathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>) and vaccine volumes are difficult to appropriately scale to mouse size, some potential exists for delivery of a fraction of the vaccine volume beyond the nasal tract to the lungs and digestive tract. These issues are likely only resolvable with larger animal models better representing the nasal passages and respiratory tracts of humans, and use of appropriate delivery devices for improvement in vaccine dose delivery. Similarly, some toxicity was noted in the highest i.n. delivered saRNA-NLC vaccine dose (10 µg) in mice, resulting in notable transient mouse weight loss. While these effects are not expected to scale to primates due to non-linear dose scaling of saRNA vaccines relative to animal size and nasal tissue surface area, any potential toxicity noted with an i.n. vaccine will be closely monitored in future studies, and further optimization of the NLC formulation specifically for i.n. delivery will also be conducted to minimize any such effects. Finally, we have been unable to test this saRNA-NLC vaccine candidate head-to-head against any commercially available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for comparison of either vaccine immunogenicity or efficacy due to restrictions on vaccine sale and research use. Should such comparisons become more feasible in the future, we anticipate them to greatly benefit future work, including enabling further exploration of the use of this i.n. saRNA vaccine as an effective mucosal immunity-inducing booster of prior approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.</p><p id="P34">This saRNA-NLC vaccine platform represents a promising technology to combat both the existing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and other respiratory illnesses, such as seasonal and pandemic influenza.

Scoring was performed following a published algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>). Briefly, the airway, alveolar, and vascular pathology in affected areas were assessed and scored on a scale of 0-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>), and then added together to generate a total histopathological score of the whole lung.</p></sec><sec id="S43"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P75">The effect of dosing strategy on CD4 and CD8 cell polyfunctionality was assessed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. The effect of dosing strategy on IgG titer and pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers was assessed in log-transformed data using a mixed-effects model with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. The effect of immunization strategy on IgG titer was assessed on log-transformed data using unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests or two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s or Sidak’s (if any sample data were missing) multiple comparisons test. The effect of immunization strategy on pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers was assessed on log-transformed data using unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests or a mixed-effects model with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. The effect of immunization strategy on polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 cell responses was assessed in untransformed data using unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests or one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. Lung, bone marrow, and splenocyte ELISpot data were analyzed using log-transformed data by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. Hamster body weight data was analyzed using area under the curve measures assessed statistically by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Hamster viral load measures were analyzed using log-transformed area under the curve measures, assessed with one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test. All statistical analyses were conducted using Prism version 9 (GraphPad Software).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS156986-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d24aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Jesse Bloom (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center) for sharing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein plasmids used in pseudovirus production.
