We developed a new bioactive medical device for long bone repair by combining a 3D-printed architectured cylindrical scaffold made of clinical-grade polylactic acid (PLA) with a polyelectrolyte film coating delivering the osteogenic bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2). This film-coated scaffold was used to repair a sheep metatarsal 25-mm long critical-size bone defect. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> biocompatibility of the film-coated PLA material were proved according to ISO standards. Scaffold geometry was found to influence BMP-2 incorporation. Bone regeneration was followed using X-ray scans, μCT scans, and histology. We showed that scaffold internal geometry, notably pore shape, influenced bone regeneration, which was homogenous longitudinally. Scaffolds with cubic pores of ~870 μm and a low BMP-2 dose of ~120 μg/cm<sup>3</sup> induced the best bone regeneration without any adverse effects. The visual score given by clinicians during animal followup was found to be an easy way to predict bone regeneration. This work opens perspectives for a clinical application in personalized bone regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tissue engineering</kwd><kwd>3D printing, medical devices</kwd><kwd>surface coatings</kwd><kwd>bone</kwd><kwd>large animal model</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Critical-size bone defects, which result from high energy traumas, non-unions, tumor resection, infection, etc. are unable to heal by themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Thus, their reconstruction remains a challenge for clinicians and has a high economical and societal cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Currently, autologous bone graft is the gold standard solution to treat such defects, but it is associated with some drawbacks such as limited availability, increase in the number of surgeries required, significant postoperative donor-site morbidity, and inconsistency of repair in large bone defects exceeding typically about 5 cm<sup>3</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. To tackle these drawbacks, synthetic scaffolds, made of a large variety of materials, including ceramics, metals, and polymers, have been developed and used as bone graft substitutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. For efficient bone regeneration, these scaffolds should be biocompatible, preferably biodegradable and bioresorbable with appropriate kinetics, osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and possess sufficient mechanical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. To date, scaffolds are widely used to replace or consolidate bones in maxillofacial surgery, dentistry, spine and orthopedics. However, the use of scaffolds alone is not sufficient to manage challenging clinical situations. The induction of bone regeneration can be achieved by optimizing the properties of the scaffolds, or by including additional functionalities, such as active surface coatings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], delivery of osteoinductive growth factors like bone morphogenetic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], or stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Such strategies are currently being developed in view of clinical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].</p><p id="P5">In terms of regulation, stem cell-based products are categorized as “advanced medicinal therapeutic products”, which requires a strong control of their source, culture conditions prior to implantation, and knowledge of their fate once implanted <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Growth factor- or drug-based products, i.e. without stem cells, need to follow the regulatory path for medicinal products, pharmaceutical products, or combined medical devices, depending on their intended use and whether the scaffold itself is responsible or not of the main action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 7 (BMP-2 and BMP-7) are the most widely used osteoinductive growth factors for bone regeneration and, combined with a collagen sponge or paste, have been clinically approved for the treatment of open fractures of long bones, non-unions, and spinal fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Unfortunately, some controversies arose because supra-physiological doses (several milligrams) of these proteins were used for their application and have resulted in adverse effects in humans. In fact, the use of collagen sponge, which has a poor affinity for BMPs, results in massive protein leakage into the soft tissue followed by systemic diffusion leading to the occurrence of inflammation, osteolysis, bone cyst, and ectopic bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. More recently, new forms of BMP proteins, such as the BV-265 chimera, have been developed and new materials have been engineered to optimize and localize the delivery of BMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Two major strategies are used to optimize their delivery in space and time. First, delivering BMPs via a hydrogel or a paste. In this case, BMPs are usually pre-mixed with the hydrogel or paste, which is then either directly injected into the bone defect, or used to fill a synthetic scaffold with mechanical properties suitable for bone regeneration and the combination is inserted into the bone defect. For instance, BMP-7 was loaded into a collagen carrier that was inserted in the inner duct of a composite synthetic scaffold made of polycaprolactone (PCL) and tricalcium phosphates (β-TCP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Second, BMPs may be incorporated into a surface coating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], which is itself deposited at the surface of a synthetic scaffold. This approach enables to control both the mechanical and physico-chemical properties of the scaffold and the bioactivity of the BMP protein delivered via the surface coating. Being localized at the scaffold surface, the delivery of the protein is spatially controlled. Surface coatings made by layer-by-layer assembly of polyelectrolytes and loaded with BMPs have already been used to control BMP dose at an implant surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. We previously evidenced that a film based on hyaluronic acid (HA) and poly(L-lysine) (PLL) can deliver tunable doses of BMP-2 to repair a critical-size bone defect in a rat femur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Promisingly, such films can be dried and sterilized before implantation, while remaining osteoinductive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Recent developments in material engineering have open new possibilities in custom material design and fabrication. Due to their versatility, additive manufacturing (AM) techniques have recently emerged and can be applied to the fabrication of 3D scaffolds made of metals like titanium, ceramics like β-TCP and hydroxyapatite, or polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. More specifically, fused deposition modeling (FDM) is the most widely used AM technique to fabricate synthetic polymeric scaffolds of any size and shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>].</p><p id="P7">In order to be clinically translated, synthetic grafts must be fabricated using good manufacturing practice-grade raw components and processes. Biocompatibility assays need to be performed <italic>in vitro</italic> according to regulatory standards, notably NF EN ISO 10993, to ensure that the new products meet the safety requirements. Following these <italic>in vitro</italic> normative tests, <italic>in vivo</italic> biocompatibility and biodegradability assays can be performed in small animal models, again following the NF EN ISO 10993 guidelines.</p><p id="P8">Scaffold geometry should be designed to support and guide bone formation within large bone defects. As a result, scaffolds should be porous and provide sufficiently interconnected pore space for fluid flow and cell invasion, particularly before the completion of angiogenesis, in order to promote bone growth inside the pores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. However, the ideal internal architecture features of scaffolds, including the porosity, pore size and shape, pore connectivity, surface area, surface convexities/concavities, etc. have not been evidenced yet, since they depend on several parameters, especially the implantation site. Several studies have focused on the optimization of scaffold geometry but the vast majority of them were conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> and results depended on the experimental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. The difficulty also arises from the interdependency between parameters. For instance, some studies focused on pore size, but tuning this parameter also modifies porosity and scaffold stiffness. Thus, it was difficult to conclude on the independent effect of the studied parameter. The few <italic>in vivo</italic> studies focused mainly on pore size and suggested conflicting results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. These discrepancies may be explained by the differences in animal models, implantation sites, volume of the defect (non-critical versus critical-size), scaffold materials, fabrication methods, and pore shapes. The vast majority of these studies were performed in small animal models (mice, rats, and rabbits). To our knowledge, only one study was conducted in a large animal model, i.e. sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Globally, it is generally agreed that pore size ranging between 300 and 800 μm is preferred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. To our knowledge, the influence of pore shape on bone regeneration has barely been studied <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. These studies showed that orthogonal pores led to more bone formation compared to hexagonal pores and gyroid pores induced more bone formation than orthogonal pores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. The type of cubic unit cell may also influence bone regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>].</p><p id="P9">Preclinical experiments <italic>in vivo</italic> should preferably be performed in large animal models that best mimic human bone physiology. Minipig, dog, and sheep are the most widely used large animal models for bone regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. Minipigs are often used for mandibular bone defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>], while sheep are rather used for orthopedic bone defects, mimicking the localization of tibial fractures. Furthermore, bone metabolism of sheep is similar to that in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. In a recent study, we showed that a 3D-printed polymeric scaffold coated with the (PLL/HA) biomimetic film containing a controlled dose of BMP-2 was effective to repair a very large (12 cm<sup>3</sup>) critical-size bone defect in the mandible of minipigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. The local environment in experimental mandibular bone defects provides a large amount of well-vascularized cortico-cancellous bone with extensive muscle coverage, which creates conditions conducive to BMP-2-induced bone regeneration. The regeneration of long bone segmental defects still need to be proved using such bioactive film-coated synthetic scaffolds.</p><p id="P10">In the present study, we aimed at developing a bioactive synthetic bone graft substitute to repair a critical-size metatarsal bone defect in sheep, which could be subsequently translated to the clinic. To this end, we designed and fabricated 3D-printed scaffolds made of polylactic acid (PLA) and we coated them with an osteoinductive (PLL/HA) film containing a controlled dose of BMP-2. First, the biocompatibility and biodegradability of the film-coated PLA were assessed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in a small animal model according to the regulatory standards for implantable biomaterials. Then, 3D scaffolds with different scaffold internal architectures were designed, fabricated, and assessed for their efficiency to repair a 25 mm-long sheep metatarsal bone defect. Together, our results suggest that biocompatible and biodegradable 3D-printed PLA scaffolds with cubic pores of ~870 μm coated with a biomimetic film and loaded with a controlled BMP-2 dose can repair a sheep metatarsal critical-size bone defect. This opens perspectives for clinical applications of such scaffolds that can be personalized to each patient.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials and chemicals</title><p id="P11">Polyethyleneimine (PEI, Sigma, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France), sodium hyaluronate (HA, Lifecore, Chaska, USA), and poly(L-lysine) (PLL, Sigma) were dissolved respectively to 5 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, and 0.5 mg/mL in a N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N'-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)/NaCl buffer (20 mM HEPES at pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl).

Animals were then anesthetized via an induction cage (5% isoflurane and 2 L/min oxygen), and the anesthesia was maintained using a mask (2.5% isoflurane and 2 L/min oxygen). An ophthalmic gel (Ocrygel, TVM) was used during anesthesia and put in place before animal clipping. The animals were placed in prone position before clipping and disinfecting their back skin using chlorinetetracycline.

While coating PLA with the biomimetic film did not affect cell proliferation, the addition of BMP-2 decreased cell proliferation. This decrease was more marked with the highest BMP-2 dose.

Histomorphometry showed that at D7, PLA + film + BMP-2 LD formed ~1.5 times more bone compared to PLA + film + BMP-2 HD. On the contrary, at D28, 54% more bone was formed with BMP-2 HD compared to BMP-2 LD and at D48, 35% more bone was formed with BMP-2 HD compared to BMP-2 LD. The quantity of new bone formed with BMP-2 LD was not significantly higher at D28 and D48 compared to D7 because of high variability at D7. On the contrary, significantly more bone was formed at D28 and D48 compared to D7 when using BMP-2HD. Interestingly, the quantity of newly formed bone did not increase between D28 and D48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3m</xref>). A two-way ANOVA test was performed and showed that there was no significant difference in the quantity of new bone formed between BMP-2 LD and BMP-2 HD, but there was a significant difference between the quantity of bone formed at D7 and the quantity of bone formed at D28 and D48. The film present at the implant surface at each time point of the experiment was also evaluated: significantly more film was found to be present at D7 compared to D28 and D48, with however no significant difference between the experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><label>3.4</label><title>BMP-2 incorporation in 3D scaffolds</title><p id="P41">The study of BMP-2 loading in the different 3D architectures was conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> in 3D mini-scaffolds made of cgPLA.</p><p id="P42">μCT images of the different 3D mini-scaffolds, along with their surface, porosity, and pore size, are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure SI 3</xref>.

These observations were confirmed by the X-ray scores, which steadily increased with the implantation time in animals implanted with both types of scaffolds containing BMP-2.

This difference between these two observations comes from the more limited field of view provided by 2D X-rays compared with 3D μCT scans.

Additionally, the bone volume was significantly different in Cubic S + BMP-2 compared to Cubic S w/o BMP-2.

In the presence of BMP-2, the newly formed bone was homogeneously distributed within the scaffold at proximal, central and distal locations, for both Cubic S and Gyroid S geometries.

In both groups, some areas of the scaffolds were filled with bone while others remained empty, providing evidence of a nonuniform bone induction. In addition, in most of the explants, the new bone tissue was mostly formed in the outer part or outside of the PLA scaffolds (peripheral area) in the continuity of the cortices, leading to a new connecting cortex when the material implant was not aligned with the native cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8c, 8c’, 8d and 8d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure SI 19c, c’, e, and e’</xref>). At higher magnification, the bone tissue formed around the scaffolds appeared mature (lamellar), homogeneous and dense with thick trabeculae filled with bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8e and 8g</xref>). When found within the scaffold pores, the new bone tissue (NB) displayed either lamellar features with the presence of blood vessels (V) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8f</xref>) or woven bone features with osteocytes, bone-lining cells and osteoblasts depositing osteoid tissue, thus, revealing an active bone formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8i and 8j</xref>). However, we noted that the new bone was scarcely in contact with the PLA material struts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8g, 8i, 8j</xref>). Isolated bone nodules were also observed at a distance from the PLA struts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8g</xref>).

Another finding of this experiment is that Cubic S + BMP-2 scaffolds led to a higher amount of newly formed bone when compared with Gyroid S + BMP-2 scaffolds.

Critical-size bone defects are of particular relevance in view of their close resemblance to clinical situations. Sheep is a particularly good candidate to study bone regeneration in orthopedics because its long bones are of similar size compared to humans and its bone physiology, biomechanics, stem cells, and response to BMP-2 are comparable to that in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>].

Thus, the sheep metatarsal bone appeared as an appropriate model to assess a newly developed bone graft substitute. A similar bone graft substitute made by 3D printing of PLA already proved to be efficient in the more favorable environment which was the minipig mandible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Indeed, though the presence of teeth and proximity with saliva induces unfavorable bacteriological conditions, the minipig mandible displays a large amount of well-vascularized cortico-cancellous bone with extensive muscle coverage, which creates more conducive conditions for bone regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>].

In this study, a BMP-2 dose of ~80 μg/cm<sup>3</sup> of defect was targeted, based on our previous study on minipig mandible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>] where an efficient bone regeneration was found for this dose.

In previous studies in sheep, Yang et al. used a BMP-2 dose of 400 μg/cm<sup>3</sup> of defect to repair a 5 cm-long tibial defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>].

Thus, this low BMP-2 dose delivered via the surface coating of a 3D-printed scaffold enabled an efficient and safe bone regeneration without adverse effects in our model.</p><p id="P63">In our previous study on minipig mandibles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>], we developed a CT-scan score to qualitatively assess bone regeneration over time. Here, a similar score was used to qualitatively assess bone formation based on X-rays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>), the initial score being slightly adapted by considering only one type of bone, without distinction between cortical and cancellous bones, which can barely be distinguished on radiographs. We found that this simple score, which can be given by clinicians, agrees well with the quantitative results obtained by analyzing μCT images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure SI 21</xref>). This finding is of great interest, since it provides an easy and fast qualitative assessment of the amount of newly formed bone. It can be a timesaving predictive tool of the synthetic graft (peut on parler de greffe pour un matériau de synthèse?) success, without the need to wait for μCT images.</p><p id="P64">In this study, we compared the efficiency of different scaffold geometries to repair a critical-size sheep metatarsal bone defect. We found that a cubic geometry with a mean pore size of ~870 μm could efficiently regenerate bone in 5/7 cases. Comparatively, the gyroid geometries tested with mean pore sizes of ~1 mm and ~805 μm did not regenerate bone so consistently (for Gyroid L, 2/2 scaffolds partially bridged the bone defect and for Gyroid S, 3/7 fully bridged the defect, 1/7 partially bridged it, and 3/7 did not bridge it at all). These results are contrasting with those of found by Van Hede et al., who compared cubic (called orthogonal in their study) and gyroid structures in a calvarium rat model with a pore size of 700 μm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. The different results may be explained by the different implantation sites (metatarsal bone vs. calvarium), the animal model used (sheep vs. rat), the scaffold material (polymer vs. ceramics), and the presence or absence of BMP-2 (no BMP-2 was added in Van Hede et al. study). Notably, the implantation in Van Hede et al. was subperiosteal (extremely favorable environment) without any real loss of substance, especially without any critical-size bone defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Another reason may be that Cubic S has more opened pores located at the top and bottom sides of the scaffolds, which were in contact with bone edges, compared to Gyroid S. These opened pores may promote fluid infiltration inside the scaffolds, so that bone precursor cells better penetrate in the core of the scaffold. This was the opposite in the study of Van Hede et al. where gyroid scaffolds had more opened pores in contact with bone compared to scaffolds with orthogonal pores. Besides pore size and shape, another parameter has been identified by researchers as important for bone regeneration: permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>]. The ratio of scaffold surface over volume may also play a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>] since the higher the ratio will be, the more surface will be available for cells to adhere. When considering the volume of the defect, surface/volume ratio was the highest for Cubic S (1.8) followed by Cubic-Gyroid (1.4), Gyroid S (1.35), and Gyroid L (1.1).</p><p id="P65">This study presents some limitations. Indeed, the number of animals used may be considered low. However, it is difficult to propose studies with larger groups sizes when working with large animals and it is desired to limit the number of animals used to respect the 3Rs principle. A priori statistical power analysis showed that for an effect size set to 0.5, α set at 0.05, and desired power set at 0.80, 64 sheep would be needed per group to see a statistical difference, which is inconceivable. If keeping the groups size at 7, the effect size should be &gt; 1.6 in order to reach a power &gt; 0.80. A post-hoc statistical power analysis showed that power was 0.11 when comparing Cubic S + BMP-2 vs. Gyroid S + BMP-2 (effect size of 0.4); 0.92 for Cubic S + BMP-2 vs Cubic S w/o BMP-2 (effect size of 3.2); and 0.28 for Gyroid S + BMP-2 vs Gyroid S w/o BMP-2 (effect size of 1.3). Another limitation is the incomplete loading of implants during the study due to the cast and walking bar maintaining the limb. This incomplete loading may have led to less bone formation since it is known that mechanical constraints are required for efficient bone repair. Furthermore, we noticed that when the diameter of the scaffold was smaller than the diameter of host bone, it led to a misalignment of the scaffold with bone and thus to less bone formation. Ideally, the scaffold length should be perfectly adapted to the bone defect to avoid delayed or poor osseointegration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>]. This highlights the necessity to fabricate personalized scaffolds that would be perfectly adapted to the specific defect in each animal.</p></sec><sec id="S25" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P66">We designed PLA scaffolds with different internal geometries, fabricated them by FDM, and coated them with a biomimetic polyelectrolyte film delivering BMP-2 to repair a critical-size metatarsal bone defect in sheep. Film-coated PLA loaded with BMP-2 was proved to be biocompatible both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. By tuning scaffold internal geometry, we showed that scaffold geometry influenced BMP-2 incorporation and bone regeneration. X-ray scans, μCT scans, and histology proved that scaffolds with cubic pores of ~870 μm loaded with BMP-2 at ~120 μg/cm<sup>3</sup> led to the formation of new bone without any adverse effects. The new bone formed homogeneously in the longitudinal direction of the bone defect. Notably, the BMP-2 dose used here was ~12 fold lower than in the commercially available collagen sponges, and ~1.6 to 4 fold lower than comparative studies in large animals. Furthermore, the clinical score given by clinicians on the X-ray scans acquired during animal follow-up revealed to be an easy predictive tool of the quantitative assessment of bone volume done by μCT scans. This work opens perspectives for a future personalized treatment of large bone defects in patients, by adapting scaffold shape and size for each patient and precisely controlling the BMP-2 dose delivered via the film coating of the 3D scaffold.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>supporting information file</label><media xlink:href="EMS158928-supplement-supporting_information_file.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d3aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR-18-CE17-0016, OBOE), the Fondation “Gueules Cassées” (contract N°33-2022), and by the European commission European Research Council (ERC BIOMIM GA259370, ERC PoC BioactiveCoatings GA692924 and ERC PoC REGENERBONE GA790435).
