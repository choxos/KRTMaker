to identify a suitable agent or agents identified did not translate to clinical use; either because of demonstrated lack of clinical efficacy in trials, inappropriate dose requirements and probably use of inappropriate pre-clinical laboratory surrogates of effectiveness. In this study, we used an innovative algorithm, that incorporates dissemination and implementation considerations, to identify potential drugs for COVID-19 using iterative computational and wet laboratory methods that highlight inhibition of viral induced cytopathic effect (CPE) as a laboratory surrogate of effectiveness. Erythromycin, pyridoxine, folic acid and retapamulin were found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 induced CPE in Vero cells at concentrations that are clinically achievable. Additional studies may be required to further characterize the inhibitions of CPE and the possible mechanisms.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Funding</title><p id="P2">TETFund Covid-19 Special Intervention Research grant(grant number TETFund/DR&amp;D/CE/ SI/COVID-19/UDUS/VOL 1)</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was not a rude surprise because impending pandemics had long been predicted based on scientific data, and preparations existed for early detection and response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. When SARS-CoV-2 finally crossed the species barrier and initiated a rapidly evolving worldwide morbidity and mortality events, even the most advanced health systems in terms of resources and scalability were easily overwhelmed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, the rapid discovery, dissemination and implementation of effective vaccine is estimated to have saved millions of lives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and can largely be traced to the availability of repurposed mRNA technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> initially developed with therapeutics in view, though other vaccine platforms were also successful<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. A major drawback was the lack of equity in vaccine distribution with developed countries acquiring vaccine doses in multiples of their population needs while less developed economies that had neither the resources for competitive purchases nor capacity for unassisted vaccination campaigns were late in vaccine deployment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Efforts at identifying therapeutics for people who do develop COVID-19 have had only limited success with most early enthusiasm at discovery of effective repurposed drugs rapidly and consistently failing randomized clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. With the exception of Dexamethasone and related drugs, the few effective COVID-19 therapeutics like Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) and even less effective Remdesivir (Veklury) were priced out of the reach of most countries, especially developing economies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. It is informative that both Nirmatrelvir and Remdesivir are essentially repurposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Repurposing drugs appears to be an effective approach to rapidly discover therapeutics for emerging infectious diseases. What seems to be faulty is the lack of factoring dissemination and implementation into the initial repurposing inquiry. Such inclusion would involve reflection on potential hindrances to rapid worldwide use of the drug such as cost, inherent toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, worldwide accessibility, ease of scalability and other factors that may together be described as <italic>off-label use likelihood</italic> (e.g., familiarity of clinicians with the drugs, background acceptability by the population, among others). Also, most of the effort at repurposing drugs have been conservative on molecular targets, by frequently restricting screening to inhibition of one target in the virus and /or disease evolution pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. However, lessons from HIV suggests that therapeutics with multiple targets may have higher effectiveness and tremendously lower the probability of resistance by the virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that a new approach to drug repurposing is needed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and that for emerging viral diseases, combination therapy or targets should be prioritized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. This so called one-drug-multiple-target approach is attractive and has been used successfully for non-viral diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Fortunately, current in-silico technology and supporting ecosystem (databases) enable highly cost-effective screening of multiple small molecules for potential activity at multiple targets and greatly reduces wet laboratory transition time and cost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Methods of wet laboratory validation frequently used is inhibition of viral multiplication as measured by reduced viral number on quantitative PCR (qPCR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. However, qPCR is not optimized for rapid high throughput screening of large number of compounds. Furthermore, reduction in viral load may not be predictive of clinical efficacy, especially where the mechanism of viral disease involves cellular cytopathy and a low viral threshold for cytopathy exists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. SARS-CoV-2 induces cellular cytopathy in its target cells and inhibition of cytopathic effect has been employed as a high throughput screening method for drug repurposing against COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">This study was therefore designed as a cost-effective, easy to conduct, high throughput procedure to repurpose drugs using in silico screening against multiple SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19 targets, then select from the hits using criteria that will enhance dissemination and implantation, then conduct wet laboratory validation of the selected hits using inhibition of cytopathic effect (CPE) as a measure of efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S4"><label>2.1</label><title>Theoretical Framework</title><p id="P7">Although orthodox medicines are developed for narrow indications, by their nature, small molecules (drugs) have the capacity for activity at various sites, some of which may have clinical benefits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Drugs with multiple sites of activity are essentially ‘combination therapies’ and therefore may be expected to show a high threshold for viruses to develop resistance. For example, although the rate of resistant mutation is unknown with SARS-CoV-2, it is estimated as 1 in 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> for HIV-1 virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. This suggests that a three-drug combination with different sites of action will acquire 1 in 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> resistant viruses: a number much higher than the possible viral loads in the body. When repurposing drugs for viral infections, it is therefore prudent to screen drugs for potential activity at all known targets (confirmed and putative) in the viral cycle and select those drugs with the highest overall score (negative binding score) across the targets. It is also prudent that the minimum potential sites of activity of a candidate drug for selection will thus be three sites.</p><p id="P8">Although different virus families interact with their host cells in very different ways, they have historically been categorized as either generating abortive, persistent or cytolytic infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. SARS-CoV-2 is known to cause CPE in infected cells and SARS-CoV-2 Spike variant has been shown to have enhanced cytopathic and fusogenic effects in infected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We, therefore, propose that inhibition of virus induced CPE by drugs would be more rapid and predictive of clinical efficacy than inhibition of viral replication, especially where virus induced cellular death is a major pathway of disease, as with COVID-19. This is because viral load suppression alone may not go below the viral threshold for CPE though the suppression may be of multiple folds compared to control. Lack of inhibition of CPE may be one of the reasons many repurposed drugs fail. In addition, inhibition of CPE could be more cost-effective to rapidly screen multiple batches of candidate drugs than qPCR.</p><p id="P9">Also, it has been shown that only about 12.5% of positive research findings are ever disseminated and implemented (DI) and that even these (DI) take over 10 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. To improve this status, a theory-informed approach built into research design has been suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We propose that DI of study results are more successful if designed into the research a priori by involving stakeholders like infectious disease clinicians, policy makers and clinical protocol developers in a needs assessment and other phases of the study: thus, making them, by their participation, aware of the rationale and thoroughness of the primary data generation and its analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.2</label><title>Repurposing Algorithm</title><p id="P10">The repurposing algorithm used in this study includes (i) Needs assessment, NA (ii) Evaluation and Efficacy Studies, EES and (iii) Dissemination and Implementation Steps (DIS), which were iterative with continuous review and enrichment as knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Where required, consensus was reached by modified Delphi protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> involving subject specialists and measurements were made using 4-points Likert’s scale to evoke forced choices and avoid neutrality.</p><sec id="S6"><label>2.2.1</label><title>Needs Assessment</title><p id="P11">This involved developing a drug repurposing group that included those who will be directly involved in early phase laboratory studies (SOB, AY, AAA), later phase wet laboratory validation studies (SOB, AY, AAA, MUI, MBB, AS), clinical pharmacologist (SOB), policy makers(MAP,CLO), public health experts (EI,CLO, KE) and infectious disease clinicians (ZH) some of whom did not start the study but iteratively became involved as COVID-19 scenario evolved and needs became recognized. Consensus were reached using modified Delphi protocols involving relevant experts at each stage, with multiple iterations. The process involved questions and brainstorming on what drugs to select for repurposing efforts that will translate to feasible clinical implementation. In this regard, the opinions of infectious disease clinicians and clinical pharmacologists were considered particularly important because they may be the earliest advocates and champions of off-label use. For example, irrespective of potential for efficacy it will be inconceivable and a herculean task to attempt to repurpose digoxin for a viral infection because clinicians are unlikely to offer digoxin off-label irrespective of potential benefits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.

Drugs that show positive CPE inhibition will then be tested in dose ranges in a separate study; thus, reducing the cost and time of this initial screening. All candidate drugs were screened at the maximum achievable plasma concentration (Cmax) at the recommended dose, as identified in literature. This concentration will also be the maximum tested in subsequent experiments to avoid spurious efficacy at concentrations (in vitro) not achievable in vivo. Such non-physiological result was a major drawback of several Ivermectin repurposing studies. The controls were three, as follows: (1) vehicle control groups (DMSO), (2) a negative control (Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus without any treatment) and (3) a Vero cells growth control. All experiments were run in triplicates.</p><p id="P27">Briefly, we seeded 96-well plates with 6x10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> cells/mL of Vero E6 (200 μL per well), using MEM with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS) without antibiotics. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The following day, the 96 wells plates were viewed under an inverted microscope for confluence of about 50%.</p><p id="P28">Before drug treatment, cell culture supernatant was removed from each well and the wells were washed with 150 μL phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Except for the negative and cell growth control wells where only PBS (50 μL) was added, each well was infected with 50 μL SARS-CoV-2 diluted in PBS at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. All were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with intermittent shaking of the plates at 15 minutes interval to allow for viral adsorption. Thereafter, the supernatant was removed and 200 μL of the respective drugs diluted in MEM having 1% FBS without antibiotics were added to the different treatment groups and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were viewed using an inverted microscope at 48 hours to check for CPE. Two investigators (MBB and AAA) jointly visually assessed the slides and agreed on the percentage inhibition of CPE demonstrated by the test drugs.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="results"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="S17"><label>3.1</label><title>Outcome of Needs Assessment</title><sec id="S18"><label>3.1.1</label><title>Selection criteria and rationale -Drug targets</title><p id="P29">Thirteen drug targets selected after several iterations of modified Delphi protocol, extending to the end of wet laboratory studies, are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.

At each step, scenarios sought to maximize the probability of identifying an effective agent that may easily translate to clinical application through off-label principles while awaiting further studies. Also, the protocol was designed to be easily executed even in LMIC using CPE. These objectives appear successful because erythromycin, pyridoxine and folic acid that this study found effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 induced CPE are almost ubiquitously available in the world and are accepted to be of low safety concerns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, especially when life time dosing is not under consideration. Indeed, Folic acid has previously been suggested to be a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>Pro</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, but these studies stopped at in-silico docking and focused on a single target. In a separate study, folic acid was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 invasion of cells by methylating ACE2 and reducing the transmissibility in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, altogether suggesting a multitarget effect. In COVID-19 patients, serum levels of folic acid have been correlated with clinical outcome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>and high dose folic acid has been suggested as possible add on therapy or supplement for COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Paradoxically folic acid has been used as inert placebo in clinical trials of COVID-19 infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> instead of as an active comparator thereby possibly biasing the result. Supplements, with pyridoxine 4.9 g daily and folic acid 400μg daily, as a component, have been shown to improve COVID-19 clinical outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Erythromycin, the prototype macrolide antibiotic, has not been much studied for SARS-CoV-2 except in computational docking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, which suggested activity against SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>Pro</sup>, but these studies also mainly have single target.</p><p id="P34">Retapamulin is less ubiquitous and will probably be difficult to access in LMIC, nevertheless, it is attractive as a potential hand or surface ointment solution. Ivermectin has previously been established to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication but at physiologically impossible dose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. In this study ivermectin served as a positive control and the result supports that inhibition of CPE is its additional or consequential effect and further reassures that the overall study design could be predictive. Use of qualitative assessment of CPE inhibition is one of the drawbacks of this study but it is conceivably more useful for rapid screening of large library of compounds compared to quantitative methods. Further studies of the drugs identified are needed and may include quantification of CPE inhibition, graded dose response of CPE inhibition, insight into mechanisms of actions and clinical trials. Dose response studies would be particularly important if doses beyond posology are under consideration; a likely situation where current clinical doses are not expected to be effective (like ivermectin) or have been shown not to be effective in previous clinical trials. Meanwhile, we propose that the result of the present study should be sufficient for off-label prescription of erythromycin, pyridoxine, and folic acid in COVID-19, and is particularly important during rapidly evolving, high mortality epidemics.</p><p id="P35">In conclusion, drug repurposing efforts need to be purposeful to optimize yields and avoid identifying drugs whose translation to clinical use may be compromised due to toxicity, availability, or inappropriate dosing requirements. This study has presented results that suggest that erythromycin, pyridoxine, and folic acid could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS159088-supplement-Supplementary_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d2aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was funded by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund(TETFund) under The TETFund Covid-19 Special Intervention Research grant(grant number TETFund/DR&amp;D/CE/SI/COVID-19/UDUS/VOL 1).

Streptomycin and Clindamycin have very favorable scores, but their nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity would reduce their chance of moving forward for repurposing in this schema given that alternatives exist, e.g., Ascorbic acid would be more favored.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS159088-f003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Inhibition by selected drugs of SARS-CoV-2 induced CPE in Vero cells(x10)</title><p><bold>a.</bold> Vero cells</p><p><bold>b.</bold> SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero showing ≥ 80% Cytopathic effects (CPE)</p><p><bold>c.</bold> SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells with 0.1% DMSO showing ≥ 80% CPE</p><p><bold>d.</bold> SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells with 5μM Erythromycin in 0.1% DMSO showing ≥ 80% inhibition of CPE</p><p><bold>e.</bold> SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells with 5 μM Retapamulin in 0.1% DMSO showing ≥ 60% inhibition of CPE.</p><p><bold>f.</bold> SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells with 10 μM Pyridoxine in 0.1% DMSO showing ≥ 60% inhibition of CPE.</p><p><bold>g.</bold> SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells with 5 μM Folic acid in 0.1% DMSO showing ≥ 60% inhibition of CPE</p><p><bold>h.</bold> SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells with 5 μM Ivermectin in 0.1% DMSO showing ≥ 80% inhibition of CPE.</p><p>*All images were taken and prepared by AAA, then reviewed by MBB.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS159088-f004"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="T1" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Drug targets and rationale <xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TFN1">*</xref></title></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left">S/N</th><th valign="top" align="left">Name</th><th valign="top" align="left">PDB-ID</th><th valign="top" align="left">Target classification</th><th valign="top" align="left">Rationale</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left">1</td><td valign="top" align="left">SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent <bold>RNA polymerase</bold> in complex with cofactors</td><td valign="top" align="left"><bold>6M71</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left">Major</td><td valign="top" align="left">A critical enzyme in viral replication and has no redundant pathway.
