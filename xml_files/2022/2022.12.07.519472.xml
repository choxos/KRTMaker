Thus, both prevailing weather and long-term climate change directly impact insects, and their capacity to cope with varying temperatures is critical for species survival and dispersal. Exposure to a high temperature typically reduces individual fitness and ultimately causes death through protein denaturation, disruption of membrane structure, and desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Klockmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2017b</xref>). Furthermore, heat stress may lead to long-term life-history trade-offs in those survivors, restricting future reproductive success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jourdan <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Under current global warming projections, high temperatures and extreme climate events will be more frequently encountered in the future, which may strongly impact biodiversity (IPCC 2021).</p><p id="P8">Although half of known animal species are tropical ectotherms, our knowledge about how well they can withstand high temperatures remains limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">García-Robledo <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sheldon, 2019</xref>). There are many studies on the effects of heat stress on the development of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Piyaphongkul <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), but fewer have focused on tropical insects. Furthermore, the majority of these studies have focussed on adults, thus, much less is known about the impact of thermal stress throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Klockmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2017b</xref>). Tropical insects are predicted to be especially vulnerable to elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Janzen, 1967</xref>). Since environmental temperatures in the tropics are largely stable throughout the year, this could potentially lead to narrow thermal tolerance in tropical species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Polato <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sheldon, 2019</xref>). As such, tropical ectotherms are likely to be living near their upper-temperature limits already and may not be able to cope with a large increase in developmental temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Deutsch <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fischer <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is important to determine the ability of tropical ectotherms to overcome the physiological constraints posed by increasing temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Piyaphongkul <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Thermal stress experienced by juveniles may further affect adults (“carry-over effects”; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Klockmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2017b</xref>). Juveniles surviving heat stress may have reduced fitness as adults, and could influence life-history trade-offs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jourdan <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Under elevated temperatures, there may be a trade-off in phenology and morphology, resulting in shorter development time and emergence at a lower adult body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chown &amp; Gaston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fischer <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Adult body size is often a predictor of lifespan, competitiveness, and reproductive success, possibly impacting population viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fischer <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kingsolver &amp; Huey, 2008</xref>). Therefore, carry-over effects from juvenile heat stress could severely impact adult fitness. Improving our understanding of tropical insect responses to global warming will necessitate considering the effects of heat stress on both survival and other fitness traits throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Klockmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2017b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">This study investigates the effects of increased temperatures on survival and development in a Neotropical butterfly <italic>Heliconius erato demophoon. H. erato</italic> is a pollen-feeding butterfly ranging from southern Texas to northern Paraguay and often inhabits fringes of tropical rainforests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Turner, 1971</xref>). Previous studies have shown plasticity in heat tolerance when butterflies from different elevations were reared in a common-garden environment, with butterflies from different populations showing similar heat tolerances despite strong differences in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Montejo-Kovacevich <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Here we test the vulnerability of each juvenile stage to sustained heat stress by testing the survival and growth rate of eggs, larvae, and pupae.

Approximately 20 <italic>H. e. demophoon</italic> females were allowed to oviposit on a small <italic>P. biflora</italic> plant for a three-hour session on three consecutive days, from which the eggs were collected hourly, and time was noted. Three eggs were placed per small plastic pot. Pots were randomly placed among three treatment groups within 2 hours of laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Climate chambers were heated up to the target temperature before the transfer of pots, and the light: dark, and temperature cycles were 12h:12h across cabinets. The 20-30°C temperature (i.e., 12h of 20°C followed by 12h of 30°C, also referred to as the cold treatment) was used as a control for the comparison, with the same mean temperature as the normal rearing temperature of the stock population, i.e. 25°C. The 23-33°C temperature (also referred to as the intermediate treatment) used is within the range of temperature experienced by <italic>H. e. demophoon</italic> in some locations of its natural habitat, and 26-36°C (also referred to as the hot treatment) represents temperatures only experienced occasionally in forest canopies in the Equator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Montejo-Kovacevich <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) but that could become common in degraded lowland habitats in the tropics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Luber &amp; McGeehin, 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Survival rates and development times for eggs, larvae, and pupae were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

The larvae from each temperature group were transferred into plastic boxes lined with moist tissue and <italic>P. biflora</italic> with three to five larvae per box and survival was checked every two days. Pupation and emergence dates were recorded to obtain larval and pupal development time. Pupae were weighed between 2 and 4 days after pupation. Each pupa was hung in an individual, labelled pot once weighed. After emergence, butterfly wings were carefully removed from the thorax with forceps to best maintain the whole structure. Adult body mass was measured after wing removal, and bodies were stored in pure ethanol at −20°C for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Wing image analysis</title><p id="P15">Wing size was obtained from images of the detached wings of the individuals that reached adulthood (n=78).

Further, females in the intermediate group were significantly heavier than males in the same treatment (t-test between sexes in 23-33°C, t(7) = 3.70, p &lt; 0.01). Thus, the difference in mean body mass between cold and intermediate treatment was driven by heavier females in the intermediate temperatures.

This study revealed that a 3°C temperature increase to 23-33°C led to higher egg mortality and a 6°C temperature increase to 26-36°C led to both higher egg and larval mortality compared to developing at 20-30°C. The few survivors of 26-36°C had a significant decline in adult body mass, growth rate, and wing loading. In contrast, the slight elevation from 20-30°C to 23-33°C increased adult body mass and growth rate, but the fitness consequences of these trait shifts were not assessed.</p><sec id="S12"><title>Temperature affects survival and development</title><p id="P24">In line with earlier studies, we found strong adverse effects of high temperature on both egg-hatching success and larval survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Piyaphongkul <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kingsolver <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Klockmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2017a</xref>). These detrimental effects could be explained by, for instance, denaturation of proteins, disruption of membrane structure, or desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Klose &amp; Robertson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chown &amp; Terblanche, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Potter <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). The <italic>H. e. demophoon</italic> larvae here studied seems to be well equipped to bear temperatures slightly above the normal rearing temperature (25 °C) of the stock, as there were no differences in larval and pupal mortality between the 20-30°C and 23-33°C treatments.</p><p id="P25">Furthermore, it is remarkable that some individuals survived cycles of 12 hours at 36°C in the 26-36C treatment, as individuals of the same species have been shown to get knocked down after only 15.9 minutes when exposed to temperatures between 39 and 41°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Montejo-Kovacevich <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Many studies have looked at the maximum temperature organisms can endure (critical thermal maximum) or perform short exposures to high temperatures and measured the time until they are knocked down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bowler &amp; Terblanche, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ju <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Nandi &amp; Chakraborty, 2015</xref>). Our findings suggest that responses to short exposures may not correlate so well to long exposures. In the wild, short exposures may be relevant to complex habitats such as tropical forests where microclimates are buffering against heat stress, acting as refugia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Scheffers <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). But for other more open or degraded habitats, temperature increases may be more homogenous throughout space and time of the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">De Frenne <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Montejo-Kovacevich <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Therefore, testing different exposure times and temperatures for different habitat types would be interesting for future studies.</p><p id="P26">The ability to survive in hot conditions changes through development, with eggs having the lowest survival, followed by larvae. Different hypotheses as to why heat tolerance varies through development have been proposed. First, individuals with a larger size may have higher survival under heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kingsolver &amp; Huey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Klockmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2017a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Klockmann <italic>et al</italic>. (2017b)</xref>, for example, found that survival was higher for larger caterpillars of <italic>Bicyclus anynana</italic>. Nonetheless, we did not find size-dependency in heat tolerance within larval development as the time of larval death did not differ between the treatment groups. Second, the enhanced survival of larvae compared to eggs may be attributed to behavioural responsiveness. Since desiccation is an important factor contributing to the high mortality under heat stress, the consumption of food by the larvae may allow them to acquire water and energy which are essential for evaporative cooling to prevent desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Klockmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2017a</xref>). Finally, habitat use by wild butterflies may further explain why eggs are sensitive to high temperatures. Eggs may not be under strong selection pressure to evolve heat tolerance in the wild if they inhabit the understory and near the moist leaves, which can provide microclimate buffering against heating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Madigosky, 2004</xref>). The understory of tropical forests inhabited by <italic>Heliconius</italic> in Ecuador has, on average, 1.75°C cooler daily maximum temperature than the sub-canopy (Montejo-Kovacevich <italic>et al</italic>., 2020). The absence of such refugia in our experiment, with only a few leaves and/or stems of the plant in each pot, may have exacerbated the heat stress suffered by the eggs. Overall, our findings are broadly in line with similar experiments on <italic>Bicyclus anynana</italic> butterflies and highlight the importance of preserving habitat complexity for buffering against heat stress in vulnerable and immobile early life stages of tropical ectotherms.</p><p id="P27">Our results showed that adult body mass was higher at 23-33°C relative to the 20-30°C treatment, but lower at 26-36 °C. Since temperature is known to have a major influence on various developmental processes in ectotherms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lailvaux &amp; Irschick, 2007</xref>), higher temperatures may lead to butterflies reaching adulthood faster. In line with previous studies, the overall trend of growth rate is similar to a typical temperature-performance curve, with higher growth rates in intermediate to low temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Huey &amp; Stevenson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lee &amp; Roh, 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Growth is defined as the net energy surplus of absorption and metabolism, and thus, the growth rate could be modelled by the relationship between a series of processes, including metabolism and ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Wood &amp; McDonald, 1996</xref>). As temperature increases, larvae may increase their ingestion rate to compensate for the increased metabolic cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kingsolver <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). The initial increase in ingestion rate may over-compensate the increase in metabolic cost if the food supply is not a limiting factor, giving rise to the boosted growth rate and fitness benefits seen at 23-33°C. However, this ingestion rate will eventually reach a plateau and decline beyond the optimum temperature, which, in this study, is likely to be around 28°C (the mean of 23-33°C) for <italic>H. e. demophoon</italic>. The reasons for the decline in ingestion could be those similar reasons involved in the increased mortality rate under heat stress, eventually leading to smaller adult body mass under high developmental temperatures. Whilst growth rate results match this expected metabolism-ingestion relationship, we did not explicitly measure the rate of metabolism and ingestion for individual caterpillars across the temperature treatments. Since the larvae in our experiments were allowed to feed <italic>ad libitum</italic>, we do not know exactly how the rate of ingestion and metabolism are affected by temperature. Future studies may look into the difference in the amount of feeding and the resulting adult body mass between temperature treatments for empirical validation of the metabolism-ingestion relationship.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Females respond more plastically to temperature</title><p id="P29">Our results found that under mildly elevated temperatures (23-33°C), females had a greater increase in body mass and growth rate than males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B and 3C</xref>). Females often have a higher body mass due to a positive correlation between body size and fecundity, whereas males are typically selected for larger wings, which increases their mating opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Deinert <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gotthard <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Blanckenhorn <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Montejo-Kovacevich <italic>et al</italic>., 2019b</xref>). This can be explained by the fact that as female reproductive success is more closely correlated with adult body mass, female butterflies tend to weigh more than male butterflies under fecundity selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Blanckenhorn <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gotthard, 2008</xref>). Thus, the optimal adult body mass differs between the sexes. Furthermore, there were no developmental time differences between the sexes. This further supports the idea that females are more plastic than males under mildly elevated temperatures, leading to increased body size and growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gotthard <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Wing loading, which is the mass carried per unit area of wing size, was higher in both sexes under elevated temperatures (23-33°C). Greater wing loading may translate into reduced flight performance and dispersal ability as shown in experiments with Monarch butterflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Soule <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), potentially leading to lower fitness and reproductive success despite the enhanced growth rate under warmer temperatures. Similar results of the temperature-wing loading relationship are also found in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fraimout <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). While adult body mass is correlated with higher egg production and fitness, it may not benefit the butterflies in natural environments if their flight ability is hindered by higher wing loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Almbro &amp; Kullberg, 2012</xref>). Butterflies may benefit from lower wing loading to escape predators, locate host plants, or acquire mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Molleman <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). For example, higher temperature reduced host-foraging motivation in parasitoid <italic>Aphidius colemani</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jerbi-Elayed <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) and spring generation of butterflies with more significant wing loading often disperses less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fric &amp; Konvic, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gibbs <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Male butterflies may be under stronger selection to maintain their flight ability for acquiring mates and keeping territories even when the temperature is no longer a limiting factor for body mass. Thus, heavier wing loading due to greater body mass under mildly elevated temperatures may be disadvantageous to male butterflies in the wild.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P31">This study investigated the effect of temperature on the early development of butterflies and the resulting adults, which has been rarely studied in tropical insects. Our findings reveal that long-term sub-lethal heat stress has deleterious effects on both survival and developmental traits in a common neotropical butterfly species. Eggs were found to be most vulnerable to heat stress, followed by larvae. Furthermore, the growth rate followed a typical thermal-performance curve, which showed an optimal growth temperature of 23-33°C. The observed decline in adult development rate and body mass at 26-36°C, which is known to be correlated with lower fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Piyaphongkul <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Klockmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2017b</xref>), is of particular concern for two reasons. First, body mass may be a critical restriction on <italic>H. e. demophoon</italic> heat stress tolerance in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Klockmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">2017b</xref>). Second, because smaller females often produce fewer and/or smaller eggs, this may have a transgenerational effect, resulting in offspring with lower fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kingsolver &amp; Huey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Klockmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2017b</xref>). The faster development rate at 23-33°C may appear to be beneficial for fecundity, but it will restrict the butterfly’s flight capabilities since wing size is less plastic than body mass. Ongoing climate change, rising ambient temperatures, and an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves and drought periods would almost certainly have severe effects on life on Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Klockmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Theng <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). This study emphasises the importance of taking plastic responses of phenotypic traits into account when predicting population viability in response to recent global warming. It calls for incorporating the effects of temperature on developmental time and life-history traits into models forecasting species extinction risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jourdan <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Data set</label><media xlink:href="EMS158362-supplement-Data_set.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d82aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>R.Script</label><media xlink:href="EMS158362-supplement-R_Script.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d82aAdFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all research assistants that have contributed to this study, particularly Glennis Julian.</p><sec id="S16"><title>Funding</title><p>J.M. was funded by a Balfour-Browne summer grant from the Zoology Department, University of Cambridge.
