In the current study, we explored the use of membrane-active peptides as an alternative therapeutic modality to target drug-resistant melanoma cells. We produced slow-cycling and drug-resistant melanoma cells using dabrafenib, a small molecule drug that targets tumor cells with BRAF V600E mutation, and characterised their lipidome and proteome to investigate the role of membrane lipids in acquired drug-resistance. Despite some changes in the lipid composition, tested anti-melanoma membrane-active cyclic peptides (cTI and cGm) killed melanoma cells that are sensitive, tolerant, or resistant to dabrafenib. Importantly, melanoma cells did not develop resistance to cTI or cGm, nor changed their lipid composition with long-term peptide treatment. Therefore, these peptides are well suited as templates to design therapeutic leads to target drug-resistant metastatic melanoma cells and/or as co-treatment with small molecule drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anticancer peptides</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial peptides</kwd><kwd>drug-resistance</kwd><kwd>membrane lipids</kwd><kwd>cell surface charge</kwd><kwd>lipid metabolism</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Melanoma is the deadliest and most aggressive form of skin cancer due to its metastatic and invasive potential. Current standards of care to treat metastatic melanoma patients include immunotherapy with antibodies to inhibit immune check-points (e.g., pembrolizumab and nivolumab) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], and targeted therapy with small molecule drug kinase inhibitors to inhibit MAPK/ERK signalling (e.g., dabrafenib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], which inhibits the mutant BRAF V600E occurring in 40-45% of metastatic melanoma). Melanoma patients that respond to immunotherapy have an increased survival rate; however, half of the patients are intrinsically resistant to immunotherapy. Patients that carry MAPK/ERK mutations respond well to targeted therapy with small molecule BRAF/MEK inhibitors, but continued therapy with these kinase inhibitors converts drug-sensitive into non-responsive tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], which rapidly acquire drug resistance, enabling the disease to progress within six to ten months of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Patients with metastatic melanoma that are resistant to current immunotherapy and targeted therapy require novel therapies with alternative mechanisms of actions.</p><p id="P3">Tumors that become non-responsive to BRAF/MEK inhibitors normally emerge from populations of slow-cycling cells that are tolerant to treatment with kinase inhibitors. The slow-cycling cells that survive drug treatment are referred to as drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], and reflect a non-mutational response to drug exposure. However, continued drug treatment of DTPs leads to a state of phenotypic diversity and further non-reversible permanent resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies that prevent tumour heterogeneity, and eradicate populations of DTPs, are crucial to prevent acquired drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P4">It has been hypothesised that host-defense peptides (HDPs) can bypass established mechanisms of drug resistance and kill drug-tolerant and drug-resistant cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. These peptides selectively target the negatively charged membrane surface of cancerous cells, over neutral cell surfaces of healthy cells, and induce cell death by disruption of cell membranes, or by crossing cell membranes and acting on intracellular targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Owing to their membrane-dependent mechanism of action, it has been hypothesised that HDPs can kill cancer cells that are slow-growing, cancer cells that are refractory to treatment with conventional therapeutics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], and cancer cells that have acquired drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p><p id="P5">In the current study, we investigated changes in the membrane lipids and proteins of melanoma cells, while acquiring drug-resistance to dabrafenib, and when incubated with anti-melanoma peptides inspired by HDP. We selected two cyclic peptides, cyclic tachyplesin I (cTI) and cyclic gomesin (cGm), previously shown to have antimelanoma properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], to investigate whether they can kill drug-tolerant and drug-resistant melanoma cells, and if they can avoid acquired drug resistance. We explored anticancer properties of cTI and cGm against metastatic BRAF V600E melanoma cells, while they acquired resistance to dabrafenib and found that cTI and cGm display similar efficacy against melanoma cells that are drug-naïve, drug-tolerant, or drug-resistant. Melanoma cells treated with cTI over 14 weeks remained peptide-sensitive, suggesting that cancer cells do not develop resistance against these anticancer peptides. Overall, these results demonstrate that membrane-active cyclic peptides inspired by HDPs can target drug-tolerant and drug-resistant melanoma cells, are less likely to induce drug resistance than targeted therapy with kinase inhibitors, and therefore have the potential to be developed as anticancer and/or as adjuvant agents.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Peptide synthesis and characterisation</title><p id="P6">The synthesis, folding and purification of the peptides used in this study were done as previously described for cTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] and cGm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].

Thus, drugs able to kill slow-cycling cells are of utmost importance for preventing cancer progression. Here we induced tolerance to dabrafenib, a small molecule drug that targets tumor cells with BRAF V600E mutation, in metastatic melanoma cell lines WM164 and HT144 to produce slow-cycling and drug-resistant cells, and investigated their lipid composition, the role of lipid metabolism in acquired drug-resistance and their susceptibility to membrane-active peptides cTI and cGm.</p><p id="P59">Alterations in the lipid metabolism and of membrane lipid composition can contribute to acquired drug-resistance from treatment with targeted and conventional therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Here, we confirmed that treatment with dabrafenib induces metabolic reprogramming, as demonstrated by alterations in the lipid composition and differential expression of proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis and FAO.</p><p id="P60">It is not clear whether these changes occurred to protect cancer cells from stress induced by dabrafenib, or were inherited from a pre-existing subpopulation of drug-resistant cancer cells; however, these changes were not observed following sustained treatment with cTI.</p><p id="P61">Lipid composition results demonstrate increased proportion of SM and cholesterol, and/or a decrease in long polyunsaturated lipids in HT144 DTPs; all these changes are likely to increase membrane rigidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>] and reduce cellular uptake of dabrafenib. Changes in membrane fluidity has been reported as a drug-resistance mechanism in similar studies with lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>], breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>], and colorectal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>].</p><p id="P62">Alterations in the membrane of slow-cycling melanoma cells could also affect the activity of membrane-active peptides, such as cTI and cGm; however, here we demonstrated that both peptides rapidly kill drug naïve, slow-cycling and drug-resistant melanoma cells through cell membrane disruption (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S4</xref>). A mechanism dependent on membrane agrees with previous studies showing disruption of negatively charged cell membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Differences in their membrane interaction and/or preference for specific membrane components might explain the higher efficacy of cTI, compared to cGm, and against DTPs, compared to drug-naïve WM164 cells. Although there are some modifications in the total lipid composition of DTPs and PDRCs, we do not know how the lipids are distributed within the lipid bilayer of cell membranes and across organelle membranes, nor how variations in other membrane components exposed at the cell surface (e.g., glusosaminoglycans) might contribute to the potency of these peptides.</p><p id="P63">We monitored the effect of continuous exposure to cTI on the susceptibility of WM164 and HT144 cells to cTI or cGm peptides. The treated cells were equally susceptible to these peptides compared to untreated cells, suggesting that melanoma cells did not acquire resistance to cTI treatment over 100 days. The current study, together with other studies combining treatment of TI peptides with other anticancer drugs (e.g., cisplatin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>], and the absence of observed drug-related adverse effects in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>] and rat models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>] with tachyplesin III, support the notion that stable cTI- and cGm-analogues could find application as additional treatment to small-molecule kinase inhibitors to eradicate the slow-cycling cancer cell population during anticancer treatment, before resistance to the kinase inhibitor can develop, and without inducing resistance themselves.</p><sec id="S28"><title>Significance</title><p id="P64">Acquired drug-resistance is a serious problem for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma; melanoma tumors contain slow-cycling cells that are tolerant to treatment with small molecule drugs targeting the RAF/MEK pathway and are very difficult to eradicate, which lead to acquired drug-resistance. Here, we demonstrate the application of cGm and cTI, stable membrane-active peptides with anti-melanoma properties, as alternative antimelanoma agents. These cyclic peptides kill slow-cycling and drug-resistant melanoma cells via a fast mechanism, and do not induce resistance. Therefore, cyclic peptides are excellent candidates for developing new anticancer therapies with the potential to target slow-cycling cancer cell subpopulations thereby preventing the emergence of resistance mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>SF1</label><media xlink:href="EMS156330-supplement-SF1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d30aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>SF2</label><media xlink:href="EMS156330-supplement-SF2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d30aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>SF3</label><media xlink:href="EMS156330-supplement-SF3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d30aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>supplementary information</label><media xlink:href="EMS156330-supplement-supplementary_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d30aAdEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary</label><media xlink:href="EMS156330-supplement-Supplementary.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d30aAdEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Peptides used in this study were synthesised using facilities from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Innovations in Peptide and Protein Science managed by David Craik group (IMB, UQ, Brisbane, Australia), lipidomics data were acquired at the Central Analytical Research Facility (CARF) at the Queensland University of Technology (Brisbane, Australia) and the authors acknowledge technical support from Berwyck Poad and Pawel Sadowski (CARF, QUT).
