Here, we describe key drivers by combining viral genome sequences with epidemiological data and possible factors of spread into phylodynamic models. WNV in Europe has greater lineage diversity than other regions of the world, suggesting repeated introductions and local amplification. Among the six lineages found in Europe, WNV-2a is predominant, has spread to at least 14 countries and evolved into two major co-circulating clusters (A and B). Both of these seem to originate from regions of Central Europe. Viruses of Cluster A emerged earlier and have spread towards the west of Europe with higher genetic diversity. Amongst multiple drivers, high agriculture activities were associated with both spread direction and velocity. Our study suggests future surveillance activities should be strengthened in Central Europe and Southeast European countries, and enhanced monitoring should be targeted to areas with high agriculture activities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>West Nile virus</kwd><kwd>Europe</kwd><kwd>Phylodynamics</kwd><kwd>Phylogeography</kwd><kwd>Drivers of transmission</kwd><kwd>Disease ecology</kwd><kwd>Molecular epidemiology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Mosquito-borne viruses represent a considerable public health problem worldwide, causing infections in both humans and animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. For the European region, West Nile virus (WNV) is one of the mosquito-borne viruses which can cause severe disease and death in humans and has been increasing in prevalence and geographic range over the past decade <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. WNV belongs to the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) with an enveloped, single-stranded RNA genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The transmission cycle of WNV involves mosquitos (mainly of the <italic>Culex</italic> species) as vectors and birds as amplifying reservoir hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, while humans and other mammals are considered dead-end hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Dead-end hosts are not thought to contribute significantly to transmission in the natural life cycle of the virus. However, for humans, the potential for virus transmission through blood transfusion and organ transplantation has impacted blood and transplantation donor programs, with mandatory screening for regions where exposure to WNV is possible. Currently nine distinct lineages (WNV-1 to WNV-9) of WNV have been identified globally, but little is known about their phenotypic properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. WNV-1 and WNV-2 strains have been identified most frequently in human and animal cases in multiple continents, while strains within WNV-3 to WNV-9 have been detected from mosquitos, birds and equines sporadically in parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> . The dominant lineage in Europe in recent years is WNV-2, although cases of WNV-1 have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">WNV circulation in Europe was first reported in the 1960s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Since 1996, an increasing number of WNV outbreaks in humans and equines were detected in Southeast and Central Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In past decades, WNV outbreaks in humans and animals have been found almost annually in previously non-endemic areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. As surveillance and clinical testing of WNV infections are patchy, it is difficult to compare case notifications across Europe. Nevertheless, considerable differences have been observed between successive years, with for instance particularly severe regional WNV outbreak involving both humans and equids in 2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> detected in Italy, Serbia, and Greece<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Since the beginning of the 2022 transmission season, over 60 outbreaks among birds (mainly in Italy) have been reported and over 800 human cases of WNV infections were reported in seven countries, mainly in Greece and Italy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Unlike in the United States, where the initial WNV (WNV-1) incursion in 1999 led to rapid dispersal of the virus throughout the continent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, patterns of spread have remained somewhat patchy in Europe and involved both WNV-1 and WNV-2. Although there have been studies on the presence and the spread of WNV in different European countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, the overall dispersal history and the important drivers have yet to be determined. Therefore, we explored the possible added value of integrated analysis of different types of publicly available and newly acquired data to understand and potentially predict the trajectory of WNV dispersal across Europe.</p><p id="P5">To infer the virus dispersal history from sequence and other data, it is important to model how viruses are dispersed through space, between species or host-types. For inference of transmission patterns of viruses between discrete locations, a phylogenetic discrete traits analysis can be used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. If the dispersal history of viruses is in a continuous space setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, the coordinates of the ancestral nodes of the tree could be inferred from the sampled locations and two-dimensional diffusion rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The inferred transmission pattern between locations and the spreading rate can be further modelled as functions of a combination of spatial environmental factors, and the contribution of the factors modulating the transmission pattern can be determined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In addition, the importance of factors which may affect the viral effective population size (a measure of the extend of circulation inferred from sequence diversity) over time can be estimated using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) approach based on the temporal data (for example, seasonal or climate change signals)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In addition, increased virus transmission rates and dispersal are signals of changing outbreak potential, although drivers for spread during outbreaks and drivers of incursion to new regions might differ.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we explored the dispersal history of WNV in Europe and the underlying drivers in regions with yearly WNV outbreaks and in regions with sporadic outbreaks. We used phylodynamic models which incorporated: (i) sequencing data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supporting file 1</xref>), (ii) epidemiological data (host species, sampling time and coordinates, as well as travel history of humans if available) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supporting file 1</xref>), (iii) socio-economic data (population and GDP), and (iv) environmental data (climatic, land cover, land use, biodiversity) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supporting file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">3</xref>). Updated sequencing data and epidemiology data were provided by a European collaborative consortium initiated by a group of experts across Europe (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.veo-europe.eu/">https://www.veo-europe.eu/</ext-link>). Specifically, we described the evolution and genetic diversity of WNV in Europe; we then explored the pattern of transmission between and within countries and the possible predictors of spread.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Diverged WNV lineages found in Europe</title><p id="P7">We found a positive correlation between cumulative human cases in EU/EEA reported by ECDC (between 2008-2021, total n=4188) and the number of WNV-2 sequences (between 2004-2021, total n=485) provided from different countries (R= 0.75, p&lt;0.005), despite the varied sequencing capacity among countries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1a</xref>). Among the 22 European countries that have human cases reported, 15 of them have sequences available, including Greece, Italy, Romania, Serbia, Hungary, Spain, Austria, France, Bulgaria, Germany, Netherlands, Slovenia, Portugal, Slovakia and Czechia; sequences are missing from six countries (Croatia, Kosovo, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Cyprus) in the east region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1b</xref>). By comparing the number of sequences available versus the number of human cases reported, the sequencing effort in central and north regions are better than the south and east regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1b</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The maximum likelihood tree of all available WNV genome sequences showed that six lineages (out of the total 9 lineages globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>) were detected in Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Among the six lineages, WNV-2 had the largest number of sequences available, accounting for 82% of all WNV sequences detected in Europe so far, and the widest diffusion, since it has been found in 15 European countries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>). The earliest WNV-2 genome (JX041631.1) was sampled from birds in Eastern Europe (Ukraine) in 1980 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b and 1c</xref>). The dominant sub-lineage 2a (WNV-2a) emerged in 2004 and became the dominant lineage in the past ten years, while the other lineages were rarely seen in the same time period. In addition, there was a separate small sub-lineage 2b (WNV-2b) composed of sequences mainly from Romania, Italy and Russia in 2011-2015, and one detection in Greece in 2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">In comparison, sequences of the second largest lineage (WNV-1) have been found in seven European countries (Austria, Italy, Spain, France, Hungary, Romania and Portugal) since 1971. Most WNV-1 sequences were reported in Italy (72% of total WNV-1 sequences), including all currently available WNV-1 sequences from humans. WNV sequences belonging to lineages 3, 4, 8 and 9 were only sporadically reported and all of them were collected from mosquitos: WNV-3 strains were only found in Czech Republic in 1997 and 2006; WNV- 4 in Romania in 2012-13; WNV-8 were only found in Spain in 2006, while WNV-9 genomes were obtained in Austria in 2013 and Hungary in 2011 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c,1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>). In addition, up to 2021, these lineages (WNV-1, 3, 4, 8 and 9) were only collected from non-human hosts (mainly birds or mosquitos, very few equines), except 9 WNV-1 genomes from humans in Italy between 2009-2013.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Phylodynamics of the predominant WNV-2a</title><p id="P10">Considering the distinct genetic diversity, the number of sequences available, and the dominance of WNV-2 as cause of human disease, the detailed phylodynamic analyses were focused on WNV-2a. These sequences were collected from 14 countries between 2004 to 2021, with most available sequences from Greece (n=64), Italy (n=50), and Germany (n=46) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supporting file 1</xref>). The sequences were collected from 6 host types, with 30% from bird, 30% from mosquito and 40% from humans and mammals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S3 a and b</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The time-scaled phylogenies of WNV-2a in Europe rooted with the first genomes found in Hungary, with the estimated time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) dated back to July 2003, with a 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval between November 2002 and July 2004. The WNV-2a sequences in Europe were split into two distinct sub-clusters (A and B) on the tree composed of full genome sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>), which were previously named the central eastern clade and southeastern clade, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). We could see that the two clusters evolved independently after the incursion from central Europe. Both Cluster A and Cluster B are present in Serbia, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and Italy. Cluster A has also been transmitted to Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, France and Spain; while Cluster B has also been found in Greece, Romania and Bulgaria.</p><p id="P12">Next, we estimated the time of emergence and rate of evolution, as well as the population dynamics and speed of diffusion for the two WNV-2a clusters A and B. WNV of Cluster A emerged in approximately July 2006 (with 95% HPD between January 2005 and March 2007; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). The estimated ancestor country of Cluster A was Austria, with subsequent sequences identified mainly in Germany and Italy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). With a similar evolution rate, Cluster B emerged later in June 2007 (with 95% HPD between March 2006 and December 2008) from Hungary, and most subsequent sequences were collected from Greece (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a and 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We also compared the population dynamics of the two clusters. The effective population size (Ne) of cluster A peaked around 2014, which corresponded to the expansion phase of the epidemic, and then decreased slightly till the second peak at around 2018, which was consistent with a high WNV activity in multiple regions. In comparison, there were less important changes in Ne of Cluster B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). The higher genetic diversity translates into a higher mean Ne of cluster A compared to Cluster B. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d, e</xref>).</p><p id="P14">WNV-2a spread at a high diffusion rate in Europe; the estimations vary between 88 km/y (full genome), 215 km/y (Ns3 gene) and 180 km/y (Ns5 gene), respectively. The dispersal velocity of Cluster B sequences was higher (mean of 249 km/y with 95% HPD between 221 and 278 km/y using Ns3 data) than those of Cluster A (mean of 189 km/y with 95% HPD between 175 and 203km/y using Ns3 data) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f and 3g</xref>). This finding is consistent with the estimation of frequencies of between-countries transmissions: WNV of Cluster B tended to jump more frequently among countries, with an overall number of 39 (95% HPD between 34 and 44)—almost twice more often than Cluster A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Quantified transmission frequencies between European countries and within Greece</title><p id="P15">We quantified frequencies of transmission among the 14 European countries where we have available WNV-2a sequences. We found transmissions were most likely to occur between neighboring countries. In addition, Austria and Hungary (both in Central Europe) had the most linkages with other countries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5 and S6a</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Greece contributed the highest number of WNV-2a sequences in Europe. The time-scaled analysis showed Cluster B WNV has transmitted from central Europe (Hungary) to Greece and kept circulating within Greece almost annually except 2015-2016. In 2017, WNV-2a re-emerged in Greece and caused outbreaks in 2018 and continued to circulate during 2019–2021. Between 2017 and 2021, at least six separate introductions were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>). Three of them were from Greece only and fell in the same group with earlier isolates from Greece back to 2013. The other three groups included sequences from other countries, including Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. Among them, sequences isolated from Hungary from 2018 to 2019 were most closely related to sequences from Greece sampled in the same time periods. This showed the possibility of both re-introduction from other countries and silent circulation maintained within Greece.</p><p id="P17">The discrete trait phylogeographic analysis estimated that approximately 19 transmission events between Greece and neighbouring countries occurred in the past decade. Countries that had the most frequent transmissions to Greece were Hungary (n=8), followed by Serbia (n=5) and Romania (n=4). The transmissions between Hungary and Greece occurred multiple times between 2010 and 2019, while the transmissions between Greece and other countries occurred mainly in 2012-2013. We further estimated the transmissions within Greece; between-region transmissions mainly occurred in north Greece and spread to the east and south regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S6b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Continuous dispersal and impact of environmental factors on viral lineage dispersal</title><p id="P18">We reconstructed the dispersal history of WNV-2a in a continuous space (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) using a continuous phylogenetic model. WNV-2a was estimated to have originated from Central Europe in 2003-2004 (Hungary). One year later, WNV-2a dispersed to the eastern part of Austria and spread to the northwest and western regions (including Slovakia, Serbia, Hungary, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Germany, Netherlands, France and Spain) and southeastern countries (Greece, Romania, Italy, Bulgaria, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia). We could see that WNV emerged and circulated slowly in central Europe at first, and then spread to the southeast regions, and then in a westward direction. The frequency and velocity of diffusion was higher in 2013-14, then slowed down, and speeded up again around 2018 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>). The periods with high diffusion rates were consistent with the timing when the re-emergence of WNV caused major outbreaks as well as the introduction to new geographic regions, e.g., further up north spreading of WNV-2a (Cluster A) towards Germany and the Netherlands.</p><p id="P19">We could also extract the spatio-temporal information embedded in the tree and test the correlation of the phylodynamic dispersion with gridded predictors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supporting file 2</xref>). We tested the impacts on dispersal directions by examining the association between environmental values and tree node locations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">methods</xref>). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Our analysis found that viral lineages tended to spread towards and remained in areas with relatively high density of farming [e.g., cropland, pasture, cultivated and managed vegetation (i.e., cropland and the mixture of cropland and natural vegetation), livestock count (i.e., summed sheep, pig, horse, goat, cattle, and buffalo), and mammal richness (i.e., the number of mammal species for the entire class), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supporting file 2</xref>]. In addition, this analysis underlined that WNV lineages were more likely to spread towards areas with high urbanization status (human population density and high coverage of urban land), high coverage of wetland, as well as areas with bird directive and habitats directive and flyways of Passeriformes and Anseriformes. In addition to these impacts on directionality of spread, we found that the factors associated with high farming density (areas with high coverage of cropland, pasture, livestock count, mammal richness) may accelerate WNV dispersal velocity in Europe with strong support (BF &gt; 20) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Impact of climate/bio-diversity changes on WNV genetic diversity via time</title><p id="P21">As the dynamics of host populations (mosquitos and birds) varies widely in different months or years, it is important to understand how these variables could further affect the WNV genetic diversity or population dynamics. Therefore, we examined the relationship between WNV and climate change coefficients in a log-linear regression model. In this study, the covariates of interest included the time-varying climate related factors (including air temperature, precipitation, wind speed and direction, leaf area index) and the factors related to the trend of population changes of different types of birds in Europe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supporting file 3</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We found a significant positive association between the population history of the WNV-2a and the air temperature in Europe between 2004 and 2021. This concordance is supported by a positive, statistically significant estimate of the coefficient relating the WNV-2a effective population size to air temperature with a posterior mean of 0.18 with 95% HPD (0.08,1.68) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3</xref>). In contrast, wind speed in the eastward direction (rather than the northward direction) at a height of 10 and 100 meters above the surface of the Earth, monthly total precipitation, and the trends of farmland bird populations (the change in the relative abundance of 39 common bird species which are dependent on farmland for feeding and nesting and are not able to thrive in other habitats) were negatively correlated, which was in line with the observed data that mosquitoes were more abundant during the dry months compared to the wet months. In comparison, northward wind speed and the leaf area index of different types of vegetation did not have a significant impact on the genetic diversity changes of WNV-2a viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">In this study, we used spatially explicit phylogeographic and phylodynamic inference to reconstruct the dispersal patterns and dynamics of WNV dominant in Europe in the past twenty years. Using comparative analyses of lineage dispersal statistics, we detected distinct evolutionary histories of lineages WNV-1 and WNV-2 and of sublineages WNV-2a and 2b within the overall spread of WNV. Although the evolution of WNV has previously been examined in individual European countries in different time spans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, this study has employed a phylodynamic model to incorporate sequence data, ecological data and epidemiology data and quantified the overall evolution and dispersal history across Europe. Moreover, the presented analysis provided insight into the potential impact of predictors that influence WNV dispersal and diversity in Europe.</p><p id="P24">We described how WNV is present and spreads across Europe using viral sequence data. WNV in Europe has higher lineage diversity (six different lineages) compared to other regions in the world, e.g., only one lineage (WNV-1) has been found in North America since 1999<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The current predominant WNV-2 (2a) sequences were only found within Europe, indicating that this lineage is more likely to have emerged and circulated within Europe rather than introduced via cross-continent transmissions. However, we cannot rule out the possibilities of repeated introductions, due to under-sampling in non-European regions. The WNV-2a has evolved into 2 clusters (Cluster A and B) and spread in two directions: both originated from central Europe and then spread to the west (Cluster A) and to the south (Cluster B). In recent years, the spread patterns are becoming more complicated. Since 2018, WNV-2a (Cluster A) has unusually spread further north even up to Germany and the Netherlands.</p><p id="P25">We highlighted that areas with high levels of agricultural activities may accelerate WNV dispersal velocity as well as attract the spread direction of WNV in Europe. Meanwhile, WNV is likely to spread to areas with high status of urbanization, in line with higher abundance of <italic>Culex pipens</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S3 d</xref>), which prefers urban environments. A recent study suggested that expansion in urbanization and demography has increased the risk of infectious disease outbreaks especially in the past few decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. While other native and invasive mosquito species (e.g., <italic>Ochlerotatus caspius, Culex modestus, Aedes albopictus, Culex perexiguus</italic>) living in natural and agricultural environments may also play an important role as WNV vectors in Europe, promoting the overwintering of WNV, especially in South and Southeast Europe <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. It is also worth noting that <italic>Culex</italic> hybrids from the <italic>pipiens</italic> and <italic>molestus forms</italic> have been found present in Europe, which can serve as a bridge for WNV between birds and humans, and the proportions of hybrids are differentially affected by temperature, e.g., 17% of Culex are hybrids in Greece, and the figure is 6-15% in the Netherlands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, the different dynamic histories of WNV variants (WNV-2a and WNV-2b) might also be associated with the presence of different mosquito species, which needs further investigation. Our observations suggest that enhancing mosquito control efforts, particularly on livestock farms, may reduce the rate of WNV infections; monitoring farm operations is needed to effectively mitigate mosquito risk and WNV spread. In addition, the observation of the negative correlation between WNV population dynamics and the declines in farmland bird species in Europe in the past two decades, suggests the invasion of WNV might have an impact on the population of common bird species that are dependent on farmland for feeding and nesting. Meanwhile, the loss of habitat may force bird migration, increasing the possibility of WNV spreading to new territories.</p><p id="P26">We found a strong relationship between the presence and movement of birds and WNV spread in Europe. In terms of a natural bird reservoir, WNV sequences were obtained mainly from predatory birds (35%), songbirds (20%) and captive birds (20%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S3</xref>). WNV-2a in Europe spread at a high spread rate (88km/y to 218km/y) and, therefore, is more likely correlated with bird movement than the travel of <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitos (approx.500m to 2Km/y)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. We have found that WNV may be “attracted” to areas with high coverage of bird habitats and to the flyway of <italic>Passeriformes</italic>, particularly bird species such as the Red-backed Shrike (<italic>Lanius collurio</italic>), which travels at a faster rate than WNV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Therefore, our work suggested that although the risk of WNV depends on both the presence of infected birds and the presence of mosquitoes transmitting the disease, bird movements seed the infections into mosquito populations occurring far away and introduce WNV into new regions.</p><p id="P27">In addition, climate changes in the past twenty years predicted viral genetic diversity over time. We found that higher temperature is correlated with high WNV genetic diversity during the entire history of WNV-2a spread in Europe. High temperature may stimulate the geographical expansion of suitable arbovirus regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Other epidemiological modelling studies have found that mild winters and drought have been associated with WNV disease outbreaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. We also found that precipitation and wind speed had negative correlations, which could be explained by WNV infections mostly occurring during the mosquito season in summer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>and also the dry season in most European countries. In addition, we found that the direction of wind also matters, as the impacts on virus genetic diversity is more likely hindered by eastward wind speed rather than northward (in Europe winds coming from the south tend to be warmer). A study also found that wind can affect mosquito host finding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">Wild animals may have played a role in onward WNV transmissions, as antibodies were detected from wild animals, such as red deer, tree squirrels and wild rodents <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. This demonstrates that enhanced surveillance and sequencing efforts in an extended host range are needed to better understand the dispersal of WNV in more diversified environments. In addition, passive surveillance should focus on a range of wild birds especially predator birds and passerine birds. The same applies to human surveillance. Since the early 2000s, WNV circulation has been continuously monitored in some European countries with varying number of human and equine cases. Surveillance of mosquitoes and birds has proven to be useful for early detection of WNV circulation and identification of enzootic areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. The available data do reflect enhanced efforts in some countries. In Greece, active mosquito surveillance, especially in the Central Macedonia Region, is being performed since 2010 when the virus was first identified in the country<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In Italy, a multi-species national surveillance plan was implemented since 2002, following the first WNV outbreak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Arbovirus surveillance in birds has been set up in the Netherlands since 2016 with the number of screened samples increased each year (from n=952 in 2016 to n=7030 in 2021), although no WNV sequence was detected except in 2020<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, which was mostly likely transmitted from Germany, according to our phylogeographic analysis. On the contrary, there is an insufficient amount of WNV genomes from the Central and Southeast Europe (such as Croatia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, Bulgaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, Slovenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> as well as Turkey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>) as well as Southwest (Spain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> and Portugal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>) where WNV have been detected in both humans and animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, surveillance should include more sustained and collaborative efforts to fill in the gaps in WNV genomic sampling throughout Europe.</p><p id="P29">The risks of zoonotic diseases and their spread increase with globalisation, climate change and changes in human behaviour, giving pathogens numerous opportunities to colonise new territories and evolve into new forms. We used virus genomics to investigate the emergence of WNV in Europe, as well as its rapid spread, evolution in a new environment and establishment of endemic transmission. Most importantly, our study suggested targeted regions could deserve further investigation, including areas where WNV-2a was more likely to cluster in (with high urbanization and farming activities, high coverage of wetlands, as well as areas with the presence and movements of migrating and resident birds) and areas with higher farming density tended to accelerate the dispersal of WNV. This analysis could also be done on a more local level, and with information that we have compiled, so that we could predict where WNV would go in the future. Putting it into a larger perspective, our work could be extended to other zoonotic pathogens and guide strategies of enhanced surveillance systems for disease prevention and control.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Virus Isolation, Identification, and Genome Sequencing</title><p id="P30">In this study, we included unpublished WNV-2 genomes collected from Italy (n=8) and the Netherlands (n=6) between 2019 and 2021.

We prepared a list of potential predictors (n=37) which were assigned into five different groups including climatic, land cover, topography, socio-economic and biodiversity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supporting file 2</xref>). The predictors used in this study were adapted from our previous analysis of the drivers of discovery of human infective RNA viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>.

Resolution of predictors ranged from 30” to regional level, and all data were rescaled to 0.25° where necessary. Collection of data on spatial and temporal drivers of WNV dispersal and the related modelling process were performed using the R version 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, 2020). For each of the potential predictors, we assessed the quality of the data sources used in terms of their ability to represent the underlying driver. Specifically, we assessed each driver against six characteristics using the method of Horigan et al. 2022 (paper submitted) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">supporting file 2</xref>). Overall, the data sources were of very good quality, scoring well for accuracy, reliability and availability, including the factors regarding land use which the model output as influential on WNV spread.

Following the methodology described by Dellicour et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>, for each of the environmental factors, we generated three scaled rasters by transforming the original raster cell values with the following formula: vt = 1 + k(vo/vmax), where vt and vo are the transformed and original cell values, respectively, and vmax is the maximum cell value recorded in the raster. Here k (k = 10, 100 and 1000) is a rescaling parameter that tests different strengths of raster cells relative to the conductance (positive correlation) or resistance (negative correlation), with a minimum value set to “1”.

Posterior mean estimates of the viral effective population size based on both sequence data and covariate data are represented by dark blue curves, and the corresponding dark blue polygon reflects the 95% HPD region. Posterior mean estimates of the viral effective population size inferred strictly from sequence data are represented by light blue curves and the corresponding light blue polygon reflects the 95% HPD region. A significant association between the covariate and effective population size is inferred when the 95% HPD interval of the GLM coefficient excludes zero.
