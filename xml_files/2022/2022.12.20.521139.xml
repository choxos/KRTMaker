Identifying and characterizing clinically relevant receptors is of utmost importance. We report here the application of a machine learning approach, utilizing B cell receptor repertoire sequencing data from severely and mildly infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2 compared with uninfected controls. In contrast to previous studies, our approach successfully stratifies non-infected from infected individuals, as well as disease level of severity. The features that drive this classification are based on somatic hypermutation patterns, and point to alterations in the somatic hypermutation process in COVID-19 patients. These features may be used to build and adapt therapeutic strategies to COVID-19, in particular to quantitatively assess potential diagnostic and therapeutic antibodies. These results constitute a proof of concept for future epidemiological challenges.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>BCR</kwd><kwd>AIRR-seq</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>somatic hypermutation</kwd><kwd>B cell</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Background</title><p id="P2">Despite the unprecedented speed of vaccine development against SARS-CoV2, the virus continues to undergo changes that cause repeated waves of COVID-19 morbidity worldwide, with increasing infectivity. Risk factors such as age (&gt;60) and preexisting medical conditions can predict to some extent whether an individual will become severely ill or not, but the prediction is not very accurate. The early phase of infection results in direct tissue damage, followed by a late phase when the infected cells trigger an immune response, by recruitment of immune cells that release cytokines (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]). In severe patients, this may result in a “cytokine storm” and a systemic inflammatory response. Many individuals do not respond well enough to the vaccine, either because of old age or immune impairments. Thus, there is an ongoing search for anti-viral therapies and passive vaccines, as well as research into the basic mechanisms related to the virus and immunity towards it.</p><p id="P3">One useful path to investigate the immunity towards SARS-CoV-2 is adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], revealing noticeable changes in affected individuals in many arms of the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Millions of B and T cell receptor (BCR and TCR, respectively) sequences from hundreds of individuals have been shared in public archives such as iReceptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] and OAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Thousands of individual antibody sequences validated as targeting and neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 have been published in datasets such as CoV-AbDab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P4">In the past few years, several studies have used AIRR-seq data to train machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify individuals who carry diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], including celiac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], hepatitis C virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], cytomegalovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Finding the connection between AIRR-seq data and health states is a highly challenging task, because of the massive volume of AIRR-seq datasets that can include tens of millions of sequences that dilute the disease-specific biological signals. Another difficulty is our inability to determine to which antigen(s) each receptor can bind based solely on the receptor sequence. New methods to identify relevant repertoire features are continuously developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Besides the diagnostic and prognostic potential, such features can be critical in teaching us about the mechanisms behind the disease and the successful immune response towards it. Thus far, the vast majority of efforts to classify the health state or severity of COVID-19 have relied on TCR data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Recently, for example, a new approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection by TCR sequencing has been FDA approved for clinical use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p id="P5">B cells undergo affinity maturation after pathogen encounter, to further adapt to the specific pathogen. Affinity maturation includes iterative cycles of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity dependent selection. While selection depends on better binding, the SHM mechanism is independent of pathogen affinity. During SHM, different enzymatic pathways orchestrate together to introduce mutations specifically in the genomic regions encoding the antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Extensive investigations have been devoted to understanding the SHM mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], but to the best of our knowledge, no connection of a specific infection to a specific SHM pathway or pattern was made. The use of BCR sequencing is considered more difficult than TCR, because of SHM and higher diversity in the complementary determining region 3 (CDR3). It has been reported that BCR sequencing data cannot be used to classify individuals with COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Nevertheless, BCR data may be more informative than TCR in some cases, as BCRs undergo affinity maturation to adapt to each pathogen.</p><p id="P6">Here, using bulk and single cell BCR sequencing data, we successfully classify SARS-CoV-2 infected vs. naive individuals, as well as determine disease severity. Compared with the traditional sequence similarity clustering based approach, we obtain better classifications by considering SHM pattern changes in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. SHM specific patterns connected to decreased severity, as well as important amino acid (AA) composition in SARS-CoV2 antibodies, were identified.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Collection of samples</title><p id="P7">The repertoires composing the dataset were collected at three medical centers.

Only sequences which started at the first 30 bases of the V gene were included. Isotype frequencies, V, D, J and combinations of V &amp; J gene usage and CDR3 AAs 3-mers, as well as CDR3 AA lengths and V gene identities were calculated using a custom-designed R script (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S21">data and code availability section</xref>). The same script also calculated the frequencies of BCR clusters (sharing the same V and J genes and junction AA length). Diversity was calculated using the alphaDiversity function from the Alakazam R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].

To create these metrics for one representative from each clone, we used the collapseClones function from the same package. For each repertoire, substitutions, mutability, and targeting values were collapsed into a single table. Tables from all repertoires were collapsed into a single table. The tables enable both training ML algorithms and calculating mean mutability in specific sites (WR<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>TW and W<underline>A</underline>/<underline>T</underline>W hot-spots, the SYC/GRS cold-spot and all other sites). The table was also used to calculate single base mean mutability levels in all repertoires. The single base mutability was calculated as the average of all 5-mers with the same base in the middle.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Training and estimation of ML algorithms</title><p id="P12">50 random splits to train and validation groups were made in order to estimate the F1 score, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of each model. Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Models (GLMNET) using the caret R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] were trained on tables containing data from the repertoires. Feature selection was done using t-test calculations between frequencies in the different groups in the train subset only. Only features with P value below a certain threshold were selected. The algorithm was then trained on the selected data, and classifications were made for the validation groups. F1 score, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for each random split.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>COVID-19 classification using AA frequencies at all V gene positions</title><p id="P13">Frequencies of each AA along 103 positions (according to the IMGT numbering) in each V gene family were calculated for all repertoires. The train/validation samples were used to train the same algorithm as explained above, and to estimate the F1 score, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the algorithm. The validation group was used to estimate the parameters of the algorithm on unseen data. Coefficients of the algorithm were extracted and enabled to calculate scores for single antibodies. If a certain AA was present in the sequence, it received a frequency of 1. Otherwise, it received a frequency of 0. This equation was used to calculate scores for all antibodies in all repertoires, as well as scores for known COVID-19 antibodies from the CoV-AbDab database.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Single cell data analysis</title><p id="P14">Single cell data was analyzed using cell-ranger 6.0.1 with output of both VDJ recombination and gene expression data.

Samples were split to three groups: uninfected individuals, mildly and severely COVID-19 infected patients. For each group we characterized several whole repertoire features, such as CDR3 AA length distribution, V gene mutation distribution, clonal diversity, V, D, J and combination of V and J gene usage. We also calculated frequencies of BCR clusters (same V and J gene as well as same CDR3 AA length). These measurements are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref> for heavy chains, and for kappa and lambda light chains in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs.S2 and S3</xref>. As expected, the diversity of BCR clones is significantly lower in COVID-19 patients compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>). No significant difference was observed in CDR3 AA length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>), and only slight increase was seen in V gene mutation distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>). For many V genes we observed significantly reduced usage in COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>). Three exceptions are IGHV4-34, IGHV4-39 and IGHV4-59 that demonstrate increased usage upon infection, which is further increased in severe patients compared with mild ones. These results support previously published COVID-19 data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], and suggest that antibodies against SARS-CoV2 mainly comprise those genes. To further validate these conclusions, we tried to build ML classifiers based on V, V &amp; J gene usage, or V &amp; J gene usage and 85% similarity in the CDR3 AAs. However, these models yielded less than 70% accuracy, suggesting low impact of V or V &amp; J gene usage on the response to SARS-CoV2 infection.</p><p id="P16">We explored further whole repertoire features, and compared isotype frequencies between the different groups. While we observed a reduction in the frequencies of IGD and IGM upon SARS-CoV2 infection, the levels of IGG increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>), and those of IGA remained unchanged. We also measured silent mutability frequencies for each isotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). These measurements avoid changes which are caused by antibodies selective pressure. In contrast to the IGG and IGA class switched isotypes, in which mutability upon infection is reduced, in IGD and IGM mutability is increased. In severe patients, the IGD and IGM mutability was even higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>BCR V gene AA composition successfully classifies SARS-CoV2 infection and may reveal important features of antibodies against the virus</title><p id="P17">We continued exploring classification approaches to stratify COVID-19 patients and uninfected individuals. To this end, we explored AA frequencies along the V gene, aggregated by V gene family. We generated a table with 10,300 columns, counting AA frequencies along 103 V gene positions (aligned according to IMGT numbering), for the 5 most highly used V gene families (IGHV1-5). Using this approach we obtained a high F1 score of more than 0.85, and similar levels of accuracy, sensitivity,and specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2A</xref>). The test set resulted in an F1 score of above 0.85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). We then extracted the coefficient used by the algorithm, corresponding to the contribution of each AA frequency to the classification of the disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To further validate that these changes are unique to COVID-19 patients, we downloaded a dataset of more than 450 repertoires from cAb-rep data collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. These data include repertoire sequencing results from a wide variety of clinical conditions such as Hepatitis B virus infection, vaccinations against Hepatitis B virus and influenza, and several autoimmune diseases. Applying our algorithm to these data to classify COVID-19 infection resulted in a false positive rate of only 6%, indicating that our classification is specific to COVID-19 infection.</p><p id="P19">These results were obtained for the repertoire level, and we sought to test their applicability to the single BCR sequence level. For this, we transferred the features selected for the repertoire level model, i.e., AA frequencies along the V gene families, to calculate a score for single BCR sequences. We calculated such scores for a list of more than 5,000 known antibodies against SARS-CoV2 from the CoV-AbDab database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. The scores of the known antibodies were higher than those came from whole repertoires of control patients as well as most of the COVID-19 infected repertoires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), suggesting that these coefficients are meaningful not only for the repertoire level, but also for single BCR sequences. Our attempts to classify the severity of COVID-19 using this method were not successful, so for this purpose, we explored other sets of features. The coefficients of the algorithm can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Mutation bias in class-switched B cells of COVID-19 patients</title><p id="P20">As reduced levels of overall BCR mutability were seen upon SARS-CoV2 infection only in the class switched isotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F</xref>), we quantified single base mutability patterns in these isotypes. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>, the mean relative mutability is reduced in COVID-19 patients at Cytosine and Guanine (C and G), but increases in Adenine and Thymine (A and T). The same results were obtained when considering silent mutations only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Five main pathways are responsible for introducing mutations during SHM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Three introduce mutations in C and G, and the other two involve the low fidelity DNA polymerase polη, which mutates A and T. The significant differences in mutability observed in COVID-19 patients suggest altered activity of those arms. To further investigate SHM in SARS-CoV2 infection, we applied a commonly used 5-mers SHM mutability model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. In general, two highly mutated hot-spot motifs are commonly observed in SHM. One is WR<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>YW (where W ={A, T}, Y ={C, T} R ={G, A}, and the mutated position is underlined), and the other is W<underline>A</underline>/<underline>T</underline>W. In addition, SY<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>RS (where S ={C, G}), is considered as a cold-spot sequence motif. We first built a 5-mer mutability model based on both silent and replacement mutations. Such a model combines the effects of SHM and antigen-driven selection. We divided the 5-mers to those occurring in the two hot-spots, in the cold-spot, and in all other neutral sites, and show their levels for IGD/IGM and for IGA/IGG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C and E</xref>). The most significant changes between the different groups are a decrease in the WR<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>YW site and an increase in SY<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>RS in IGA/IGG of COVID-19 patients. This increase is not seen in severely infected patients.</p><p id="P21">To understand whether these patterns stem from SHM or from antigen-driven selection, we built another model, taking only silent mutations into consideration. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D and F</xref> shows the resulting mutability scores for the same sequence motifs. The observed pattern resembles the one observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C and E</xref>, suggesting that the alteration between the groups results from altered SHM characteristics. To avoid the effect of clonal expansion on mutability calculations, we repeated all calculations, taking into account only one representative from each clone. Similar results were obtained using this approach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Moreover, using SHM matrices based only on a specific V family resulted in a much lower signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5F</xref>). Importantly, the mentioned SHM patterns reflect the relative likelihood for each mutation pattern and do not indicate the overall mutability level.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Silent SHM patterns classify SARS-CoV2 infection and severity</title><p id="P22">To estimate the level of connection between changes in SHM patterns and SARS-CoV2 infection, we tried again to build a classifier of samples’ origin. We built two models, one using all mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5, S6A and S8</xref>), and one using silent mutations only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6B</xref>). Taking all mutations into account, we obtained an F1 score of over 0.85, as well as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values. Taking only silent mutations into account, we obtained a slightly lower result of ∼ 0.8 F1 score and accuracy. These results strengthen our hypothesis that the differences between the repertoires emerge mainly from SHM itself and not from antigen-driven selection. Using only light chain sequences for the mutability model reaches much lower results, as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A and B</xref>). A model based on the combination of light and heavy chains does not obtain better results than using the heavy chain only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Next, we tried to classify COVID-19 severity using SHM patterns. Since the mutability in the cold-spot motif changes the most between severe and mild patients, we built a model using mutability scores of this cold-spot only. We obtained an F1 score and accuracy of about 0.75 in severity classifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P24">All patterns with non-zero coefficients have much higher mutability frequencies in mild patients compared with severe patients ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Again, to avoid the effect of clonal expansion and selective pressure on the inferred mutability model, we repeated the mutability model inference taking into account only one representative from each clone. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>, the results were comparable to those obtained using all sequences.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Known SARS-CoV2 antibodies are enriched in plasmablasts from COVID-19 patients</title><p id="P25">We thought to find in our sequencing data, antibodies that may be related to the known COVID-19 antibodies. As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic a new database summarizing all known SARS-CoV2 antibodies was published, containing more than 5,000 antibody AA sequences of both heavy and light chains. For each of our repertoires, we calculated and summarized the frequencies of sequences that are similar to known antibodies. We defined similar antibodies by 85% identity in the CDR3 AAs, and the same V and J genes. As expected, the frequencies of similar to known antibodies in COVID-19 patients were higher than those in control individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>. Histograms summarizing the sizes and numbers of samples having at least one representation in the clones can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S9A and B</xref>). Using the sum of frequencies of similar to known COVID-19 clones, we reached an accuracy of above 70% in repertoire classification and an AUC of 0.81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Even lower results were obtained when training the algorithm to count the frequencies of shared clones between samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>). Although significant, this result is lower than that achieved by considering mutations along the V gene.</p><p id="P26">To further explore the similarity to known antibodies, we performed 10X Genomics single cell sequencing including V(D)J and gene expression, on blood samples from additional 13 mild COVID-19 patients. Using single cell sequencing data enables matching of heavy and light chains, which cannot be done with bulk sequencing. Moreover, single cell sequencing provides the ability to identify cell type using gene expression signatures. We found similar to known antibodies in 7 out of the 13 repertoires. The frequencies were overall lower compared with those seen in the bulk RNA sequencing cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). This could be due to the differences in sequencing methods, or because in the single cell cohort the patients were diagnosed on average more recently than the bulk cohort and thus may have had lower levels of SARS-CoV2 specific antibodies.</p><p id="P27">We then applied the SingleR R package to classify cell types by single cell expression profiles. Two-dimensional UMAP reduced plots are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, demonstrating a distinct cluster of plasmablasts. We summarized the frequency of known SARS-CoV2 clusters in bulk sequenced COVID-19 patients, bulk controls, single cell unsorted data, and single cell plasmablasts only. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, COVID-19 patients show enriched levels of similarity to known SARS-CoV2 antibody compared with controls. Single cells show higher levels than controls but lower than bulk, as discussed above. Among plasmablasts of COVID-19 patients, we see the highest frequency of known antibody clusters, indicating a stereotypical response to SARS-CoV2. Lastly, to validate our observation that WR<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>YW hot-spots mutability scores decrease upon COVID-19 infection, and SY<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>RS cold-spots increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), we split the single cell data into plasmablasts vs. all other B cell types. We built a mutability SHM matrix for each of these subsets, and indeed found a reduction in the mutability scores of WR<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>YW hot-spots in plasmablasts (0.00168) compared with the other B cell types (0.00178), and an increase in the mutability scores of the SY<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>RS cold-spots (0.0003 and 0.0002, respectively).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by evolving variants of SARS-CoV2, has infected a large proportion of the population worldwide. Antibodies play a critical role in eliminating the virus from the body. Serological tests are routinely used to estimate immunity of individuals against SARS-CoV2, convalescent plasma donations were used to treat severely ill COVID-19 patients, and many monoclonal antibodies were developed as candidate passive vaccinations.</p><p id="P29">Although the pandemic has caused a huge health and economic burden, it brought several important advantages for biomedical research. With so many researchers and funding opportunities focusing on a single topic, the pandemic facilitated both broad and profound analyses of the virus and the immune responses towards it. During the past two and a half years, thousands of COVID-19 binding/neutralizing antibodies have been published and deposited in public datasets[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. This huge amount of data facilitates finding BCR sequences that are similar to known antibody sequences, and searching for common features. Such features may be used in the clinic for diagnosis of the disease, but in the case of COVID-19 there are easier, faster and cheaper ways to do that. Much more importantly, it can teach us about the development of the immune response towards the virus.</p><p id="P30">Here, in contrast to previous reports[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], we were able to stratify COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals based on shared clusters of BCR sequences. The moderate classification results of such approach led us to explore different sets of features that turned out to be more informative. AA frequencies at all V gene positions served as a basis for an ML model that produced a high F1 score (∼ 85%) in classifying COVID-19 infection.</p><p id="P31">The patterns of AA alterations in BCRs arise during the process of affinity maturation, that includes two iterative processes, namely SHM and affinity-dependent selection. These patterns can stem from the antibodies against SARS-COV2 or from overall altered SHM mechanism in COVID-19 patients.</p><p id="P32">An important question that may arise when inspecting the presented approach is whether it is specific to COVID-19, or perhaps it simply detects general signals related to an adaptive immune response towards a new pathogen. We believe that the presented approach is specific to COVID-19 because: 1. The signal does not disappear when choosing a single representative per clone, which eliminates the effect of general clonal expansion. 2. The signal is based on an SHM pattern, which is subject to an antigen-specific affinity maturation. 3. Our lab has a lot of experience in ML-based classification of different clinical conditions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], and for each condition the features identified by the algorithm as the most essential for classification were different. SHM patterns have never been previously identified as a feature, as far as we know (but see our recent publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]). To test this, we applied our algorithm to data from ∼ 450 samples, including infection with Hepatitis B virus, vaccinations against Hepatitis B virus and influenza, and several autoimmune diseases. 94% of these repertoires were classified as healthy, indicating that our algorithm does not classify any neo-response as COVID-19.</p><p id="P33">Extensive research has been devoted to study SHM mechanisms affecting other regions in the antibody besides the CDR3[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Yet, this knowledge has not been used for disease classifications, nor for improving antibody engineering. We sought to follow the SHM machinery during SARS-CoV2 infection, starting with the whole repertoire level. It is well established that antibodies binding SARS-CoV2 are very close to the germline[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Surprisingly, even at the repertoire level, we detected a decrease in mutability of IGG BCRs. To explore whether the AA frequency-based signal results from alterations in SHM or affinity dependent selection, we followed the mutability rates of silent mutations only. These mutations are not subjected to affinity dependent selection pressure, thus reflecting changes in the machinery of SHM. We found that most SHM changes upon SARS-CoV2 infection were observed even when counting only silent mutations, which are not subject to affinity selection, suggesting dramatic changes in the SHM machinery upon SARS-CoV2 infection. To further pinpoint the effects on the SHM machinery, we repeated the calculations taking only one representative from each clone into account, thereby abolishing the effect of clonal expansion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). This step slightly reduced the F1 score, in a non-significant way. The fact that eliminating the effect of clonal expansion on our findings did not abolish the differences suggests that there are true changes in the SHM machinery. Moreover, the moderate performance reduction when taking only one representative per clone, hints that the SHM changes during SARS-CoV2 infection may be further enhanced by clonal expansion, potentially aiding the battle with the virus.</p><p id="P34">Many pathways are involved in the introduction of mutations to BCR sequences. In particular, two common SHM hot-spots, WR<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>YW and W<underline>A</underline>/<underline>T</underline>W, are affected by two different pathways. While mutations in WR<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>YW motifs are mediated by the activation induced deaminase, mutability at W<underline>A</underline>/<underline>T</underline>W motifs also involve the low fidelity DNA polymerase pol<italic>η</italic>.</p><p id="P35">In the class switched IGA and IGG isotypes, we observed decreased mutability levels with increasing severity of COVID-19 at WR<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>YW motifs, and increased mutability at W<underline>A</underline>/<underline>T</underline>W sites. Again, these changes were observed even when counting silent mutations only, further supporting an impact of the virus on the SHM introduction mechanism. The reduced mutability in WR<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>YW motifs and the mildly increased mutability in W<underline>A</underline>/<underline>T</underline>W motifs may hint that AID levels could be decreased upon COVID-19 infection. This possibility will need to be validated in future studies. Another future direction is to test for possible SHM positional effects. The presence of such an effect was lately suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>], and it will be very interesting to inspect whether this is relevant to our results.</p><p id="P36">Another specific SHM target is the cold-spot SY<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>RS. Surprisingly, we found an increase in mutability rates of this cold-spot in COVID-19 repertoires. Moreover, this increase was not observed in severely infected patients, suggesting that this mechanism may be critical for production of efficient antibodies and thereby for prevention of severe illness.</p><p id="P37">Building on our success in classifying patients from healthy individuals, we sought to develop an ML-based algorithm to classify disease severity. This could have important clinical outcomes, since medications and passive vaccines now exist that can prevent deterioration if diagnosed individuals are treated rapidly. However, these treatments have side effects and are not given to the wide population. Prediction of disease severity by the known risk factors is highly inaccurate, and there are currently no other means to classify severity. Using mutability patterns from silent mutations only, we estimate our ability to classify COVID-19 severity at approximately 75%(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). The known risk factors to develop severe COVID-19 are mostly preexisting conditions such as older age, hypertension, obesity, diabetes. Here, we suggest another risk biomarker that involves basic features of the adaptive immune system. Many more steps are needed to enable prediction of COVID-19 infection and severity based on BCR sequencing data. We provide here a first step towards it.</p><p id="P38">AA frequency patterns along the V genes at the whole repertoire level is a sufficient feature for relatively good classification of COVID-19. Looking at the identity of AA along the V gene of a single BCR sequence may reveal its affinity towards the virus. To explore the connection between the new BCR repertoire data generated here and known SARS-CoV2 antibody sequences we took a two way approach. Building on the hypothesis that the whole repertoire level signal responsible for the classification stems from individual SARS-CoV2-specific antibodies generated during the infection, we derived a single sequence score based on the repertoire classification signal. Although sequences with high scores are scarce in both healthy and COVID-19 repertoires, their prevalence in the CoV-abDab data is significantly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). As such, the features (detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) may be used for more rational antibody design towards the virus. In addition, we explored the presence of similar sequences to the validated CoV-abDab antibodies in both bulk and in single cell sequenced repertoires. We found a higher fraction of sequences with high similarity to known antibodies in COVID-19 patients compared with controls. This can also be used for successful classification of the repertoires. Notably, a group of COVID-19 patients had no similar antibodies to those in the list, suggesting that despite the massive efforts so far, the list is incomplete. On the other hand, in some control samples we found few sequences similar to known antibodies. These antibodies may provide a basis for protection from COVID-19 symptoms or complications to individuals who carry them.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary material</label><media xlink:href="EMS158972-supplement-Supplementary_material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d97aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="S20"><title>Funding</title><p>We thank the Israeli Ministry of Science grant 3-16909, the Israeli Science Foundation grant 3768/19, the United States–Israel Binational Science Foundation (2017253), and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (825821).
