We recently described a role for IL-17A, through regulation of IFNγ, as an important inducer of type 2 responses during infection with the lung-migrating rodent nematode <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic>. Here, we aimed to investigate the interaction between IL-17A and IL-33 during the early lung migratory stages of <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> infection. In this brief report, we demonstrate that deficiency of IL-17A leads to impaired IL-33 expression and secretion early in infection, independent of IL-17A suppression of IFNγ. Impaired IL-33 production was evident in lung epithelial cells, but not innate immune cells. Therefore, our results demonstrate that IL-17A can drive IL-33 during helminth infection, highlighting an additional mechanism through which IL-17A can regulate pulmonary type 2 immunity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Interleukin-33 (IL-33) belongs to the IL-1 cytokine family and plays a key role in innate and adaptive immunity. IL-33 signals via the ST2 receptor, which is expressed on many different cell types including eosinophils, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and Th2 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The expression of ST2 on cell types closely associated with type 2 immunity and evidence that IL-33 is a potent inducer of type 2 responses makes the IL-33/ST2 axis a therapeutic target in type 2 mediated diseases. However, IL-33 is implicated more broadly in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and has roles in protection against microbial infection and regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In contrast to most other cytokines, IL-33 is usually released during cellular necrosis, underpinning its role as an “alarmin” cytokine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. However, studies have also demonstrated IL-33 release by cells of the airway epithelium including alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells after infection with <italic>Strongyloides venezuelensis</italic> and administration of <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic>, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A is typically associated with host protection against fungal and bacterial infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> . However, using a model of infection with the lung-migrating nematode <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> (<italic>Nb</italic>), we recently demonstrated that IL-17A is also necessary to mount a pulmonary type 2 response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In this helminth setting, IL-17A from innate γδ T cells exerts a suppressive effect on IFNγ release by multiple cell types early during infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. This inhibition of IFNγ allows development of the adaptive pulmonary Th2 response. However, existing data on the interaction between IL-17A and IL-33<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> suggests the possibility that innate IL-17A during <italic>Nb</italic> infection may function beyond its ability to suppress IFNγ. In a neonatal mouse model of influenza, infection-induced IL-17A was associated with increased IL-33 production by lung epithelial cells, subsequently generating a local type 2 immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Similarly, mice lacking IL-17A exhibit decreased IL-33 in visceral adipose tissue, leading to reduced Treg expansion and failure to regulate thermogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In both these studies, as in lung <italic>Nb</italic> infection, the source of IL-17A is γδ T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. IL-17A-induced IL-33 also promotes type 2 immunity during atopic dermatitis with the IL-17A source being ILC3s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Of note, during pulmonary <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> infection, IL-33 negatively regulates IL-17A production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, demonstrating cross-regulation between these two cytokines. During <italic>Nb</italic> infection, we have shown IL-17A to be a driver of type 2 immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, but Hung et al. have demonstrated a pivotal role for IL-33 in the type 2 response in <italic>Nb</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Given the existing literature on the interactions between IL-17A and IL-33 described above, we felt it essential to investigate the relationship of these two cytokines during the lung-migrating phase of <italic>Nb</italic> infection.</p><p id="P5">In this brief report we describe IL-17A stimulation of IL-33 release by the lung epithelium during the early phase of <italic>Nb</italic> infection. However, this effect was independent of the IFNγ-suppressing function of IL-17A. Furthermore, IL-17A-induced neutrophilia and the associated lung damage was not the driver for IL-33 production. Together, our data demonstrate that IL-17A acts as an upstream regulator of type 2 immune responses in the lung through two distinct pathways; IFNγ-suppression and IL-33-secretion.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mice</title><p id="P6">C57BL/6 J mice were obtained from Charles River.

Both IL-33 and its receptor ST2 have been shown to be implemented in the defense against different nematode infections including <italic>Nb</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, <italic>Litomosoides sigmodontis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and <italic>Strongyloides ratti</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. We recently described IL-17A as an important initiator of type 2 responses in the lung by downregulating early IFNγ production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. To investigate the relationship between IL-17A and IL-33 during the early phase of infection, both <italic>Il17a</italic>-KO and WT mice were infected with 250 L3 <italic>Nb</italic> larvae and the pulmonary immune response assessed at d1 and d2pi. Using flow cytometry, we found that infection driven IL-33 was produced by EpCAM<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup> lung epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). A comparison between WT and <italic>Il17a</italic>-KO mice demonstrated a significant reduction in IL-33 production by EpCAM<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup> cells in <italic>Il17a</italic>-KO mice compared to WT controls ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). IL-33 expression was detected in the lung epithelium early during infection at 16h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), possibly correlating with the time point <italic>Nb</italic> larvae enter the lung. Using ELISA, we determined that by 24h post infection WT mice secreted significantly higher amounts of IL-33 into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) compared to infected <italic>Il17a</italic>-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Taken together, these data reveal an IL-33 regulating function of IL-17A during the early stages of <italic>Nb</italic> infection.</p><p id="P16">To further identify localization of IL-33 production during <italic>Nb</italic> infection, we examined immunofluorescence staining in lung sections from d1 infected WT and <italic>Il17a</italic>-KO mice. IL-33 expression was detected in lungs of both, naïve WT and <italic>Il17a</italic>-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). However, consistent with the flow cytometry data the bronchial epithelial cell staining for IL-33 was less intense in <italic>Nb</italic> infected <italic>Il17a</italic>-KO mice, relative to the infected WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). In accordance with the observations of Hung et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, quantification of the IL-33 positive areas of the lung airways revealed a significant increase in IL-33 intensity between naïve and d1 infected WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). However, we observed significantly lower IL-33 intensity in the airways of <italic>Il17a</italic>-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). In fact, <italic>Il17a</italic>-KO mice failed to upregulate IL-33 in the bronchial epithelium after <italic>Nb</italic> infection. In contrast to the bronchial epithelium, IL-33 expression by the cells in the lung parenchyma, did not differ between genotypes at the same time point. IL-33 intensity in the lung parenchyma was quantified, but we did not observe any statistical differences between all tested groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Due to previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, we investigated the possibility that myeloid cells were the source of IL-33 expression in the lung parenchyma by co-staining lung sections for both IL-33 and Ym1. Ym1 is a chitinase-like protein known to induce IL-17A and thereby promote pulmonary type 2 responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In the lung, Ym1 is mainly expressed by myeloid cells including macrophages and neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Lung sections stained for both Ym1 (pink) and IL-33 (yellow) revealed no co-staining, suggesting that the source of IL-33 in the parenchyma was not myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). The lung epithelium is a major barrier surface and is known to respond to IL-17A by producing antimicrobial proteins or neutrophil chemoattractants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. As such, lung-epithelial specific deletion of IL-17RA results in impaired clearance of <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Our finding that during early <italic>Nb</italic> infection, the presence of IL-17A leads to increased airway epithelial derived-IL-33, along with other recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> suggest that IL-17A regulation of lung epithelium extends beyond the induction of proinflammatory and anti-microbial factors, and involves regulation of type 2-associated molecules.</p><p id="P17">The molecule Ym1 is responsible for early IL-17A production during <italic>Nb</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and thus an early type 2 ‘trigger’ may be needed for IL-17A to promote type 2 responses. The early Ym1 needed to induce IL-17A and promote type 2 immunity, is mostly IL-4Rα independent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> but as infection progresses Ym1 production becomes increasingly IL-4Rα-dependent, and functions to repair lung damage, in part through the induction of RELMα by lung epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. At this stage, when the type 2 immune response is fully established, the role of IL-17A switches to suppress rather than enhance the type 2 immune response. Whether IL-17A regulation of IL-33 also differs during the early versus later adaptive stages of infection is unknown, but Hung et al have demonstrated that the context and cell source of IL-33 impacts its role in anti-helminth immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, it is important to understand the specific consequence of epithelial cell-derived IL-33. A possible mechanism by which IL-17A induces IL-33 is suggested by work on human epidermal keratinocytes, where IL-17A causes phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK, p38 and STAT1, which is necessary for the induction of IL-33<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Suppressing IL-33 during <italic>Nb</italic> infection does not increase IFNγ production</title><p id="P18">We have reported that during <italic>Nb</italic> infection, early IL-17A is responsible for the suppression of IFNγ from all cellular sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Here we observed that in the absence of IL-17A IL-33 expression in the lung epithelium and IL-33 secretion into the BAL fluid is reduced. We therefore asked whether the ability of IL-17A to limit IFNγ production is acting indirectly through promotion of IL-33. To answer this question we used a known suppressor of IL-33, the <italic>H.polygyrus</italic>-derived protein HpARI, previously shown to inhibit type 2 immune response during <italic>Nb</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. HpARI directly binds to IL-33 and nuclear DNA, blocking the interaction of IL-33 with the ST2 receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, HpARI prevents release of IL-33 from necrotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. HpARI was administered intranasally at d0 and d1 of <italic>Nb</italic> infection and IFNγ production was investigated d2pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, at d2pi there was a significant decrease in the proportion of CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), γδ T cells, and NK cells producing IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-E</xref>). Notably, blocking IL-33 with HpARI in <italic>Nb</italic> infected mice did not reverse the suppression of IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 B-E</xref>). In contrast and as expected, <italic>Il17a</italic>-KO mice exhibited significantly increased IFNγ production compared to WT controls at d2pi with <italic>Nb</italic>. To validate that HpARI treatment was successfully blocking IL-33, we analyzed the numbers of ILC2s in the lung and observed a significant reduction in IL-5+ILC2s in the lung at d2pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>) further confirming the requirement for IL-33 in type 2 mediated immunity during <italic>Nb</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Additionally, IL-33 protein levels in lung homogenates were significantly reduced after HpARI treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). In summary, the evidence does not support a role for IL-33 in the suppression of IFNγ during the early stages of pulmonary nematode infection. Because blocking IFNγ rescues type 2 immunity in <italic>Il17a</italic>-KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> the suppression of IFNγ by IL-17A is sufficient to initiate type 2 responses, without the need to enhance IL-33 expression. The data therefore suggests that IL-17A induction of type 2 responses involves two fully independent pathways, suppressing IFNγ by lymphocytes and promoting IL-33 production by lung airway epithelial cells. However, a likely consequence of incoming L3 larvae is IL-33 release by damaged epithelial cells, which raises the question as to what are the circumstances that require IL-17A to further enhance IL-33 expression. A better understanding of the connection between IL-33 and IFNγ in this setting is therefore needed.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>IL-17A-dependent neutrophilia is not a driver of IL-33 production</title><p id="P19">A hallmark characteristic of IL-17A is its ability to promote neutrophil recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. During the early phases of <italic>Nb</italic> infection, neutrophils are rapidly recruited to the lungs, with peak-neutrophilia being between d1 and d2pi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Neutrophils primed by <italic>Nb</italic> infection have been shown to upregulate <italic>Il33</italic> transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and are a major driver of tissue injury which in turn could lead to IL-33 release. Therefore, we investigated whether neutrophils recruited during <italic>Nb</italic> infection contribute to IL-33 levels in the lung. Neutrophils were depleted at d-1 and 1pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and successful depletion was confirmed via flow cytometry. Injection of anti-Ly6G effectively prevented neutrophil accumulation in the BAL at d2pi compared to isotype control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Histological sections of the lungs demonstrated infection-induced injury at d2pi in isotype-treated WT mice, an effect that is almost absent in infected mice depleted of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Using measures of lacunarity as an indicator of acute lung injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, neutrophil depleted mice displayed no significant signs of damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). These findings reinforce previous observations that neutrophilia is largely responsible for the severe lung damage observed in this model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. To investigate whether this extensive tissue damage during the early stage of <italic>Nb</italic> infection could be responsible for the increase in IL-33 release, lung sections were stained for IL-33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Quantification of the IL-33 positive areas in the lung airways as well as the lung parenchyma did not reveal a difference between mice depleted of neutrophils and isotype controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E, F</xref>). While infected mice exhibited increased IL-33 intensity compared to naïve mice, no significant difference was observed between the treatment groups. If neutrophils are a contributor of IL-33 during <italic>Nb</italic> infection, we would have expected less IL-33 after depleting the peak neutrophilia. However, mice depleted of neutrophils had a slightly higher intensity for epithelial IL-33 staining at d2pi, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Depleting neutrophils also did not change the IL-33 levels at later stage of <italic>Nb</italic> infection as shown for d6pi in both lung epithelium and lung parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E, F</xref>). Our data therefore demonstrate that during the lung-migrating phase of <italic>Nb</italic> infection, neutrophil-mediated damage is not the cause of IL-33 production.</p><p id="P20">In summary, our brief report further implicates pulmonary IL-17A in the initiation phase of type 2 immunity in the lung. Through two independent mechanisms, enhanced IL-33 production by the lung epithelium, and suppression of IFNγ, IL-17A supports the type 2 immune response in the lung needed to cope with lung-migrating helminth infection.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S16"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the Flow Cytometry, Bioimaging, and Biological Services core facilities at the University of Manchester.
