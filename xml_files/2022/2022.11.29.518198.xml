Loss of the tumour suppressor <italic>PTEN</italic> in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is associated with a patient subgroup with poor prognosis. The cellular mechanisms of how <italic>PTEN</italic> loss contributes to HGSOC are largely unknown. We utilise long-term time-lapse imaging of HGSOC spheroids coupled to a machine learning approach to classify the phenotype of <italic>PTEN</italic> loss. <italic>PTEN</italic> deficiency does not affect proliferation but rather induces PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-rich and -dependent membrane protrusions into the extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in a collective invasion phenotype. We identify the small GTPase ARF6 as a crucial vulnerability upon <italic>PTEN</italic> loss. Through a functional proteomic CRISPR screen of ARF6 interactors, we identify the ARF GTPase-activating protein (GAP) AGAP1 and the ECM receptor β1-integrin (ITGB1) as key ARF6 interactors regulating the <italic>PTEN</italic> loss-associated invasion phenotype. ARF6 functions to promote invasion by controlling the recycling of internalised, active β1-integrin complexes to maintain invasive activity into the ECM. The expression of the ARF6-centred complex in HGSOC patients is inversely associated with outcome, allowing identification of patient groups with improved versus poor outcome. ARF6 may represent a new therapeutic vulnerability in <italic>PTEN</italic>-depleted HGSOC tumours.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The tumour suppressor PTEN is a dual specificity phosphatase regulating both protein tyrosine dephosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> as well as dephosphorylation of the 3-positions of phosphatidyl-inositol-3,4,5-<italic>tris</italic>-phosphate (PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, PIP<sub>3</sub>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and phosphatidyl-inositol-3,4-<italic>bis</italic>-phosphate (PI(3,4)<sub>2</sub>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In a classical view of lipid phosphatase function PTEN acts as a buffer to oppose potential over-production of PIP<sub>3</sub> or PI(3,4)<sub>2</sub>. This ensures the appropriate level of downstream pathway activation and homeostatic responses to PI3K signalling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In addition to their well-documented roles in cell signalling, such as to the AKT and mTOR pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> the spatial distribution of PIP<sub>3</sub> or PI(3,4)<sub>2</sub> is integral to their contribution to cell behaviour. Specifically, the location of these two PTEN-regulated PIP species is asymmetric in polarised epithelial cells; PIP3 is focally enriched at the basolateral surface <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> while PI(3,4)<sub>2</sub> is located at the apical domain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. PTEN is present at the apico-laterally localised tight junction, which is a boundary point between these asymmetric lipids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3"><italic>PTEN</italic> gene deletion can be found in a number of cancers, particularly high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) and prostate cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Mutation of <italic>PTEN</italic> also occurs at a modest level in most cancers, with Glioblastoma and Uterine cancers presenting frequent <italic>PTEN</italic> mutation (The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), cBioPortal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>). Mutation of the PIP<sub>3</sub>-producing <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, in contrast, is a frequent event in a number of cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. This emphasises that dysregulation of the PI3K-PTEN axis is a common event in several cancer types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Despite this, exactly how these lipid kinase and phosphatases enact the cellular changes that contribute to tumourigenesis remains largely unclear. For instance, given the polarised nature of these lipids, does the loss of <italic>PTEN</italic> allow for enhanced signalling function at the normal site of PIP<sub>3</sub> in the cell (the basolateral domain) or is PIP<sub>3</sub> produced at ectopic sites, allowing for <italic>de novo</italic> functions? Clarifying such fundamental questions may inform whether targeting classical downstream targets of PI3K-PIP<sub>3</sub> signalling versus potential dependencies that manifest particularly when <italic>PTEN</italic> is lost, show therapeutic viability.</p><p id="P4">The spatial distribution of PIP species has been revealed by the use of domains of proteins that show preferential PIP affinity fused to fluorescent proteins as indirect reporters for PIP location<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. For example, fusion to fluorescent proteins (e.g. GFP) of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain from the cytohesin family of GTP exchange factors (GEFs) for ARF GTPases, such as ARNO/CYTH2, (e.g. GFP-PH-CYTH2) can be an exquisite sensor for PIP3 location. Splicing of these cytohesin PH domains alters their lipid specificity, wherein a di-glycine splice variant of the PH domain (PH-CYTH2<sup>2G</sup>) preferentially binds PIP3, while a tri-glycine splice variant (PH-CYTH2<sup>3G</sup>) associates with PI(4,5)2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This illustrates how using lipid-preferential binding domains in such reporters allows detection of PIP distribution.</p><p id="P5">Although the PH domain of CYTH-type ARF GEFs have been extensively used as probes for PIP<sub>3</sub> localisation, the extent to which they are required to enact PIP<sub>3</sub> downstream signalling has mostly been neglected. Recent work identifies that the PIP3-specific variant of CYTH1 is required for signalling from c-Met to induce migration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, both PI4- and PI5-kinases are effectors of ARF GTPases themselves <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, highlighting that ARF GTPases are intimately involved in maintaining and effecting PIP homeostasis. ARF GTPases are evolutionarily conserved membrane trafficking regulators, controlling many aspects of cargo trafficking, such as turnover or recycling of receptor tyrosine kinases, cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. ARF GTPases are therefore well-placed to respond to changes in phospholipid metabolism that occur frequently in cancer and enact the cellular alterations that lead to invasive activity in cancer.</p><p id="P6">Here, we used the murine-derived model of HGSOC (ID8) to examine the cellular consequences of <italic>Pten</italic> loss on collective cancer cell behaviour using machine learning to detect phenotypic changes across multi-day time-lapse spheroid imaging. We identify that <italic>Pten</italic> loss induces PIP3-rich and -driven invasive protrusions into the extracellular matrix (ECM), which leads to invasive activity. We uncover that ARF6 is essential for this process. Through CRISPR-mediated ARF6 interactor screening, we identify that ARF6 acts in concert with the ARFGAP protein AGAP1 to promote recycling of active integrin in protrusions and drive invasion. Levels of this ARF6 module predict clinical outcome in ovarian cancer patients. Our approach therefore uncovers an ARF6 vulnerability upon PTEN loss in collective cancer cell behaviour in ovarian cancer.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>PTEN loss in the tumour epithelium and association with poor patient survival</title><p id="P7">To understand how <italic>PTEN</italic> expression levels are altered in ovarian cancer, we examined <italic>PTEN</italic> mRNA in tumour epithelium and stroma. In three independent datasets of laser capture-microdissected (LCMD) ovarian tumours separated into epithelium and stroma, <italic>PTEN</italic> mRNA was significantly decreased in Tumour versus Normal ovarian epithelium, whereas stromal <italic>PTEN</italic> levels were inconsistently altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A-C</xref>). Across bulk Ovarian Cancer tumour datasets, which include epithelium and stroma, three of six independent datasets show decreased <italic>PTEN</italic> mRNA in Tumour versus Normal samples, with non-significant datasets all possessing a low number of normal samples (n=4-6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Ovarian Cancer dataset, 73% of samples possessed <italic>TP53</italic> mutation and consequently <italic>PTEN</italic> alteration occurred frequently with <italic>TP53</italic> alteration, low <italic>PTEN</italic> mRNA was poorly associated with <italic>PTEN</italic> copy number changes and modestly associated with low PTEN protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). While comparing high levels of <italic>PTEN</italic> mRNA (Quartile 4, Q4) to lower (Q1+2+3) levels did not distinguish overall survival in ovarian cancer patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>), an 11-month (p=0.0019) increase in survival was observed in high (Q4) versus not (Q1+2+3) PTEN protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Accordingly, while low <italic>PTEN</italic> mRNA patients (Q1 versus Q4) display significant, but modest AKT activation (pT308, pS473) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1H</xref>), similar comparisons using PTEN protein levels revealed a significant and robust PI3K-AKT signalling signature in low PTEN protein patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>). Therefore, <italic>PTEN</italic> loss in ovarian cancer, particularly at the protein level, occurs in the tumour epithelium, and is associated with upregulated AKT signalling and poor overall survival.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title><italic>Pten</italic> loss induces modest effects in 2D culture</title><p id="P8">We aimed to model how <italic>PTEN</italic> loss in the epithelium affects tumour cell behaviour.

Due to the numerous mutations that may occur on <italic>TP53</italic>, and the pleiotropic effects they may incur on the observed phenotype, we utilised ID8 ovarian cancer cells knocked out (KO) for <italic>Trp53</italic> and <italic>Pten</italic>, alone or in combination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Fig. S1A,B</xref>; including multiple clones of the double KO, dKO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. As a control, we made use of a Wild Type (WT) ID8 cell line, derived from Parental ID8 cells upon treatment with CRISPR plasmids containing the gRNA sequence that produced the <italic>Trp53</italic><sup>-/-</sup> subline but had in this specific case failed to introduce <italic>Trp53</italic> KO <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. <italic>Pten</italic> KO, either alone or in combination with <italic>Trp53</italic> KO, significantly increased AKT activation (pS473) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Fig. S1C-H</xref>), which occurred at the cell cortex in cells grown in 2-Dimensional (2D) contexts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Fig. S1I-J</xref> arrowheads). ID8 cells in 2D displayed a mixed morphology and could be classified into three categories: Cobblestone, Round, and Elongated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Fig. S1K-L</xref>). <italic>Trp53</italic> KO alone did not significantly affect cell shape class compared to parental (WT) cells, while <italic>Pten</italic> co-depletion decreased the Round phenotype, but did not cause a consistent increase in the other classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Fig. S1M</xref>).

The steps involved were as follows: 1) phase contrast images of segmented spheroids were measured for texture, granularity, shape, size and movement features in tracked objects over multiple days, 2) a high-accuracy classifier was applied to determine in-focus objects, 3) out of focus objects were removed, 4) a second high-accuracy classification into Spherical and Hyper-protrusive spheroids was applied, and 5) the frequency of phenotypes over time across different manipulations were calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Application of this approach revealed that KO of <italic>Pten</italic>, whether alone or in combination with <italic>Trp53</italic> loss, and across multiple clones, results in induction of a hyper-protrusive, invasive spheroid phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-H</xref>, arrowheads; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Fig. S2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Movie 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">3</xref>).

In <italic>Pten</italic>-expressing cells, PIP<sub>3</sub> localises to cell-cell contacts. In <italic>Pten</italic> KO cells, while cell-cell contact PIP<sub>3</sub> is not lost, a prominent pool of PIP<sub>3</sub> appears in ECM-invading protrusion tips. The small GTPase ARF6 likely acts directly in PIP<sub>3</sub>-elevated areas through activation by the PIP<sub>3</sub>-associating variant of its cognate GEF, Cyth2<sup>2G</sup>, and via its GAP AGAP1. This ARF6 module functions in the recycling of internalised active pools of integrin, thereby driving invasive protrusions enriched for the adhesion signal-transducing FAK and SFKs. This suggests a model wherein PTEN loss elevates recycling of invasion-promoting cargoes. The cellular consequence of this is altered interaction with the ECM.</p><p id="P30">It is notable that this CYTH2-ARF6-AGAP1 module was not specifically and only induced in <italic>Pten</italic>-null contexts, but rather that <italic>Pten</italic>-null cells became dependent on the module for enacting the invasive phenotype. Indeed, with the exception of α5-integrin, the majority of ARF6-proximal protein network was largely unchanged across <italic>Trp53</italic> or <italic>Pten</italic> knockout cells. This suggests that ARF6 and interactors likely have a steady-state function in recycling active integrins. It may be that this function is enhanced in <italic>Pten</italic> KO cells, as in our functional proteomic CRISPR screen of ARF6-proximal proteins we identified KINDLIN-2/FERMT2, a PIP<sub>3</sub>-binding regulator of integrin activation. When PIP<sub>3</sub> levels are high it is possible that, in addition to selectively supporting recycling of previously internalised active integrin cargoes, ARF6 may collaborate with KINDLIN-2 to promote or maintain activation of recycled integrins at the plasma membrane, although this remains to be tested. In addition, a number of additional hits in the screen, such as EGFR, FMNL3, LAMTOR5 and ITGA6, gave strong reductions in Hyper-protrusiveness and may act as additional ARF6 cargoes or effectors in regulating collective invasion.</p><p id="P31">It is notable that the effects of <italic>Pten</italic> or <italic>Trp53</italic> loss were most prominent in 3D culture.

Samples were further washed with PFS (twice) and with PBS (thrice). Invading monolayers and spheroids were imaged using a Zeiss 880 Laser Scanning Microscope with Airyscan or at normal confocal function. Images taken in super resolution mode were processed using the Zeiss proprietary ZEN 3.2 software, exported as TIFF files and processed in Fiji. Invading monolayers and cells on 96-well plates were imaged using an Opera Phenix™ high content analysis system (x20 or x63) and the Columbus High-Content Imaging and Analysis Software (PerkinElmer, Version 2.9.1) was used to generate custom pipelines and perform object segmentation, intensity measurements and machine learning. For 2D morphology assays cells were identified based on nuclear staining (Hoechst) and the shape of each cell was defined by CellMask staining. Machine learning and manual training was used to classify cells as either 'elongated', 'cobblestone' or 'round'. Each cell was imaged in one plane. Cells in contact with the image border were discarded. For measurement of pAKT enrichment cells were identified based on nuclear staining (Hoechst), the total cell area was defined by CellMask staining and cells in contact with the image border were discarded. The cell area was split into 3 Regions: Ring Region, or 'Perinuclear', resized to 35% Outer Border Shift (OBS) and 50% Inner Border Shift (IBS), 'Membrane', resized to -10% OBS and 10% IBS and 'Cytoplasm', resized to 10% OBS and 35% IBS. The cells were imaged in three planes with 1 μm distance between planes and processed as maximum projection. The staining intensity of pAKT was measured in each cell, for each individual area and was expressed as a proportion of the total (sum of all areas).

Samples were resuspended in 2M urea in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer and stored at -20°C until further processing. On-bead digestion was performed from the supernatants. Quadruplicate biological replicates were digested with Lys-C (Alpha Laboratories) and trypsin (Promega) on beads as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Following trypsin digestion, peptides were separated by means of nanoscale C18 reverse-phase Liquid Chromatography (LC) using an EASY-nLC II 1200 (Thermo Scientific) system directly coupled to a mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Fusion Lumos, Thermo Scientific). Elution was performed using a 50 cm fused silica emitter (New Objective) packed in-house with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ, 1.9 μm resin (Dr Maisch GmbH). Separation was carried out using a 135 min binary gradient at flow rate of 300nl/min. The packed emitter was maintained at 50°C by means of a column oven (Sonation) integrated into the nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo Scientific). Air contaminants signal levels were decreased using an Active Background Ion Reduction Device (ABIRD ESI Source Solutions). Data acquisition was performed using the Xcalibur software. A full scan was acquired over a mass range of 350-1400m/z at 60,000 resolution at 200 m/z. The 15 most intense ions underwent higher energy collisional dissociation fragmentation and the fragments generated were analysed in the Orbitrap (15,000 resolution). MaxQuant 1.6.14.0 was used for data processing. Data were processed with MaxQuant software <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>querying SwissProt (UniProt, 2019) Mus musculus (25198 entries). First and main searches were performed with precursor mass tolerances of 20 ppm and 4.5 ppm, respectively, and MS/MS tolerance of 20 ppm. The minimum peptide length was set to six amino acids and specificity for trypsin cleavage was required. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification, whereas Methionine oxidation, Phosphorylation on Serine-Threonine-Tyrosine, and N-terminal acetylation were specified as variable modifications. The peptide, protein, and site false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1 %. All MaxQuant outputs were analysed with Perseus software version 1.6.2.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Protein abundance was measured using label-free quantification (LFQ) intensities, which were calculated according to the label-free quantification algorithm available in MaxQuant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, reported in the ProteinGroups.txt file. Only proteins quantified in all 3 replicates in at least one group were used for further analysis. Missing values were imputed separately for each column (width 0.3, down shift 1.8), and significantly enriched proteins were selected using a permutation-based t-test with FDR set at 5% and s0 = 0. Processed data were filtered using Microsoft Excel to select the hits likely representing true interactions. Typically, proteins with Student's T-test Difference in their LFQ value of &gt;1.2, when compared to ID8 Trp53-/-; Pten-/- 1.15 TurboID, were considered as true interactors. Protein networks were visualized using Cytoscape (v3.9.1) and bubble heatmaps were generated using RStudio (v1.4.1717).</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Integrin Recycling Assay</title><p id="P48">96-well ELISA plates were coated with 50 μl of integrin antibody at the optimised concentration diluted in 0.05M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> pH 9.6 at 4°C overnight and blocked with 5% BSA in TBS-T. Cells at 80% confluence were washed with cold PBS and surface labelling was achieved with 0.13 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin for 1 hr. For internalization, cells were washed with cold PBS and treated with 12-14°C cell medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Medium was removed, cells were washed with pH 8.6 buffer (50mM Tris pH7.5, 100 mM NaCl, adjust pH with 10 M NaOH) and MesNa (95 mM of MesNa in pH 8.6 Buffer) was added to achieve thiol reduction at 4°C for 30 min. Cells were washed with PBS and pre-warmed medium was added to induce recycling at 37°C and for the annotated time points. Cells were washed with PBS and pH 8.6 Buffer, followed by another round of thiol reduction. The reaction was quenched with the addition of 1 ml 20 mM iodoacetamide at 4°C.
