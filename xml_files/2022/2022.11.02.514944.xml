To understand the immune response individuals have from the SARS-CoV-2 infection, we studied the immunoglobulins against the virus’s antigens. The diversified complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) can be used to characterize an antibody. We downloaded four public RNA-seq data sets that were collected between March 2020 and March 2022 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) in our longitudinal analysis. In total, there were 269 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and 26 negative patients who served as a control group. Samples were grouped based on their SARS-CoV-2 variant type and/or the time they were collected. Among 629,137 immunoglobulin V(D)J sequences identified by reconstructing the V(D)J sequences, we found 1011 common V(D)Js (same V gene, J gene and CDR3 sequences in each SARS-CoV-2 positive group) shared by more than one patient in each group and no common V(D)Js were from the negative control group. In our clustering analysis, we identified 129 convergent clusters from the SARS-CoV-2 positive groups. One of these convergent clusters matched the protein sequence of crystal 3D structures of the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). In our longitudinal analysis between the Alpha and Omicron variant, we found 2.7% of common CDR3s were shared although the longitudinal profiling of common V(D)Js was variant specific. Although diverse immunoglobulin profiles were observed, the convergence of common V(D)Js suggests that there exists antibodies with similar antigenic specificities across patients in different groups over various stages of the pandemic.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>complementarity determining region 3</kwd><kwd>convergent</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">When humans are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the immune system will naturally generate antibodies with binding specificity to SARS-CoV-2 and these antibodies can be detected in the blood serum of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. The convergent antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 play an important role in fighting the severity of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. The characterization of antibodies will help elucidate the mechanisms of immune response and find strategies that lead to a potential treatment of COVID-19. Antibodies with highly diversified antigen binding specificity are produced from B-lymphocytes under V(D)J rearrangement that will define the antibody responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The variable structure in the heavy and light chains contain complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), where mutations are prone to occur. The CDR3 of the heavy chain covers the D gene and junction regions of D-J and V-D. The highly mutable CDR3 region could contribute to the diversity of antibodies, which is theoretically estimated at 10<sup>15</sup> variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Therefore, the sequence similarity analysis of CDR3s could infer the specificity of antibodies against antigens.</p><p id="P3">Four antibodies responsive to the earlier SARS-CoV-2 variant (WA-1) have been reported to be able to interact with a wide range of variants of concern (VOCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].

Using routine DE analysis of RNA-seq can easily result in the loss of valuable information in the dataset.

Collectively, in these four data sets, there were 269 COVID-19 positive patients and 26 negative patients. These patients were distributed among 5 different groups (Figure 5a).</p><p id="P6">Samples in Group 1 were collected between March 2020 and April 2020. The data set consisted of 69 blood samples which were extracted from patients who were admitted to either the infectious disease unit or the designated ICU at a university hospital network in northeast France. All the patients in this group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 through a qRT-PCR test which detected COVID-19 nucleic acids using a nasopharyngeal swab.</p><p id="P7">Samples in Group 2 were collected between April 2020 and May 2020 from patients that were admitted to either Albany Medical Center’s medical floor or the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

In total, the data set included 100 blood samples which were extracted from 48 patients. We assigned 32 of the 48 patients to Group 3 as they had been classified as patients who had contracted the Alpha variant. Blood was extracted from patients through three samplings which took place 10 days, 25 days, and 45 days after the patient began feeling symptoms compatible to SARS-CoV-2. All 32 patients had their blood sampled 10 days after the patient started experiencing symptoms, 30 samples were collected 25 days after the patient started experiencing symptoms, and 5 samples were collected 45 days after the patient started experiencing symptoms. In our experiment, we combined each patient’s samplings into one sample.</p><p id="P9">Samples in Group 4 were from the same downloaded dataset as Group 3 but were classified as patients who had contracted the E484K escape mutation of the Alpha variant. There were 13 patients who tested positive for the mutation and samples were collected through three different samplings. All 13 patients were sampled 10 days after experiencing symptoms, 10 patients were sampled 25 days after experiencing symptoms, and 7 patients were sampled 45 days after experiencing symptoms. In this group, each patient’s samplings was combined as well.</p><p id="P10">Samples in Group 5 were collected between December 2021 and March 2022 from patients that were infected with the Omicron variant. Patients in this group were admitted due to either testing positive after attending an outpatient clinic at Krnakenhaus St. Vinzenz Zams using the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test or being in contact with a family member who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 47 of the blood samples were collected zero, one, two, three, four, and five days after patients had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the qRT-PCR test. 14 patients were sampled on day 0, 7 patients were sampled on day 1, 14 patients were sampled on day 2, 7 patients were sampled on day 3, 2 patients were sampled on day 4, and 3 patients were sampled on day 5.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Reconstruction of VDJs and Longitudinal Analysis</title><p id="P11">The workflow is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>.

Samples were grouped based on their SARS-CoV-2 variant type and/or the time they were collected. We reconstructed the V(D)Js using an immune repertoire reconstruction tool TRUST4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. A total 629,137 heavy chain VDJs were reconstructed. The V, J and CDR3 regions were annotated based on the VDJ genes from the international ImMunoGeneTics information system (IMGT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and the human genome reference hg38. The immunoglobulins with common VDJs are defined as having the same V and J genes are used and the exact same CDR3 sequences are matched within each group. We identified a total of 1011 common VDJs in groups 1–5 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>. The common VDJs can be found in a diversified number of patients in each group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table S1</xref>). The common VDJs were then analyzed in the longitudinal analysis. A common VDJ (VH4-59, JH4 and CDR3 sequence CARGFDYW) was observed in all five sample groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Five other VDJs were found across four out of the five groups. When comparing Group 3 (infected by Alpha variant) to Group 5 (infected by Omicron variant), we found 13 common VDJs that existed in both groups making up 2.7% of unique common VDJs in the two groups.</p><p id="P19">In order to compare the common VDJs longitudinally (Inter-Group Common VDJs as IGC-VDJs), the frequencies of IGC-VDJs in common VDJs of each group were adjusted by the number of patients in each group (see the calculation of normalized score in methods). The result shows a significant decrease in the normalized score for the patient group infected with the Omicron variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), which may suggest that more patients tend to contain immunoglobulins with Omicron specific VDJs. The normalized score for the SARS-CoV-2 negative groups was zero further suggesting that the immunoglobulins with common VDJs found in other groups correlated with the viral infection.</p><p id="P20">To characterize the common VDJs further, we generated a heatmap of VH gene usages in all five groups. The VH3 gene family has been dominantly used in all groups. However, we observed that IGHV3-30 is more favorited in the variants from the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic such as Group 2 and Group 3 infected by the Alpha variant.

The absence of common V(D)Js in the negative control group’s data set suggests the low antibody titer in normal blood serum and the very diversified VDJs are used for immunoglobulins generated by PBMCs. Our longitudinal study has shown that there are 2.7% common VDJs that exist in patients upon being infected with the Alpha or Omicron variants of COVID-19. The convergent analysis has suggested that the antibodies developed in different patients with similar antigenic specificity may potentially share similar clonotypes. Most of the convergent VDJ clusters are from multiple groups, which indicates that different SARS-CoV-2 VOCs occurring in different pandemic periods may induce similar clonality of B-lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. This phenomenon has also been observed in the influenza virus vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. The CDR3s of Cluster 7 and 11 show high similarity with one amino acid difference in the length of the sequence, which suggests that multiple clusters share similar antigenic specificity. In addition to the convergent CDJ clusters, our analysis result regarding the common VDJs show that most of the antibodies with common VDJs are group specific. The unique antibody profiling in each group suggests diversified immune response profiles were generated upon infection of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="P25">This project provides an efficient way to characterize the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 positive patients. The 3D structure of immunoglobulin Fab fragments in PDB database confirms that one convergent VDJ cluster in our study and provides validation for our analysis. Although the methods in the project were used to characterize antibodies against COVID-19, the procedure can easily be implemented to analyze other antibody-related immune responses against different viral and auto-immune diseases. This method allows us to identify the variable regions of the light chain as well. It is challenging to pair the heavy and light chain using bulk RNA-seq. However, a single cell RNA-seq can be processed for a just few samples and solve this challenge because the bulk RNA-seq aids with the process of identifying the individual samples containing the interesting antibodies. The specificity of convergent antibodies can be screened through the recombinant antibody production system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Table S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS156672-supplement-Supplementary_Table_S1.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" id="d154aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table S2</label><media xlink:href="EMS156672-supplement-Supplementary_Table_S2.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" id="d154aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S10"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the technical advice from the bioinformatics core in the Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; The authors acknowledge the support of the High-Performance Computing for research facility at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center for providing computational resources that have contributed to the research results reported in this paper.
