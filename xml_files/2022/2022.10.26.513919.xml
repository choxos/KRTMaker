Whereas myosin motors transport cargoes on actin filaments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin motors are responsible for translocation along microtubules, driving minus-end-directed and plus-end-directed movements, respectively. The cargoes for these motors, however, often travel bidirectionally, requiring the coordinated activity of the two motor classes. For instance, in neurons, mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> are shuttled bidirectionally to ensure their constant supply to distal regions. Because dynein and kinesin motors are often simultaneously bound to the same cargo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, their activities must be tightly coordinated to allow for efficient transport rather than a futile tug-of-war.</p><p id="P3">Individual motors appear to be in an autoinhibited state by default, with activation driven by binding of adaptor proteins and cargoes.

This interaction has been proposed to involve pivoting of the coiled-coil stalk at a hinge region, which allows docking of a conserved isoleucine-alanine-lysine (IAK) motif in the tail onto the motor domain, thereby locking the complex in a conformation that prevents processive movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.

For example, the mitochondrial transport adaptor TRAK2 forms a complex with both kinesin-1 and dynein-dynactin and links these two motors functionally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. UNC-16, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of the lysosome adaptor JIP3/Syd, was also shown to link kinesin-1 and dynein, allowing for plus-end-directed transport of dynein by kinesin-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.

In the germline syncytium, the oocyte is transcriptionally quiescent and relies on mRNAs provided by the 15 interconnected nurse cells for its development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

At this point, Khc translocates <italic>osk</italic> to the posterior pole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.

At concentrations that allowed single-particle tracking (6.25 nM of each component), we observed transport of <italic>osk</italic> by Khc along microtubules in both the presence and absence of Tm1, albeit at low frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). In the absence of Tm1, 4.8 % (4/84) of Khc transport events co-localized with the <italic>osk</italic> 3’UTR signal. This value did not change significantly in the presence of Tm1 (2.8 %, 1/36; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>), despite 55 % (20/36) of Khc signals co-localizing with Tm1 signals. Correcting for the efficiency of labeling of Tm1 with the fluorophore (57 %) indicated that ~95 % of microtubule-bound Khc molecules were bound to Tm1. The high occupancy of Khc with Tm1 in these experiments is consistent with the strong binding between their interacting domains observed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Mass photometry confirmed high occupancy of Khc with Tm1 at nanomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), as well as the proposed 2:1 stoichiometry of the Khc-Tm1 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. We conclude from these experiments that Khc can associate with <italic>osk</italic> RNA but that the Khc-Tm1 complex does not have substantially higher affinity for the transcript in our assay conditions.</p><p id="P10">We next examined the effect of Tm1 on Khc motility. Without Tm1 present in the assay, microtubule-associated Khc complexes moved with a mean velocity of 0.221 μm s<sup>-1</sup>.

Regulatory functions have been attributed to an auxiliary, ATP-independent microtubule-binding domain (AMB) and the autoinhibitory IAK motif within the Khc tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Whereas the AMB allows for microtubule-sliding by Khc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, the IAK motif inhibits Khc’s ATPase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, and thus processive motility, by binding to the Khc motor domain and locking the two Khc heads in a conformation that prevents neck-linker undocking and ADP-release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. We tested whether the regulatory tail is responsible for Tm1-mediated inhibition of Khc by assessing the effect of Tm1 on the motility of a tailless Khc truncation (Khc910; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). As expected of a Khc without its regulatory tail, Khc910 was hyperactive in the <italic>in vitro</italic> motility assay, exhibiting more processive runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), an increased likelihood of processive movement upon binding microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>), and faster motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) than the full-length motor complex. However, the presence of Tm1 did not inhibit Khc910 motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c-e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The same effects were observed when experiments were performed with <italic>osk</italic> min instead of <italic>osk</italic> 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2c-f</xref>). These observations demonstrate that the regulatory tail of Khc is required for Tm1-mediated inhibition of motility.</p><p id="P13">To assess the relevance of the autoinhibitory IAK motif in the Khc tail for Tm1-mediated inhibition, we deleted this feature whilst leaving the AMB intact. To this end, we produced Khc940, which is truncated C-terminal to the AMB domain. Khc940 was hyperactive (in terms of the number of processive runs, fraction of Khc binding events that resulted in processive motility, and velocity) to a degree comparable to that of Khc910 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b-e</xref>). However, despite the fact that a smaller fraction of Khc940 co-localized with Tm1 as compared with Khc FL and Khc910 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>), Khc940 was sensitive to inhibition by Tm1, as the number of runs, fraction of processive Khc, and Khc velocities were reduced in its presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b-e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).

We also observed that the fraction of Tm1-bound Khc did not differ significantly between Tm1 1-335 and Tm1 FL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).

Because the inhibitory effect of Tm1 is mediated by the auxiliary microtubule-binding region (AMB) within the Khc tail, we reasoned that Tm1 could alter microtubule binding by the tail domain, perhaps by providing an additional interaction with microtubules. In order to test this notion, we performed microtubule-binding assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> with recombinant Tm1 proteins. Tm1 was incubated with polymerized microtubules before pelleting of microtubules, together with bound protein, by ultracentrifugation. As a positive control, we confirmed that both Khc FL and Khc tail partially partitioned into the microtubule-containing pellet fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6a</xref>). A small fraction of Tm1 1-335 also partitioned into the pellet, indicating that the N-terminal or coiled-coil domain of Tm1 can interact with microtubules. However, we did not observe increased partitioning of the Khc tail (Khc 855-975) into the microtubule fraction in the presence of Tm1 1-335 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6b</xref>). This observation indicates that association with Tm1 does not alter the degree of binding of the Khc tail to microtubules.</p><p id="P18">In the crystal structure of the Khc tail bound to Tm1, the Khc coiled coil extends into the AMB domain (last visible aa: 916)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Attempts to crystallize the same Khc construct alone were unsuccessful, raising the possibility that the isolated motor protein is more flexible. It is conceivable that the extended coiled coil of Khc is induced upon Tm1 binding, which could reduce flexibility of the tail, potentially locking it in a conformation that impairs Khc activity. To test this hypothesis, we probed the structure of the Khc alternative cargo-binding domain and tail (Khc 855-975) in solution by NMR spectroscopy. The <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-HSQC NMR spectrum of the Khc tail showed 34 resonances, each corresponding to a backbone N-H correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). Backbone assignment experiments and resulting secondary chemical shifts revealed that the visible peaks are disordered and correspond to aa 937-975, the very C-terminal part of the Khc tail that contains the auto-inhibitory IAK motif. For all tested coiled-coil constructs of Khc, resonances for aa 855-936 were broadened beyond detection due to short transversal relaxation times. The unfavorable relaxation behavior of H-N resonances in coiled-coil structures is caused by slow rotational tumbling of the axis perpendicular to the helix orientation which is, in the case of Khc-Tm1, potentially further slowed down by transient intermolecular oligomerization. The absence of resonances for aa 855-936 is thus consistent with this entire part of the protein forming an extended coiled-coil structure, even in the absence of Tm1. Our data therefore suggest that the AMB domain is part of the structured coiled coil even in absence of Tm1.</p><p id="P19">To further investigate the effect of Tm1-binding on the disordered tail, we performed NMR titration experiments to detect any effects of Tm1 binding on the tail region. Upon titration of increasing amounts of Tm1, there were intensity decreases for several resonances in <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra of Khc 855-975 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b, c</xref>). The affected residues correspond to the IAK motif and its flanking regions. This effect could be observed both in the absence and presence of a U10 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c, d</xref>), and depended on the N-terminal domain of Tm1 because the Tm1 coiled-coil (aa 252-334) construct did not affect the spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e</xref>). These findings are in agreement with our earlier findings that Tm1 inhibits Khc motility in the absence of RNA and that the N-terminal region of Tm1 is required for its inhibitory effect.

To test this notion, we performed NMR titration experiments in which the Khc motor domain (aa Khc 1-365) was added to the tail domain prior to Tm1 1-335 titration. Titration of Khc 1-365 to Khc 855-975 caused intensity losses for several resonances. As expected, the resonances corresponding to the IAK motif (aa 941-948), as well as its flanking residues (aa 936-962), were affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5f, g</xref>). Some resonances in this region also showed chemical shift perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5f, h</xref>). Taken together, these data confirm an interaction between Khc 855-975 (tail) and Khc 1-365 (motor). Additional titration of Tm1 1-335 to this Khc tail-motor complex caused further intensity decreases of the same resonances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5f, g</xref>), showing that Tm1 1-335 can bind to the Khc tail when it is associated with the motor domains. We conclude that binding of the Khc tail to Tm1 and the Khc motor are not mutually exclusive.</p><p id="P21">We therefore tested whether Tm1 can directly affect the interaction of the Khc motor and tail domains in GST-pulldown assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). When used as bait, the GST-tagged Khc tail domain (Khc 855-975) simultaneously captured the Khc motor domain (Khc 1-365) and Tm1 1-335, consistent with our NMR-based evidence that formation of a trimeric complex is possible. However, the fractions of Khc 1-365 and Tm1 1-335 pulled down by GST-Khc 855-975 were low, indicating a rather weak or transient interaction. Upon titration of Tm1 1-335, the amount of motor domain associating with the tail domain was not affected.

In order to obtain information about Khc’s predominant conformation in its free and Tm1-bound states, we measured small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) of Khc and the Khc-Tm1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>). A dimensionless Kratky plot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> of both scattering profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>) shows that Khc and Khc-Tm1 are extended molecules with flexible elements. To identify structures that can explain the scattering curves of Khc and Khc-Tm1, we generated a large pool of Khc and Khc-Tm1 models by connecting coordinates of the structured parts that were generated by AlphaFold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Based on AlphaFold2 predictions, the Khc stalk contains four coiled-coil regions (cc 1-4) connected by flexible hinge regions (hinges 2-4). The stalk is connected to the motor domain’s neck coiled coil by another flexible region (hinge 1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8a</xref>) We subsequently randomized the connecting linker and tail regions to create a large pool of possible structures. In a second step, the C-terminal tail of one chain was pulled into the binding pocket of the motor domain resulting in a second pool of structures with random orientation of the stalk region and the IAK peptide bound to the motor domain dimer. Both pools of structures were sorted by the quality of the fit to the SAXS data.</p><p id="P23">For both Khc and the Khc-Tm1 complex, the structures with the lowest χ<sup>2</sup> values (i.e. best quality fits) all exhibited compact conformations with considerably lower than average values for the radius of gyration (<italic>Rg</italic>). Since the autoinhibited conformations were more compact than the initial pool with randomized linker conformations, there were on average more structures with low χ<sup>2</sup> values in the pools of structures with the IAK motif bound to the motor domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8b</xref>). Inspection of the structural models that best fit the scattering curves indicated that the arrangement of the coiled-coils is different for Khc and Khc-Tm1. Looking at the angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c-d</xref>) of consecutive coiled-coil regions of Khc models, we observed that the conformation of the hinge regions (hinge 2: aa 586-603, hinge 3: aa 707-710 and hinge 4: aa 839-843, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8a</xref>) leads to bent structures of the coiled-coil regions cc1-cc2 and cc3-cc4 and elongated cc2-cc3 orientation, resulting in a triangular shape of the molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8d</xref>). In this conformation, the N- and C-terminal parts of the stalk are separated, and the AMB domain, which mediates inhibition by Tm1, is not in proximity to other stalk regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8d-e</xref>). For Khc-Tm1, the stalk folds at hinge 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8d</xref>), bringing N- and C-terminal halves of the stalk in proximity, with the AMB domain oriented parallel to the N-terminal stalk region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8f</xref>). Fits with single models are a crude approximation because in solution, Khc likely is in a dynamic equilibrium of a multitude of autoinhibited and more open conformations. Nevertheless, such single models reflect a possible predominant or average conformation of the protein. These data therefore suggest that binding of Tm1 to Khc results in a shift of the conformational equilibrium towards different, more compact structures of the Khc stalk domain. The autoinhibited conformation of Khc is likely stabilized by interactions within the Tm1-bound stalk in addition to the motor-tail interaction. This is in agreement with our findings that the Khc AMB domain in complex with Tm1 can inhibit Khc independently of the IAK motif.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Tm1 links inactive Khc to dynein RNPs for minus-end-directed <italic>osk</italic> transport</title><p id="P24">Khc and Tm1 are loaded onto <italic>osk</italic> RNPs in nurse cells prior to dynein-driven transport into the oocyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.
