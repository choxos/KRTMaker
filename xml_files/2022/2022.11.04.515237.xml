Human-animal interactions have led to transmission events of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to wild and captive animals. However, many questions remain about how extensive SARS-CoV-2 exposure is in wildlife, the factors that influence wildlife transmission risk, and whether sylvatic cycles can generate novel variants with increased infectivity and virulence. We sampled 22 different wildlife species in Virginia, U.S.A. We detected widespread exposure to SARS-CoV-2 across six wildlife species. Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the Virginia opossum and had equivocal detections in six additional species. Furthermore, we used whole genome sequencing to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and compare mutations present to known circulating strains. Species that exhibit peridomestic tendencies had high seroprevalence, ranging between 62%-71%, and sites with high human presence had three times higher seroprevalence than low human-use areas across all species combined. SARS-CoV-2 genomic data from an opossum and molecular modeling exposed one previously uncharacterized change to an amino acid residue in the Spike receptor binding domain (RBD), which predicts improved binding between the Spike protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) compared to the dominant variant circulating at the time of collection. Overall, our results highlight widespread exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in wildlife and suggest that areas with high human activity may serve as important points of contact for cross-species transmission. Furthermore, this work highlights the potential role of wildlife as reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Omicron variant</kwd><kwd>cross-species transmission</kwd><kwd>spillover</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>wildlife</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in over 600 million human cases and over 6 million deaths worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). As this pathogen becomes endemic in the human population, one of the greatest threats to public health is the resurgence of more transmissible and virulent SARS-CoV-2 variants. The considerable pathogen pressure imposed by the pandemic has caused concern around whether SARS-CoV-2 will spill into wildlife populations and establish a sylvatic cycle. Establishment of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a new host could result in novel mutations that increase virulence, transmissibility, or confer immune escape, which could negatively impact both human and wildlife populations.</p><p id="P3">Transmission to captive animals has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), but SARS-CoV-2 detections in free-ranging wildlife are currently limited to only a few species including: the white-tailed deer (<italic>Odocoileus virginianus</italic>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>)), and mustelids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) such as the feral mink (<italic>Neovison vison</italic>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>)) and the Eurasian river otter (<italic>Lutra lutra</italic>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>)). Experimental infections and modeling of the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2: ACE2) have shown that numerous wildlife species may be competent hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). However, which wildlife species are infected in natural settings, where exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be indirect and at a lower exposure dose than in laboratory settings, remains unexplored.</p><p id="P4">Since the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, numerous variants have been detected in humans and animals. Some variants that have become dominant in human populations have shown mutations that increase their infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Questions remain about how these mutations will also impact the ability of the virus to infect wildlife. White-tailed deer samples have included lineages found in human samples, likely caused by transmission between humans and the deer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), as well as unique mutations suggestive of deer to deer transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Human peridomestic species, such as deer, skunks, rats, and mice have all been found to be generally susceptible to the virus in laboratory settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). However, the implications of this for transmission to humans is unknown beyond the suggestion that minimal adaptation may be needed for transmission to occur within mink and deer following initial transmission from human to animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p><p id="P5">With increased numbers of susceptible and exposed host species, there is an increased risk of mutations that could lead to more virulent strains both within wildlife populations and humans. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of producing large numbers of mutations, many appear neutral but some are associated with increased transmission rates and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Furthermore, as SARS-CoV-2 adapts to not only human hosts, but potentially a wide diversity of wildlife hosts, there may be increased opportunities for mutations that could have higher infectivity in both humans and wildlife. This could pose a problem for human health due to vaccine development aimed at human specific strains. If wildlife infected with novel strains of SARS-CoV-2 are able to transmit this virus back into human hosts and humans are still susceptible, new dominant strains may emerge, making vaccine failure more likely.</p><p id="P6">In order to examine how widespread SARS-CoV-2 exposure has been in wildlife communities, we collected nasopharyngeal and serum samples from 22 species in Virginia, U.S.A. We used a combination of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and whole genome sequencing as well as neutralizing antibody surveys to examine wildlife exposure to SARS-CoV-2. We also examined the effects of urbanization and human use on seropositivity in animals.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P7">We analyzed 418 samples (415 individuals) from 22 species collected across 35 counties in Virginia, U.S.A. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). We conducted more detailed sampling across 10 species (111 samples; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) from six sites across an urbanization gradient in Southwestern Virginia, where both nasopharyngeal swabs and serum samples were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We amplified RNA from two SARS-CoV-2 genes from a single Virginia opossum (<italic>D. virginiana</italic>; 1.3%, N=80; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Overall PCR prevalence based on just a single gene (<italic>S</italic> or <italic>N</italic>) amplification was ∼5% with equivocal detections in 6 additional species. Red fox (<italic>Vulpes vulpes</italic>; 11.1%, N=9), Virginia opossum (10.0%, N=79), and white-tailed deer (<italic>Odocoileus virginianus;</italic> 10.0%, N=10) had the highest prevalence. Other species with a single gene amplification included the Eastern gray squirrel (<italic>Sciurus carolinensis;</italic> 3.5%, N=86), Eastern cottontail rabbit (<italic>Sylvilagus floridanus</italic>; 6.7%, N=75), raccoon (<italic>Procyon lotor</italic>; 2.2%, N=46), and bobcat (<italic>Lynx rufus;</italic> 50.0%, N=2).</p><p id="P9">At the 50% neutralization cutoff, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in all six species where serum was collected, including the Virginia opossum (62.5%, N=8), striped skunk (<italic>Mephitis mephitis</italic>; 66.7%, N=3), raccoon (<italic>Procyon lotor</italic>; 63.6%, N=11), Eastern grey squirrel (71.4%, N=7), white-footed mouse (<italic>Peromyscus leucopus;</italic> 16.7%, N=6) and the deer mouse (<italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic>; 28.6%, N=14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). Percent neutralization from samples prior to the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 was significantly lower than those collected after SARS-CoV-2 arrival (t=-10.774, P &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). One sample from a squirrel sampled prior to the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 had percent neutralization of 58% (all other samples were substantially lower), and thus the probability of falsely detecting a positive given the 50% cutoff was 0.015 (N=67).</p><p id="P10">Furthermore, given our sample sizes paired with the high seroprevalence of wildlife post-SARS-CoV-2 emergence, the probability of detecting 0 positives in 5 species, and 1 positive in another species was very low (opossums: P&lt;0.0001, skunks: P = 0.0370, white-footed mice: P = 0.1122, deer mice: P = 0.0176; raccoons: P&lt;0.0001; squirrels: P&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). Four samples (two raccoons, one opossum, and one white-footed mouse) had a percent neutralization above a more conservative 80% cut-off, further supporting that SARS-CoV-2 exposure is likely in these species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The opossum with two-gene amplification and WGS, was trapped one month afterwards and serum samples collected revealed a percent neutralization value of 51.1%.</p><p id="P11">We found a positive relationship between urbanization (imperviousness) and wildlife seroprevalence at the 50% cutoff (intercept: -0.61 ± 0.38 SE, urbanization slope 0.04 ± 0.02 SE, <italic>P</italic> = 0.024, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Antibody detections were highest (80%, N=5) at one of the least urban sites which is a highly utilized state park (average imperviousness 1.5%), and more closely matched seroprevalence at two of our urbanized sites (70%, N=10 and 67%, N=12). However, human visitation at this site and other urbanized sites were more than 20x higher compared to the low visitation sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). We found a positive relationship between human presence and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 (univariate linear mixed model with species as a random effect; intercept: -0.039 ± 0.31 SE, human presence coeff: 0.764 ± 0.31 SE, <italic>P =</italic> 0.014; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). Additionally, we found a similar positive relationship between human residence and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 (intercept: -0.039 ± 0.31 SE; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>, human presence coeff: 0.726 ± 0.31 SE, <italic>P =</italic> 0.019; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We conducted WGS of the SARS-CoV-2 variant detected in the opossum which revealed several mutations shared within the Omicron clade as well as a unique amino acid substitution not previously identified in other human-infected SARS-CoV-2 virus at the time of collection (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The opossum sequence shared defining mutations in <italic>ORF1a</italic>/<italic>b, S, E</italic>, and <italic>M</italic> genes found in the BA.2 Omicron lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P13">At the time of the sample collection and genomic analysis, May 2022, we could not confidently assign a variant name. However, more recent phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome showed the isolate clustered within the NextStrain clade 21L (BA.2; Omicron) and assigned the PANGO lineage BA.2.10.1, also named BJ.1, using UShER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This Omicron sub-linage includes the G<sup>798</sup>D mutation found in the Spike protein. The nearest neighbor (EPI_ISL_14334179), which was detected in New York state after our sampling, contains all the nucleotide and amino acid mismatches as the opossum sequence as compared to the reference sequence from Wuhan, China, except for A22974T (E<sup>471</sup>V) which appears to be unique to the opossum.</p><p id="P14">The E<sup>471</sup>V mutation is located in the receptor-binding motif (RBM, residues 437 to 508) within the receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues 319 to 541) of the S protein. The RBD is necessary for binding the viral S protein to ACE2 in both human and animal cells and is, in addition, therapeutically targeted by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We performed a detailed computational investigation into the impact of the E<sup>471</sup>V and G<sup>798</sup>D mutations for the structure of the S protein using molecular modeling and molecular mechanics/generalized borne surface area (MM/GBSA) free energy calculations. The open conformation structure of the S protein trimer from the glycosylated BA.2 Omicron variant was used for residue variant mapping [PDB 7XO8; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>)]. Because the crystal structure shows the trimer bound to the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor, it is possible to investigate the impact of mutations in the RBD on interactions between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and hACE2, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Our free energy studies showed predicted free energy of binding between the E<sup>471</sup>V-carrying mutation in S improved, compared to that of BA.2, for binding to hACE2 (-76.5 and -60.2 kcal/mol for E471V vs. BA.2, respectively). Residue 471 is predicted to be part of a flexible, hydrophobic loop that interacts with the N-terminal domain of ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Several point mutations (A<sup>475</sup>V, S<sup>477</sup>G, V<sup>483</sup>A, F<sup>490</sup>L) within this loop region have experimentally shown to improve S protein – hACE2 binding affinity and increased resistance to neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Our analysis using normalized Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy scores and surface maps show a more hydrophobic interaction surface at not just position 471, but also among flanking residues 469-474 (0.8) compared to BA.2 [-2.6; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>)].</p><p id="P16">We located a second missense mutation, G<sup>798</sup>D, in the S2 subunit of the S protein (residues 686 to 1,273) and within the fusion peptide domain (residues 788 to 806) in close proximity to the N<sup>801</sup> glycosylation site. Interestingly, D<sup>798</sup> changed the probability of glycosylation at N<sup>801</sup> (0.48) as compared to BA.2 [0.61, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>)] and could impact structural stability and membrane interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Our combined results suggest that a wide breadth of species may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the wild. We detected positives in six species using RT-qPCR and neutralizing antibodies in an additional four species. We found support for a relationship between human presence and seroprevalence suggesting that areas with high human activity may serve as potential hotspots for cross-species transmission. Analysis of isolates collected from infected wildlife revealed novel mutations at the time of collection, some of which have subsequently been found circulating in other regions. Some of these mutations likely increase binding affinity to the hACE2 receptor or confer some antibody resistance compared to ancestral BA.2 lineages. Whether these mutations developed in humans not captured in surveillance at the time or in wildlife communities and were transmitted back to humans remains unknown but presents an important consideration for future variant surveillance.</p><p id="P18">SARS-CoV-2 PCR prevalence among wildlife was generally low and ranged from 1.6-20.0%. We found that 10.0% of opossums, a marsupial, were PCR positive (including equivocal detections), similar to PCR prevalence in white-tailed deer (10.0%) we tested. High seroprevalence (62%) and a single opossum with viral RNA at sufficient levels for WGS suggests this species may have high exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in natural settings. The SARS-CoV-2-positive opossum with two gene amplification was recaptured at the same site ∼30 days later, and was positive for antibodies (51.1 % neutralization), supporting that the serology data reflect previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="P19">We used a 50% neutralization cut-off value for our serological analyses of human use. We acknowledge that one sample collected prior to the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 had a percent neutralization value of 58% (a significantly higher percent neutralization than any of the other 66 samples; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, probability of false positive= 0.015). Given our post-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates, the probability that we detected no positive samples in five species and one positive in one species prior to SARS-CoV-2 was very low (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). A more conservative estimate such as raising the cutoff to 60%, would still yield positive samples from five of the six species we sampled. However, a conclusively RT-qPCR positive opossum that was sampled one month later had a percent neutralization of only 51.1% (purple diamond, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), suggesting that more conservative estimates may miss previously exposed animals. Interestingly, samples below our 50% cutoff (classified as negative in our analyses) still tended to have higher percent neutralization post-SARS-CoV-2, possibly indicating waning immunity at the time of sampling.</p><p id="P20">Our seroprevalence results generally aligned with both experimental infection studies (e.g whether the species seroconverted) and predicted susceptibility based on ACE2 modeling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S8</xref>). Raccoons and skunks have been shown experimentally to be seroconvert following SARS-CoV-2 exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) and both had high seroprevalence in our study (64% and 67%, respectively). Deer mice have also been shown to be capable of viral shedding and producing neutralizing antibodies in the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), are predicted to have high susceptibility, and had moderately high seroprevalence in this study (29%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S8</xref>). Eastern gray squirrels have not been evaluated through molecular modeling or experimental infections, but we had detections through both RT-qPCR (1.6%) and serology (71.4%). However, modeling of the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (ACE2), with closely related species (red squirrels, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>)) predicted high susceptibility. Recent research has shown that the omicron (B.1.1.529) ACE2 binding affinity is greater in a number of wildlife species than in humans, including five marsupials (one of which is the Gray short-tailed opossum (<italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>)), white-footed mouse, red fox, and two marmots, while deer mice and white-tailed deer were marginally below humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). This suggests that for species evaluated with earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants that did not seroconvert (fox squirrels) or shed virus (raccoons and squirrels), competence may now be higher with newer variants.</p><p id="P21">Many of the species in this study are considered human peridomestics and live in and around human settlements. Many of these species’ range across large areas of North America and some have been introduced into Europe (gray squirrels and raccoons) and Asia (raccoons) and have close relatives across the globe. It is unknown whether a sylvatic cycle has been established in the species we evaluated, however, their close connection to human populations makes them important species for continued monitoring as they could be important for transmission to and from humans.</p><p id="P22">Our analyses revealed a relationship between human presence, urbanization and seroprevalence among sites. This suggests that wildlife in areas with more human activity likely have higher exposure to SARS-CoV-2, leading to more wildlife infections. Interestingly, the site with the highest seroprevalence was a forested recreational trail that receives high human visitation but is less developed. This suggests that recreational sites may be important points of contact between humans and wildlife and could be targeted for surveillance. Humans and wildlife rarely come into direct contact, but numerous indirect links likely exist. Wastewater has been proposed as a potential source for indirect exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), however, in rural areas where septic tanks are a dominant form of wastewater management, this is unlikely to be the only source. Instead, other forms of human waste, like trash receptacles, may serve as important sources of indirect exposure for wildlife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Urban wildlife are regularly exposed to human refuse and have developed positive associations with discarded food, which could serve as a bridge for transmission between humans, companion animals, and wild species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). We regularly captured wildlife using traps baited with cat food and other common food items such as peanut butter, and thus may have attracted individuals with natural proclivities for human associated foods, thus inflating prevalence (e.g., these are the individuals who are already regularly coming into indirect contact with humans). More research is needed to understand transmission chains between humans, pets, and wildlife.</p><p id="P23">SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the opossum showed mutations in the RBM of the RBD of the S protein. The previously uncharacterized amino acid change is predicted to improve S-hACE2 binding compared to omicron BA.2, potentially providing a fitness advantage by either increasing the affinity of S for the ACE2 receptor or, alternatively, by evading the neutralizing activity of antibodies. These mutations were not observed in human samples at the time of isolation from the opossum and have only recently been identified in the Omicron sub-variant (BJ.1), with one mutation still remaining novel to the opossum sample. These results highlight the possible role of wildlife in contributing unique mutations that may be more transmissible to humans, as has been previously suggested with the emergence of the Omicron variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Summary</title><p id="P24">Wildlife were sampled using nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs through active captures as well as through submissions to wildlife centers.

We anesthetized and swabbed all animals and collected blood from a subset of individuals. Urbanization was calculated as the percent of impervious surface and adjusted based on the home range of each species captured. Human activity was estimated based on trail counters, visitation records or extrapolated from census data.

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among species has the potential to generate new and more virulent variants, posing a threat to both public health and animal populations. However, the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect wildlife other than white tailed deer and mustelids in nature remains unknown. We examined exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in 22 wildlife species, which are commonly found across the Eastern U.S. We found widespread SARS-CoV-2 exposure in six common wildlife species, which was elevated in areas with high human activity. Our results highlight the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to spread through wildlife communities.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Location of the six study sites and counties where viral swabs were collected (larger panel).</title><p>Orange shading represents imperviousness with darker shades of orange representing more urban areas.

The inset panel represents all the counties where nasopharyngeal swabs were collected (from both wildlife rehabilitation centers and the 6 study sites). Darker green counties represent larger sample sizes. Each of the colored circles represents different trap locations and the colors indicates study site where we collected samples from live individuals within four counties in Virginia.

Detections for RT-qPCR include species with &gt;5 individuals sampled and both panels include the prevalence and 95% confidence intervals. Black points in panel (A) represent prevalence based on amplification of two of the three genes (N, S, and E) while estimates in gray include samples that amplified on a single gene. All samples had a Cq value &lt;40. The size of each point in panel (B) is in relation to the percent neutralization. Samples with a 50% or greater percent neutralization were considered positive samples. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.
