Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have led to an increased ability to interrogate the mitochondrial genome for low-frequency mutations associated with various disease states. Mitochondrial DNA mutations have been associated with ageing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and a myriad of disease phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Disorders caused by inherited and acquired mitochondrial DNA variants affect ~1 in 4,300 of the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. These variants were initially thought to solely originate from matrilineal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA molecules, however more recent studies have shown that somatic mutations also occur in mtDNA over time and in a tissue-specific manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. There are hundreds-to-thousands of mitochondrial DNA molecules in every human cell. This number is dependent on the tissue, cell type and energy state of the mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The fluctuating, multi-copy nature of mitochondrial DNA means that mutations can be present at any frequency within a cell, unlike the diploid nuclear genome. The presence and frequency of mitochondrial DNA mutations is referred to as mitochondrial heteroplasmy. While there appears to be a threshold frequency for the impact of some heteroplasmic variants on human health in relation to some conditions; the specific variants and their required pathogenic frequency has yet to be established for acquired somatic mitochondrial mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Mitochondrial heteroplasmy has been increasingly investigated as a contributor to human disease. To date, it has been linked to various diseases including cardiomyopathy, hypertension, epilepsy, Parkinsons disease and optic neuropathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Elevated heteroplasmy levels have also been linked to tumor aggressiveness and poor cancer prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. These studies demonstrate that high resolution mitochondrial heteroplasmy analyses could be used to identify molecular mechanisms that drive some disease states. Additionally, evidence suggests that mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy could be used for diagnosis/prognosis of particular conditions and even perhaps as a therapeutic target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Given these findings, it is important that mitochondrial heteroplasmy, particularly low frequency heteroplasmy, can be identified and quantified as a part of disease-related studies. Such investigations require high to ultra-high sequencing coverage (&gt;1000X - &gt;10,000X) of the mitochondrial genome in order to reliably quantitate low frequency heteroplasmy with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. Currently, this is typically achieved by using probe hybridisation/capture or long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to enrich mitochondrial DNA.</p><p id="P9">Probe hybridisation/capture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> uses complementary probes that bind mitochondrial sequences to separate mtDNA from nuclear DNA. Another approach is long-range PCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> which amplifies the entire mitochondrial genome, typically in two, overlapping fragments. Both probe hybridization and long-range PCR amplification require complementary binding of probes/primers to enrich mtDNA from whole DNA extracts. Widespread use of these methodologies in many heteroplasmy studies is due to their ease, amenability to high-throughput processes and efficacy of producing mtDNA appropriate for ultra-deep sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. These sequence-dependent methods are imperfect. Probes and primers designed to match reference alleles may select against rare heteroplasmic variants that are of interest. Additionally, PCR amplification is known to introduce errors that may appear as false positive heteroplasmic variants. Arguably, the most problematic issue for these techniques is the contamination of nuclear-mitochondrial elements (NUMTs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">NUMTs are nuclear sequences that share high levels of sequence identity with mtDNA. They arose from the somatic translocation of mitochondrial DNA into the nuclear genome. The number, size and sequence of NUMTs varies within species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, including between human populations and indivduals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The entire mitochondrial genome is represented in the human nuclear genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. As a result, it is extremely difficult to design primers or hybridization probes that will selectively enrich mitochondrial DNA without also enriching NUMT sequences. Multiple studies have found that NUMT contamination was present in mtDNA sequencing data that used either probe hybridisation or PCR amplification to enrich mtDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Most notably, NUMT contamination is thought to explain the apparent paternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA in humans that was reported in PNAS in 2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The difficulty posed by deciphering NUMT contamination from true mitochondrial DNA may require the use of a sequence-independent capture method of mitochondrial enrichment.</p><p id="P11">In this study we have adapted a previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> sequence-independent and PCR-free technique which relies on differential centrifugation and alkaline lysis to separate mitochondria from other tissue/cellular debris. We provide evidence that this method can be effectively used to isolate mitochondrial DNA from different tissue types for subsequent mtDNA sequencing. We achieved ultra-deep coverage of the mitochondrial genome when this approach was combined with an appropriate Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data pipeline. To demonstrate the proof-of-concept, we employed <italic>Polg</italic> mutator mice as positive controls to compare this methodology with long-range PCR amplification enrichment of mtDNA. These mice lack the ability to ‘proof-read’ their mitochondrial DNA and as a result, gather single nucleotide mutations at a much higher frequency than their wild-type counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We propose that this method can be applied to a range of species to allow researchers to reliably investigate mitochondrial heteroplasmy and expand our current knowledge of the contribution of somatic mitochondrial mutations to human ageing and disease. This methodology negates the impact of NUMT contamination and PCR error introduction when assessing heteroplasmy and is therefore more sensitive and accurate than long-range PCR amplification. We refer to this method as Mito-SiPE.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P12">The Mito-SiPE technique for enriching mtDNA for sequencing is rooted in classic cell biology and biochemistry methods for subcellular fractionation. It utilizes a combination of differential centrifugation and alkaline lysis to separate the mitochondria from nuclear and cytoplasmic cellular components. The resulting preparation is then used to purify mitochondrial DNA with minimal contamination from nuclear DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To test this method across a range of inputs, we used seven different mouse tissues; brain, heart, lung, kidney, liver, spleen and muscle. Mitochondrial copy number was assessed <italic>via</italic> quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in enriched samples from the seven tissues and compared to unenriched, whole DNA extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). qPCR was used to calculate the ratio of mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA, which provides an estimate of the average mtDNA copy number per cell. A significant increase (100-1,000 fold, P &lt; 0.0005) in mitochondrial DNA copy number was observed in samples that underwent enrichment. This effect was present across the 7 tissues of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Comparison of two alignment strategies to assess nuclear contamination</title><p id="P13">The performance of this technique to produce pure, high-quality mtDNA for next-generation DNA sequencing was assessed by applying the method to 163 samples across seven different mouse tissues. These samples were then sequenced across four lanes of the Illumina NovaSeq platform. After quality control, alignment and removal of duplicates, the number of mitochondrial, nuclear and unmapped reads were assessed for each sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Of the mapped reads, an average of 75% ±20% were mapped to the mitochondrial genome and 25% ±20% to the nuclear genome. Unmappable reads made up 0.26±0.63% of the total reads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The level of nuclear contamination in samples originating from brain, heart, kidney and liver was extremely low with higher levels found in lung, muscle and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Two alignment strategies were used to assess the coverage of the mitochondrial genome and the distribution of nuclear contamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The first method aligned filtered reads to the whole genome and then isolated mitochondrial-aligned reads. The second method aligned all the reads to the mitochondrial genome first, then mapped any remaining unaligned reads to the nuclear genome. Coverage across the mitochondrial genome and distribution of nuclear contamination were assessed after duplicate removal. Average coverage across the mitochondrial genome exceeded 50,000X at each base pair and was dependent on tissue of origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>). Lung, muscle and spleen had lower levels of coverage due to the higher levels of reads mapped to nuclear DNA in these samples. Mapping to the whole genome first caused a loss in coverage between nucleotide positions 7,500-11,000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, top). This dip in coverage was not observed when reads were first aligned to the mitochondrial genome using the second alignment strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, bottom). The latter method did not lead to an overall increase in sequencing coverage across the rest of the mitochondrial genome, indicating that nuclear reads were not misaligned to the mitochondrial genome when this method was used.</p><p id="P15">As this mtDNA enrichment method is sequence-independent, any reads originating from nuclear DNA should have been randomly distributed throughout the whole genome. To test this hypothesis, the distribution of nuclear contamination was assessed using both alignment strategies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>). When reads were aligned to the whole genome, nuclear contamination appeared to be evenly distributed across the nuclear genome as expected, except for chromosome 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>, top). Aligning the reads to the mitochondrial genome first did not produce this same anomaly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>, bottom and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). This is due to an NUMT found on chromosome 1 of the reference genome that shares 100% sequence identity of its homologous sequence in the mitochondrial genome. As a result, the alignment tool (bwa) mapped ~50% of reads originating from this region to the mitochondrial genome and ~50% incorrectly, to the homologous NUMT on chromosome 1 when reads were mapped to the whole genome. This artefact was eliminated when reads were mapped to the mitochondrial genome first. Chromosomes 2 and 9 also had slightly elevated levels of mapped reads when compared to the rest of the genome. This effect was produced by both alignment strategies. However, further investigation showed that this was caused by the alignment of highly repetitive reads from across the genome to the same loci on chromosomes 2 and 9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 2,3 and Supplementary Fig 4,5</xref>, respectively). Mapping to the mitochondrial genome first appeared to be more effective at mapping true mitochondrial reads correctly, without increasing levels of spurious alignments. This alignment methodology was used to assess heteroplasmy levels in the tissues of <italic>Polg</italic><sup>D257A/D257A</sup> and <italic>Polg</italic><sup>wt/wt</sup> mice to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of Mito-SiPE.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Sequence coverage and heteroplasmy in samples prepared with Mito-SiPE compared to lrPCR</title><p id="P16">Mito-SiPE and long-range PCR (lrPCR) were applied to the Polg mice. There was an average of 7.15 x 10<sup>7</sup> reads produced per sample across all studied groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>; n=48). A higher average number of reads was observed in the lrPCR amplified samples (7.22 and 7.19 x 10<sup>7</sup>, <italic>Polg</italic><sup>D257A/D257A</sup> (n=12) and <italic>Polg</italic><sup>wt/wt</sup> (n=12), respectively) compared to the Mito-SiPE samples (7.15 and 7.02 x 10<sup>7</sup> <italic>Polg</italic><sup>D257A/D257A</sup> and <italic>Polg</italic><sup>wt/wt</sup>, respectively). The proportion of reads mapped to the mitochondrial genome was also higher in the lrPCR amplification samples than the Mito-SiPE samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). The average coverage across the mitochondrial genome was higher in the lrPCR amplified samples (average depth 137,000X compared to the Mito-SiPE average of 123,000X). However, these samples had a loss in coverage towards the end of the two overlapping fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>, left). The Mito-SiPE samples, broadly, had uniform coverage across the entire mitochondrial genome compared to the lrPCR samples. <italic>Polg</italic><sup>D257A/D257A</sup> samples displayed minor region-specific fluctuations in coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>, right). This effect was not observed in the samples amplified with lrPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>, middle).</p><p id="P17">Three metrics were measured to assess heteroplasmy levels in <italic>Polg</italic><sup>D257A/D257A</sup> and <italic>Polg</italic><sup>wt/wt</sup> tissues: the number of heteroplasmic sites, the average alternative allele frequency (heteroplasmy frequency) and cumulative heteroplasmic burden. These three metrics are not independent and have previously been reported in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The number of heteroplasmic sites is the number of nucleotide positions at which an alternative allele was identified above the threshold frequency (0.2%) in a sample. Alternative allelic calls caused by sequencing error are present below this frequency and are indistinguishable from low-frequency heteroplasmy. Average heteroplasmy is the mean frequency of all variants observed in a sample above the threshold frequency. Finally, cumulative heteroplasmic burden is the sum of all variant frequencies that were identified above the threshold frequency in a sample.</p><p id="P18">More heteroplasmic sites were observed in the <italic>Polg</italic><sup><italic>D257A/D257A</italic></sup> mice than wild-type, in brain, liver and kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>, top). No difference was observed between <italic>Polg</italic><sup><italic>D257A/D257A</italic></sup> males and females, however there was a significant difference between sexes of <italic>Polg</italic><sup><italic>wt/wt</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>, top, left panels vs right panels). There were significantly fewer heteroplasmic sites found in Mito-SiPE preps of both male and female <italic>Polg</italic><sup><italic>wt/wt</italic></sup> as well as <italic>Polg</italic><sup><italic>D257A/D257A</italic></sup> males compared to lrPCR enrichment. This effect was not statistically significant in female <italic>Polg</italic><sup><italic>D257A/D257A</italic></sup> tissues. The difference between enrichment assays was larger in <italic>Polg</italic><sup><italic>D257A/D257A</italic></sup> samples than in <italic>Polg</italic><sup><italic>wt/wt</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 6</xref>). When examining cumulative heteroplasmic burden, similar overall results were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>, middle). Lower burden was detected in Mito-SiPE prep enriched samples compared to lrPCR in the same 3 of 4 comparisons. Average heteroplasmy, however, displayed contrasting results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>, bottom). <italic>Polg</italic><sup><italic>D257A/D257A</italic></sup> mice had lower average heteroplasmy levels than <italic>Polg</italic><sup><italic>wt/wt</italic></sup> mice.

This is because heterozygous female breeders have an intermediate phenotype. Long-range PCR amplification enrichment was performed on total DNA extracted from brain, kidney and liver of two wild-type C57BL6/J males.

We conclude that this methodology works most effectively with brain, heart, liver and kidney samples, however sufficient results can also be obtained in samples originating from lung, muscle and spleen. The cause of the disparity between tissues is unknown, however, we hypothesise that it may be related to the amount of starting material, the mechanical properties of the tissues and mitochondrial copy number before enrichment. There are three main advantages of this method over the current standard: 1) It does not require complementary binding of reference probes/primers to mitochondrial DNA, 2) PCR amplification is not required and therefore generates no polymerase errors during enrichment and 3) Any nuclear contamination present is randomly distributed across the nuclear genome and therefore does not result in NUMT enrichment leading to false interpretation of any resulting data.</p><p id="P22">The sequencing depth achieved using this methodology exceeds that of many heteroplasmy studies to date, even in the tissues where enrichment was less effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. High coverage of the mitochondrial genome allows for a more sensitive assessment of low frequency mutations and changes in heteroplasmy frequency. The number of reads (average 22.4 million per sample, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) produced through sequencing in this study could be reduced by up-to 5-fold and would still be sufficient to achieve coverage levels in line with previous studies (typically less than 10,000X). This would reduce the sequencing costs, increase throughput and enable the study of mitochondrial heteroplasmy across many samples by taking advantage of high-throughput sequencing. Our results also suggest that sufficient sequencing coverage could be achieved even with lower-capacity sequencing platforms.</p><p id="P23">An alternative bioinformatics pipeline is required when this technique is utilized. Typically, it is advised to align all sequencing data to the whole reference genome before isolating mitochondrial reads to avoid spurious alignment of nuclear reads to the mitochondrial genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. However, due to the lack of sequence-specific enrichment when using this technique, we demonstrate that a different approach is optimal. When reads are aligned to the reference genome first, mitochondrial reads are incorrectly aligned to homologous regions in the nuclear genome, most prominently, chromosome 1. This effect in this study, it should be noted, is specific to the mouse reference genome; however, future studies may assess whether the same effect is observed in human alignments or indeed in other species. As we demonstrate here, mapping reads to the mitochondrial genome first did not appear to lead to an increase in spurious alignment of nuclear reads to the mitochondrial genome and produced uniform sequencing coverage.</p><p id="P24">Nuclear-mitochondrial sequences have been identified as an important source of artefacts in heteroplasmy analysis. By employing Mito-SiPE, we find that any nuclear contamination present in the resultant sequence data is randomly distributed across the nuclear genome. It is pertinent to note, however, that although NUMT contamination is not enriched in this study, it does not mean that NUMT contamination is entirely absent. This is an important point as the number and size of all NUMTs have not been fully elucidated for most species and varies within species, and even between individuals. The effect of NUMT contamination when using this technique will be minimised in the tissues that contain less nuclear contamination e.g., brain, heart, kidney and liver.</p><p id="P25">Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy has been assessed in different ways across a number of studies. Number of heteroplasmic sites, average alternative allele frequency and cumulative heteroplasmic burden are all metrics that have been considered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.

These findings are in line with previous studies, however the number of mutations detected appear to be higher in the data presented here. This may be due to the high levels of coverage achieved and a lower minimum threshold of alternative allele frequency (0.2%) utilised in this study. Interestingly, <italic>Polg</italic><sup>wt/wt</sup> mice displayed higher average alternative allele frequencies than <italic>Polg</italic><sup>D257A/D257A</sup>. This effect, at first observation, is in stark contrast to what has been recorded previously and is not what one would expect from the literature. However, the high number of low-frequency heteroplasmies identified in <italic>Polg</italic><sup>D257A/D257A</sup> tissues may have caused a decrease in the overall average heteroplasmy levels (average alternative allele frequency) compared to <italic>Polg</italic><sup>wt/wt</sup> as a result of the high sequencing depth achieved across all samples. This result highlights the importance of looking at multiple measures of heteroplasmy to obtain an accurate assessment of the levels of mitochondrial DNA mutation that are present in a sample.</p><p id="P26">Mitochondrial DNA enriched <italic>via</italic> lrPCR amplification had a higher number of heteroplasmic sites and cumulative heteroplasmic burden than DNA enriched using the Mito-SiPE method. This difference was larger in <italic>Polg</italic><sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mice than in <italic>Polg</italic><sup>wt/wt</sup>. There are two likely explanations for this observation. The first, that rounds of PCR amplification cause PCR errors that are subsequently identified as mitochondrial heteroplasmy, although a high-fidelity polymerase is used to negate this impact as much as possible. The second mechanism is that NUMT regions in the nuclear genome are being co-amplified and thus are mistaken for heteroplasmic, mitochondrial reads. If the first mechanism was the leading cause, it is unexpected that the difference would be higher in <italic>Polg</italic><sup>D257A/D257A</sup> tissues than in <italic>Polg</italic><sup>wt/wt</sup>, as the error rate of the polymerase used for amplification should remain constant. Co-amplification of NUMT regions, however, could be affected by changes in mtDNA copy number – a feature that has previously been identified in <italic>Polg</italic> mutator mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Changes in mtDNA copy number may directly affect the amount of mispriming of NUMTs that occurs during lrPCR. Whilst our results cannot rule out either mechanism, this evidence suggests that co-amplification of NUMT regions as a more likely/influential mechanism for what would be interpreted as false positive heteroplasmic variants identified in PCR amplified samples. The metric of average alternative allele frequency did not display this same pattern but as explained previously, it is influenced by the presence of many apparent, low-frequency heteroplasmies that are identified when using lrPCR amplification at these sequencing depths and heteroplasmy threshold. This effect was even more dramatic when lrPCR was compared to mtDNA enrichment prep of C57BL6 wild-type tissues. This is largely due to the high baseline of mutation that is present in <italic>Polg</italic><sup>wt</sup> due to the intermediate phenotype of female breeder mice.</p><p id="P27">Finally, a tissue-specific effect on the levels of heteroplasmy was observed using the Mito-SiPE method in <italic>Polg</italic><sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mice. Spleen and colon samples had higher levels of heteroplasmy compared to heart, kidney, liver and lung, whereas, brain samples had lower levels. Heart, kidney, liver and lung were indistinguishable from one-another. This is an interesting finding, as previous studies have identified strong, tissue-specific effects of mitochondrial heteroplasmy in more tissues than what is reported here<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. It is possible that enrichment methods used in previous studies have identified false heteroplasmic variants due to NUMT co-enrichment, and thus the differences observed are due to mtDNA copy number changes, rather than true mtDNA mutations. It is also possible, however, that the levels of coverage and low thresholds used in this study have led to this difference.</p><p id="P28">The limitation of this methodology is that it requires the availability of tissue for enrichment and as such it may not be feasible for archived DNA samples. DNA purified from intact cells and tissues using standard methods are predominantly nuclear DNA. These preparations and already existing NGS data are not compatible with this method, although such datasets are likely to have elevated NUMT contamination. However, with the explosion of interest in mtDNA and increasing levels of heteroplasmy-focused research, this method will provide an important tool for future explorations of mtDNA variation and its role in ageing and disease.</p><p id="P29">In conclusion, differential centrifugation and alkaline lysis may be used to enrich mitochondrial DNA eliminating the need forPCR amplification or probe hybridization. Avoiding sequence-dependent techniques greatly reduces the effect of NUMT contamination, a problem which has been identified in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. This technique, in addition to a modified bioinformatics pipeline, can be applied to different tissues and achieves ultradeep sequencing coverage. It provides a straightforward and robust workflow to assess heteroplasmy in mitochondrial DNA. This technique outperforms long-range PCR amplification and negates the potential impact of PCR errors and NUMT contamination on heteroplasmy analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Breeding and tissue harvesting</title><p id="P30">All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Animal Care and Use Committee prior to animal experiments.
