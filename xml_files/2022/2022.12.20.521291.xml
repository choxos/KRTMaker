For example, while many broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza have been found to target the highly conserved stem region of hemagglutinin (HA-stem), the immune response to seasonal influenza vaccines is predominantly directed to the immunodominant but variable head region (HA-head), leading to narrow-spectrum efficacy. Here, we first introduce an approach to controlling antigen orientation based on the site-specific insertion of short stretches of aspartate residues (oligoD) that facilitates antigen-binding to alum adjuvants. We demonstrate the generalizability of this approach to antigens from the Ebola virus, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza and observe enhanced antibody responses following immunization in all cases. Next, we use this approach to reorient HA in an “upside down” configuration, which we envision increases HA-stem exposure, therefore also improving its immunogenicity compared to HA-head. When applied to HA of H2N2 A/Japan/305/1957, the reoriented H2 HA (reoH2HA) on alum induced a stem-directed antibody response that cross-reacted with both group 1 and 2 influenza A HAs. Our results demonstrate the possibility and benefits of antigen reorientation <italic>via</italic> oligoD insertion, which represents a generalizable immunofocusing approach readily applicable for designing epitope-focused vaccine candidates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F5" position="anchor"><label>Graphical Abstract</label><caption><p id="P3">Seasonal influenza vaccines induce a biased antibody response against the variable head of hemagglutinin, whereas conserved epitopes on the stem are a target for universal vaccines.

In the case of influenza, current vaccines elicit strain-specific antibody responses against the immunodominant but variable head region of HA (HA-head) that undergoes antigenic drift, necessitating annual updates of seasonal influenza vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. When a novel zoonotic influenza virus acquires the ability of sustained human-to-human transmission, existing vaccine-induced immunity is unlikely to confer protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Such risks highlight the importance of pandemic preparedness and the urgent need to generate a universal vaccine that protects against diverse influenza strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">A potential strategy for developing more broadly protective vaccines is to focus the immune response (referred to as immunofocusing) on antigenic regions that are less likely to evolve. Since the stem region of HA (HA-stem) contains highly conserved epitopes across different influenza subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, focusing the antibody response on HA-stem and away from the immunodominant HA-head is a promising approach. Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting HA-stem show broad neutralizing activity and protect animals from lethal challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. HA-stem-directed antibodies also correlate with protection from infection and disease in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Current immunofocusing approaches include sequential immunization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> or mosaic display<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> of heterologous HAs, or chimeric HAs that contain the same HA-stem but varying HA-head to stimulate a stem-directed response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. These approaches require complicated vaccination regimens and do not directly address the immunodominance of HA-head<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Other immunofocusing approaches include masking HA-head with glycosylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> or PEGylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, or structure-based design of HA-stem-only immunogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. While epitope masking often leads to reduced immunogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, the generation of HA-stem-only proteins requires laborious rounds of design, screening, and optimization of antigens to retain the proper presentation of conformational epitopes. Ultimately, although these strategies have found some success in inducing cross-reactivity among a particular phylogenetic group (i.e., group 1 or 2) of influenza A HAs, it remains a challenge to elicit a consistent response to both groups from a single immunogen.</p><p id="P7">Here, we investigate the hypothesis that antigen reorientation is a straightforward and effective immunofocusing strategy. More specifically, we test if the reorientation of HA in an “upside-down” configuration from its natural presentation on influenza virions would sterically occlude HA-head and redirect the antibody response to the more exposed HA-stem. Interestingly, stem-directed (but not head-directed) mAbs isolated from vaccinated individuals exhibit significantly reduced binding to the whole virus as compared to recombinant HA proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that steric occlusion leads to poor accessibility of HA-stem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, thereby biasing antibody responses toward HA-head during natural infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">To control antigen orientation, we first develop an approach based on the site-specific insertion of short stretches of aspartate residues (oligoD) into different protein antigens to facilitate their binding to alum, a well-established vaccine adjuvant that has been used for over 90 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. The surface of alum allows the presentation of oligoD-modified antigens in a pre-defined manner. While methods to afford increased antigen-binding to alum have been developed previously, including modifications with terminal phosphate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> or phosphonate groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> or phosphoserine peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, these approaches usually require the synthesis of alum-binding molecules followed by chemical coupling and post-modification purification procedures. In contrast, oligoD insertion is a simple, one-step process pre-programmed by molecular cloning.</p><p id="P9">To validate our proposed approach, we inserted oligoD into the C-terminus of Ebola glycoprotein and showed that oligoD insertion increased antigen-binding to alum and elicited robust germinal center and neutralizing antibody responses. To demonstrate the simplicity and generalizability of our approach, we also inserted oligoD into two other protein antigens (SARS-CoV-2 spike and HA of A/New Caledonia/20/99) and found that oligoD-modified antigens induced significantly stronger neutralizing antibody responses compared to wild-type antigens.</p><p id="P10">After establishing that oligoD insertion mediated antigen-binding to alum, we identified a permissive site on the head of an H2 HA (A/Japan/305/1957) for oligoD insertion. We choose this H2 HA because H2 HAs contain a bulky phenylalanine residue on its stem region that expands the breadth of B cell responses upon vaccination compared to HAs from other subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. We showed that oligoD insertion into H2 HA resulted in the trivalent anchoring of its head to alum at specific locations on each HA trimer in an “upside down” configuration. Immunization with this reoriented H2 HA (reoH2HA) on alum elicited a stem-directed and cross-reactive antibody response to diverse HA subtypes from both group 1 and 2.

OligoD-modified GP proteins were expressed in Expi293F cells <italic>via</italic> transient transfection and purified to homogeneity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>). OligoD insertion did not change the thermal melting profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) or melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>, 58°C, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b</xref>) of GP, suggesting a negligible perturbation to its native structure. In addition, we selected a panel of five GP-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb114, c13C6, ADI-15742, KZ52 and ADI-16061) that recognize different epitopes on GP and examined their binding to wild-type or oligoD-modified GP using bio-layer interferometry (BLI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c</xref>). We found no noticeable differences in the binding profiles of these mAbs to all GP proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting proper presentation of those conformational epitopes. Next, we measured the effect of oligoD insertions on GP-binding to alum (Alhydrogel<sup>®</sup>). We pre-mixed wild-type or oligoD-modified GP with alum (protein: alum, 1: 10, <italic>w/w</italic>) for one hour and then incubated the mixtures in the presence of naïve mouse serum (10%, <italic>v/v</italic>) at 37 °C for 24 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1d</xref>). After incubation, alum pellets were rinsed extensively and subjected to protein gel electrophoresis, followed by Western-blot analysis to determine the amount of alum-bound GP. Whereas only a small fraction of wild-type GP was detected on the blot, an increasing amount of GP bound to alum as the number of aspartates increased from two to 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). To quantify the amount of alum-bound GP, we collected the supernatant from GP-alum mixtures and measured the concentration of unbound GP by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1e</xref>). Consistent with the Western blot, higher GP-binding to alum correlated with increasing oligoD length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1f</xref>). The presence of naïve mouse serum did not affect binding of GP-8D or GP-12D to alum. This interaction between oligoD and alum also did not affect the thermal stability of GP proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1g,h</xref>). Besides the C-terminus, we identified three flexible loop regions (after residue R200, T294 or A309) on GP that readily accommodated oligoD insertion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a,b</xref>). Thermal melting profiles and T<sub>m</sub> of the resulting oligoD-modified GP proteins were identical to those of wild-type GP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2c</xref>). While both GP-8D and GP-12D exhibited ~100% binding to alum, only 12D insertion afforded ~100% GP-binding to alum when inserted into each of these flexible loop regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2d</xref>). Therefore, we inserted 12D into antigens to promote maximal binding to alum for subsequent immunization studies.</p><p id="P12">To evaluate the immunogenicity of oligoD-modified GP, we immunized mice with either wild-type GP or GP-12D adjuvanted with alum <italic>via</italic> subcutaneous injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). A single dose of GP with alum elicited a relatively weak GP-specific antibody response, while GP-12D with alum stimulated a much stronger response with almost tenfold higher IgG titers six weeks post-immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). At six and eight weeks post-immunization, we detected very low IgG titers against oligoD or other C-terminal affinity tags that were used for purification purposes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3a</xref>). Next, we generated Ebola GP-pseudotyped lentiviruses (EBOV, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3b</xref>) to analyze the neutralizing antibody response. Consistent with the IgG titers, GP-12D induced a three- to five-fold stronger neutralizing antibody response than GP did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). While all mice immunized with GP-12D adjuvanted with alum developed neutralizing responses at week six (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3c</xref>), only half of the mice immunized with GP did, though the titers were lower. Even at week 12, one mouse immunized with GP did not show any neutralizing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3d</xref>). Taken together, oligoD insertion increased antigen-binding to alum and significantly enhanced neutralizing antibody responses in animal immunizations compared to wild-type GP.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>OligoD-modified antigens stimulate robust germinal center responses</title><p id="P13">To understand the mechanism underlying the enhanced antibody response elicited by GP-12D, we immunized mice with wild-type GP or GP-12D and analyzed the germinal center (GC) responses in draining lymph nodes at 7, 14 or 21 days post-immunization using flow cytometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). As with the previous immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), a single injection of GP-12D with alum elicited a stronger antibody response than GP with alum did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Use of alum also led to a Th2-biased response (IgG1) in both groups with negligible titers of IgG2a or IgG2b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4a</xref>). Besides the serological response, we examined the responses of GC B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>CD95<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>−</sup>), IgG<sup>+</sup> GC B cells and T follicular helper cells (T<sub>FH</sub>, CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>) in the draining lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4b</xref>). Compared to GP with alum, GP-12D with alum induced an extended GC response with a substantially higher magnitude of GC B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), IgG<sup>+</sup> GC B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>) and T<sub>FH</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>), which all peaked at 14 days post-immunization. These data suggest that the higher antibody titers elicited by GP-12D with alum resulted from stimulation of a robust GC response.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>OligoD insertion is generalizable to other protein antigens to enhance antibody responses</title><p id="P14">Given the simplicity of our approach, we applied oligoD insertion to two other protein antigens for additional validation. We first inserted oligoD into the C-terminus of SARS-CoV-2 spike to generate spike-12D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Wild-type spike and spike-12D were transiently expressed and purified to homogeneity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5a</xref>). In both the absence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5b</xref>) and presence of alum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5c</xref>), spike-12D shared the same thermal melting profile and T<sub>m</sub> (44°C and 52°C) with wild-type spike. We also found nearly identical binding profiles for ACE2-Fc and three spike-specific mAbs (COVA2-15, CB6 and CR3022) against wild-type spike or spike-12D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5d</xref>). Next, we immunized mice with wild-type spike or spike-12D adjuvanted with alum <italic>via</italic> subcutaneous injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). A three-dose regimen of spike-12D with alum elicited a significantly higher antibody response than wild-type spike with alum did against both spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>) and its receptor-binding domain (RBD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Immunization of spike-12D with alum also greatly enhanced the neutralizing response against spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6a,b</xref>). Despite the less than twofold difference in IgG titers at week nine, the neutralization titers (NT<sub>50</sub>) of the spike-12D group were over fivefold higher than those of the spike group. When we further assessed the neutralization of other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6c-g</xref>), we found consistently higher neutralizing activity from antisera elicited by spike-12D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Besides SARS-CoV-2 spike, we inserted oligoD into the C-terminus of an H1 HA (A/New Caledonia/20/99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Similar to the modifications in GP and spike, oligoD insertion did not affect the expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7a</xref>) or thermal stability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7b</xref>) of H1 HA. The binding profiles with different HA-specific mAbs (CH65, H2897, 6649, MEDI8852, CR9114 and FI6v3), as determined by BLI, also suggested the proper presentation of conformational epitopes on H1 HA-12D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>). A prime-boost immunization of H1 HA-12D with alum elicited substantially higher (five- to tenfold) HA-specific IgG titers than H1 HA with alum did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3j,k</xref>). To determine whether the antisera targeted HA-head or HA-stem, we performed competition ELISA, in which antigen-coated ELISA plates were pre-incubated with a saturating concentration of individual HA-specific mAbs before incubation with antisera. We observed a clear competition between antisera and HA-head-directed mAbs (H2897 or 6649) with a more pronounced change in the H1 HA-12D group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3l</xref>). In contrast, there was negligible competition with HA-stem-directed antibodies (MEDI8852 or CR9114), suggesting that oligoD insertion into the C-terminus of HA only boosted antibody responses toward the immunodominant HA-head. Nonetheless, higher antibody titers elicited by H1 HA-12D correlated with an increased breadth against two other group 1 HAs, namely H2 (A/Japan/305/1957) and H5 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) HAs, presumably toward conserved epitopes on HA-head (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>OligoD insertion into the head of H2 HA reorients it on alum to afford immunofocusing</title><p id="P16">Having validated using three protein antigens that oligoD insertion enabled their binding to alum, we then attempted to insert oligoD into HA-head to anchor this region on alum and redirect antibody responses to the newly exposed HA-stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We chose to insert oligoD into an H2 HA because the bulky phenylalanine (F45<sub>HA2</sub>) in its HA-stem expands the cross-reactivity of stem-binding B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Although oligoD insertions into HA-head often led to substantially reduced protein expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8a</xref>), insertion of 12D after residue S156 in the head of H2 HA (A/Japan/305/1957) was successful and produced reoH2HA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8b</xref>). ReoH2HA maintained the thermal stability of its wild-type counterpart (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8c</xref>), including in the presence of alum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8d</xref>). The insertion into the head of H2 HA also did not appreciably affect the binding profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) or affinities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8f-h</xref>) of stem-directed mAbs against the protein. To validate the “upside-down” orientation of oligoD-modified HA on alum, we measured binding of head- and stem-directed mAbs to reoH2HA on streptavidin- or alum-coated ELISA plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). Both head-(8F8 and 8M2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>) and stem-directed mAbs (MEDI8852 and FI6v3) bound to reoH2HA with high affinity when C-terminal biotinylated reoH2HA was adsorbed on streptavidin-coated ELISA plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In contrast, only stem-directed mAbs bound to reoH2HA when it was adsorbed on alum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Loss of binding of head-directed mAbs suggests that reoH2HA adopted an “upside down” configuration on alum, where epitopes on HA-head were no longer accessible.

After three injections, mice from both groups developed robust H2 HA-specific IgG responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Despite similar antigen-specific titers, reoH2HA elicited much higher antibody titers against HA-stem, when we tested binding of antisera to the H1-stabilized stem (H1-SS) protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To test whether stem-binding translated to increased cross-reactivity, we measured binding of antisera to different group 1 and 2 HAs. After two doses, antisera from mice immunized with reoH2HA showed higher cross-reactive titers than those immunized with wild-type H2 HA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9c</xref>). Even after three doses, mice immunized with H2 HA only cross-reacted with half of the HAs we tested (H1 CA/09, H5 VT/04, H7 SH/13), although with relatively low titers. In contrast, all mice immunized with reoH2HA developed cross-reactive responses against both group 1 and 2 HAs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9d</xref>). To further evaluate if cross-reactive responses were focused, at least partially, on neutralizing epitopes of HA-stem, we analyzed whether antisera competed for binding with a known stem-specific bnAb (MEDI8852). While there was negligible competition with MEDI8852 in the H2 HA group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>), antisera against reoH2HA clearly competed with MEDI8852. As a control, antisera from neither group showed much competition for binding with another bnAb (FluA-20) that targets the trimer interface of HA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9e</xref>). These results indicate that alum-bound reoH2HA directed antibody responses away from the head and toward the stem region of H2 HA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">It remains challenging to acquire durable and protective immunity from vaccinations against viruses with high sequence variability, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. However, the discovery of bnAbs that target conserved epitopes on viral glycoproteins suggests the possibility of developing universal vaccines against these targets and has prompted the development of epitope-focused vaccine candidates to direct antibody responses toward bnAb epitopes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In the case of influenza, intense efforts to focus antibody responses to HA-stem include cross-strain boosting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, mosaic display<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, epitope resurfacing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, epitope masking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, and protein dissection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. While these diverse immunofocusing approaches have led to substantial progress toward broadening the breadth of the antibody response, it has not been possible to elicit an antibody response with a single immunogen that consistently cross-reacts with HAs from both group 1 and 2 influenza A subtypes.</p><p id="P20">Here, we introduce a new approach to immunofocusing – antigen reorientation. Our hypothesis was that the reorientation of antigens could alter epitope accessibility and redirect the immune response to less dominant but more desirable epitopes. Using influenza HA as a model, we reoriented the full-length HA ectodomain in an “upside-down” configuration facilitated by its binding to alum, to redirect antibody responses away from the variable HA-head and toward the highly conserved HA-stem. We envisioned that this approach could increase the exposure of the poorly accessible HA-stem that was originally occluded by HA-head on influenza virions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, while simultaneously sterically decreasing the exposure of HA-head – in the context of an intact HA trimer that preserves the native structure of HA-stem.</p><p id="P21">To test this, we genetically inserted oligoD into HA-head and found that this modification enhanced antigen-binding to alum in an “upside-down” configuration, likely through electrostatic interactions. Compared to existing immunofocusing approaches, our strategy simultaneously preserved the native structure and conformational epitopes of HA and mitigated the immunodominance of HA-head by tethering it to alum. Immunization with wild-type H2 HA on alum induced an antibody response that cross-reacted with several of the HAs tested, consistent with previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. By contrast, reoH2HA on alum elicited higher titers of cross-reactive antibodies against all group 1 and 2 HAs tested, in support of our hypothesis that antigen reorientation redirected antibody responses to the HA-stem region. Data from the competition assay with the HA-stem-directed bnAb MEDI8852 further indicate that antisera derived against reoH2HA include antibodies that target neutralizing epitopes on HA-stem, while antisera raised against wild-type H2 HA generally do not. Therefore, increased exposure and accessibility of HA-stem in the reoriented HA directed a fraction of the overall response to important stem epitopes.</p><p id="P22">Our results provide proof-of-concept that the reorientation of viral antigens leads to a stem-directed, cross-reactive antibody response. In future work, it will be important to explore higher doses or more potent adjuvants than those used here with the aim of further boosting cross-reactive antibody titers. As well, whether such cross-reactive antibody responses elicited by reoriented antigens protect against lethal challenges by direct viral neutralization or Fc-mediated mechanisms remains to be determined.</p><p id="P23">The simplicity of our approach makes it readily generalizable to other antigens since it only requires molecular cloning and screening of insertion sites. Meanwhile, existing methods for attaching antigens to alum require the synthesis of linker molecules, followed by chemical conjugation and subsequent purification steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Importantly, identifying sites where insertion of oligoD is permissive for protein expression in mammalian cells will likely be required to generate antigens with preserved native structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. The trivalent anchoring afforded by three distinct oligoD motifs within each HA trimer rigidifies the antigen-alum binding interface and reduces the possibility of antigens “lying down” on alum. In addition, conceptually similar motifs that harness electrostatic interactions (<italic>e.g.</italic>, oligomeric glutamate residues) and other protein tags or binding partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> may substitute or could be combined with oligoD for antigen reorientation and high-resolution immunofocusing purposes.</p><p id="P24">In summary, we introduce a generalizable immunofocusing strategy that enables the control of antigen orientation on alum by oligoD insertion. Our results showed consistent cross-reactivity toward group 1 and group 2 HAs with a single immunogen (reoH2HA) that encodes HA from a single influenza subtype. This approach has the potential to accelerate the development of epitope-focused vaccines against a broad range of viruses and other infectious agents.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P25">HEK-293T cells were purchased from American type culture collection (ATCC) and maintained in D10 medium – Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Corning) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GeminiBio) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/<italic>L</italic>-glutamine (GeminiBio).

This five-plasmid system includes a packaging vector (pHAGE-Luc2-IRES-ZsGreen), a plasmid encoding full-length Ebola GP (pCDNA3.1 EBOV FL-GP) and three helper plasmids (pHDM-Hgpm2, pHDM-Tat1b and pRC-CMV_Rev1b). One day before transfection, HEK-293T cells were seeded in 10-cm TC-treated culture dishes (5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per culture dish, Corning). Transfection mixture was prepared by adding five plasmids (10 μg packaging vector, 3.4 μg GP-encoding plasmid and 2.2 μg of each helper plasmid) to 1 mL D10 medium, followed by the dropwise addition of BioT transfection reagent (30 μL, Bioland Scientific) with vigorous mixing. After 10-minute incubation at room temperature, the transfection mixture was transferred to HEK-293T cells in the culture dish. Culture medium was replenished 24 hours post-transfection, and after another 48 hr, viruses were harvested and filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane. Pseudotyped lentiviruses were aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at -80 °C, and titrated before further use.</p><p id="P52">SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses encoding a luciferase-ZsGreen reporter were produced using the same method but with plasmids encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike (HDM-SARS2-spike-delta21, Addgene #155130) or its variants of concern.

On day 4, medium was removed, and 100 μL of luciferase substrates (BriteLite Plus, Perkin Elmer) were added to each well. Luminescent signals were recorded on a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy™ HT or Tecan M200). Percent infection was normalized to cells only (0% infection) and virus only (100% infection) on each plate. Neutralization assays were performed in biological duplicates with technical duplicates. Similarly, neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses was validated with ACE2-Fc or three spike-specific mAbs. HeLa-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells were seeded at a density of 6,000 cells per well one day before the assay (day 0). On day 1, ACE2-Fc or spike-specific mAbs (2 μM in HBS with 10% glycerol) were filtered and diluted to 20 nM as the starting concentration. Subsequently, ACE2-Fc or mAbs were serially diluted (10-fold dilution) in D10 media and mixed with SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses for one hour before being transferred to HeLa-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells.
