Numerous DEE genes have been discovered thanks to advances in genomic diagnosis, yet putative molecular links between these disorders are unknown. CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD, DEE2), one of the most common genetic epilepsies, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the brain-enriched kinase CDKL5. To elucidate CDKL5 function, we looked for CDKL5 substrates using a SILAC-based phosphoproteomic screen. We identified the voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Cav2.3 (encoded by <italic>CACNA1E</italic>) as a novel physiological target of CDKL5 in mice and humans. Recombinant channel electrophysiology and interdisciplinary characterization of Cav2.3 phosphomutant mice revealed that loss of Cav2.3 phosphorylation leads to channel gain-of-function via slower inactivation and enhanced cholinergic stimulation, resulting in increased neuronal excitability. Our results thus show that CDD is partly a channelopathy. The properties of unphosphorylated Cav2.3 closely resemble those described for <italic>CACNA1E</italic> gain-of-function mutations causing DEE69, a disorder sharing clinical features with CDD. We show that these two single-gene diseases are mechanistically related and could be ameliorated with Cav2.3 inhibitors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CDKL5</kwd><kwd>CACNA1E</kwd><kwd>Cav2.3</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>developmental and epileptic encephalopathy</kwd><kwd>DEE2</kwd><kwd>DEE69</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) are characterized by severe early-onset epileptic activity accompanied by global developmental and cognitive impairments.

As expected in CDKL5 KO neurons, we observe a significant reduction in CDKL5 pS407 and in EB2 pS222, a known CDKL5 phosphorylation target <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Phosphorylation of EB2 S221 was also decreased, indicating co-regulation of these neighbouring sites. More importantly, a potential new target protein, the ion channel Cav2.3, showed strongly reduced phosphorylation at S15 (pS15), in CDKL5 KO neurons. Strikingly, the Cav2.3 S15 site matches the RPXS/T* consensus motif <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, suggesting direct CDKL5 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>).

This phosphorylation is absent when overexpressing phosphomutant Cav2.3 or kinase-dead CDKL5, demonstrating the specificity of the antibody and the dependence of phosphorylation at this site on CDKL5 kinase activity. Importantly, full-length CDKL5 also directly phosphorylated Cav2.3 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a, b</xref>).

First, channel deletion renders mice resistant to tonic-clonic seizures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. On the other hand, Cav2.3 GoF leads to severe epileptic encephalopathy in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. The remarkable overlap in clinical manifestations between CACNA1E and CDD patients, including seizures and neurodevelopmental delays, raises the possibility that Cav2.3 regulation by CDKL5 might affect channel function and in turn neuronal excitability.</p><p id="P13">To test the effect of pS14 on Cav2.3 channel properties we used a HEK293 cell line stably expressing the human auxiliary subunits β3 and α2δ1 and transiently transfected human α1E and full-length CDKL5 plasmids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of Cav2.3 Ba<sup>2+</sup> currents revealed slower decay kinetics (inactivation τ) in S14A mutant channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-c</xref>). Notably, in absence of CDKL5, WT Cav2.3 decay kinetics were indistinguishable from S14A Cav2.3 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). We also found a statistically significant increase in whole-cell current density at maximum activation voltages in S14A when compared to WT Cav2.3 in presence of CDKL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). To account for differences in biophysical properties that may be introduced by α1E association with a different β subunit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, we conducted parallel experiments in a HEK293 cell line stably expressing human α2δ1 and β1b, another Cavβ subunit associated with α1E in the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. We used Ca<sup>2+</sup> as charge carrier to examine channel properties in a more physiological context. Decay kinetics of WT Cav2.3 currents with β1b were substantially slower than currents with β3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2 a, b</xref> <italic>vs</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a, b</xref>), as previously reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. In absence of CDKL5 phosphorylation (S14A α1E mutant or kinase-dead CDKL5 conditions), Cav2.3 current inactivation was further slowed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a-c</xref>), recapitulating our results with β3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-c</xref>). Current density at maximal activation voltages did not reach significance in the β1-expressing cells, where currents were generally larger (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). Finally, we observed no changes in half maximal activation and inactivation potential or time course of recovery from fast inactivation in β3- or β1-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary 2e,f</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Altogether, our results indicate that CDKL5-mediated Ser14 phosphorylation of α1E speeds up the inactivation of human Cav2.3 and suppresses current amplitude, independent of Cavβ subtype or charge carrier. Consequently, absence of CDKL5 leads to Cav2.3 GoF, with larger and more prolonged currents. A subset of <italic>CACNA1E</italic> GoF mutations described in human DEE patients also cause slower inactivation kinetics and/or increased current density <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, mirroring the phenotypes observed in the unphosphorylated channel. Thus, the functional deficits in Cav2.3 observed in absence of CDKL5 phosphorylation match those caused by pathological point mutations in Cav2.3 and could partly explain the pathophysiology of CDD.</p><p id="P15">Cav2.3 channels are downstream targets of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which modify channel function predominantly via PKC-mediated phosphorylation, leading to current enhancement in HEK293 cells and neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Given the observed GoF in S14A Cav2.3, we hypothesized that muscarinic receptor enhancement may also be affected by CDKL5 phosphorylation. To test this, we co-expressed Cav2.3, CDKL5 and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor type 3 or 1 (M3 or M1), which are prominent brain subtypes known to regulate neuronal Cav2.3 post-synaptically. As expected, application of the non-hydrolysable agonist carbachol substantially increased current amplitude regardless of Ser14 phosphorylation in both β3 and β1 stable cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g-l</xref>). The current increase with carbachol was 1.5 to 2 fold greater in cells without phospho-Ser14 at -10 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g, h, j, l</xref>), reflecting Cav2.3 gain-of-function in absence of phosphorylation. The half-maximal activation potential (V<sub>1/2</sub>) was left-shifted by 5 mV for WT channels in both cell lines, a described effect of muscarinic receptor activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Interestingly, without Ser14 phosphorylation this shift was significantly greater, implying an effect of phospho-Ser14 on the modulation of Cav2.3 gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2m-p</xref>). This represents an additional gain-of-function due to loss of CDKL5, a phenotype comparable to pathogenic <italic>CACNA1E</italic> mutations that alter V<sub>1/2</sub> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">Upon GPCR activation, Cav2.3 channels can be suppressed by G<sub>βγ</sub> subunits. This effect is has been observed in Gαq-coupled receptors including M1/M3 in HEK293 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> and CA1 neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. The Cav2.3 N-terminus and Cavβ are involved in G<sub>βγ</sub> regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. For this reason, we investigated the possibility that the enhanced carbachol effects in absence of N-terminal pS14 could be due to reduced G<sub>βγ</sub> suppression. To distinguish between PKC-mediated enhancement and G<sub>βγ</sub> suppression, we boosted PKC activity prior to carbachol application using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), reliably increasing Cav2.3 currents <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. With further addition of carbachol we found no evidence of muscarinic inhibition of human WT Cav2.3 channels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2g, h</xref>). Moreover, co-expression of Cav2.3 and Gi-coupled dopamine D2 receptors to further probe G<sub>βγ</sub> inhibition in our system, revealed significant reduction in peak currents upon D2 activation with quinpirole <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. However, there was no difference in inhibitory modulation with or without Ser14 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2i, j</xref>). The above manipulations suggest that G<sub>βγ</sub> is not involved in pathological Cav2.3 GoF.</p><p id="P17">Our results describe two Cav2.3 gain-of-function (GoF) mechanisms in the absence of CDKL5 phosphorylation: slower decay kinetics and a left shift in voltage-dependence of activation (V<sub>1/2</sub>) upon muscarinic activation, both reflected in increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Cav2.3 channels. These GoF features are reminiscent of those described for pathological Cav2.3 variants.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Altered R-type current inactivation and increased excitability in neurons from Cav2.3 S15A phosphomutant mice</title><p id="P18">To investigate the role of Cav2.3 S15 phosphorylation in neurons, we generated Cav2.3 S15A phosphomutant mice using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.

At least two independent immunoblot experiments with technical replicates were used for quantification, as specified in figure legends.</p><p id="P44">Primary antibodies used in each sample were: mouse anti-HA 1:2000 (Biolegend, 901513; HEK293), rabbit anti Cav2.3 N-terminus 1:250 (Covalab, custom 1, HEK293 &amp; brain), rabbit anti pS15 Cav2.3 1:500 (Covalab, custom 2, HEK293, brain &amp; human neurons), mouse anti Cav α1E 1:1000 (Synaptic Systems, 152411, human neurons), rabbit anti CDKL5 1:2000 (Atlas, HPA002847, HEK293), mouse anti GAPDH 1:50000 (Abcam, ab8245, brain &amp; human neurons). Custom made Cav2.3 Ser15 phosphospecific antibodies were raised by immunizing rabbits with peptide PRPG(pS)GDGDSDQSRNC. Phosphorylated Cav2.3 antibody was obtained after double purification. First, they were selected against non-phosphorylated peptide PRPGSGDGDSDQSRNC. This antibody is used as total Cav2.3 antibody (custom 1). Next the eluted fraction was purified again by binding to PRPG(pS)GDGDSDQSRNC -linked beads, obtaining pSer15 Cav2.3 (custom 2). Secondary antibodies used were: donkey anti rabbit HRP 1:10000 (Jackson, 711-035-152), donkey anti mouse HRP 1:10 000 (Jackson, 715-035-151).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> electrophysiology</title><sec id="S17"><title>HEK293 cells</title><p id="P45">Cells were split 24hr after transfection and replated on glass coverslips and allowed to recover overnight.

Pipettes (2.5-3.5 ΩM) were pulled from borosilicate glass (1.2x0.69mm, Harvard Bioscience) and filled with the following intracellular solutions adapted from <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> to minimize current run-down (in mM): CsMeS 140, EGTA 5, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, MgATP 5, HEPES 10, for GPCR experiments; CsMethanesulfonate 125, TEACl 5, EGTA 5, MgATP 5, Na3GTP 0.3, Na-phosphocreatine 5, Na-pyruvate 2.5, HEPES 10, pH 7.25, 285-295 mOsm, all other recordings. Upon seal break, currents were evoked every 5/10s with a step from -80/-100mV (holding potential, HP) to 0/+10mV. After an initial run-up period, steady state current voltage (IV) relationships were obtained with 100ms depolarising test steps to +60/+80 in 10mV increments every 10s. For voltage dependence of inactivation the protocol consisted of a 1s pulse from -140 to +20mV in 10 mV increments, followed by a 50 ms test pulse to 0 mV, every 10s. Peak currents (I<sub>peak</sub>) in response to test voltages (V<sub>test</sub>) were used to plot IVs and measure the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation. Reversal voltage (E<sub>rev</sub>) was estimated by extrapolating a linear fit to the IV curve from +20-+40 mV. Conductance (g) was calculated using the equation (g=(I<sub>peak</sub>)/(V<sub>test</sub>-E<sub>rev</sub>)). Voltage of half-maximal activation or inactivation (V<sub>1/2</sub>) were measured by fitting with a Boltzmann equation (Y= A+(B-A)/(1+exp((V-V<sub>1/2</sub>)/K)) where Y is the conductance or the current, and A and B are the minimum and maximum amplitudes of the fit. Time course of open state inactivation (τ<sub>inact</sub>) was estimated by fitting a single exponential function to current decay in response to test pulses. The average of 3 fits at each voltage was used. For all transfection conditions, cells with outward currents &gt;40% of the peak current at +10mV or with τ<sub>inact</sub> that did not decay uniformly with depolarization were excluded from analysis. Similarly, cells were not used for current density or τ<sub>inact</sub> comparisons if run-down was &gt;30% of the maximal current recorded in the experiment as this is known to affect inactivation time <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. To examine recovery from inactivation, an inactivating pulse to +10mV of 0.8-1s (pulse 1), was followed by a variable recovery period (Δ150-200ms) and a test pulse to +10mV (pulse 2), at 0.1-0.3 Hz. Time course of recovery was calculated using the ratio of I<sub>peak</sub> in response to pulse 2/pulse 1 plotted against duration of recovery period and fitted with single exponential equation. Carbachol, quinpirole and PMA were bath applied at ~3 ml/min whilst activating Cav2.3 currents with brief monitoring (25ms) test steps to 0 or +10mV, every 2, 5 or 10s, depending on speed of run-down. Upon steady state, IVs were obtained. Cells included in the analysis showed no significant changes in series resistance and a consistent shift in activation V<sub>1/2</sub>, with current amplitude matching between IV and brief monitoring steps. Leak and capacitance subtraction was applied to all recordings using -P/5 protocol and series resistance compensated from 75-95% to keep voltage error &lt;5mV.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18"><title><italic>Ex vivo</italic> electrophysiology</title><sec id="S19"><title>Hippocampal slices</title><p id="P46">Mice older than P10 were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80mg/kg) and xylazine (10mg/kg).

The room lighting was kept at 90 Lux. Hind-limb clasping was scored from 0 to 3: score 0 = both hind limbs were splayed outward away from the abdomen; score 1 = one hind limb retracted inward toward the abdomen for at least 50% of the observation period; score 2 = both hind limbs partially retracted inward toward the abdomen for at least 50% of the observation period; score 3 = both hind limbs completely retracted inward toward the abdomen for at least 50% of the observation period.

The brightness of the room was kept at 10 lux. Chamber occupancy during habituation was equal between groups. After this, the mouse was returned to the waiting cage for 3 minutes. To assess social preference, an unfamiliar WT mouse of the same age, sex and strain (stranger 1) was gently introduced inside one of the wire cages to serve as a social stimulus. An unfamiliar and inanimate object was added to the other wire cage as the non-social stimulus. The test mouse was placed in the apparatus containing the social and non-social stimuli for 10 minutes. After that, the test mouse was removed and kept in the waiting cage for 3 minutes. All compartments were cleaned with 30% ethanol solution before the next test phase. To assess preference for social novelty, the non-social object from the previous test phase was replaced by an unfamiliar mouse (stranger 2) and the previous stranger 1 (now familiar mouse) was placed into the wire cage of the opposite compartment. The test mouse was placed in the central chamber and allowed to explore the arena for the next 10 minutes, after which it was returned to the home cage.

An arm entry was recorded manually when the mouse moved beyond the central triangle of the maze and entered an arm with all four paws. Alternation behaviour was defined as consecutive entries into each of the three arms in overlapping triplet sets (e.g.: 1, 2, 3 or 2, 1, 3 or 3, 2, 1).

During the training phase (4 days), mice were trained to locate the target hole (with an escape chamber underneath) from among 20 holes evenly spaced around the perimeter of an elevated circular open field (Ø 96 cm). Each animal was initially placed in the centre of the arena covered by an opaque cylinder, which was removed 10-20s after the start of the trial. Room lighting was kept at 635 lux. The mouse is then free to explore the platform for 3 minutes using four visual cues to aid navigation. If the mouse does not enter the escape chamber within 3 minutes the experimenter guides the mouse gently to the escape box (20x11x7cm) and leaves the mouse inside for 1 min. This step is repeated two more times a day (3 trials in total per day) with at least 20 minutes in between where the mouse is placed back in its home cage. To assess learning, a probe test in carried out 24h after the last training, where the escape box has been removed from the target hole. The mouse is placed on the platform and free to explore it for 3 minutes. Distance to first: distance walked from the centre of the arena to the target hole (centre-point detection); latency to first: time to reach the target hole from the centre of the arena (centre-point detection); errors to first are defined as checking any hole before reaching the escape box (nose-point detection).</p><p id="P61">Contextual fear conditioning – The fear conditioning chamber (27x27x35 cm, Ugo Basile, Italy) was equipped with a shock grid floor and a digital Near Infrared Red Video Fear Conditioning system.
