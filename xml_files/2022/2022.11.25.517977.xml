Chronic, persistent viral loads increase both transmission and mutation risk, and prevent administration of the required immunosuppressive/antineoplastic therapies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Small molecule antivirals have not been formally validated for IC patients, who often have contraindications, and the convergent evolution of the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) has led to inefficacy of all the anti-Spike monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) authorized so far for both treatment or prevention, e.g. in the highly prevalent BQ.1.* sublineages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The other rapidly growing XBB.* and BF.7 sublineages are also highly resistant to anti-Spike mAbs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).

Miller <italic>et al</italic>. also in the USA sampled both before the 3<sup>rd</sup> vaccination dose and about 4 weeks after monovalent mRNA vaccination in the Fall of 2021, as well as with the 4th vaccine dose in the Summer or Fall of 2022, with either monovalent or bivalent booster vaccinations in Fall of 2022 in those with no documented COVID-19(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Cao <italic>et al</italic>. in China investigated BQ.1.1 neutralizations from plasma of 4 cohorts after 3 doses of CoronaVac (Fall 2021) without COVID-19 or 2-12 weeks after BA.1, BA.2 and BA.5 infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).

Kurhade <italic>et al</italic> in the USA also compared GMT<sub>50</sub>after the 4<sup>th</sup> monovalent vaccine dose or 3 mRNA doses with the 4<sup>th</sup> the bivalent dose without COVID-19 and also after bivalent boost with recent COVID-19(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).

Akerman et al in Australia characterized neutralizing antibodies in four groups 1) sampling one to three months after 3 doses of mRNA vaccines with an Omicron infection in 2022; 2) sampling 3 months after 4 doses of mRNA vaccine; 3) sampling 6 months after 3 doses of mRNA vaccine and 4) sampling 3-6 months after last vaccine in a larger cohort who had the original WA-1 infection in early 2020 as well as 3 more doses of mRNA vaccine(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p><p id="P8">These diverse cohorts were assembled into 3 groups, 1) plasma after both 2-4 vaccine doses and COVID-19 (VaxCCP); 2) plasma from subjects after administration of 3-4 vaccine doses (i.e. boosted), but either self-reported as COVID-19-<italic>naïve</italic> or anti-nucleocapsid negative; and 3) Omicron infection without vaccination (CCP) as well as participants sampled 6 to 11 months after previous vaccine dose and before the booster vaccination. Boosted VaxCCP neutralized BQ.1.1, XBB.1 and BF.7 with approximately 3 times the dilutional potency of the vaccine-only or 2-6 times CCP/pre-boost vaccination groups for all viral variants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Importantly, while there was a 19-fold reduction in neutralization by boosted VaxCCP against BQ.1.1 compared to WA-1, more than 90% of the boosted VaxCCP samples neutralized BQ.1.1 as well as XBB.1 and BF.7 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). Three cohorts within the boosted VaxCCP group were below at 90% neutralization with one sampled late, 8 months after BA.1/2 breakthrough infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and the other two from a single study after BA.2 and BA.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2 and 3</xref>). Except for the GMT (GMT<sub>50</sub>) against XBB.1 at 78, the other viral variant neutralizations were in the same range as pre-Alpha CCP neutralizing WA-1 (i.e., 311)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). By comparison the large randomized clinical trial which effectively reduced outpatient COVID-19 progression to hospitalizations had a GMT<sub>50</sub> of 60 for WA-1 with pre-Alpha CCP(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Boosted vaccinations at 3-4 doses without COVID-19, showed GM (GMT<sub>50</sub>) of 118 for BQ.1.1, with only 6 of 23 cohorts over 90% neutralizations, for 79% overall (i.e. 326 of 414 individuals). Four separate studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) characterized BQ.1.1 virus neutralizations with plasma after the new bivalent (wild-type + BA.4/5) mRNA vaccine booster in the Fall of 2022, with 88% (103 of 117 samples) neutralization activity within 4 weeks of bivalent booster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Many studies performed virus neutralizations on samples drawn before the 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> vaccine dose which were 6 to 11 months after last vaccine dose. The GM (GMT<sub>50</sub>)’s for BQ.1.1 and BA.2.75 were about 6 times reduced compared to VaxCCP even though the fold reductions were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). In agreement with lower GMT<sub>50</sub> for neutralizations was the low percent neutralizing BQ.1.1 (63%), XBB.1 (50%), and BF.7 (75%) at 6 to 11 months after vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Five studies used the lentiviral pseudovirus assays, with diverse Spike proteins cloned in, while the other four were live virus assays using different cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

While the single study fold reductions (FR) and percent neutralizations normalize the results between studies, the GMT<sub>50</sub> can vary between studies even amongst the live authentic viral neutralization studies (e.g., mNeonGreen™ reporter assays versus cytopathic effects)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). We sorted the live authentic viral neutralizations from the pseudoviral neutralizations, plotting also the minimum and maximums (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 1-3</xref>). In general, the live authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays for VaxCCP appeared to have similar antibody neutralization levels, with the single study by Cao et al(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) employing lentiviral pseudovirus with lower dilutional titers. In contrast, the GMT<sub>50</sub> achieved with pseudoviral assays in the boosted vaccinations without COVID-19 appeared slightly higher than the ones achieved with authentic virus.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P11">The FDA deemed CCP safe and effective for both immunocompetent and IC COVID-19 outpatients(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), and further extended its authorized use in the IC patient population in December 2021(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), at a time when oral antiviral therapy promised a no transfusion outpatient solution and many anti-Spike mAbs were still effective.</p><p id="P12">Up until the present, CCP remained a backup bridge for IC patients, durable against the changing variants and as a salvage therapy in seronegative IC patients. With the recent advent of Omicron XBB.* and BQ.1.* defeating the remaining anti-Spike mAbs, boosted VaxCCP, recently collected within the last 6 months of either a vaccine dose or SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be the only viable remaining passive antibody therapy in the 2022-23 Winter for IC patients who have failed to make antibodies after vaccination and still require B-cell depleting drugs or immunosuppressive therapy. In a literature review of CCP from diverse VOC waves as well as boosted vaccinees and VaxCCP up to BA-1, VaxCCP showed higher neutralization titers against Omicron at levels above 300 dilutional GMT<sub>50</sub><sup>4</sup>.</p><p id="P13">The accelerated evolution of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs has created the problem that the pharmaceutical development of additional mAbs is not worth the effort and cost given their expected short useful clinical life expectancy, so the anti-Spike mAb pipeline has remained stuck in 2022. High levels of antibodies in donor plasma from both boosted vaccinations and COVID-19 convalescent plasma (VaxCCP) neutralizing more than 93% of BQ.1.1and BF.7, with XBB.1 at 89%. Recently collected plasma within a 6 months window from those boosted vaccinees without prior documented COVID-19 had a 20-30% reduction in neutralization percent for BQ.1.1and XBB.1 with 10% reduction for the others and a third of the GM (GMT<sub>50</sub>) neutralizing antibody levels compared to VaxCCP. In those vaccinated with last dose more than 6 months prior to sample collection, both the neutralization percent and neutralizing antibody titers fell further, compared to the recently boosted VaxCCP group. Four studies (Planas(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), Zou(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), Cao(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) and Kurhade(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>)) had directly comparative cohorts in the three groups which increases the robustness reduction in neutralizations with the vaccine only or more than 6 months to last vaccine or infection event compared to VaxCCP. The main limitation of our systematic review is the small number of studies reporting virus neutralization with BQ.1.1 with most available as pre-preprints without peer-review yet. However, we note that peer-review itself does not change GMT<sub>50</sub> or neutralization numbers and the authors of these papers have considerable expertise in the topic.</p><p id="P14">Boosted VaxCCP has full potential to replace anti-Spike mAbs for passive antibody therapy of IC patients against recent Omicron sublineages, in the meanwhile polyclonal IgG formulations can be manufactured. VaxCCP qualification in the real-world will likely remain constrained on high-throughput serology, whose correlation with GMT<sub>50</sub> is not perfect(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Nevertheless, the very high prevalence (93%) of Omicron-neutralizing antibodies and the high GM (GMT<sub>50</sub>) in recently boosted VaxCCP reassure about its potency, and further confirm that exact donor-recipient VOC matching is dispensable. Overall, our findings urge WHO to revise its guidelines and recommend boosted VaxCCP for therapy of COVID-19 in IC patients.</p><sec id="S8"><title>Search strategy and selection criteria</title><p id="P15">On November 19, 2022 we initially searched PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv for manuscripts reporting BQ.1.1 neutralization, using English language as a restriction.
