Each plays an essential role in preparing the embryo for implantation and subsequent development. Several models are proposed to define the lineage segregation. The first suggests that all specify simultaneously; the second favours differentiation of trophectoderm before separation of epiblast and hypoblast, either via differentiation of hypoblast from established epiblast, or production of both tissues from the inner cell mass precursor. To begin to resolve this discrepancy and thereby understand the sequential process for production of viable human embryos, we investigated the expression order of genes associated with emergence of hypoblast. Based upon published data and immunofluorescence analysis for candidate genes, we present a basic blueprint for human hypoblast differentiation, lending support to the proposed model of sequential segregation of the founder lineages of the human blastocyst. The first characterised marker, specific initially to the early inner cell mass, and subsequently identifying presumptive hypoblast is PDGFRA, followed by SOX17, FOXA2 and GATA4 in sequence as the hypoblast becomes committed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hypoblast</kwd><kwd>Human blastocyst</kwd><kwd>Inner cell mass</kwd><kwd>PDGFRA</kwd><kwd>Lineage acquisition</kwd><kwd>Entropy sorting</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">At the time of implantation in the uterus, around 8 days after fertilisation (D8), the human embryo comprises three lineages: trophectoderm (TE), epiblast (epi) and hypoblast (hypo). TE is responsible for connecting to the uterus and is the precursor of the placenta. Epi gives rise to the embryo proper and hypo will form the primary yolk sac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Hertig et al., 1956</xref>). Hypo also plays an essential role in patterning the epi to establish the foetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Mole et al., 2021</xref>). The mechanisms by which the three lineages segregate have been well described for the mouse embryo, but emerging data from human embryos implies that the developmental processes may not be completely conserved between the species. Successful pregnancy rate following assisted conception programmes is disappointingly low (around 25% of transferred embryos, according to HFEA metrics). Understanding how the lineages segregate and quantifying the proportions of each required for mature blastocyst morphology constitute prerequisites for optimising culture regimes to improve live birth rates following IVF treatment. So far, several models have been proposed to explain acquisition of the three pre-implantation lineages in the human embryo. The one-step model suggests that TE, epi and hypo cell fates are acquired synchronously at around D5, based on analysis of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Petropoulos et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the two-step model proposes that, in concordance with the mouse embryo, TE and inner cell mass (ICM) lineages begin to segregate at the morula stage, with the hypo and epi emerging subsequently from the ICM following cavitation of the blastocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Blakeley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Niakan and Eggan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Roode et al., 2012</xref>). Other scRNAseq analyses and immunofluorescence (IF) for pan markers of TE versus ICM studies support position initiation of the TE programme at the morula stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Gerri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Meistermann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Stirparo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Zhu and Zernicka-Goetz, 2020</xref>), prior to appearance of epi and hypo as the blastocyst expands. These reports indicated that a combination of polarity acquisition and activation of phospholipase C and Hippo signalling leads outer morula cells to commence TE differentiation with activation of GATA3 and nuclear localisation of YAP. Subsequently, it was suggested that hypo originates from the epi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Meistermann et al., 2021</xref>). However, a more recent study, using an entropy-based approach for feature selection for published scRNA-seq data sets identified an early ICM population from which both epi and hypo arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Radley et al., 2022</xref>). The existence of this common ICM precursor had also been implicated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Stirparo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The process of epi and hypo specification in human embryos has not yet been described in detail, although it is known that hypo is not induced simply as a result of FGF/ERK signalling from the epi, as it is in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Kuijk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Nichols et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Roode et al., 2012</xref>). Divergence in the order of gene expression during this segregation in human compared to mouse was first investigated using IF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Niakan and Eggan, 2013</xref>) and subsequently expanded with scRNAseq, enabling identification of 164 genes differentially expressed between the two lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). A larger dataset identified <italic>LINC00261</italic> as the most highly expressed hypo gene; <italic>PDGFRA, FGFR2, LAMA4, HNF1B, COL4A1, GATA4, FN1, FRZB, AMOTL1</italic>, and <italic>DPPA4</italic> were also highlighted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Petropoulos et al., 2016</xref>). Hypo markers were further separated as ‘early’ for those expressed before the hypo is fully specified (<italic>GATA6, LRP2</italic> and <italic>ANXA3</italic>) and ‘late’ for genes appearing only in the mature lineage (<italic>APOA1, COL4A1, GDF6, RSPO3</italic> and <italic>FST).</italic> OTX2 was also discovered to mark early human hypo, providing another example of divergence in lineage identity from that of mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boroviak et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In this study, we sought to specify the order of appearance of hypo-associated gene products and thereby further delineate blastocyst staging and enrich embryo quality control. We compare initiation and downregulation of candidate hypo genes and proteins during blastocyst expansion alongside known epi markers to resolve the sequence of cell fate specification in the human embryo and thereby determine whether hypo cells arise simultaneously with the other two founder lineages, via conversion of epi-specified cells, or from the pluripotent ICM following its segregation from TE.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>The hypoblast lineage is acquired progressively, concurrent with intensification of SOX17 in ICM cells during blastocyst development</title><p id="P7">To study acquisition of hypo and epi fates in the human embryo, we thawed D5 blastocysts and fixed them immediately after recovery, or following culture to ‘early’ D6, ‘late’ D6 or D7 stages. Although still present in the TE at early stages, OCT4 was used to track the ICM/epi lineage, while SOX17 identified hypo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Niakan and Eggan, 2013</xref>). Embryos were staged using a combination of number of days’ culture post-fertilisation and morphological landmarks, including thickness of zona pellucida, size of blastocoel and total cell number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). At D5, the embryo comprises mostly OCT4+ cells; the few SOX17+ cells also display high levels of OCT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Notably, OCT4 is still present in TE at a similar level to that of the ICM at this stage. Consequently, the ICM/epi quantification also includes some TE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). At early D6, the majority of ICM cells co-expresses OCT4 and SOX17; detection of cells displaying high levels of OCT4 without SOX17 suggests emergence of epi precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-D</xref>). At late D6, the ICM can be separated into three populations of cells: epi precursors expressing only OCT4; ‘undefined’ ICM cells displaying high levels of SOX17 as well as OCT4, and hypo precursors expressing SOX17, but no OCT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-D</xref>). At D7, the undefined population has resolved into epi and hypo cells, distinguishable by expression of either OCT4 or SOX17. Coincidentally, by this stage the hypo is located near the blastocoel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). This sequence of events suggests that, in a similar way to the mouse embryo, nascent human ICMs (D5) possess some OCT4+ SOX17- cells, whereas by early D6, cells co-express markers for epi and hypo, indicating presence of dual progenitor cells within the ICM population with the potential to form either epi or hypo. The number of OCT4+SOX17+ cells per embryo increases at early D6 as SOX17 expression begins in ICM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). The number of double positive cells reduces at late D6 as OCT4 intensity diminishes in the hypo precursors, leading to complete segregation of hypo from epi by D7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-C, E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). This analysis was repeated in three more datasets showing the same trend: starting from low or no SOX17 expression in the ICM, to OCT4+SOX17+ co-expression and finally segregation of ICM cells into exclusively OCT4 (epi) or SOX17 (hypo) lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The proportion of epi and hypo (also called primitive endoderm) cells in mouse embryos at embryonic day E4.5 is largely consistent and maintained at 40:60% for all embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Saiz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Saiz et al., 2016</xref>). However, in D7 human embryos the proportion of cell lineages appears to vary from 20 to 60% for both hypo and epi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). The percentage of putative epi cells in the ICM remains nearly constant from late D6 to D7 (49 to 41%), suggesting that it is the co-expressing cells at late D6 that will become hypo at D7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Moreover, the small decrease in the percentage of epi cells implies they are fully specified and do not convert to hypo from late D6 to D7.</p><p id="P9">The progressive increase in hypo cells during blastocyst expansion and the scarcity of OCT4+SOX17+ co-expressing cells at D5 appears to support the hypothesis that hypo originates from epi cells in human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Meistermann et al., 2021</xref>). In this case, exclusively OCT4+ epi cells at D5 will subsequently upregulate SOX17, generating the co-expressing population at D6 from which hypo differentiates at late D6 and D7. However, persistent OCT4 in the TE at this stage confounds the ability to identify epi cells definitively. Once co-expression is established at early D6, hypo cells apparently emerge from OCT4+SOX17+ cells rather than by direct conversion from Epi. It is possible that D5 OCT4+ cells express an alternative, earlier hypo marker distinct from SOX17, classifying them as early ICM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Radley et al., 2022</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we investigated alternative hypo markers expressed at D5 immediately after cavitation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Pseudotime analysis of blastocyst development unveils sequential activation of genes specifying the hypoblast lineage</title><p id="P10">In mouse blastocysts, hypo fate is acquired sequentially, originating from an ICM population co-expressing NANOG (epi) and GATA6 (hypo), which segregate into a ‘salt and pepper’ arrangement at around E3.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Plusa et al., 2008</xref>). Sequential activation of hypo markers was investigated using IF, revealing progressive expression of hypo transcription factors in the following order: GATA6 &gt; SOX17 &gt; GATA4 &gt; SOX7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Artus et al., 2011</xref>). This was subsequently confirmed by pseudotime analysis of scRNAseq data from early mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Nowotschin et al., 2019</xref>). Hypo genes in human embryos were previously classified as either ‘early’ or ‘late’ using scRNAseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boroviak et al., 2018</xref>). Use of denoising and feature selection software (FFAVES and ESFW) expands the potential to detect small temporal differences in expression of individual genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Radley et al., 2022</xref>). We therefore made use of this method to characterise the order of appearance of human hypo marker genes. The first step was to identify specific genes uniquely expressed in hypo and absent from TE and epi compartments. We began by selecting genes known to mark the mouse hypo population: <italic>Pdgfra, Gata6, Sox17, Gata4</italic> and <italic>Sox7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Artus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chazaud et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Plusa et al., 2008</xref>). To search for genes not yet known to be related to hypo, we leveraged a recently generated high resolution scRNAseq human pre-implantation embryo UMAP embedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Radley et al., 2022</xref>) using published scRNAseq datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A,B</xref>). Genes were ranked based on level of enrichment in the hypo population according to the UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C-F</xref>). Trophectoderm and epiblast genes were analysed as controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D-E</xref>). The order of appearance was obtained by fitting a logistic curve to smoothed gene expression values of the selected hypo genes along the hypoblast pseudotime and identifying the mid point of each logistic curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Based on these analyses, we suggest the following order: <italic>PDGFRA &gt; BMP2 &gt; OTX2 &gt; LGALS2 &gt; VIL1 &gt; SOX17 &gt; FOXA2 &gt; SALL1 &gt; GATA4 &gt; COL4A1 &gt; RSPO3 &gt; FRZB &gt; IGF1 &gt; FRLT3 &gt; CPN1 &gt; SYT13</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The first divergence compared with mouse appeared with <italic>GATA6 and SOX7. GATA6</italic> appears to be a generic human preimplantation extraembryonic marker owing to its presence in both TE and hypo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boroviak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Roode et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>SOX7</italic> is not expressed in human blastocysts, whereas <italic>OTX2</italic> marks hypo in human, but not mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boroviak et al., 2018</xref>); <italic>FOXA2</italic> appears in human hypo, but is absent in mouse at the mid blastocyst stage, according to scRNAseq. However, in late human blastocysts FOXA2 protein overlaps with SOX17, whereas it appears only in a subset of hypo cells at this stage in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Blakeley et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, according to published data <italic>PDGFRA, BMP2, OTX2</italic> and <italic>LGALS2</italic> may be classified as early ICM genes; <italic>VIL1, SOX17, FOXA2 and SALL1</italic> as mid stage hypo genes and <italic>GATA4</italic> as a marker for mature hypo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3,4</xref>). To verify order of appearance of selected markers at the protein level we performed IF.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>PDGFRA is the first hypoblast marker to appear in the early ICM of human blastocysts</title><p id="P12">Validated antibodies for many of the novel hypo markers identified through the high resolution UMAP are not yet available. We therefore focused on PDGFRA, SOX17, FOXA2 and GATA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). We co-stained for SOX2 or NANOG, since these epi markers are known to be lost in hypo precursors earlier than OCT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Blakeley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Niakan and Eggan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Roode et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E</xref>). PDGFRA appears in the membrane of all cells of the early ICM at D5, co-expressed with both SOX2 and NANOG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-D</xref>). At early D6, emerging epi precursors downregulate PDGFRA and it becomes completely lost in the epi at late D6 while remaining strongly expressed in the hypo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-D</xref>). This is the first indication of a common precursor in the ICM which gives rise to epi and hypo lineages. Distribution of SOX17 is heterogeneous at D5 and then widespread in all co-expressing ICM cells at early D6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). SOX17 becomes specific to hypo at late D6 and it is still present at D7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Neither FOXA2 nor GATA4 are expressed as early as D5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). <italic>FOXA2</italic> expression is detectable earlier than <italic>GATA4</italic> at D6 based on scRNAseq analysis and image quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B,D-H</xref>). Moreover, FOXA2+GATA4- cells are apparent at D6. GATA4+ cells are exclusively found facing the cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Meistermann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Roode et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting its expression commences after physical epi:hypo, sorting, while FOXA2+ cells can be observed within the ICM core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B,C</xref>). FOXA2 and GATA4 differ with regard to co-expression with epi markers. High expressing FOXA2 cells have low levels of SOX2 and are negative for NANOG. In contrast, cells expressing GATA4 are able to co-express low levels of both SOX2 and NANOG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-D,G,H</xref>). The difference in co-expression with NANOG suggests that despite its earlier appearance in the ICM cells, FOXA2 is a marker of a more specified hypo state. This could be an indication of ICM differentiation taking place asynchronously in a similar way to the mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Saiz et al., 2016</xref>) or via an independent mechanism governing the specification of the hypoblast, such as exposure to the cavity or signalling molecules.</p><p id="P13">The presence of PDGFRA in the membrane of all ICM cells at early D5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-D</xref>) suggests that both epi and hypo populations arise from a common pool of ICM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Radley et al., 2022</xref>), rather than derivation of hypo cells from epi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Meistermann et al., 2021</xref>). Inclusion of SOX2 and NANOG in our characterization allowed us to determine which population between epi and hypo was specified first from the ICM. Already at D6, it is possible to see OCT4+SOX17- cells before OCT4-SOX17+ are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), implying the epi is specified first, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boroviak et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the protein characterization with both SOX2 and NANOG showed that SOX2+PDGFRA- as well as NANOG+PDGFRA- cells are present at D6, confirming that epi precursors appear earlier in development than the hypo counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-D</xref>). Low levels of SOX2 can be seen in hypo precursors until late D6 and NANOG is still expressed in PDGFRA+GATA4+ at D6, albeit not in cells already expressing high levels of FOXA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-D</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To summarise, our data support the model in which epi and hypo populations arise from a common progenitor, the early ICM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Radley et al., 2022</xref>). While this conclusion was primarily based on existence of early ICM markers, such as LAMA4, that are downregulated in the differentiating ICM, here we investigated hypo marker expression at early stages to determine whether a co-expressing ICM population exists that subsequently resolves into separate lineages. The presence of PDGFRA in all ICM cells at D5 together with OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG indicates that both lineages originate in a population of cells co-expressing epi and hypo markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Our data also strengthen the hypothesis that epi is the first population to be specified, since NANOG+ only or SOX2+ only cells appear earlier than hypo+ only cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), consistent with conclusions drawn from cell transfer experiments in preimplantation mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Grabarek et al., 2012</xref>). Unfortunately, such definitive experiments are not possible using human embryos.</p><p id="P15">SOX2 can be maintained in human hypo cells until D6 but NANOG expression appears to be incompatible with FOXA2 expression arising in the embryo as early as D6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Blakeley et al., 2015</xref>). The early specification of the epi could be related to epi factors already expressed in the early ICM, while the hypo population is strengthened with <italic>de novo</italic> expression of markers from D5 to D7. At D5 only PDGFRA and SOX17 are expressed, in contrast to the high levels of PDGFRA, SOX17, FOXA2 and GATA4 at D7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). As more antibodies for less well-known hypoblast markers become available, the process of lineage segregation in the developing human ICM can be further refined to uncover the optimal sequence for healthy blastocyst development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Human embryos</title><p id="P16">Supernumerary frozen human embryos were donated with informed consent by couples undergoing <italic>in</italic>□<italic>vitro</italic>□fertility treatment.

Embryonic stage was assessed based on thinning of the zona pellucida and blastocoele expansion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Immunostaining and imaging of human embryos</title><p id="P17">The zona pellucida of D5 and D6 blastocysts was removed using acid Tyrode’s solution (Gibco) before fixation with 4% PFA in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Embryos were rinsed in PBS containing 3 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone (Sigma-Aldrich) (PBS/PVP), permeabilised using 0.25% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS/PVP for 30 min and blocked in blocking buffer comprising PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 0.01% Tween20 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2% donkey serum for 2 h at room temperature. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) Embryos were incubated in primary antibody solution overnight at 4°C and rinsed three times for 15 min in blocking buffer before incubation in secondary antibody solution for 1-2 h at room temperature in the dark. Embryos were rinsed in blocking buffer and imaged through a Poly-D-Lysin coated Mattek dish (P356-0-14) whilst submerged in blocking buffer. Embryos were imaged in a Leica Stellaris Confocal microscope and image analysis was performed using FIJI.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Image acquisition and quantification</title><p id="P18">Embryos were imaged in a Leica Stellaris 8 confocal microscope.</p><p id="P19">Confocal images were converted to 8-bit using FIJI. The Hoechst/nuclei channel was used for nuclei segmentation in 3D using ZeroCostDL4Mic StarDist via Google colaboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Schmidt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Weigert et al., 2018</xref>). For details on software training for embryo images, Kraunsoe et al., (in press).</p><p id="P20">The segmented image outcome was merged to the original image using FIJI. Integrated density, Mean fluorescence Intensity and volume per nuclei were measured using FIJI. Data analysis and data representation was performed using R. Scatter and violin plots were generated using the function “ggplot2” while histogram plots were created using “ggExtra”. No statistical analysis was performed due to the low number of embryos per stage per batch.</p><p id="P21">The expression threshold that separates the TE and ICM, and the ICM into epi, hypo and precursors was calculated based on the nuclear fluorescence intensity via generating histograms from the data at D7. At this late stage, epi and hypo markers are only expressed in the ICM, not TE; moreover, the ICMs are solely formed by epi and hypo with complete different marker expression meaning that plotting SOX17 and/or OCT4 generates at least two distinct normal distributions (negative and positive). The point in between the two normal distributions is considered the threshold and it is used in early stages to separate ICM from TE, and subsequently Epi and Hypo precursors from the undefined ICM population. Because OCT4 is expressed in the TE at D5, the ‘ICM’ population at D5 is misleadingly large in the scatter plot since it also contains the TE cells.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Single cell RNA sequencing analysis</title><p id="P22">The single cell RNA sequencing analysis in this work was primarily built upon the high-resolution human pre-implantation embryo UMAP generated recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Radley et al., 2022</xref>).

At early D6, SOX17 expression begins in the nucleus of the undefined ICM population together with membrane PDGFRA, OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG. In parallel, some cells lose PDGFRA in the membrane and become epi precursors. At late D6, more epi cells have emerged within the ICM compartment. This stage is characterized by the appearance of hypoblast precursors: cells that express SOX17 and FOXA2 in the nucleus as well as PDGFRA in the membrane but have downregulated epi markers such as NANOG or SOX2. More advanced hypo cells can be found located next to the blastocoel expressing GATA4 in the nucleus, the last marker of this series to be expressed. At D7, both lineages are specified and sorted. The hypo cells are located next to the blastocoel and the epi compartment is situated between these and the polar TE. Epi cells express NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2 while hypo cells express PDGFRA, SOX17, FOXA2 and GATA4.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS158394-f004"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Antibodies used for immunofluorescence</title></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Antibody</th><th align="left" valign="top">Supplier</th><th align="left" valign="top">Cat no</th><th align="left" valign="top">Dilution</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">PDGFRα</td><td align="left" valign="top">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="top">#ab203491<break/> RRID:AB_</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">SOX17</td><td align="left" valign="top">R&amp;D System</td><td align="left" valign="top">#AF1924<break/> RRID:AB_355060</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">GATA4</td><td align="left" valign="top">EBioscience</td><td align="left" valign="top">#14-9980-82<break/> RRID:AB_763541</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">FOXA2/HNF-3β</td><td align="left" valign="top">R&amp;D System</td><td align="left" valign="top">#AF2400<break/> RRID:AB_2294104</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">SOX2</td><td align="left" valign="top">Santa Cruz</td><td align="left" valign="top">#sc-365823<break/> RRID:AB_10842165</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">OCT4?</td><td align="left" valign="top">Santa Cruz</td><td align="left" valign="top">#sc-5279<break/> RRID:AB_628051</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">DRAQ 7<sup>™</sup></td><td align="left" valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="top">#D15105</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Donkey anti-goat 405</td><td align="left" valign="top">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="top">#ab175664<break/> RRID:AB_2313502</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:500</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Alexa Fluor donkey<break/> anti-rabbit 488</td><td align="left" valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="top">#A32790<break/> RRID:AB_2762833</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:500</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Alexa Fluor donkey<break/> anti-mouse 555</td><td align="left" valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="top">#A-31570<break/> RRID:AB_2536180</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:500</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Alexa Fluor donkey<break/> anti-rat 647</td><td align="left" valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="top">#A78947<break/> RRID:AB_2910635</td><td align="left" valign="top">1:500</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
