The structural changes occurring to the poly-Q when increasing its length remain poorly understood mainly due to its intrinsic flexibility and the strong compositional bias of the protein. The systematic application of site-specific isotopic labeling has enabled residue-specific NMR investigations of the poly-Q tract of pathogenic httex1 variants with 46 and 66 consecutive glutamines.

HD is triggered by an abnormal expansion of the poly-Q tract located in exon1 (httex1) of the 348-kDa huntingtin, a ubiquitous protein involved in multiple pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In its non-pathogenic form, the httex1 poly-Q tract is comprised of 17-20 glutamines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>; however, when the number of consecutive glutamines exceeds the pathogenic threshold of 35, it results in aggregation-prone mutants. Indeed, fragments of mutant httex1 can be found forming large cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates within neurons of the striatum, a well-known hallmark of HD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The presence of such aggregates, the neuronal degeneration, the age of onset and disease severity, all correlate with the length of the expanded poly-Q tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Notably, the mutant httex1 fragment alone suffices to reproduce HD symptoms in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, no effective treatment is currently available, mainly because of the lack of knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Amyloidogenic aggregates were initially proposed to be the toxic species in HD, acting by sequestering essential cellular proteins and components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, they have also been related to neuronal survival in certain cell types, suggesting that aggregates may be protective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. It has also been proposed that toxicity is caused by soluble species of httex1, which are characterized by a high polymorphism comprising monomers, dimers, tetramers and small oligomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. It has been shown that N17, the 17 residue-long fragment preceding poly-Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), is the pivotal element triggering httex1 self-recognition and enhancing aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. However, the structural mechanism by which N17 propagates aggregation and cytotoxicity of expanded httex1 remains to be defined.</p><p id="P4">Two models have been suggested to connect the pathological threshold and toxicity, the ‘toxic structure’ and the ‘linear lattice’ models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. While the ‘toxic structure’ model proposes the appearance of a distinct toxic conformation when the poly-Q tract is expanded beyond the pathological threshold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>; the ‘linear lattice’ model suggests that poly-Q tracts are inherently toxic and that their toxicity systematically increases with the homorepeat length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, both models have been supported by antibody recognition experiments in different studies. Furthermore, the absence of sharp changes in single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), circular dichroism and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments around the pathological threshold has been argued to substantiate the ‘linear lattice’ model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. High-resolution structures of non-pathogenic and pathogenic httex1 variants are required to evaluate the changes occurring upon poly-Q expansion, discriminate between both models and finally define the bases of httex1cytotoxicity.</p><p id="P5">Until recently, the detailed high-resolution structural characterization of soluble httex1, especially of those with pathogenic poly-Q length, has been hampered by the intrinsic properties of the protein, namely the highly flexible nature, its aggregation propensity and the strong compositional bias. X-ray diffraction or electron microscopy, normally used to study folded proteins, cannot be applied to probe disordered proteins such as httex1. Furthermore, the presence of low complexity regions, such as the long glutamine and proline homorepeats, results in important signal overlap when nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is used, hampering the collection of high-resolution information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Despite these difficulties, several high-resolution NMR studies of non-pathogenic httex1 and N-terminal fragments have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. However, due to the severe overlap, only assignments of the first and last glutamines of the poly-Q tract could be achieved.</p><p id="P6">To circumvent the NMR signal overlap, our lab recently developed a site-specific isotopic labeling (SSIL) strategy that combines cell-free protein expression and non-sense suppression, enabling the investigation of homorepeats in a residue-specific manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. When applying this methodology to a non-pathogenic version of httex1 containing a 16-residue-long poly-Q tract (H16), it was shown that the protein was enriched in helical conformations whose length and stability were defined by flanking regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. While the helical propensity was propagated from N17 to the poly-Q through a hydrogen-bond network, it was blocked by the helix-breaking effect caused by the proline-rich region (PRR) that follows the poly-Q tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The structural effects imposed by N17 and PRR may explain the positive and negative regulation of httex1 aggregation by both poly-Q flanking regions, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Whether these structural mechanisms also govern the conformational landscape of pathogenic httex1 remains to be discerned.</p><p id="P7">In the present study, we applied SSIL to a pathogenic form of httex1 containing a 46 residue-long poly-Q tract (H46) to unambiguously assign sixteen of these glutamines spread along the tract and probed the structure and dynamics of the homorepeat. The integration of the NMR information and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data provided the structural description of H46 as an ensemble of elongated, partially helical conformations, whose propagation and stability mechanisms were deciphered by <sup>19</sup>F-NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. All together, our observations provides a detailed structural perspective of the ‘linear lattice’ toxicity model, demonstrating that the presence of long, persistent, aggregation-prone α-helices is concomitant to the expansion of the poly-Q tract beyond the pathological threshold.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Pathogenic and non-pathogenic httex1 forms present similar structural features</title><p id="P8">In order to study a pathogenic form of httex1, a construct comprising the N17 domain, a 46-residue-long poly-Q tract and the PRR was fused to superfolder GFP (sfGFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). A fully <sup>15</sup>N-labeled H46 sample was prepared and a <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC NMR spectrum was recorded in order to evaluate its general spectroscopic features. Similarly to H16<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, the spectrum revealed that while peaks from N17 and the PRR were well dispersed, the peaks corresponding to glutamine residues remained in a large poorly resolved density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). As expected, the increased molecular weight led to a general peak broadening, which was particularly striking in the region of the expanded poly-Q tract.</p><p id="P9">The reduced stability of H46 at high concentration precluded the use of traditional 3D-NMR experiments for the frequency assignment. Thus, to confirm the similarities found between the pathogenic and non-pathogenic httex1 constructs, selectively labeled samples of H46 were prepared (<sup>15</sup>N-Ala and <sup>15</sup>N-Lys; <sup>15</sup>N-Gly, <sup>15</sup>N-Ser and <sup>15</sup>N-Arg; <sup>15</sup>N-Leu and <sup>15</sup>N-Glu; and <sup>15</sup>N-Phe), therefore reducing the overlap of some N17 and PRR signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>). The selective labeling showed that the vast majority of peaks corresponding to N17 and PRR residues nicely overlap for both H46 and H16. Interestingly, F17 peaks in H16 and H46 displayed different chemical shifts. Altogether, our observations suggest that both httex1 forms share similar structural features outside of the poly-Q tract, although some perturbations in the N17/poly-Q boundary are induced upon the extension of the homorepeat.</p><p id="P10">In order to obtain high-resolution information on the poly-Q tract of H46, the SSIL approach using previously optimized protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> was used to specifically study 16 of the 46 glutamines of the H46 poly-Q tract, as well as two glutamines within the PRR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra of these samples revealed that the glutamines adjacent to N17 (Q18, Q20 and Q21) adopted the lowest chemical shift values of the poly-Q region without any specific trend, while the following glutamines (Q24-Q56) exhibited steadily increasing <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>15</sup>N chemical shifts. This last observation points towards a gradual structural change along the homorepeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, upper panels). Finally, the last glutamines of the tract (Q61-Q63) were found at the highest chemical shifts, with Q63, affected by the adjacent poly-P tract, displaying an isolated peak outside of the poly-Q density. The signals corresponding to Q75 and Q91 in the PRR did not show any specific trend. The same features were observed when monitoring the Cα-Hα correlations of the same SSIL samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, lower panels). Notably, the Q21 SSIL sample presented two Cα peaks with similar intensity, suggesting the presence of two slowly interconverting conformations. While one of the peaks appeared close to these of Q18 and Q20, the second one was shifted to the same spectral region of the central glutamines of the homorepeat.</p><p id="P11">The secondary chemical shift (SCS) analysis of the glutamines using a neighbor-corrected random coil database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> showed that the poly-Q tract was highly enriched in α-helical conformations, in line with previous observations for non-pathological constructs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). However, this propensity was not homogeneous; the helicity reached its maximum at Q18 and presented a steady plateau over 30 residues, until around Q48, in which the helical propensity was maintained. Only for the C-terminal part of the H46 poly-Q a smooth decrease of helicity was observed, reaching negative SCS values for the last glutamines of the tract. When comparing this SCS analysis with that previously reported for H16<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, an increase in helicity for the N-terminal part of the H46 poly-Q tract was observed. This phenomenon also explains the shift of the NH, NεH<sub>2</sub> and CαHα NMR signals of Q18 and Q21 towards more helical positions in H46 when compared with H16 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b</xref>). Interestingly, the two Cα peak observed for Q21 presented SCS values of 1.27 and 1.63 ppm, corresponding to two conformations with different helical content.</p><p id="P12">The extent of the structural effects induced by the PRR was analyzed by aligning the SCS values of H16 and H46 from the C-terminus of the poly-Q tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Interestingly, while the last four glutamines of the tract (Q30-Q33 in H16 and Q60-Q63 in H46) showed the same conformational trends, this similarity was reduced for more distant glutamines, such as Q56. Notice that this residue is closer to the helix-promoting N17 in H16 (Q26) than in H46.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>H66 substantiates the persistence of long α-helical conformations in long poly-Q tracts</title><p id="P13">The above results suggest that the distance to the PRR is the only parameter defining the length of α-helical conformations in httex1 and that helical conformations encompass larger sections of the homorepeat when the length of the poly-Q tract is increased. In order to validate this hypothesis, we studied an httex1 construct with 66 consecutive glutamines (H66). The <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC of H66 produced by cell-free expression nicely overlapped with that of H46, indicating that no structural changes occur in httex1 upon incorporating twenty additional glutamines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a</xref>). The glutamine region of H66 and H46 spectra displayed the same elongated shape and their maximum intensities were centered at the same proton and nitrogen frequencies. Then, using our standard protocols, we applied the SSIL strategy to two glutamines (Q56 and Q76) of H66 to probe their helical content. Note that these two residues are located at equivalent positions to residue Q56 in H46 when aligning both sequences from the N- and C-termini, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The NH peak of H66-Q76 appeared in a position equivalent to H46-Q56, whereas H66-Q56 had a lower chemical shift, suggesting that this glutamine adopted a more helical structure than the other two residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This observation was further confirmed by monitoring the Cα-Hα correlations for the three residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Indeed, while the Cα-Hα peaks for H46-Q56 and H66-Q76 overlapped, H66-Q56 was shifted towards more helical conformations. The helical propensity of these residues was quantified with the SCS analysis, indicating an enhanced helicity for H66-Q56 (1.18 ppm) when compared with H66-Q76 (0.50 ppm) and H46-Q56 (0.53 ppm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Interestingly, the SCS value for H66-Q56 was very similar to those observed for the plateau in H46, indicating that the additional twenty glutamines in H66 adopt helical conformations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2b</xref>). These results evidenced that the extent of the α-helix-breaking capacity of the PRR is the same in all httex1 forms, allowing the α-helical propensity to be propagated through a larger number of glutamines when the length of the homorepeat is increased.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>SAXS indicates that H46 is an elongated particle in solution with a large degree of flexibility</title><p id="P14">Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was applied to derive the overall size of H46 in solution. To this end, we applied size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled with SAXS, which allowed us to isolate the H46 peak from potential aggregates and partially digested sfGFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). The analysis of the resulting profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) indicates that H46 is a monomeric particle with a radius of gyration, <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>, of 41.5 ± 0.5 Å according to Guinier analysis and a maximum dimension, <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub>, of 148 Å, calculated using pair-wise distance distribution, <italic>p(r</italic>), analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3c</xref>). Although the Kratky representation displayed a peak indicating the presence of a folded protein, which was attributed to the sfGFP, the intensity did not completely return to base line, suggesting that the httex1 part of H46 exhibited a high level of flexibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The smooth decrease of the <italic>p(r</italic>) when approaching the <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic> value and the departure in the maximum of the Kratky plot from the standard values of a globular protein substantiate the flexibility and the overall extendedness of the protein.</p><p id="P15">To further confirm that the overall extendedness is inherent to httex1, we performed an equivalent SAXS analysis for H16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">FigS. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Not surprisingly, the resulting SAXS profile of H16 indicated that the protein is a smaller particle (<italic>R<sub>g</sub></italic>=32.9 ± 0.2 Å and <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic> = 126 Å) in solution than H46 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Importantly, H16 retained SAXS features corresponding to an extended and flexible particle observed for H46.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>H46 consists of a mixture of α-helical conformations of different lengths</title><p id="P16">The Cα chemical shifts and the SAXS data measured for H46 were integrated to derive a structural model of the protein. Similar to our previous study of the non-pathogenic H16, two families of ensembles were generated to capture the conformational influence of both flanking regions using a conformational sampling method for intrinsically disordered proteins (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods section</xref> for details)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. For the first family (N→C ensembles), starting with the <sup>10</sup>AFESLKS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> region of N17 as partially structured, multiple ensembles of 5,000 conformations were built by successively including F17 and an increasing number of glutamines in the poly-Q tract (from Q18 to Q63) as partially structured, while the rest of the chain was considered to be fully disordered. An equivalent strategy was followed for the second family of ensembles (N←C ensembles) for which glutamines (from Q63 to Q18) were successively considered as partially structured starting from the poly-P tract. Note that using this building strategy, secondary structural propensities are naturally propagated due to the neighboring effects. For the resulting ensembles of each family and after building the side chains with the program SCWRL4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, averaged Cα chemical shifts were computed with SPARTA+<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. For each family, the relative populations of these ensembles were optimized using the experimental Cα chemical shifts with Q55 as the boundary position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Then, an NMR-compatible ensemble was built by randomly taking conformation from the selected ensembles with the appropriate populations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref> for details). This ensemble was further refined by integrating the SAXS data with the ensemble optimization method (EOM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. For this, we included the crystallographic structure of sfGFP (PDBID: 3LVA) and the C-terminal His-tag to the individual conformations of the NMR-optimized ensemble to generate the pool of conformations used by EOM (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). It must be noted that the H46 ensemble had an overall size <italic>(R</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = 42.7 Å) very similar to the experimentally determined one <italic>(R</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>, = 41.5 ± 0.5 Å), highlighting the quality of our starting model despite using local NMR information for the refinement. Sub-ensembles selected with EOM yielded an excellent fit to the experimental profile (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).

This analysis substantiated the presence of a mixture of multiple helical conformations encompassing different sections of the H46 poly-Q tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). These α-helices were initiated in the last residues of the N17 domain (<sup>14</sup>LKSF<sup>17</sup>) and propagated along the tract.

The two diastereotopic Hβ glutamine protons displayed resolved responses, with the difference in their chemical shifts increasing along the sequence. The maximum difference was observed for the last glutamines of the tract (Q62 and Q63) and those within the PRR (Q75 and Q91), while Q18 displayed the smallest one, featuring virtually degenerate Hβ chemical shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5a</xref>). These observations indicate a correlation between the chemical shift difference and the level of disorder.

First, we used 4F-Gln to substantiate the participation of Q20 and Q21 in the hydrogen bond network that propagates helicity in the homorepeat. To this end, we incorporated 4F-Gln in positions Q20 or Q21 in two Η46 samples that were also isotopically labeled with <sup>15</sup>N-Ser or <sup>15</sup>N-Phe, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> left panels and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). When comparing their <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra with those of non-fluorinated H46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, left panels), substantial changes could be observed in S16 and F17 upon Q20 or Q21 fluorination, respectively. The presence of a fluorinated glutamine in position 20 produced a slight chemical shift change of S16, while fluorination of Q21 induced a stronger effect on F17, leading to the appearance of a second peak. Furthermore, no chemical shift changes were observed for the other serines and phenylalanines of Η46, highlighting the specificity of the interaction. Importantly, similar observations were made when 4F-Gln was incorporated in the same positions in Η16, in samples simultaneously labeled with <sup>15</sup>N-Ser and <sup>15</sup>N-Phe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> right panels and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). Indeed, when Q20 was fluorinated in the non-pathogenic form, not only S16 was affected, but F17 was also perturbed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). Fluorination of Q21 again resulted in the appearance of a second F17 signal and slightly affected S16. These data underline the structural coupling between Q20 and S16 as well as Q21 and F17, in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic forms of httex1.</p><p id="P24">In a second set of experiments, we incorporated 4F-Gln in four H46 positions strategically located at the beginning (Q20 and Q21), the middle (Q40) and the end (Q60) of the poly-Q tract to be monitored by 1D <sup>19</sup>F-NMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).

Strong differences in <sup>19</sup>F chemical shifts were observed for the four positions despite the homogeneity of the amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This demonstrates important structural changes along the poly-Q tract, most likely linked to the amount of helical content. The chemical shift of Q21 was particularly high, most probably due to its proximity to the ring currents exerted by F17 in the hydrogen-bonded form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Interestingly, multiple <sup>19</sup>F-NMR resonances were observed for Q20 and Q21. For Q20, three distinct responses were measured, including two signals with very close chemical shifts that could only just be resolved. In line with the Cγ-Hγ peaks, it can be concluded that the Q20 side chain adopts at least two different conformations in a slow exchange regime. Given the sensitivity of the <sup>19</sup>F chemical shift, the two closely resonating signals can be explained by the fluorine sensing the different conformational states of neighboring glutamines. For Q21, a weak second <sup>19</sup>F signal could be detected, in agreement with the two populations previously identified in the Cα-Hα, Cβ-Hβ and Cγ-Hγ correlations. Altogether, the site-specific incorporation of 4F-Gln substantiates the structural link of N17 with the poly-Q tract, the distinct glutamine side-chain conformational preference along the poly-Q tract, and the presence of multiple conformations in the homorepeat.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations provides insights into the helix propagation and stabilization mechanisms in httex1</title><p id="P26">We performed Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> simulations to understand the secondary structure propensities of httex1 and get further insights into the role of N17 in inducing helicity. Previous MD studies of httex1 have yielded vastly different results ranging from completely α-helical to highly β-strand rich structures, most likely due to the use of non-adapted force-fields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. To simulate a httex1 fragment encompassing N17, the polyQ tract and five prolines, we used the recently developed ff99SBws-STQ force-field, which has been refined to describe the secondary structure propensities of low-complexity proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In all the 8 independent MD simulations, with an aggregated time of ≈20 μs, we observed that the poly-Q tract sampled a wide conformational landscape and mainly adopted α-helical and disordered conformations, while N17 presented a higher helical propensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9a</xref>). Interestingly, several helical folding and melting events could be observed along these trajectories. For some of the simulations, we observed the formation of long α-helices that spanned almost the whole length of N17 and poly-Q tract and were only absent in the residues close to the poly-P region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In line with the directionality observed experimentally, the process of α-helix melting systematically occurred from C to N, as observed in the 1600-1800 ns period in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>, while α-helices in httex1 preferentially grew from N to C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>). The spontaneous formation of short α-helical conformations unconnected with N17 was also observed along the trajectories (<italic>e.g.</italic>, frames 2000-2300 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), although they dissolved relatively fast. This suggests a small inherent α-helical propensity of poly-Q tracts.</p><p id="P27">The weighted average per-residue fractional helicity of all the simulations indicated that the poly-Q tract adopted higher α-helical propensity when closer to N17 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9b</xref>). Moving further from N17, the helicity decreased until Q30 from where it remained flat until Q55 to finally decrease when approaching the poly-P. Importantly, this behavior was qualitatively very similar to the experimentally determined α-helix propensity of httex1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and 1e). This suggests that our simulations captured the structural mechanisms present in httex1, although the relative population of α-helix in the poly-Q tract was underestimated. When analyzing the frames with α-helices with increasing length (from 4 to 40), we observed a gradual increase in fractional helicity from N- to C-terminus, substantiating the structural propagation from N17 towards the poly-Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p><p id="P28">We analyzed the trajectories for the existence of <italic>i→i+4</italic> bifurcated hydrogen bonds.

Residue Q21 presented the highest propensity to form bifurcated hydrogen bonds with F17. Taken together, the trend of bifurcated hydrogen bonds agrees with the results of the appearance of doublets in Cγ-Hγ correlations and the results from specifically fluorinated glutamines probing the initial residues of the poly-Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Then, we analyzed the correlation between bifurcate hydrogen bonds and α-helix stability. Not surprisingly, the percentage of these hydrogen bonds was higher in frames where the segment <italic>(i → i+4</italic>) adopted a helical conformation.

With this aim, two N17 mutants of H46 were produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). First, by substituting <sup>16</sup>SF<sup>17</sup> by <sup>16</sup>GG<sup>17</sup> (LKGG-H46), we hamper the H-bond network connecting both domains. Second, when <sup>15</sup>KS<sup>16</sup> were replaced by <sup>15</sup>LL<sup>16</sup> (LLLF-H46), the hydrogen bond network was strengthened by incorporating two additional large hydrophobic residues. Uniformly labeled and SSIL samples of these mutants were produced and analyzed by NMR. On one hand, LKGG-H46 glutamine <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC signals collapsed in a broad, high-intensity, downfield-shifted peak, proving a substantial loss of helicity in comparison with the wild-type H46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Interestingly, this broad peak did not overlap with the positions corresponding to fully unstructured glutamines, which were shifted further downfield. This indicates that poly-Q, even when disconnected from the flanking region, contains a small intrinsic propensity for helical conformations, in agreement with our MD simulations and previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectrum of fully labeled LLLF-H46 displayed a more dispersed density of glutamine peaks and an additional upfield density, pointing to a helicity increase of the poly-Q tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The detailed analysis of NH, NεH<sub>2</sub> and Cα signals of Q18, Q20 and Q21 SSIL samples from both mutants confirmed the decrease in structuration of LKGG-H46 and the increase in helicity in LLLF-H46, in comparison with the wild-type form (H46) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>). Importantly, Q21 in LLLF-H46 displayed signatures of two conformations as also observed for the wild-type. Interestingly, this residue exhibited two NHε correlation peaks, suggesting the formation of a stronger bifurcated hydrogen bond than in the wild-type. Unfortunately, a single Cα peak, corresponding to the less helical conformation, was observed for Q21 in this mutant, suggesting an unfavorable exchange regime for the NMR detection.</p><p id="P30">Once the structural features of the H46 mutants were confirmed, their propensities to aggregate were measured. For this, 15 μΜ samples of H46, LKGG-H46 and LLLF-H46 were incubated at 37°C and the soluble fractions of the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE over a period of 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12</xref>). Several essays were performed to better sample the monitored period. H46 presented a moderate aggregation propensity, with a systematic decrease of the soluble fraction from the first hours of incubation that almost disappeared after 48 h. When the soluble fraction was fitted to a reverse sigmoid function an aggregation half-time, t1/2, of 19 h was obtained. A much stronger aggregation propensity was observed for the LLLF-H46 mutant, for which a t1/2 of only 1.4 h was derived. These observations indicate that increasing the α-helical stability strongly enhances the aggregation propensity of httex1. When the same experiment was performed with the LKGG-H46 mutant, which has a more disordered poly-Q tract similar to pure poly-Q peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, the first signs of aggregation occur after 20 h of incubation and a t1/2 of 29 h was obtained. The presence of sfGFP fused to the C-terminus of the httex1 variants, which certainly slows down aggregation, makes the quantitative comparison with previous studies difficult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. However, the relative aggregation propensity of the three httex1 forms can be unambiguously obtained.</p><p id="P31">The morphology of the aggregates for H46 and the two mutants after 48 and 120 h were investigated by correlative atomic force microscopy (AFM) – total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S13a,b</xref>). The intrinsic fluorescence of the proteins allowed the easier localization of the aggregates on the silica surface and indicated that no proteolytic activity preceded the aggregation process of the samples. The inspection of H46 micrographs measured after 48 h of incubation revealed the presence of typical amyloid structures with interconnected fibrils, often presenting a length larger than 1 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>, upper panels, left row). Those fibrils exhibited a heterogeneous morphology, with notable variations in width and height, similarly to those recently described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Interestingly, LLLF-H46 aggregates displayed similar features, although the presence of fibrils was substantially more abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>, middle panels). Indeed, large aggregates containing long fibrils were easily found in the sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S13a</xref>). Again, width variations were often observed along the fibrils. The analysis of LKGG-H46 preparation revealed a different behavior. Considerably larger and more heterogeneous aggregates, presenting often well-defined limits, were observed for this mutant. Images indicated the presence of very short fibrils, although relatively long isolated fibrils with a similar morphology than the wild-type and the LLLF-H46 were found in the boundaries of the heterogeneous aggregates.</p><p id="P32">To verify whether the morphology was maintained after longer maturation times, 5-day-old fibrils were also imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13b</xref>). Long fibrils were found in wild-type and LLLF-H46 preparations and, interestingly, elongated bundle structures involving several paired filaments were observed. However, these coiled structures were seldom found in LKGG-H46 aggregates and, when observed, they were less ordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Indeed, fibrils around LKGG-H46 bundles were fragmented and small aggregates could be detected along the whole sample, suggesting reduced fibril stability. Altogether, aggregation and AFM experiments demonstrate that the structural properties of httex1 exert a stronger influence on the aggregation propensity and the final form of the fibrils than the poly-Q tract length.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P33">Huntington’s disease is the most notorious example of the poly-Q-related diseases and findings connecting structure and disease unveiled for huntingtin are most probably applicable to the whole family of pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In this study, we have characterized at high resolution a pathogenic form of httex1 containing 46 consecutive glutamines, a system that is out of the reach for traditional structural biology approaches. We demonstrate that SSIL can be systematically applied to highly repetitive sequences, such as H66, and the only limitations arise from the capacity to purify the protein and preserve its stability in solution.</p><p id="P34">The systematic application of SSIL to H46 demonstrates that this protein retains the α-helical conformation previously observed for non-pathogenic versions of httex1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Using circular dichroism, α-helical propensity in pathogenic httex1 had been previously identified for httex1 with up to 55 glutamines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, it was shown that the helical content increased concomitantly with the length of the tract. However, the low-resolution of circular dichroism hampered the analysis of the extent and stability of helical conformations. One of the most striking observations of our study is the fairly flat plateau of measured secondary chemical shifts along a large fraction of the poly-Q tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These chemical shifts are consistent with the coexistence of multiple partially formed α-helices of different lengths, spanning almost the complete poly-Q tract. However, these helices are not equally populated and long α-helices are prevalent according to our synergistic analysis of NMR and SAXS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This behavior evidences that the helices, which are formed through a nucleation process triggered by the interaction between the N17 and the first glutamines of the tract, are cooperatively propagated along the homorepeat. A faster decrease in the SCS values would be expected if all helical lengths would display a similar thermodynamic stability. The comparison of the NMR observables for H16 with those of H46 also substantiates the helical stabilization with the poly-Q length. For instance, despite both proteins having the same sequence context, NH, Cα and NεH<sub>2</sub> chemical shifts for initial glutamines of the tract are systematically shifted towards more helical conformations in H46 than in H16 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Moreover, experiments performed on H66 demonstrate that α-helical conformations are maintained for long poly-Q tracts and the distance of individual glutamines to the PRR defines their helical propensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P35">From a structural perspective, the α-helical stability found in httex1 could arise from the formation of bifurcate hydrogen bonds all along the homorepeat. Indeed, up to Q48, the diastereotopic Hγ protons have non-degenerate chemical shifts, although the chemical shift difference decreases along the repeat (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). An opposite trend is observed for the diastereotopic Hβ protons, which present increasing chemical shift differences when reaching the less structured glutamines of H46. These spectroscopic features have been associated with the formation of bifurcated hydrogen bonds and the concomitant rigidification of glutamine side chains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Our MD simulations indicated that the percentage of bifurcated hydrogen bonds is correlated with the stability of α-helical conformations. The ensemble of these observations suggests that glutamine side chains are actively involved in the stabilization of the helical conformation of the poly-Q tract and that the strength of this mechanism declines when approaching the PRR.</p><p id="P36">Partial structuration in the poly-Q implies that individual glutamines co-exist in (at least) two different conformational states. A similar conclusion was reached by EPR experiments after incorporating stable radicals in several positions of a pathogenic httex1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. In that study, two dynamic regimes were identified in N17 and poly-Q tract residues, but not in glutamines in the PRR. However, structural details of this conformational fluctuation could not be unveiled. Several NMR signatures collected for H46 using SSIL samples, which can be rationalized through the MD simulations, define the structural bases of this conformational equilibrium. These include, among others, the two Cα-Hα peaks for Q21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), the two sets of Cβ-Hβ and Cγ-Hγ peaks for Q20 and Q21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), and the multiple <sup>19</sup>F-NMR frequencies also detected for these two residues. Remarkably, the co-existence of a conformational equilibrium is also manifested in most of the other glutamines of the tract, which exhibit the previously eluded non-degenerate Cγ-Hγ peaks. Our observations demonstrate that httex1 fluctuates between a rigid α-helical conformation, which is stabilized with bifurcate hydrogen bonds, and a more disordered state. Furthermore, our data suggest that the dynamic regime also changes in conjunction with the stability of the helical conformation. While the first glutamines of the tract, which have the highest helical propensity, exhibit a slow exchange on the NMR frequency timescale, a fast exchange regime is observed for the other helical glutamines. This asymmetric behavior suggests that helix unwinding is initiated in the proximity of the PRR and progresses towards the N-terminus, substantiating the previously proposed protective role exerted by the PRR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P37">The synergistic combination of NMR and SAXS data has enabled the elucidation of an ensemble model of H46<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, showing that the presence of long α-helices determines the overall shape of httex1. The refined ensemble indicates that H46 is a flexible elongated particle in solution and that the overall size is correlated with the length of the poly-Q tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Importantly, our structural model is in contradiction to previously reported compact models of httex1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. In these models, compactness is driven by extensive fuzzy contacts between N17 and the poly-Q, a situation that is not compatible with our data. Despite the overall extendedness of the httex1 structure derived here, our ensemble description requires that a large fraction of the protein ensemble remains disordered. This disorder explains the fluorescence transfer efficiency observed in smFRET measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and the lack of permanent hydrogen bonds observed in NMR hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P38">The similarity of the mechanisms defining the structure of non-pathogenic and pathogenic forms of httex1 validates ‘linear lattice’ as the model accounting for the existence of the pathological threshold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. According to this model, the expansion of the poly-Q induces a systematic increase of the toxicity of httex1 and, beyond the pathological threshold, triggers cytotoxicity and neuronal aggregation. Importantly, our study provides a structural perspective for this model. Our results demonstrate that the poly-Q extension is associated with an increase in the length and stability of the coexisting helical conformations. This is relevant as our aggregation experiments unambiguously show that the α-helical content and not the homorepeat length is the key factor promoting aggregation. Although N17 has been demonstrated to be the aggregation-triggering domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, httex1 becomes aggregation-prone when N17 is structurally coupled to the poly-Q tract. This suggests that when structurally uncoupled, such as in the LKGG-H46 mutant, partially helical N17 is still able to oligomerize, but the resulting oligomers are less stable and aggregation propensity is notably reduced. Conversely, strengthening the structural coupling between both domains stabilizes the helical content of the protein and accelerates aggregation, as observed for LLLF-H46. In line with these observations, previous aggregation experiments with httex1 analogues modifying the poly-Q tract structure highlighted the relevance of the homorepeat conformational preferences in defining the aggregation propensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. In addition to modified aggregation kinetics, we have observed that mutations in the flanking regions also result in fibers with distinct morphologies, with the LKGG-H46 mutant forming shorter amyloids and exhibiting less capacity to associate to form bundles. Polymorphism in httex1 aggregates has been previously observed <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> when modifying the experimental conditions or when deleting flanking regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. This polymorphism has been associated to the contribution of N17 and the PRR to the fibril packaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Conversely, the amyloid core is consistently formed by antiparallel poly-Q stretches forming β-sheet monolayers connected through interdigitated glutamine side chains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P39">In light of our observations, we can speculate about the structural bases of the mechanisms leading to the pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). The helical propensity in the poly-Q tract may facilitate intermolecular assemblies through coiled coil (CC) interactions. Indeed, more than 60% of the described httex1 partners have, or are predicted to have, CCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. Furthermore, CC formation has also been suggested to be an important step for the oligomerization and subsequent aggregation of httex1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In the non-pathological scenario, the short length and relatively low stability of the poly-Q helical conformations precisely define the selectivity of partners recognized by httex1. Moreover, resulting httex1 oligomers exhibit reduced stability. When the number of glutamines exceeds the pathological threshold, there is a concomitant population increase of long α-helical conformations. These long poly-Q helices could still interact with their physiological partners, although most probably with different thermodynamic properties compared to the non-pathological scenario. However, they could also associate with other non-physiological partners, sequester them and perturb crucial signaling and metabolic pathways, inducing the symptoms associated to HD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In terms of the fibrillation capacity, longer helices can form more stable oligomers though CC interactions. These oligomers can eventually nucleate the formation of the amyloidogenic fibrils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup> or being the source of cytotoxicity by sequestering crucial cellular components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P40">Altogether, this study shows that the expansion of the poly-Q tract in pathogenic httex1 is associated with an increase in the length and stability of α-helical conformations, which are the main driving force for the enhanced aggregation propensity. Our results provide a high-resolution structural perspective of the pathological threshold in HD that goes beyond the length of the poly-Q tract by underlining the associated conformational preferences. The generalization of these observations to the other poly-Q related diseases remains to be unveiled. However, the possibility to explore their associated proteins at the residue level and independently of the length of the homorepeat paves the way to a detailed structural understanding of the origin of these pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Huntingtin exon1 constructs</title><p id="P41">All plasmids were prepared as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.

MSNL cantilevers have a sharp tip radius (≈ 2 nm), which is ideal for high-resolution imaging. The inverse optical lever sensitivity was calibrated with the acquisition of a force <italic>versus</italic> distance curve on the glass coverslip whereas the cantilever stiffness was calibrated using thermal method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P59">Samples for correlative AFM and TIRF were prepared on circular glass coverslips (2.5 cm, 165 μm thick, purchased from Marienfeld). Coverslips were cleaned with a 15 min cycle of sonication with ultrasounds in 1M KOH, rinsed 20 times with deionized water and finally with a second cycle of sonication in deionized water. Fibrils were then deposited on the clean glass coverslips and let dry before being immersed in D-PBS for AFM imaging.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental information</label><media xlink:href="EMS156305-supplement-Supplemental_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d83aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Gottfried Otting for providing the BL21 (DE3) Star::RF1-CBD3 strain.
