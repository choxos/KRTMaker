Many bacteria scavenge trace metals with metallophores, small molecules that chelate environmental metal ions and transport them back into the cell. Our incomplete knowledge of metallophores diversity stymies our ability to fight infectious diseases and harness beneficial microbiome interactions. The majority of known metallophores are non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs), which feature metal-chelating moieties rarely found in other classes of natural products. NRP metallophore production may be predicted by genome mining, where genomes are scanned for homologs of known biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). However, accurately detecting NRP metallophore biosynthesis currently requires expert manual inspection. Here, we introduce automated identification of NRP metallophore BGCs through a comprehensive detection algorithm, newly implemented in antiSMASH. Custom-designed profile hidden Markov models detect genes encoding the biosynthesis of most known NRP metallophore chelating moieties (2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, hydroxamates, salicylate, β-hydroxyamino acids, graminine, Dmaq, and the pyoverdine chromophore), achieving 97% precision and 78% recall against manual curation. We leveraged the algorithm, in combination with transporter gene detection, to detect NRP metallophore BGCs in 15,562 representative bacterial genomes and predict that 25% of all non-ribosomal peptide synthetases encode metallophore production. BiG-SCAPE clustering of 2,562 NRP metallophore BGCs revealed that significant diversity remains unexplored, including new combinations of chelating groups. Additionally, we find that Cyanobacteria are severely understudied and should be the focus of more metallophore isolation efforts. The inclusion of NRP metallophore detection in antiSMASH version 7 will aid non-expert researchers and facilitate large-scale investigations into metallophore biology.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Across environments, microbes compete for a scarce pool of trace metals. Many microbes scavenge metal ions with small-molecule chelators called <italic>metallophores</italic>, which diffuse through the environment and chelate metal ions with high affinity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> A microbe possessing the right membrane transporters will be able to recognize and import a metallophore–metal complex, while other strains are unable to access the chelated metal ions. Thus, the metallophore excreted by one microbe can either support or inhibit growth of a neighboring strain, driving complex community dynamics in marine, freshwater, soil, and host environments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> The most well studied metallophores are the Fe(III)-binding <italic>siderophores</italic>, which have found applications in biocontrol, bioremediation, and medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Two recent studies demonstrated that the disease suppression ability of a rhizosphere microbiome is strongly determined by whether or not the pathogen can use siderophores produced by the community; a microbiome can even encourage pathogen growth when a compatible siderophore is produced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> Compared to siderophores, other metallophore classes are relatively understudied, but they likely play equally important biological roles, as exemplified by recent reports of both commensal and pathogenic bacteria relying on zincophores to effectively colonize human hosts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup></p><p id="P3">Hundreds of unique metallophore structures have been characterized, each with specific chemical properties (ex: effective pH range, hydrophobicity, and metal selectivity) and biological effects on other microbes (based on membrane transporter compatibility). Experimentally characterizing metallophores can be time-consuming and costly, and thus researchers often use genome mining to predict metallophore production in silico.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> Taxonomy alone is not sufficient to predict what metallophores will be produced by a microbe, as production can vary significantly even within a single species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> Instead, metallophores must be predicted from each genome based on the presence of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that encode their biosynthesis. The majority of known metallophores are non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs), a broad class of natural products that also includes many antibiotics, antitumor compounds, and toxins. Specialized chelating moieties bind directly to the metal ion (in the case of siderophores, Fe<sup>3+</sup>), while other amino acids in the peptide chain give the metallophore the required flexibility for chelation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Only a handful of chelating groups have been identified to date, and nearly all NRP metallophores contain one or more of the substructures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>: 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (catechol, 2,3-DHB), hydroxamates, salicylate, β-hydroxyaspartate (β-OHAsp), β-hydroxyhistidine (β-OHHis), graminine, Dmaq (1,1-dimethyl-3-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-quinoline), and the pyoverdine chromophore. Biosynthetic pathways are known for each of the chelating groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), and the presence of a chelator pathway may be used as a marker for metallophore production.</p><p id="P4">Mining genomes for metallophore BGCs has facilitated the discovery of chemically and biologically diverse metallophore systems; however, automated detection tools are still severely lacking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> The peptidic backbones of NRP metallophores are produced by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), large multi-domain enzymes that activate and condense amino acids and other substrates in an assembly-line manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> In the past two decades, a variety of bioinformatic tools have been developed to identify NRPS BGCs in a genome. One of the most popular is the secondary metabolite prediction platform antiSMASH, which uses a library of profile hidden Markov models (pHMMs) to identify (combinations of) enzyme-coding genes that are indicative of certain classes of specialized metabolite biosynthetic pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> For example, antiSMASH identifies an NRPS BGC region by the minimum requirement of a gene containing at least one condensation and one adenylation domain. NRP metallophore BGCs are technically detected by this rule as well; however, NRPSs also produce many other families of compounds, and additional manual annotation is still required to identify NRP metallophore BGCs specifically. The current version of antiSMASH (6.2) has a “siderophore” rule; however, it only detects a single, unrelated family of enzymes, called NRPS-independent siderophore (NIS) synthetases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Thus, accurate prediction of BGCs encoding siderophores and other metallophores is currently limited to experts in natural product biosynthesis, and even experts cannot feasibly annotate hundreds or thousands of BGCs produced by high-throughput metagenomic or comparative genomic analyses. To date, no global analysis of NRP metallophores has been performed, and thus the prevalence, combinatorics, and taxonomic distribution of different chelating groups is unknown.</p><p id="P5">Here, we describe a method for the automated detection of NRP metallophore BGCs, using the presence of chelator biosynthesis genes within NRPS BGCs as key markers for predicting metallophore production. We have formalized and automated this strategy by developing a set of pHMMs and logical rules that detect biosynthetic pathways for eight different chelating groups found in NRP metallophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Against a manually curated NRPS dataset, 78% of NRP metallophore BGCs were detected with a 3% false positive rate. The new detection rules were applied to 15,562 representative bacterial genomes, allowing us to take the first census of NRP metallophore production across bacteria. At least 25% of all NRPS clusters in representative genomes code for the production of metallophores. BGC similarity networking of 2,523 metallophore BGCs via BiG-SCAPE and analysis of combinatorial patterns of chelating groups revealed that significant biosynthetic diversity remains unexplored, with hundreds of NRP metallophore gene clusters unique to single strains in our dataset. By mapping NRP metallophore BGCs to the Genome Taxonomic Database (GTDB) phylogeny, we found that biosynthetic novelty can be found across many taxa, although metallophores from Cyanobacteria deserve greater attention. NRP metallophore detection is available in antiSMASH v7.0 through the web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org">https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org</ext-link>) and standalone command line tool.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A chelator-based strategy for detection of NRP metallophore biosynthetic gene clusters</title><p id="P6">The specialized chelating moieties found in NRP metallophores are rarely found in other natural products, and thus we sought to automate metallophore BGC prediction by searching for genes encoding their biosynthesis. An extensive review of published NRP metallophore structures revealed that nearly all contain one or more of just eight chelator substructures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Protein domains responsible for their biosyntheses have been reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), and thus pHMMs could be constructed to allow detection of putative chelator biosynthesis genes. Generally, draft pHMMs were built from alignments of known and predicted NRP metallophore biosynthesis genes collected from literature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Initial bitscore cutoffs were determined by scanning MIBiG 2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> gene clusters, as well as 38 additional experimentally characterized NRP metallophore BGCs that we added to MIBiG 3.0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> Final cutoffs were determined by scanning 28,688 NRPS cluster regions from the antiSMASH database and manually inspecting hits near the initial cutoff to determine if they are likely true NRP metallophore BGCs based on the presence of genes encoding membrane transport, metal acquisition (ex: ferric reductases<sup>16–18</sup>), and multiple chelating groups. The pHMMs were iteratively refined where required by adding additional low-scoring putative true positives to the seed alignments until clear bitscore separations appeared between (putative) true and false hits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).

To date, distinguishing peptidic metallophore BGCs from other NRPS BGCs has been largely limited to manual expert analyses, leading to blind spots in our understanding of microbes and their communities. We have now automated bacterial NRP metallophore prediction by extending the secondary metabolite prediction platform antiSMASH to detect genes involved in the biosynthesis of metal chelating moieties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

Biosynthetic genes are detected with custom pHMMs and significance score cutoffs calibrated for accurate metallophore discovery, diminishing the ambiguity of interpreting gene annotations, protein families, and BLAST results. We acknowledge that human biases may have influenced which clusters were coded as putative metallophores during both algorithm development and testing; however, expert manual curation remains the most reliable method for NRP metallophore BGC detection. During testing, antiSMASH correctly identified four NRP metallophore BGCs that were initially missed by manual curation, suggesting that future algorithms, incorporating additional forms of evidence, will be able to outperform researchers. Unfortunately, 22% of manually identifiable metallophore BGCs could not be automatically distinguished from other NRPS clusters. The rules developed herein rely on the presence of one or more known chelator biosynthesis genes colocalized with the NRPS genes. In some cases, biosynthetic genes are located elsewhere in the genome, for example in a second NRP metallophore cluster. Advances in the machine-learning prediction of adenylation domain specificity should aid in identifying NRPS modules that incorporate chelating moieties. Additionally, some substructures capable of metal chelation are produced by the core NRPS/PKS machinery rather than unique accessory enzymes, including 5-alkylsalicylates and oxazolidines. The current algorithm can detect two metallophore-specific NRPS condensation domain subtypes (VibH-like and Cy_tandem), and phylogenetic analyses may reveal more metallophore-specific clades of NRPS or PKS domains.</p><p id="P26">Recently, Crits-Christoph et al. demonstrated the use of transporter families to predict that a BGC encodes siderophore (or metallophore) biosynthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> Among our test dataset, the biosynthesis-based antiSMASH rules outperformed the transporter-based approach (F1 = 0.86 <italic>versus</italic> F1 = 0.69).

Biosynthetic- and transporter-based techniques are thus complementary, and future work will incorporate transporter genes into antiSMASH metallophore prediction. We note that the reported transporter-based approach uses just three pHMMs from Pfam, while our biosynthetic detection requires many custom pHMMs. An extended set of metallophore-specific transporter pHMMs designed according to the same principles as those followed for the biosynthesis-related pHMMs could significantly improve detection by reducing false positives and capturing other families of transporters.

Chelator pathway abundance was consistent with reported NRP metallophore structural diversity: hydroxamate and catechol biosyntheses were common in representative genomes, while β-OHHis, graminine, and Dmaq were rare. Hybrid metallophore BGCs, with more than one detectable chelator biosynthesis pathway, were found to make up 20% of NRP metallophores.
