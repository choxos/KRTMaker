As the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is committed to ensuring that the publications resulting from the research it funds are publicly accessible, widely disseminated, and broadly discoverable. This commitment is epitomized by the NIH Public Access Policy, established in 2008, which requires deposit of final, peer-reviewed manuscripts reporting NIH-supported research to be made publicly available in PubMed Central (PMC), the National Library of Medicine’s (NLM) digital archive for journals and articles, no later than 12 months after journal publication. In the ensuing 14 years, 1.4 million peer-reviewed articles with NIH support have been made available to the public in PMC under this policy, and discoverable in PubMed. More broadly and consistent with its mission, NLM supports public access to research outputs to accelerate scientific discovery and advance the health of individuals and our communities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup></p><p id="P6">Since the establishment of the NIH Public Access Policy, scholarly communication has evolved as the number of journals and articles published annually has grown and new models of publishing have emerged. This growth has been accompanied by the emergence of new business models, the rise of open access publishing, increased attention to licensing terms and data sharing, and the increased use of preprints. The emergence of preprint servers and increased use of preprints in recent years has been described as “Perhaps the biggest change in scholarly infrastructure” particularly “in areas such as biology and chemistry where there had hitherto been little appetite for their take up.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Though preprint posting in the biomedical and life sciences began to increase with the launch of bioRxiv in 2013, overall publication rates remained low compared to the journal literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup></p><p id="P7">Over the last few years, NIH has explored the role of preprints, which NIH defines as “a complete and public draft of a scientific document. […] typically unreviewed manuscripts written in the style of a peer-reviewed journal article,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> in sharing results of federally funded research. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> A 2016 NIH request for information noted that “[p]reprints give their authors a fast way to disseminate their work, establish priority of their discoveries, and obtain feedback. Early-career scientists can also use preprints as evidence of independence and productivity.” Subsequently, in 2017 NIH began encouraging investigators to use preprints and other interim research products to speed the dissemination and enhance the rigor of their work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> However, preprints were considered out of scope for PMC and PubMed at the time because they were documents made public prior to peer review.</p><p id="P8">Preprints rose in prominence as a channel for rapid dissemination of biomedical research results during the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> Recognizing the benefits provided by accelerated discovery of preprints in these circumstances, on June 9, 2020, NLM launched the NIH Preprint Pilot to test the feasibility and utility of making preprints resulting from NIH-funded research available via PMC and discoverable in PubMed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> consistent with NLM strategic efforts to “stimulate new forms of scientific communication and become the library of the future” and to “anticipate developments such as preprints” in scholarly communications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup></p><p id="P9">This article describes the Pilot’s objectives, scope and approach, and summarizes findings to date.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Objectives</title><p id="P10">The NIH Preprint Pilot was undertaken to inform NLM’s understanding of the role of preprints in scholarly communication and how they may fit into NLM literature services. NLM had two primary objectives in launching Phase 1 of the NIH Preprint Pilot: <list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P11">To explore the feasibility and utility of identifying and archiving NIH-supported preprints in PMC with an associated citation in PubMed; and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P12">To support accelerated discoverability of NIH-supported research results without compromising user trust in NLM’s widely used literature services.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P13">To launch the Pilot, we established the scope, identified eligible preprint servers, and developed processes for identifying and ingesting NIH-supported preprints. We leveraged PMC infrastructure to support the full-text archiving and indexing of all openly licensed preprints that were identified as within scope and to create metadata and abstract records for those preprints that were posted under more restrictive license terms. We also modified the PMC and PubMed user interfaces to enable users to differentiate between preprints and published articles on search results and article records.</p><p id="P14">Over the two-year pilot, we collected data on retrievals of NIH-supported preprints and monitored changes in publication status of preprints. We also engaged users through focus groups and a survey to understand public perception of preprints and obtain direct feedback on their inclusion in PMC and PubMed.</p><sec id="S8"><title>Scoping</title><p id="P15">NLM scoped the Pilot to preprints resulting from research conducted or funded by NIH (i.e., “NIH-supported”). NLM considered that NIH procedures for selecting and monitoring research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> would provide an important element of trust and help ensure quality as preprints make research results public prior to peer review.</p><p id="P16">To further narrow the scope of the Pilot, NLM focused Phase 1 on preprints reporting NIH-supported research relating to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. This limited the number of preprints included in Phase 1 and targeted a research area for which there was considerable interest in accelerated access to research results by a broad range of users, including researchers, clinicians, public health officials, and the general public. Although an atypical situation given the urgency of information access about a novel disease to inform immediate action, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research presented an active testbed for the Pilot.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Selecting Preprint Servers</title><p id="P17">To identify preprint servers for inclusion in the Pilot, we applied three general criteria: <list list-type="order" id="L2"><list-item><p id="P18">Public practices largely aligned with NIH guidance on preprint server selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> and emerging community practice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> including, <list list-type="bullet" id="L3"><list-item><p id="P19">policies regarding plagiarism, competing interests, and misconduct and other hallmarks of reputable scholarly publishing are rigorous and transparent;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P20">records of changes are maintained, and users have clear ways to cite different versions; o maintaining links to the peer-reviewed journal version, if available;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P21">publicly posted screening process; and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P22">robust archiving strategy that ensures long-term preservation and access;</p></list-item></list>

</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Technical Implementation</title><p id="P25">Technical implementation of the Pilot involved leveraging the existing PMC infrastructure for the ingest and archiving of articles and developing new processes for preprint identification and conversion, in addition to modifications to the PMC and PubMed user interfaces.</p><sec id="S11"><title>Preprint Identification</title><p id="P26">To identify preprints reporting NIH-supported COVID-19 research, NLM established text mining processes to locate text strings that could be matched to NIH grants or contracts. A web interface was developed to support staff review and confirm accuracy of suggested text mining results.</p><p id="P27">To determine the relevance of research reported to COVID-19, NLM relied on the NIH Office of Portfolio Analysis iSearch COVID-19 Portfolio tool. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> NLM also used this tool to identify preprints with NIH-affiliated authors (i.e., intramural researchers and staff).</p><p id="P28">Extramural and intramural preprint identification processes were conducted weekly.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Ingest and Conversion Processes</title><p id="P29">Each week, following preprint identification, NLM staff upload a list of the permanent identifiers (largely digital object identifiers or DOIs) for those preprints identified as reporting NIH-supported COVID-19 research to a PMC tool developed for implementation of the Pilot. This triggers an initial ingest process that extracts title, author, and abstract metadata for those DOIs on the list into PMC. A PMC identifier (PMCID) is assigned at this time, and a corresponding title and abstract record is loaded to PubMed.</p><p id="P30">NLM then converts the full text of those preprints made available under a Creative Commons license to archival XML for inclusion in PMC. All full-text content in PMC is stored in the most recent American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Journal Archiving and Interchange Tag Suite (JATS) XML format, which is currently ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021 JATS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup></p><p id="P31">Those preprints identified as in scope for the Pilot but made available under other more restrictive license terms were included as metadata- and abstract-only records in PMC with links to the preprint server full text.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Preprint Record Maintenance</title><p id="P32">Indexing and archiving preprints requires active record maintenance in PMC and PubMed. Scripts developed by NLM staff are run weekly to identify and ingest new versions of preprints in bioRxiv and medRxiv. All versions of a preprint share the same PMCID. PMC displays the most recent version of the preprint available; previous versions remain accessible through the “Other versions” link in PMC.</p><p id="P33">To connect the user to the peer-reviewed journal version when available, NLM staff conduct additional automated checks across the following resources to identify peer-reviewed journal versions of preprints: bioRxiv API<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>; Crossref API<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>; Europe PMC RESTful API<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>; and PubMed Citation Matcher, an NLM-developed resource, which compares the title, author lists, and abstracts of preprints with PubMed records.</p><p id="P34">We also established processes to check weekly for withdrawn preprints and subsequently ingest the withdrawal notice. In such cases, the title of the preprint in PMC and PubMed is updated to indicate the withdrawn status. NLM staff also run daily checks for retractions of journal articles, including those that have a corresponding preprint record in PMC and PubMed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Preprint Record Display</title><p id="P35">To conform with accepted community practice regarding preprints and ensure a transparent scientific record, user interface modifications were made in PMC and PubMed to clearly identify preprint records as such, and provide links to preprint servers and, when available, associated peer-reviewed journal versions.</p><p id="P36">A prominent green information panel alerting the user that the record being viewed is a preprint was added to all preprint records in PMC and PubMed to distinguish them from journal article records. The text in this panel notes that the article has not been peer reviewed and includes a link to more information about the “NIH Preprint Pilot.” To communicate the “NIH-supported” scope of the pilot, an NIH-branded preprint banner was also added to records in PMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P37">A “Preprint” indicator was also added to the displayed citation metadata and “Cite” tool in PMC and PubMed to foster transparency as well as accurate citation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P38">Additionally, the yellow information panel in PMC that displays prior to the abstract and includes related content links was expanded to include a pointer to the preprint on the source preprint server website and a link from the preprint record to an associated peer-reviewed journal version, when available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Users may also access and view the preprint record directly from the source preprint server by clicking on the server link in this panel, the hyperlinked DOI in PMC and PubMed, or the server-branded “LinkOut” button in PubMed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P39">We added similar “Preprint” citation indicators to preprint records in the search results of PMC and PubMed. Preprints that were linked to published journal articles were labeled as “Updated” in PubMed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In PMC, a “Published in” link was added to the search results display to take the user directly to the peer-reviewed journal version, if available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P40">Finally, to enable easy identification of preprint records in PMC and PubMed in search processes, NLM created search filters. In PMC, users can apply the preprint[filter] to any search. In PubMed, users can search by publication type (preprint[pt]) or retrieve preprint records via E-utilities, using the publication type "Preprint". These search filters also allow users to exclude preprint records from search results by using the Boolean "NOT" in either database, e.g., "covid 19 NOT preprint[filter]" in PMC and "covid 19 NOT preprint[pt]" in PubMed.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Preprint Use and Practice Monitoring</title><p id="P41">We used Google Analytics and internal web logs for preprint records to monitor preprint record use and engagement consistent with NLM Web Privacy and Security Policy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> Quarterly summary reports were published on the NIH Preprint Pilot webpage under the Related Links section<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> for public view. Throughout the pilot, NLM monitored how preprint posting accelerated dissemination of and access to NIH-funded research via PMC and PubMed. NLM also monitored where NIH-supported SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 research was published as a preprint and under what license terms.</p><p id="P42">Recognizing that PMC as a full text archive and PubMed as a citation and abstract database have unique roles to play in discovery, we implemented different methods for measuring how preprints were discovered in these databases. For each database, we extracted data from October 2021, a month that generally reflects use during the academic year. For PMC we compared usage of openly licensed preprints that include full text with preprint records that were citation and abstract-only in PMC. For PubMed, we examined the frequency that preprint records were returned in search results and viewed.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>User Feedback</title><p id="P43">We also took steps to inform our understanding of the impact of the Pilot on public trust in NLM literature resources. Prior to launch, NLM established a preprint-specific email alias expressly for pilot feedback. Additionally, in Summer of 2021, after the Pilot had been taking place for just over a year, NLM conducted focus groups and administered a survey to understand user perceptions on preprints and their inclusion in PMC and PubMed.</p><p id="P44">NLM conducted four online focus groups, with 8 to 9 participants per group. Represented were key user groups of NLM literature resources (researchers, clinicians, and medical librarians) as well as healthcare journalists, a group that often acts as an intermediary between the research results that are published or made publicly available and the public. A nationwide consumer research company recruited the clinicians and the researchers. The healthcare journalists and medical librarians were recruited through the Network of the National Library of Medicine and existing NLM relationships. Participants with a mix of professional experience and familiarity with preprints were selected for each group to participate in a 2-hour discussion, conducted via Zoom (for more detail see focus group guides in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix 1</xref>).</p><p id="P45">In addition, NLM administered an online feedback survey (OMB Control No: 0925-0648) in August and September 2021, which was made available in PMC and PubMed to users who accessed preprint records in these databases. Surveying PMC and PubMed users allowed us to collect data on a broader set of user groups than those engaged in the focus groups, including students and educators, in the specific context of preprints in NLM databases. Because of the low overall numbers of preprint records in PMC and</p><p id="P46">PubMed in comparison to journal article records, to survey database users that view preprint records we set high sampling rates. A feedback prompt was made available to 30% to 40% of users that viewed a preprint record in either PMC or PubMed during the two-month period.</p><p id="P47">Only users that indicated previous knowledge or awareness of preprints were asked more detailed questions about their perspectives on preprints. The complete set of survey questions are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Appendix 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S18"><title>Discovery of NIH Research</title><p id="P48">Between June 9, 2020 and June 9, 2022, NLM made more than 3,300 preprint records discoverable in PMC and PubMed. This represents approximately 8% of all preprint records reporting on SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 research included in the NIH Office of Portfolio Analysis iSearch COVID-19 Portfolio tool during that period (iSearch does not limit its portfolio to NIH-supported preprints). Under 10% (303) of these preprint records included NIH author affiliation data in PMC and PubMed. The majority were supported by an NIH extramural award and identified through text mining processes. Over the course of the Pilot, preprints have been viewed 4 million times in PMC. Corresponding preprint records in PubMed for all preprints ingested into PMC have been viewed more than 3 million times.</p><p id="P49">NLM included the following preprint servers in the Phase 1 based on eligibility criteria: medRxiv, bioRxiv, Research Square, arXiv, ChemRxiv, and SSRN. Of the preprint records added to PMC and PubMed, the majority were posted to either medRxiv (47%) or bioRxiv (38%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p id="P50">In 2021, the NIH Office of Portfolio Analysis expanded the scope of its iSearch COVID-19 Portfolio to include preprints posted to preprints.org and Qeios. Analysis completed by NLM did not find a sufficient volume of NIH-funded preprints in either of these servers to merit setting up new curation and ingest processes to include these preprint servers in Phase 1.</p><p id="P51">The volume of preprints identified as in scope for Phase 1 varied over time, peaking at 538 preprints in the first quarter of the pilot (June 9 – September 9, 2020; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Only one preprint was withdrawn by the authors or preprint server during Phase 1. To date, no preprints included in Phase 1 have been retracted following publication in a journal.</p><p id="P52">Some preprint servers included in the Pilot (e.g., Research Square) require authors to apply a Creative Commons license. Others, such as bioRxiv and medRxiv allow authors to select from a “menu” of license options, ranging from traditional copyright restrictions to Creative Commons with attribution or CC0/public domain for US government employees.</p><p id="P53">Since June 2020, there was quarterly growth in the number of NIH-supported authors selecting some type of Creative Commons license (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). More commonly NIH-supported authors selected the more restrictive Creative Commons license options when available, limiting use to non-commercial reuse and no derivatives, or to make the work available under traditional copyright restrictions. This, in turn, limits what is archived in full text XML in PMC.</p><p id="P54">PMC usage data from October 2021 for bioRxiv preprints added to PMC in 2021 (<italic>n</italic>=482) were analyzed to inform our understanding of the role of full text availability in discoverability of preprints, as bioRxiv is one of the preprint servers that includes a mix of Creative Commons licensed preprints and preprints under traditional copyright. Therefore, the sample included a mix of openly licensed preprints with full text available and restricted licensed preprints that were available as citation and abstract records only. The boxplot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> compares the Unique User IPs that accessed preprints in this sample during October 2021 and illustrates the overall higher rates of unique user engagement in PMC with preprints made available under a Creative Commons license.</p><p id="P55">Additionally, we found that 98.4% of all available preprint records in PubMed were viewed by users and that 99.4% of available preprint records were returned in search results during October 2021, reflecting the demand for research on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. The 17 records (0.6%) that were not returned were added to the database at the end of the timeframe analyzed, which is the likely reason for their absence from search result data. Of the 2,767 preprint records available in PubMed at the end of October 2021, there were only 20 that were returned in search results that were not viewed.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Accelerated discovery</title><p id="P56">Approximately 72% of or 2,512 preprints added to PMC and PubMed through June 2022 had been linked to a peer-reviewed journal version by December 2022 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). Analysis completed a year into the pilot compared the preprint posting dates of nearly 800 preprints in the pilot at the time, to the publication date of a linked journal article found that on average 100 days elapsed between preprint posting and journal publication. The maximum time elapsed between preprint posting and publication in this sample was 365 days. Repeating this analysis on sample data from the second year of the pilot in June 2022 found an increase from an average of 100 days to 162 days from preprint posting to journal publication.</p><p id="P57">Of the journal articles linked to preprint records added to PMC during the first two years of the pilot, approximately 90% or 2,292 of those published articles were publicly accessible in PMC.

In particular, the work of the NIH Office of Portfolio Analysis proved to be key in preprint identification processes for intramural research as author affiliation metadata associated with preprints in machine-readable format was often not detailed enough to enable this type of identification otherwise.</p><p id="P103">Though several authors reached out to notify of us when in-scope preprints were missed in our identification processes, which were subsequently added to PMC and PubMed, there were no reports of preprints being inaccurately identified as NIH supported. Confirming that we were able to accurately identify those preprints within the scope of Phase 1 was a priority in implementation because we view the presence of NIH support as a key safeguard to the inclusion of papers made public prior to peer review in our databases. As noted by users, there are perceived risks regarding discoverability of the non-peer reviewed literature. The lack of controversy or validated concerns to date regarding preprints added under the Pilot demonstrate the value of keeping the scope consistent with NIH guidance and NLM collection guidelines.</p><p id="P104">Clear presentation and labeling of preprints as not peer reviewed was also prioritized in implementation. Though survey results indicate that preprint record labeling in PMC and PubMed was largely effective, there remain knowledge gaps across different user groups and some author emails indicate that more could be done to increase the clarity of the scope of the Pilot.</p><p id="P105">Since June 2020, much has been studied and written about the role of preprints in communicating COVID-19 research results. Otridge J et al. found that “the incorporation of high-quality preprints into the CDC COVID-19 Science Update improve[d] this activity’s capacity to inform meaningful public health decision-making.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> Similarly, during Phase 1, NLM found incorporating preprints within the larger corpus of curated scholarly literature made available in PMC and PubMed helped NLM contextualize the research reported in preprints, linking them to similar articles in PubMed, related data, and the larger record of citation in PMC.</p><p id="P106">Phase 1 of the NIH Preprint Pilot also supported accelerated discovery of NIH-supported research results. The analyses of PMC and PubMed usage data during Phase 1 informed our understanding of different paths users take to preprint discovery in NLM literature databases. These data also illustrated the value of indexing preprints in multiple resources that are integrated into different users’ literature search and discovery methods in different ways. As we saw, human- and machine-readable full text in PMC resulted in high rates of preprint discovery through third-party search engines. This was evidenced by higher overall preprint views in PMC than PubMed, more than two-thirds of which were from searches run outside NLM databases. Conversely, higher rates of PubMed users came to preprint records through a direct database search than those in PMC, signaling that preprints in PMC and PubMed may reach different users, depending on a user’s preferred search platform.</p><p id="P107">Additional data on PubMed user behavior showed that PubMed users were most likely to navigate from PubMed to the preprint server directly either via the DOI link or the LinkOut button to view the full text of a preprint, rather than to PMC. This again demonstrates that users may discover and engage with PMC and PubMed in different ways, with each playing a role in the wider information landscape.</p><p id="P108">Phase 1 results also highlight how even during a period of accelerated peer review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and immediate open sharing of COVID-19 related literature, the indexing and archiving of preprints can speed the dissemination and discovery of NIH-supported research in PMC and PubMed. Specifically, we found that inclusion of preprints in PMC accelerated access to NIH research results in NLM literature databases by more than 100 days on average, a notable period of time during a public health emergency. In addition, their inclusion broadened access to NIH research, supporting discovery of NIH research results in our databases to nearly 1,000 articles that had not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal or may not have been intended for formal journal publication.</p><p id="P109">A richer understanding of the characteristics of preprints in this latter “unpublished” subset, particularly a year or more after posting, and author motivations in preprint posting could contribute to a more complete picture of the role of preprints in offsetting publication bias and in communicating the results of federally funded research.</p><p id="P110">Phase 1 has further informed our understanding of NIH researcher preprint practices in the context of broader scholarly communication activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 13,000 journal article records with NIH support reporting COVID-19-related research were added to PubMed during this period<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">1</xref></sup>; approximately 10% of which were linked to a preprint record. A recent report found that “Despite the commitment made to post COVID-19 research on a preprint server before it appears in a journal, or in some other peer-reviewed outlet, a corresponding preprint can be found for only 5% of all peer-reviewed COVID-19 outputs.” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> To what degree the Pilot may have impacted rates of preprint posting among NIH investigators is unknown. Further, though there have been steady increases in the number of openly licensed preprints added to PMC each quarter, we are unable to identify the impact the Pilot may have played in raising awareness of NIH recommendations on licensing nor the impact that culture of openness around COVID-19 research may have impacted author decisions around what license to choose when presented with options.</p><p id="P111">Our efforts to enable accelerated discovery of SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 research in PMC and PubMed, both as preprints and published articles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> have increased our awareness of the challenges that come with archiving and presenting an archival scientific record that may include multiple versions of a paper and the importance of transparency as to the status and source of all records in our databases. As a first step, we developed and released the NIH Preprint Pilot Toolkit,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> an online resource for librarians to learn about the Pilot and preprints, as well as Preprints: Accelerating Research,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> an on-demand training, though more direct materials available directly from preprint records in PMC and PubMed may prove to be beneficial to certain user groups. With this in mind, we continue to review the presentation of preprints in PMC and PubMed to identify new strategies for communicating the status of preprints, facilitate connections between them and journal articles, and clearly convey the NIH-funded scope of our collection efforts.</p><p id="P112">Finally, while the focus groups and survey played a key role in identifying in knowledge gaps around preprints as well as informing NLM’s understanding of user perceptions on accelerated discoverability of</p><p id="P113">NIH research result in PMC and PubMed, there are limitations on those findings. Focus groups only included a limited number of participants by audience of interest. Survey respondents were interacting with a preprint record when the survey triggered, which may suggest either a willingness to engage with preprints, generally, as well as a likely interest in SARS-CoV-2 virus or COVID-19 research, or perhaps a lack of awareness of preprint status. As such, focus group and survey findings may not be an accurate representation of audience or user perspectives across research disciplines and specialties and thus may not be generalizable to all users or audiences, nor to all NIH-supported preprints.</p></sec><sec id="S25" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P114">The NIH Preprint Pilot has confirmed the technical feasibility of including preprints in PMC and PubMed. Further, NLM has found that preprint records in PMC and PubMed provide an additional avenue for accelerated discovery of NIH-supported research during the ongoing public health emergency prior to journal publication. In addition, the pilot did not have strong impact on customers’ trust of NLM and its literature services. In cases where users did report it having an impact, they indicated it was more likely to increase their trust due to the greater transparency.</p><p id="P115">Through the Pilot, NLM has accelerated and expanded broad discovery of publicly funded research results, helped maximized the impact of NIH funding, accelerated the point at which this research would otherwise be discoverable and publicly accessible in PMC and PubMed, and supported the NIH response to the ongoing public health emergency.</p><p id="P116">Though peer review remains integral to scholarly communication, preprints are positioned to play an expanding role, notably in the distribution and discoverability of research, as awareness of preprints continues to grow, new publishing models incorporate preprints, and the potential of preprints to facilitate greater sharing of research results faster is realized. Clear guidance accompanied by active engagement with investigators could help build on lessons that have been learned during the NIH Preprint Pilot and throughout the public health emergency about accelerated open access to research results.</p><p id="P117">As the world’s largest biomedical library, NLM is uniquely positioned to provide discovery tools and to engage with the wider medical and public library communities to raise awareness of preprints, encourage education and training, and continually improve the presentation and integration of preprints into the wider scholarly record. With such efforts, NLM aims to enable transparency and rebuild public trust in science.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Appendix 1: Focus Groups</label><media xlink:href="EMS158515-supplement-Appendix_1__Focus_Groups.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAdNbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Appendix 2: Survey Questions</label><media xlink:href="EMS158515-supplement-Appendix_2__Survey_Questions.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAdNcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Katherine Majewski for her invaluable expertise and support in coordinating the focus groups and survey, in addition to the creation of the NIH Preprint Pilot Toolkit and tutorial, Christopher Belter (on detail with the NLM Office of Strategic Initiatives in 2020) for his help with evaluation planning, and Jerry Sheehan for his feedback on this paper.
