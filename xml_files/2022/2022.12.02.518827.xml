Most research in this area has focused on the molecular regulation of reproductive castes in obligately social taxa with complex social systems, while relatively few studies have addressed the molecular basis of caste in species in which the division of reproductive labour is more plastic. As a result, it is not clear whether, and to what extent, the mechanisms of caste in species with reproductive plasticity are the same as those that exist at the highest levels of social complexity. To address this knowledge gap, we analyse brain transcriptomic data for non-reproductives and reproductives of the facultatively social hover wasp Liostenogaster flavolineata, a representative of one of the simplest forms of social living. By experimentally manipulating the reproductive ‘queues’ exhibited by social groups of this species, we show that reproductive division of labour in this species is associated with surprisingly distinct transcriptomic signatures, similar to those observed in more complex social taxa; that variation in gene expression among non-reproductives reflects their investment into foraging effort more than their social rank; and that distinct co-expressed gene sets are associated with differential investment into alternative reproductive strategies. These results elucidate robust transcriptomic signals that represent the proximate basis of division of labour at the simplest level of insect sociality, and show these signals to be remarkably similar to those in more derived species.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Selection favours those organisms that are able to maximise the transmission of their genes to the next generation, but optimal strategies to achieve this transmission may vary considerably between ecological and social contexts, resulting in a range of alternative fitness strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Hazel et al. 2004</xref>). In many social species, for example, some individuals forego their own reproduction in favour of helping relatives. Such species are ideal models with which to determine the mechanisms that underlie alternative fitness strategies, since they exhibit a clear delineation between individuals that invest in either direct or indirect (‘altruistic’) fitness strategies. Understanding how and why indirect fitness strategies have evolved and are regulated has long been a major question in evolutionary biology.</p><p id="P3">In most social taxa, the evolution of indirect modes of reproduction can ultimately be explained in terms of inclusive fitness theory: altruistic behaviour evolves because altruists increase the fitness of individuals to whom they are related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Hamilton 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Foster et al. 2006</xref>). The question of how non-reproductive and reproductive phenotypes can arise from a shared genome at a proximate level is, however, less well-resolved. Research over the last two decades has begun to reveal how alternative reproductive strategies are produced through differential expression of shared molecular machinery (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Colgan et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Standage et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Morandin et al. 2019</xref>), but most research in this area has focused on ‘obligately’ social insects that live in complex societies comprised of mutually dependent individuals, each of whom are committed to a specific role in the group (queen and worker ‘castes’). The molecular basis of the differentiation between castes in such obligately social species has been the focus of numerous studies, which have revealed that queens and workers exhibit strongly and consistently divergent patterns of gene expression (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Morandin et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">He et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Warner et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Despite the ecological importance of obligately social insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Wilson 1990</xref>), these species are relatively taxonomically limited. In insects, for example, such societies are found only in the ants, honey bees, stingless bees, bumble bees, vespine wasps and higher termites (Boomsma &amp; Gawne 2017). Simpler forms of social organization, in which individuals retain the ability to switch between reproductive and non-reproductive roles within their lifetime, are much more common in both insects (e.g. polistine and stenograstrine wasps; halictid, xylocopid bees) and cooperatively breeding vertebrates (e.g. meerkats and long-tailed tits). Importantly, non-reproductive individuals in facultatively social species retain the ability to mate and to develop their reproductive physiology, and are potential successors to the dominant reproductive if she dies or if an alternative nesting opportunity arises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Field et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Smith et al. 2009</xref>). Such individuals can be described as ‘hopeful reproductives’ that invest in altruistic behaviour whilst waiting for opportunities to reproduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">West-Eberhard 1975</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The flexible and reversible nature of their reproductive strategies makes facultatively social insects ideal models for understanding the emergence of the simplest forms of reproductive caste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Kronauer &amp; Libbrecht 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Shell &amp; Rehan 2018</xref>). For example, facultatively social bee taxa have been used to provide evidence for ‘molecular ground plan’ hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kapheim et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">2020</xref>), and to test the long-standing sociogenomic prediction that queen-biased genes should be relatively ancient and conserved compared to worker-biased genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Jones et al. 2017</xref>). Genomic studies using facultatively social insects outside of the Anthophila (bees) are lacking, however. Accordingly, we have a limited and biased understanding of the proximate nature of alternative reproductive strategies in facultatively social insects, i.e. how the highly flexible alternative fitness strategies in these species are produced from a shared genome and how such plasticity is regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Simola et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Libbrecht et al 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Taylor et al. 2021</xref>). Specifically, we would like to know whether the degree of molecular differentiation present among the uncommitted, transient castes of facultatively social species is similar to that which exists in obligately social species. Data regarding this question are largely absent outside of the Anthophila. In addition, few if any studies have addressed the question of the degree to which variation in individual-level investment in non-reproductive ‘worker’ activities is reflected at the molecular level. Species with reproductive ‘queues’ that predict investment into altruistic behaviours should be particularly suitable for the study of this topic.</p><p id="P6">Here we address these questions by conducting the first transcriptomic analyses for a facultatively social wasp, <italic>Liostenogaster flavolineata</italic>. This species represents the best-studied member of the stenogastrine hover wasps, a group which represents an independent evolutionary origin of facultative sociality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Bank et al. 2017</xref>), separate from all other social wasps. As in other facultatively social species, many <italic>L. flavolineata</italic> individuals spend part of their lives as non-reproductive ‘workers’, but such individuals may transition at some point to a reproductive ‘queen’ role, shifting between indirect and direct fitness strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Field et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Bridge &amp; Field 2007</xref>). <italic>L. flavolineata</italic> groups are small (2–10 individuals; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Bridge &amp; Field 2007</xref>) and consist of strictly age-determined dominance hierarchies, with the oldest non-reproductive individual in a group being first in line to replace the reproductive if she dies. Because they are more likely to attain a reproductive role in the near future, older (higher ranked) individuals exhibit a reduced foraging effort relative to younger (lower ranked) individuals, indicating a shift away from investment into risky behaviours as the chances of future reproductive opportunities improve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Field et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Bridge &amp; Field 2007</xref>). At any given time, however, only a single individual within a group acts as egg-layer, so <italic>L. flavolineata</italic> also exhibits the strong reproductive skew that is the defining characteristic of insect sociality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Sumner et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Based on these biological features, <italic>L. flavolineata</italic> represents an ideal model with which to address the outstanding questions outlined above and to shed light on the complex molecular origins of plastic social phenotypes. By sequencing the genome of this species, the first for any member of the Stenogastrinae, conducting controlled experiments to manipulate social hierarchy and caste behaviour, and examining in detail the influence of social rank and altruistic activity upon brain transcription, we generate novel insights into the molecular origins of plastic social phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>L. flavolineata genome assembly</title><p id="P8">Illumina sequencing generated 163 million pairs of genomic PE reads and 102 million pairs of MP reads. The GC content distribution had a single peak both in the PE sequencing data that were used as input for the assembly and in the assembly itself, which contrasts with the bimodal or trimodal GC content distributions observed in other social hymenopterans (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Kent et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Harrop et al. 2020</xref>). The size of the genome estimated based on 17-mers was 373 Mbp. The assembled genome sequence obtained with SOAPdenovo was 291 Mbp, counting only contigs larger than 500bp. The longest scaffold in the assembly had a length of 5.23 Mbp, and the N50 scaffold length was 1.5 Mbp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Of 4,415 BUSCO groups searched, 97.9% were found in the assembly (96.9% complete). We therefore conclude that this assembly is a comprehensive representation of the <italic>L. flavolineata</italic> genome in terms of regions encoding gene sequences.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>Phenotypic correlates of rank in</italic> L. flavolineata</title><p id="P9">We first verified variation in caste-related phenotypes along the reproductive hierarchy by measuring ovarian development and time spent off-nest of individual wasps with different reproductive ranks. In unmanipulated colonies, there was a strongly significant negative relationship between within-group age rank and the amount of time individuals from unmanipulated groups spent off the nest (linear regression of time off-nest on rank: slope ± SE = -27.37 ± 1.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, t<sub>df</sub> = 78; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We also observed the expected changes in foraging efforts in response to manipulation of rank. Individuals that were promoted in rank by removing a higher-ranked individual reduced their time off the nest (and therefore putatively the time spent foraging) following manipulation (<italic>n</italic> = 35; two-sided Wilcoxon test W = 137, <italic>p</italic> = 0.017), although the dispersion of this change was high (mean ± SD = -10.16 ± 20.25; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). By contrast, individuals whose rank was not manipulated showed no significant shift in their time spent off the nest (<italic>n</italic> = 26; mean ± SD = 0.35 ± 12.68; two-sided Wilcoxon W = 90, <italic>p</italic> = 0.2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), despite the fact that group size was decreased for these individuals following manipulation. This indicates that the removal of brood during manipulation was successful in maintaining a constant per-capita foraging requirement and supports the interpretation that behavioural changes in individuals with manipulated ranks were indeed due to their shift in the reproductive hierarchy.</p><p id="P11">Ovarian development was strongly dependent on rank at time of removal. The most dominant individual (Rank 1) within a nest was always inseminated and possessed several mature eggs in her ovarioles (<italic>n</italic> = 19; mean ± SD = 12.63 ± 2.29 eggs). By contrast, individuals of Rank 2 and below (<italic>n</italic> = 64) almost never possessed developed eggs at time of removal and were never found to be inseminated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Overall, these results are in line with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Field et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Shreeves &amp; Field 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Sumner et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Bridge &amp; Field 2007</xref>), showing that <italic>L. flavolineata</italic> groups are defined by a binary reproductive division of labour between individuals of Rank 1 (who are the sole egg-layers) and Rank 2 and beyond (non-reproductives). An age-based hierarchy exists among the non-reproductives, with reduced investment in foraging effort for higher-ranked individuals in the queue. We therefore posit that time spent off the nest can be taken as a proxy for time spent foraging and hereafter refer to the proportion of time spent off the nest by each individual as that individual’s ‘foraging effort’.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Reproductive division of labour predicts gene expression variation</title><p id="P13">We next sequenced RNA from a number of focal individuals to identify patterns of gene expression associated with within-group rank. RNA was successfully sequenced from brain tissue taken from 83 individuals from 28 different nests, with an average of 14.4M successfully mapped reads per sample. Comparing all reproductives (Rank 1; <italic>n</italic> = 19) against all non-reproductives (Ranks 2–5; <italic>n</italic> = 64) with DESeq2, we identified 1117 differentially-expressed genes (DEGs). The 483 genes that were upregulated in reproductives (Rank 1) were associated with 19 significantly enriched GO terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Tables S3-4</xref>), including several terms related to DNA replication and histone binding. The 664 genes that were upregulated in non-reproductives (Ranks 2–5) were associated with 79 significantly enriched GO terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Tables S5-6</xref>), most of which related to respiration and metabolism.</p><p id="P14">We found strong signals of differential expression between Rank 1 individuals and individuals of each of the other ranks, with &gt; 300 DEGs in each comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This result held whether grouping individuals by their rank prior to manipulation or by their rank following manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that manipulation did not seriously disrupt the reproductive division of labour within groups. The strongest differentiation in each case was between reproductive Rank 1 and Rank 3 individuals rather than the more worker-like Ranks 4 and 5. This is surprising, given that Rank 3 individuals exhibit intermediate foraging efforts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), but may be at least partially explained by the larger sample sizes for Rank 3 (pre-manipulation <italic>n</italic> = 21; post-manipulation <italic>n</italic> = 15) than Ranks 4 (pre-manipulation <italic>n</italic> = 15; post-manipulation <italic>n</italic> = 6) and 5 (pre-manipulation only; <italic>n</italic> = 6).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Effects of social hierarchy on brain transcription</title><sec id="S7"><title>Absolute foraging effort explains molecular differentiation among non-reproductives better than rank</title><p id="P15">We next focused on patterns of gene expression associated with the phenotypic variation observed within nests’ hierarchies. Over 1000 genes were identified as being differentially expressed with foraging effort and/or with rank, regardless of whether the rank considered was that identified before or after manipulation (<bold>Table 2</bold>). However, much of this differential expression was driven by reproductive individuals, which exhibit the highest rank and lowest foraging rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Excluding these individuals from the analysis and thereby focusing exclusively on non-reproductives, the number of DEGs identified with rank and/or foraging effort was 1–3 orders of magnitude lower (<bold>Table 2</bold>).</p><p id="P16">Analysis of these non-reproductive individuals (<italic>n</italic> = 64 wasps) revealed that foraging effort explains differences in gene expression more strongly than rank: 256 genes were correlated with foraging effort but only 45 genes with rank (<bold>Table 2</bold>). Furthermore, no genes were found to be differentially expressed with the residuals of rank on foraging effort, while 18 genes were differentially expressed with the residuals of foraging effort on rank, which suggests that it is foraging rate <italic>per se</italic> rather than rank that best predicts individual gene expression profiles. Surprisingly, there was no detectable effect of age itself on gene expression among non-reproductive individuals (<bold>Table 2</bold>), despite a substantial age range of 20 days between the oldest and youngest individuals in this analysis. Subsequent analyses therefore focused on the molecular signatures of foraging effort among non-reproductive individuals.</p><p id="P17">We next explored the functions of the genes (<italic>n</italic> = 256) that were putatively associated with foraging. Among non-reproductives, 173 genes were upregulated with respect to foraging rate. These were associated with 61 significantly enriched GO terms, many of which related to developmental and metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Tables S7-8</xref>). The 83 genes that were downregulated with respect to foraging rate were associated with 14 GO terms, including several terms related to metabolism or visual perception (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Tables S9-10</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Individuals that were promoted in rank after experimental removal of a higher-ranked wasp responded by modulating their foraging effort to match their new rank, and this change appears to have been matched at the level of gene expression. Individuals that were promoted from Rank 3 to Rank 2 exhibited a significant degree of gene expression differentiation when compared against Rank 3 individuals that had not changed their rank: 218 genes separated these two groups, and this set of DEGs overlapped significantly with those identified as being differentially expressed with foraging rate among non-reproductives (two-sided hypergeometric test <italic>p</italic> = 0.016; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table S11</xref>). Meanwhile, individuals that were promoted to Rank 2 showed little differentiation from Rank 2 individuals that had not changed their rank (10 DEGs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table S12</xref>). These results suggest that the shifts in investment in individual-level foraging effort that accompany a change in rank are also reflected at the level of the brain transcriptome, with individuals adopting a transcriptional profile that is closer to their new rank than to the rank that they possessed prior to promotion.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Distinct suites of co-expressed genes are associated with foraging effort</title><p id="P19">Across the brain transcriptomes of all non-reproductive individuals (<italic>n</italic> = 64), we identified 20 distinct co-regulated gene modules ranging in size from 32 to 1831 genes.

Genes that were more strongly correlated with foraging rate, whether positively or negatively, were also more strongly correlated with the eigengene of Module 12 (i.e. they had higher ‘module membership’), suggesting a meaningful relationship between the expression of this module and individuals’ foraging effort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, genes that were part of this module overlapped significantly both with genes that were found to be negatively correlated with respect to foraging rate when using DESeq2 (two-sided hypergeometric test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and also with genes that were reproductive-biased (i.e. those that were upregulated in reproductives versus non-reproductives; two-sided hypergeometric test <italic>p</italic> = 0.016). However, we did not find this same pattern of overlap at the level of putative gene function. The 83 genes contained within Module 12 were enriched for 17 GO terms, several of them associated with visual processing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Tables S13-14</xref>), but these terms did not overlap significantly with those that were reproductive-biased (two-sided hypergeometric test <italic>p</italic> = 1), nor with those that were negatively correlated with foraging rate (two-sided hypergeometric test <italic>p</italic> = 0.116).</p><p id="P21">A second, larger module (Module 16; <italic>n</italic> = 606 genes) exhibited a strongly positive association with foraging rate (<italic>r</italic> = 0.4, <italic>p</italic> = 0.022).

Until recently, however, their potential to shed light on the mechanisms associated with such strategies has not been fully exploited, as most studies have concentrated on caste differences in obligately social species. Here, we have addressed this knowledge gap by examining the brain gene expression profiles associated with social organization in reproductively skewed groups of the facultatively social hover wasp <italic>L. flavolineata</italic>.</p><p id="P23">Caste differences in obligately social insect species are stable and associated with strong signatures of molecular differentiation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Morandin et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">He et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Warner et al. 2019</xref>).

However, this finding is in agreement with a number of studies that have indicated a strong relationship between ovarian activation and brain gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Amdam et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Wang et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">2010</xref>), and reinforces the notion that ovarian activation is the defining characteristic of division of labour in social insects.</p><p id="P24">Focusing on transcriptomic differences among non-reproductives, we identified approximately 250 genes whose expression varied in line with foraging rate—a substantial number, though significantly smaller than that associated with caste differences. A plausible null hypothesis is that this expression variation simply reflects phenotypic variation among individuals; for example, differential expression with foraging rate might stem from the energetic demands of spending more time in flight. However, we believe that three factors speak against this null hypothesis and in favour of the alternative hypothesis that gene expression variation among non-reproductives reflects variation in investment into alternative fitness strategies.</p><p id="P25">First, if within-group gene expression differences primarily reflect differences in e.g. energetic expenditure, then we should have observed greater differences between Rank 2 individuals and Rank 4/Rank 5 individuals than between Rank 2 individuals and Rank 1 reproductives, who are more similar in foraging effort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), yet this was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Second, individuals that were promoted from Rank 3 to Rank 2 shifted gene expression to match their new rank, which strongly suggests that gene expression variation is not primarily structured by independent factors such as age. Third, the majority of the GO terms that were enriched among foraging-biased genes (both positively and negatively) related to relatively basal metabolic and developmental processes, a pattern similar to that observed in caste-biased GO terms in both <italic>L. flavolineata</italic> and the paper wasp <italic>Polistes dominula</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Standage et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Taylor et al. 2021</xref>). This seems to belie the possibility that these genes were solely associated with such specific behaviours as e.g. flying and foraging. In fact, GO terms for visual processing were enriched among those genes that were negatively associated with foraging rate, a surprising result given that foragers presumably rely on visual signals to locate prey. Although we acknowledge that GO annotations are frequently patchy and incomplete, overall these factors support the hypothesis that gene expression variation among <italic>L. flavolineata</italic> non-reproductives genuinely represents variation in individuals’ potential fitness (i.e. their likelihood of achieving a reproductive position in the near future), over and above simply reflecting differences in age or energy expenditure.</p><p id="P26">Although we hypothesise that it is prospective reproductive opportunities rather than energetic expenditure alone that explains the variation in gene expression observed among non-reproductives, we identified a larger number of genes differentially expressed with foraging rate than with rank. Moreover, the set of rank-biased genes was almost entirely subsumed by the set of foraging-biased genes. This may indicate that rank is in fact a relatively crude indicator of individual-level variation in proximity to the reproductive role. Within-rank variation in the foraging rate of Rank 2 and Rank 3 individuals was very high relative to that of e.g. Rank 1 individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), which suggests that factors other than rank influence individuals’ foraging effort. Nest size is known to be one such factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Shreeves &amp; Field 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Cant &amp; English 2006</xref>), but others might include the age, health and fecundity of the incumbent reproductive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Kokko &amp; Johnstone 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Bridge &amp; Field 2007</xref>). If individuals modulate their foraging rate based on the likelihood of future inheritance of the reproductive position, and that likelihood is affected by e.g. the projected mortality of the current reproductive, then observed foraging rate might actually be a stronger proxy of individual-level alternative fitness strategies than rank itself.</p><p id="P27">Facultatively social insects are important models with which to investigate the earliest stages of insect social evolution, in which individuals can switch opportunistically between direct and indirect fitness strategies. Social groups in the facultatively social hover wasp <italic>L. flavolineata</italic> are characterised by linear hierarchies, and an individual’s position in the resulting ‘queue’ dictates her investment into altruistic foraging behaviour, a system that lends itself well to studies of the molecular correlates of alternative fitness strategies. In this study, we have shown that gene expression in <italic>L. flavolineata</italic> colonies is structured by both actualised and potential direct fitness, that individuals are able to facultatively shift their gene expression profiles to match changes in direct fitness prospects, and that distinct co-expression modules are associated with alternative fitness strategies. These results represent the first in-depth study of the molecular basis of social behaviour in a vespid species outside of the Polistinae, the only such analysis for a facultatively social wasp, and the first genome sequence for a Stenogastrine wasp, representing an independent evolutionary lineage of insect sociality. These resources and the insights provided by our analyses open fruitful lines for future research into the maintenance and evolution of sociality, and reveal robustly co-expressed signals of transcriptomic differentiation that appear to track differential investment into reproductive versus non-reproductive behavioural strategies.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Field monitoring and behavioural experiments</title><sec id="S12"><title>Experimental set-up</title><p id="P28">Fieldwork was undertaken in Fraser’s Hill, Malaysia between January and April 2017. <italic>L. flavolineata</italic> nests from aggregations situated in under-road culverts were selected for study on the basis of the presence of multiple pupal caps and observation of active egg-laying. Over 2 days, all individuals on each nest were given a unique combination of coloured paint marks to facilitate subsequent individual-level identification. Confirmation that all wasps had been successfully marked was achieved by censuses of group members at night, when all individuals are present on the nest. Brood were mapped in each nest to confirm the presence of an egg-layer, and to identify pupae which would shortly hatch. Reproductives were identified by observation of egg-laying or through censuses to determine foraging effort: reproductives rarely leave the nest in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Field &amp; Foster 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Cant &amp; Field 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Shreeves &amp; Field 2002</xref>). Nests were monitored every day to measure foraging effort and identify newly emerging wasps. Newly emerged group members were identified by the co-appearance of an unmarked wasp and a hatched pupal cell. Once identified, newly emerged individuals were left on the nest for 3 days before marking, to avoid interfering with their nest orientation flights.</p><p id="P29">Focal nests (<italic>n</italic> = 28) consisting of 3–5 wasps of known age and rank were generated by removing unmarked wasps and/or wasps of unknown age; such group sizes are typical of natural nests in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Field et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Shreeves &amp; Field 2002</xref>). To achieve this, nests were censused daily until 2–4 new individuals had emerged. These newly emerged individuals, together with the nest’s reproductive (Rank 1), were used as the focal individuals for the rest of the study. To generate nests of comparable group sizes and with non-reproductives of known ages, all other wasps were removed at dawn on the day following the emergence of the requisite number of focal wasps. For 10 days following this manipulation, nests were censused every ∼30 minutes during peak foraging hours (07:00–11:00) to quantify time spent off the nest for each individual. Time spent off the nest is thought to be a reliable proxy for foraging effort in <italic>L. flavolineata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Field &amp; Cronin 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Bridge &amp; Field 2007</xref>): older individuals are more likely to inherit the position of egg layer and are therefore expected to invest less in risky foraging behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Field &amp; Cronin 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Bridge &amp; Field 2007</xref>). From this initial manipulation until the end of the experiment, additional wasps that emerged from the nest were removed to ensure that colony sizes remained constant. Thus, at the end of the 10-day period, the rank and average time spent off-nest were known for each individual from 28 focal nests consisting of a single reproductive (exact age unknown but &gt;2 months old) and 2–4 non-reproductives of known ages (within-rank age range ≈ 5 days). These preliminary manipulations allowed us to generate a starting population of nests for which factors such as age, group size, brood number and foraging effort were quantified and standardised for use in our experiment and analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Experiments and sampling</title><p id="P30">Using an experimental design based on that employed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Field et al. (2006)</xref>, we performed manipulations in which the second-ranked (Rank 2) or third-ranked (Rank 3) individual from each nest was removed in order to promote lower-ranked wasps to a higher rank within the group hierarchy. To promote non-reproductive wasps on each nest either from Rank 3 to Rank 2 or from Rank 4 to Rank 3, at dawn on day 11, a single focal wasp was removed from each of the 28 nests and placed directly into RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The removed individual was always of either Rank 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 15; age mean ± SD = 30.3 ± 3.1 days) or Rank 3 (<italic>n</italic> = 7; age mean ± SD = 25.3 ± 1.4 days). To ensure that the ratio of helpers to brood remained constant despite the loss of a helper, brood were also removed from the nests at this time. Brood was divided into three categories: eggs, small/medium larvae and large larvae. A proportion, R/N (where R is the number of adults removed and N is the original number of wasps), of each category was removed using fine tweezers. Pupae, which do not require feeding, were not removed. Nests were given 48 hours to settle, after which censuses were performed daily for 5 days using the same methodology as previously. At the end of the 5-day censusing period, all wasps were removed from the nest before dawn: individuals’ heads were placed directly into RNAlater for gene expression analysis, and their bodies into 95% EtOH for dissection. The ages of non-reproductives of the same final rank collected at this stage that were subsequently sequenced were approximately age-matched across nests (age mean ± SD: Rank 2 = 33.3 ± 4.3 days; Rank 3 = 27.0 ± 1.6 days; Rank 4 = 22.8 ± 1.5 days). The ovarioles of each individual were dissected and the number of developed eggs counted. The mating status of each individual was assessed by examining the spermatheca for the presence of sperm.</p><p id="P31">This design allowed us to compare gene expression between reproductives (Rank 1) and non-reproductives (Ranks 2–5). The design also enabled us to assess the extent to which variation in gene expression varied among non-reproductives of different ranks (Ranks 2–5) and, therefore, with investment into risky foraging behaviour. If rank and/or foraging effort are reflected at the level of brain transcription, then we expected that fine-scale molecular differentiation among non-reproductive ranks (i.e. Ranks 2–5) might be as profound as that between reproductive castes (i.e. Rank 1 versus Ranks 2–5). Finally, our chosen experimental design allowed us to compare the brain gene expression patterns of individuals that had been promoted in rank to those which had not undergone promotion. We predicted that individuals that had been promoted from Rank 3 to Rank 2 would exhibit a concomitant shift in rank- and foraging-related gene expression: if this were the case, then individuals promoted from Rank 3 to Rank 2 should more closely match the expression patterns of unmanipulated Rank 2 individuals than of unmanipulated Rank 3 individuals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Genomic and transcriptomic analyses</title><sec id="S15"><title>Genome sequencing and assembly</title><p id="P32">Complete methods and results for the assembly are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Document S1</xref>.
