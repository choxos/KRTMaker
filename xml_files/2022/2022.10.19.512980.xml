However, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has shown that blocking viral transmission is an important attribute of efficient vaccines. Here, we investigated if recombinant influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) vaccines delivered at a mucosal site could protect from onward transmission of influenza B viruses in the guinea pig model. We tested four different scenarios in which sequential transmission was investigated in chains of four guinea pigs. The variables tested included a low and a high viral inoculum (10<sup>4</sup> vs 10<sup>5</sup> plaque forming units) in the initial donor guinea pig and variation of exposure/cohousing time (1 day vs 6 days). In three out of four scenarios – low inoculum-long exposure, low inoculum-short exposure and high inoculum-short exposure – transmission chains were efficiently blocked. Based on this data we believe an intranasal recombinant NA vaccine could be used to efficiently curtail influenza virus spread in the human population during influenza epidemics.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Importance</title><p id="P2">Vaccines that can slow respiratory virus transmission in the population are urgently needed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus.

Similar to injected SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, influenza virus vaccines – even if well-matched – often allow onward transmission of virus in vaccinated populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). The intramuscular administration of current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as well as inactivated influenza virus vaccines contributes to this problem since this route of administration does not lead to robust mucosal antibody titers which could block infection or limit transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Influenza virus vaccines typically induce an immune response focused on the viral hemagglutinin (HA), the receptor binding protein of influenza viruses which binds to terminal sialic acid on N-linked glycans on host cells. Immunity to HA can neutralize virus efficiently and block infection. However, the location of the vaccine-induced antibodies in combination with the constant changes of the HA through antigenic drift often lead to suboptimal immunity after vaccination. Besides HA, influenza viruses express a second surface glycoprotein, the neuraminidase (NA), which is a receptor destroying enzyme that cleaves terminal sialic acids from N-linked glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). This activity is important for migration of incoming virus through mucosal fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Mucosal fluids have high concentrations of glycosylated natural defense proteins, which can act as a virus trap to prevent the release of newly formed viral particles from infected cells. The presence of NA enzymatic activity releases cell surface bound virus and counters virus aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P5">While both HA and NA proteins undergo antigenic drift, their drift is usually discordant and NA potentially evolves more slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). This, combined with its important function in the viral life cycle, makes it an attractive vaccine target. We and others have shown that vaccination with recombinant, stabilized NA protein can induce protective immunity in different animal models, especially when the antigen is given mucosally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Of note, this protection is typically against morbidity and mortality, and while viral replication in animal models is reduced, NA-based immunity is often infection permissive. Here, we use the well established guinea pig influenza virus transmission model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) to determine if vaccination with recombinant influenza B virus neuraminidase can break viral transmission chains and which factors may influence efficiency of transmission in the background of mucosal NA immunity.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S4"><title>Viruses and cells</title><p id="P6">Sf9 cells (CRL-1711, ATCC) for baculovirus rescue were grown in <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> medium-formulation Hink insect cell medium (TNM-FH, Gemini Bioproducts) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma) and penicillin (100 U/ml)-streptomycin (100 μg/ml) solution (Gibco).

They should protect the vaccinated individual from disease and they should protect others – including immunocompromised or naïve individuals – from onward transmission. While the second purpose was well recognized in the vaccinology and public health community, it has become part of public discourse during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Several licensed vaccines fulfill both purposes. However, especially for respiratory viruses, blocking transmission through vaccination is often challenging as demonstrated with SARS-CoV-2 but also influenza virus. Part of the problem is that many vaccines are administered intramuscularly which makes them very inefficient in inducing mucosal immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). However, mucosal immune responses can block infection completely (sterilizing immunity) depending on the vaccine target, and they can blunt transmission by reducing titers and/or potentially by producing pathogen that is already coated in antibody when it leaves the upper respiratory tract and therefore perhaps reduce the infectiousness of an infected subject.</p><p id="P21">In the past we have shown that intranasal vaccination of guinea pigs, which are an excellent model for influenza virus transmission (while they do not show symptoms of disease), with recombinant NA can block viral transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). However, this depended on the setting, and efficacy was higher in an ‘aerosol’ transmission setting in which animals were separated by perforated barriers as compared to a cohoused setting which allowed for direct contact. Interestingly, vaccinated guinea pigs, while supporting virus replication when directly infected, did not pass virus on to naïve animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Vice versa, vaccinated guinea pigs exposed to naïve infected guinea pigs did get infected but experienced lower virus replication. Here, we wanted to investigate if NA vaccination could block transmission chains in a setting that previously led to greater transmission: directly cohousing vaccinated recipient animals with naïve infected donor animals. In this setting we wanted to explore two variables: Does virus dose of inoculation matter when initially infecting the donor guinea pig? And does the time donors and recipients are co-housed have an impact on transmission? We found that mucosal vaccination with recombinant NA can efficiently break transmission chains but this depends on ‘intensity’ of exposure. When donor animals were inoculated with a lower dose of virus and cohoused for a long period of time (6 days) with recipients, transmission to recipients occurred but only low viral titers were measured and virus was not further transmitted. If the initial viral inoculum was increased by one log, transmission chains were only broken in one out of three replicates. If the same experiment was performed with a short cohousing period (24 hours), transmission chains were blocked efficiently with low and high inocula; at the low inoculum dose, even transmission to the first recipient was blocked in two out of three replicates. These different scenarios may be similar to situations that humans experience during the influenza season as well. The short exposure experiment may resemble short contacts with infected individuals, e.g., in public transport, during a dinner or at work. The long exposure is perhaps akin to exposure to infected family members within a household. The low and high inocula perhaps resemble close contact without a mask versus less close contact or masking. Irrespectively, in three out of four scenarios, mucosal immunity to NA was able to break transmission chains and similar immunity in the human population may restrict influenza virus circulation during the influenza season to a large degree. We cannot exclude that recombinant HA would have the same effect. Indeed, it is likely that a recombinant HA vaccine administered the same way would perform well. However, antigenic drift may affect HA more than NA and we therefore think, based on the data presented here and a large number of studies by us and others that show benefits of NA-based immunity, further (clinical) development of NA-based mucosal vaccines is warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S13"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported in part by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) grant AI117287, the Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers (CIVIC) contract 75N93019C00051 (F.K.) and the NIAID Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR) contract 75N93021C00014 (F.K.).</p></ack><sec id="S14" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability statement</title><p id="P22">Data will be made publicly available upon publication and upon request for peer review.</p></sec><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="conflict"><p id="P23"><bold>Conflict of interest statement</bold></p><p id="P24">The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has filed patent applications regarding influenza virus vaccines based on neuraminidase.
