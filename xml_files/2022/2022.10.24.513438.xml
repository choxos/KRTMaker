Primordial follicle activation is the first step towards oocyte maturation and, ultimately, ovulation. As the number of quiescent primordial follicles is finite, their rate of activation is a critical parameter of the duration of the female reproductive lifespan. Activation status is established by the presence of cuboidal and proliferative granulosa cells in primary follicles, rather than squamous and quiescent pregranulosa cells in primordial follicles. Here, using a continuous Entropy Sort Feature Weighting approach on single-cell RNA sequencing data, we identify a distinct transcriptomic signature of activating pregranulosa cells in neonatal wildtype mice. This signature contains several genes previously linked with mature granulosa cells as well several novel candidates: <italic>Slc18a2, Tnni3, Fam13a</italic> and <italic>Myo1e</italic>. We confirm expression of <italic>Slc18a2</italic> and TNNI3 in the granulosa cells of activating follicles in embryonic, neonatal and adult mouse ovaries. Perturbation of cell cycle inhibitor p27<sup>kip1</sup> in <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice results in complete activation of all primordial follicles during this neonatal period. Contrary to previous reports on this established mouse model, we find substantial transcriptomic changes in embryonic <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ovaries. Upon loss of cell-cycle inhibition we find increased expression of our signature of pregranulosa cell activation, particularly that of cardiac troponin I (<italic>Tnni3</italic>). We conclude that pregranulosa cells engage a distinct transcriptional programme prior to cell-cycle dependent primordial follicle activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ovary</kwd><kwd>oocyte</kwd><kwd>infertility</kwd><kwd>granulosa cells</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>cdkn1b</kwd><kwd>p27</kwd><kwd>TNNI3</kwd><kwd>primordial follicle activation</kwd><kwd>entropy sorting</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Critical parameters of the female reproductive lifespan are the finite number of quiescent primordial follicles within their ovaries and the rate of primordial follicle activation for maturation and eventual ovulation. Primordial follicles are formed during gestation and consist of an oocyte with a single layer of surrounding pregranulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Once primordial follicles activate, the pregranulosa cells become steroidogenic granulosa cells and provide structural and metabolic support to the oocyte throughout folliculogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Primordial follicles are initially formed and distributed throughout the ovary. However, typically during late foetal development or neonatally in mammals, the majority of follicles within the central ovarian medulla are lost subsequent to a synchronised activation process termed first wave activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). In rodents, the sex steroids produced by supporting cells during first wave activation are hypothesised to be important for establishing aspects of puberty and the ovarian−hypothalamic−pituitary axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Following first wave activation, the remaining primordial follicles reside in the outer ovarian cortex and are cyclically activated for eventual ovulation or atresia. The establishment of this ‘ovarian reserve’ of cortical primordial follicles, and their gradual release from it, sustains fertility over many months in mice and several decades in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Consequently, stringent control of primordial follicle activation is required to ensure that the ovarian reserve persists for the entire reproductive lifespan. Key indicators of primordial follicle activation are changes in granulosa cell morphology (from squamous to cuboidal) and re-entry into the cell-cycle, and increased oocyte size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). The morphological changes to pregranulosa cells precede that of the oocyte, suggesting that primordial follicle activation may be initiated by the pregranulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). While many pathways have roles in follicle activation, including PI3K, mTOR, KITL, TGFB and Hippo signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), the signal initiating primordial follicle activation remain unresolved. Primordial follicle activation is challenging to interrogate due to the asynchronous nature of activation throughout the adult ovarian cortex. Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) have accelerated our understanding of many ovarian processes in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), however the difficulty of knowing which cortical follicle is initiating activation has impeded the identification of a specific gene or process involved in the earliest steps of this critical process.</p><p id="P6">Here we leveraged the abundance of activating follicles during first wave activation to investigate the transcriptomic changes of pregranulosa cells in neonatal mice. We identify a putative signature of activating pregranulosa cells by analysing scRNAseq data using continuous Entropy Sort Feature Weighting (cESFW). We confirm that two novel targets within the signature, solute carrier family 18 member 2 (<italic>Slc18a2)</italic> and cardiac troponin I (<italic>Tnni3</italic>), increase in expression postnatally within transitioning pregranulosa cells and granulosa cells. Furthermore, we find increased expression of our signature genes within the ovaries of a mutant line with precocious and complete first wave activation (<italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> / p27<sup>kip1</sup>-null) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Contrary to previous reports, we also find that loss of <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> results in transcriptomic changes at E18.5, prior to the morphological changes indicative of follicle activation. We confirm <italic>Tnni3</italic> mRNA expression in <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> granulosa cells at E18.5. These data demonstrate that pregranulosa cell maturation into granulosa cells is a key driver of primordial follicle activation and integrates cell-cycle regulator <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> / p27<sup>kip1</sup> within the molecular mechanism driving this important cell transition.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Identification of putative regulators of primordial follicle activation within pregranulosa cells</title><p id="P7">To profile the transcriptomic dynamics of first wave activation in wildtype (WT) mice, scRNAseq was conducted on ovaries at embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5), post-natal day 4 (PD4), and post-natal day 7 (PD7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). These timepoints captured prior to, during and after first wave activation respectively. Using our previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), we enriched for the somatic cell compartment in the single-cell suspension. The dataset contained 24,810 cells in total with 8,210 cells at E18.5, 7,587 cells at PD4 and 9,013 cells at PD7. Data from all three timepoints were integrated and, subsequent to standard highly variable gene selection, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plots were generated with 18 distinct clusters. The six major cell types (granulosa cells Gc_1 − Gc_5), mesenchymal cells (Mc_1 − Mc_5), oocytes (Oo_1), epithelial cells (Ep_1 − Ep_2), immune cells (Im_1) and blood cells (Bl_1 − Bl_2)) in the ovary were annotated based on their expression of established cell type markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We focused on discovering differences between Gc_1 through Gc_4 as cluster Gc_5 had high expression of <italic>Pax8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>), a recently reported marker of supporting-like cells from the <italic>rete ovarii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Using a detailed panel of pregranulosa and granulosa cell markers, we classified Gc_1 as an embryonic population of epithelial-derived pregranulosa cells due to their expression of <italic>Lgr5, Gng13</italic> and <italic>Lgas7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>), and the decreased cell numbers in Gc_1 between E18.5 and PD7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). We identified Gc_2 as a population of pregranulosa cells derived from the Nr5a1+ somatic cell lineage based on their high expression of <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> and <italic>Foxl2</italic> alongside low expression of <italic>Hsd3b1</italic> and <italic>Hmgcs2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Interestingly, Gc_3 had similar gene expression to Gc_2 (shown by the expression of <italic>Foxl2</italic> and <italic>Hmgcs2</italic> amongst others), but with elevated expression of well-established markers of activated granulosa cells like <italic>Kitl</italic> and <italic>Fst</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). This suggested that Gc_3 is a population of pregranulosa cells that have initiated primordial follicle activation. Cluster Gc_4 expressed mature granulosa cell marker genes including <italic>Amhr2</italic> and <italic>Hmgcs2</italic> and showed high expression of proliferation genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). When interrogated by timepoint and cell cycle phase, we observed that clusters Gc_1, Gc_2 and Gc_3 were present from E18.5, while Gc_4 only appeared at PD4 during first wave activation and was in the proliferative G2M / S phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1b</xref>). Overall, two distinct gene expression dynamics emerged: genes that increase in expression during activation and persist in mature granulosa cells (Gc_3 and Gc_4), and genes that decreased upon entry into the activating pregranulosa cell pool (Gc_1 and Gc_2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To interrogate the granulosa cell transcriptome more closely, we subclustered clusters Gc_1-Gc_5 and Ep_1, the surface epithelium from which many supporting cells are derived (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Differential expression analysis showed there was significant overlap in gene expression across all Gc clusters, and highlighted that distinct marker genes exist for Gc_4 but not the remaining Gc clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1c, Dataset S1-4</xref>). As an alternative to the standard differential expression analysis for feature selection we applied a new computational approach called ‘continuous Entropy Sort Feature Weighting’ (cESFW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) to the Ep_1 and Gc_1 – Gc_5 scRNAseq clusters. Subsetting the scRNA-seq data to the 4376 top ranked genes identified by cESFW generated a higher resolution UMAP of granulosa cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). Unsupervised Kmeans clustering revealed 14 distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1d</xref>). To compare against the differential expression analysis, we manually assigned the cESFW Kmeans clusters to the cell type annotations identified using the conventional scRNAseq workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). We then used entropy sorting (ES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) to calculate the entropy sort score (ESS) correlation metric to get ranked gene lists for each of these clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Dataset S5</xref>). The top ten markers of each cluster differed from those found by standard differential gene expression analysis but also revealed, once upregulated Gc_3 markers are maintained in Gc_4. As such, cESFW feature selection separates the transcriptional signature of the onset of pregranulosa cell activation (e.g. <italic>Slc18a2, Nr5a2, Fam13a</italic> and <italic>Tnni3</italic>) from that of mature granulosa cells only (e.g. <italic>Aurka, Kif23</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Dynamic transcriptome changes underpin the transition of pregranulosa cells to granulosa cells</title><p id="P10">To ensure that our signature genes from cESFW were specific to activating pregranulosa cells, we selected two targets for further analysis. <italic>Tnni3</italic> encodes for an actin-binding protein involved in the troponin complex in cardiac tissues and was recently reported in the granulosa cells of maturing follicles in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Solute carrier family 18-member A2 (<italic>Slc18a2</italic>) is a vesicular monoamine transporter, associated with FSH levels in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). We probed WT mouse ovaries at E18.5, PD4 and PD7 for <italic>Slc18a2</italic> RNA expression and TNNI3 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). <italic>Slc18a2</italic> was not detected within ovarian sections at E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). However, at PD4 and PD7, <italic>Slc18a2</italic> foci were apparent within cuboidal granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Similarly, TNNI3 staining was low to undetectable within pregranulosa cells at E18.5, but at PD4 and PD7, TNNI3 staining was apparent within granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). Additionally, we captured transitioning follicles (containing both cuboidal granulosa cells and pregranulosa cells) where <italic>Slc18a2</italic> and TNNI3 staining was only observed in the activated granulosa cells of a single follicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). Throughout the ovaries, staining for TNNI3 was seen in oocytes of growing follicles but minimal staining was seen in the oocytes of primordial follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). This was reflected in the scRNAseq data with transcription of <italic>Tnni3</italic> in 11.6% of cells in the oocyte cluster. We also confirmed that granulosa cell expression of TNNI3 was conserved across timepoints, detecting staining in activated cortically derived follicles in adult mouse ovaries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). This illustrates upregulation of TNNI3 both in medullary follicles activated during first wave activation and in the cortical follicles of the adult. Taken together, our data show that pregranulosa cells upregulate <italic>Slc18a2</italic> and <italic>Tnni3</italic> expression upon entry into follicle activation. This expression pattern is conserved across the two waves of follicle activation, in both the juvenile and adult mouse ovary for TNNI3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Pregranulosa cells undergo transcriptomic changes precociously in <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice</title><p id="P11">To further explore the involvement of the genes putatively underlying pregranulosa cell activation, we queried if our activation signature genes are disrupted in an established model of precocious and aberrant follicle activation, <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (<italic>Cdkn1b</italic> / p27<sup>kip1</sup>-null) mice. <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> / p27<sup>kip1</sup> is a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor and therefore blocks cell cycle progression. <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice show uncontrolled activation of follicles perinatally, inducing infertility prior to sexual maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>).

The E18.5 timepoint was chosen as it is prior to first wave activation in WT mice and is the first timepoint of our scRNAseq timecourse. First wave activation has concluded by PD8 and was investigated in the previous report of <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> / p27<sup>kip1</sup>-null mice and aligns with our final scRNAseq timepoint.</p><p id="P12">We found just 4 differentially expressed genes at E13.5 (p &lt; 0.05) (<italic>Cdkn1b, Eya4, Pitx2</italic> and <italic>Fcnb)</italic>, confirming pregranulosa cell specification is essentially unperturbed. As previously reported, larger numbers of primary and secondary follicles were observed in <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ovaries at PD8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>) and we found 746 differentially expressed genes at PD8 in our bulk RNAseq data (p &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Dataset S6</xref>). To check transcriptomic changes prior to primordial follicle activation in the wild-type ovary, we examined ovaries from both genotypes at E18.5 and unexpectedly found 896 upregulated and 520 downregulated differentially expressed genes in <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ovaries compared to WT controls (p &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Dataset S6</xref>).

Therefore, we compared the 1416 differentially expressed genes from the bulk RNA-sequencing of E18.5 <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ovaries with the genes expressed in clusters Gc_1 to Gc_4 from our scRNAseq timecourse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). This revealed that most of the differentially expressed genes in <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ovaries at E18.5 were expressed in the activating pregranulosa cell cluster Gc_3 and granulosa cell cluster Gc_4 in WT ovaries. Importantly, the most statistically significantly upregulated differentially expressed gene at E18.5 in <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ovaries was <italic>Tnni3</italic> (1.70logFC, padj=1.06E-38), a gene also identified by the ESS as one of the top ten markers of Gc_3 activating pregranulosa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). <italic>Tnni3</italic> expression is restricted to Gc_3 and Gc_4 cell clusters, contrary to the high <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> expression in clusters Gc_1 and Gc_2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridisation confirmed the localisation of punctate <italic>Tnni3</italic> to pre-granulosa cells in both WT and <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). However, significantly more puncta were observed in <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ovaries when compared with WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>). Together, this suggested engaging the cell-cycle via reduction of <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> expression and increased <italic>Tnni3</italic> expression may drive maturation of pregranulosa cells into granulosa cells in the mouse.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">Primordial follicle activation is critical to the establishment and duration of mammalian female fertility. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning activation holds the potential to improve reproductive longevity, assist in the diagnosis of infertility and develop targeted treatments for patients with ovarian dysfunction. To interrogate this mechanism, we generated a scRNAseq dataset of first-wave primordial follicle activation. We focused on four distinct clusters of granulosa cells that undergo morphological changes associated with initiation of primordial follicle activation. One cluster, Gc_3, represented a distinct population of activating pregranulosa cells, which was interrogated through entropy sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). This analysis revealed a transcriptomic signature of activating pregranulosa cells, where several strong candidate genes for the initiation of follicle activation were identified, including <italic>Slc18a2</italic> and <italic>Tnni3</italic>. We confirmed that our signature contained genes altered during follicle activation using the <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse line, a model for accelerated primordial follicle activation. Signature Gc_3 genes were dysregulated in <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ovaries, including <italic>Tnni3</italic> which showed precocious upregulation in <italic>Cdkn1b</italic><sup>-/-</sup> pre-granulosa cells. These data implicated the cardiac troponin gene, <italic>Tnni3</italic>, as a cell-cycle regulated marker of primordial follicle activation within pregranulosa cells.</p><p id="P15">The ability to track individual cell transcriptomes makes scRNAseq a powerful tool in understanding primordial follicle activation. Several studies have now used scRNAseq both in the cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) and ageing ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), where the focus is commonly on the oocyte. The transcriptomic datasets we provide here highlight the relevance of somatic cells in follicle activation. Our data provide further evidence that follicle activation is likely initiated within the pregranulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). This is in agreement with studies illustrating activation changes in response to mechanical pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) and metabolic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Consulting this dataset alongside previously published scRNAseq studies of the developing ovary will create a more comprehensive picture of granulosa cell changes across germ cell nest breakdown, primordial follicle formation and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Potential opportunities also exist to correlate this data with human ovary scRNAseq studies and those from other species to discover how mechanisms of follicle activation are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The bioinformatic approaches within the study provide new opportunities to discriminate transcriptionally similar cell types. Herein, we utilised two complementary approaches for dissecting activating pregranulosa cells from activated granulosa cells, namely Entropy Sorting (ES) and combining scRNAseq with bulk RNAseq from established infertility mouse models. As in previous uses of ES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), our work demonstrates how the mathematical framework of ES can elucidate subtle changes in transcriptional profiles along developmental trajectories that conventional bioinformatics approaches may struggle to identify. Other developmental questions with dynamic and terminal trajectories could benefit from the application of this approach as a way of more accurately selecting gene targets underpinning development. The second bioinformatic approach was to functionally interrogate genes identified via ES using an infertile mouse model. We utilised a <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse line that has an accelerated primordial follicle activation phenotype in the neonatal mouse ovary. Genes upregulated in <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ovaries were part of the novel gene expression signature of activating pre-granulosa cells identified in our scRNAseq data, along with mature granulosa cell genes. The combination of scRNAseq data with bulk RNA-sequencing supports and strengthens our characterisation of the genes involved in primordial follicle activation, and as such we highlight this methodology as an under-utilised approach. This type of comparison has previously been informative in studies on embryonic somatic gonadal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). In the context of this study, the combination of these bioinformatic tools was effective in identifying TNNI3 as a novel putative regulator of pregranulosa-driven primordial follicle activation.</p><p id="P17"><italic>Tnni3</italic> is an 8-exon gene located on chromosome 7 that encodes a 211-residue protein. TNNI3 functions in cardiac tissue as the inhibitory part of the three-subunit troponin complex and mutations in the gene in humans lead to cardiomyopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). The function of TNNI3 in the ovary is currently unknown. A recent study of human growing follicles reported TNNI3 expression by granulosa cells and noted a characteristic ring-shaped staining pattern at the outer edge of these granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Taken with our findings that <italic>Tnni3</italic> expression is upregulated in the granulosa cells of activating follicles, these data suggest a possible role of TNNI3 in inducing and maintaining the cuboidal shape of pregranulosa cells. Another explanation may be a requirement for TNNI3 to interact with protein kinase C (PKC), an established primordial follicle regulator, as TNNI3 is known to be phosphorylated by PKC in the mouse myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Future work may provide a link between TNNI3 and other biological pathways, however conditional experiments will be required as <italic>Tnni3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice die perinatally from cardiac complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Questions remain as to whether the loss of cell-cycle inhibition in pregranulosa cells solely drives the precocious primordial follicle activation in <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants. Evidence from a closer examination of <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants suggests that germ cell nest breakdown and follicle formation may also be affected, as these mice form multi-oocyte follicles at higher rates than their control littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). In this study, the phenotype of <italic>Cdkn1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants might also be exacerbated by the loss of p27<sup>kip1</sup> in the oocytes, where expression comes on postnatally in wildtype ovaries. A conditional approach deleting <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> in pregranulosa cells specifically would provide a clear answer if primordial follicle activation is initiated in the pregranulosa cells and dysregulated by the absence of p27<sup>kip1</sup>. Regardless, it is clear from this body of work that further interrogation is necessary to find the master regulators of follicle activation.</p><p id="P19">In conclusion, this study presents transcriptomic datasets to interrogate primordial follicle activation in the mouse. We identify a gene expression signature within pregranulosa cells that are undergoing primordial follicle activation and highlight p27<sup>kip1</sup>-dependent genes within this signature. We utilise a recently described mathematical framework, Entropy Sorting, to discriminate activation-specific pregranulosa genes as high confidence imputed regulators of primordial follicle activation. Using this method, combined with an established infertile mouse model, we reveal a likely role for <italic>Tnni3</italic> as a regulator of activation within pregranulosa cells. Our data provide further evidence that it is the pregranulosa cell changes and not the oocytes, that underpin primordial follicle activation. Moreover, we hypothesise that the genes identified in Gc_3 by the Entropy Sort Score (ESS) are a critical part of the molecular control initiating this process. Our datasets, along with the bioinformatic approaches we have employed, will be valuable resources for the interrogation of mechanisms underlying mammalian follicle activation and female fertility.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Mice</title><p id="P20">All experiments carried out on mice were approved under the UK Animal (scientific procedures) Act 1986 (Project license 70/8560 and PP8826065).
