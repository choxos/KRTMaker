Additional Omicron variants have recently emerged, including BA.4.6, BF.7, BA.2.75.2, and BQ.1.1, all of which have the Spike R346T mutation. In particular, BQ.1.1 has rapidly increased in frequency, and BA.5 has recently declined to less than half of viruses in the United States. Our data demonstrate that BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1 escape NAbs induced by infection and vaccination more effectively than BA.5. BQ.1.1 NAb titers were lower than BA.5 NAb titers by a factor of 7 in two cohorts of individuals who received the monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine boosters. These findings provide the immunologic context for the rapid increase in BQ.1.1 prevalence in regions where BA.5 is dominant and have implications for both vaccine immunity and natural immunity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Omicron BA.5 has been the globally dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and has demonstrated substantial neutralization escape compared with prior variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Additional Omicron variants have recently emerged, including BA.4.6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, BF.7, BA.2.75.2, and BQ.1.1, all of which have the Spike R346T mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In particular, BQ.1.1 has rapidly increased in frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>), and BA.5 has recently declined to less than half of viruses in the United States. The ability of BQ.1.1 to evade NAbs induced by vaccination and infection has not yet been determined.</p><p id="P3">We first assessed NAb titers in 16 individuals who were vaccinated and boosted with the monovalent mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine in 2021; participants were excluded from this group if they had known SARS-CoV-2 infection or a positive nucleocapsid serology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Following the boost, median NAb titers to WA1/2020, BA.5, BF.7, BA.2.75.2, and BQ.1.1 were 45,695, 887, 595, 387, and 261, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Median BQ.1.1 NAb titers were lower than median WA1/2020 and BA.5 NAb titers by factors of 175 and 3, respectively.</p><p id="P4">We next evaluated NAb titers in 15 individuals who received the monovalent mRNA boosters and in 18 individuals who received the bivalent mRNA boosters in 2022, most of whom received 3 (range 2-4) prior COVID-19 vaccine doses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). In these cohorts, 33% had documented SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection, but we suspect that the majority were likely infected. Prior to boosting, WA1/2020 and Omicron NAb titers were higher in these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>) than in the uninfected 2021 cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Following the boost, median NAb titers to WA1/2020, BA.5, BF.7, BA.2.75.2, and BQ.1.1 were 21,507, 2829, 2276, 745, and 406, respectively, for the monovalent boosters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) and were 40,515, 3693, 2399, 883, and 508, respectively, for the bivalent boosters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Median BQ.1.1 NAb titers were lower than median WA1/2020 and BA.5 NAb titers by factors of 53-80 and 7, respectively.</p><p id="P5">Our data demonstrate that BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1 escape NAbs induced by infection and vaccination more effectively than BA.5. BQ.1.1 NAb titers were lower than BA.5 NAb titers by a factor of 7 in two cohorts of individuals who received the monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine boosters. These findings provide the immunologic context for the rapid increase in BQ.1.1 prevalence in regions where BA.5 is dominant and have implications for both vaccine immunity and natural immunity. The incorporation of the R346T mutation into multiple new SARS-CoV-2 variants suggests convergent evolution.</p><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Appendix</label><media xlink:href="EMS156581-supplement-Supplementary_Appendix.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d81aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S1"><title>Funding</title><p>The authors acknowledge NIH grant CA260476, the Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness, the Ragon Institute, and the Musk Foundation (D.H.B.), as well as NIH grant AI69309 (A.Y.C.).</p><sec id="S2"><title>Role of Sponsor</title><p>The sponsor did not have any role in design or conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, or interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; or decision to submit the manuscript for publication.</p></sec></ack><sec id="S3" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data sharing</title><p id="P6">J.M., N.P.H., A.Y.C., and D.H.B. had full access to all the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
