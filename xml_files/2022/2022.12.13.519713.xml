Recent single cell studies have focused on epithelial and mesenchymal cell types, but much less is known about the developing lung immune cells, although the airways are a major site of mucosal immunity after birth. An open question is whether tissue-resident immune cells play a role in shaping the tissue as it develops <italic>in utero</italic>. In order to address this, we profiled lung immune cells using scRNAseq, smFISH and immunohistochemistry. At the embryonic stage, we observed an early wave of innate immune cells, including ILCs, NK, myeloid cells and lineage progenitors. By the canalicular stage, we detected naive T lymphocytes high in cytotoxicity genes, and mature B lymphocytes, including B1 cells. Our analysis suggests that fetal lungs provide a niche for full B cell maturation. Given the abundance of immune cells, we investigated their possible effect on epithelial maturation and found that IL-1β drives epithelial progenitor exit from self-renewal and differentiation to basal cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, IL-1β-producing myeloid cells were found adjacent to epithelial tips, suggesting that immune cells may direct the developing lung epithelium.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">A comprehensive understanding of human lung development on a cellular and molecular level is required to facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies for establishing effective lung regeneration and repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The ability to regenerate human lung tissue in the future may offer an alternative to lung transplantation to the many patients suffering with end-stage respiratory failure, the third highest cause of non-communicable disease deaths worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Studying fetal lung development should also enable us to improve the treatment of lung conditions that are known to be a major cause of mortality and morbidity in premature neonates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Importantly, enhanced expertise in human lung development may be utilized in the development of therapies, for example in the production of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) used for disease modeling and drug screening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The five overlapping stages of human lung development are well characterized morphologically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. For our studies, we had access to human lungs aged between 5 and 22 post-conception weeks (pcw), which includes the first three stages of lung development. In the first, embryonic stage, spanning approximately 4-7 pcw, the primary left and right lung buds appear and undergo rapid branching, forming a lobular structure. The pseudoglandular stage occurs between 5-17 pcw and consists of further growth by branching morphogenesis and establishment of the airway tree, with the appearance of smooth muscle, cartilage and mucosal glands. Blood vessels develop alongside airways, but branch more slowly than the epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The canalicular phase spans 16-26 pcw and includes an estimated three further rounds of epithelial branching. In addition, the airways increase in size, the distal epithelial tubes widen into airspaces and the surrounding mesenchyme thins, creating the future alveoli. Alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) differentiation begins at this stage. Our work did not cover the penultimate saccular stage (24-38 pcw) of development and the final alveolar stage (36 pcw to approximately 21 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>). In these final stages, saccules form distally in airways, eventually becoming capillary-wrapped alveoli via saccule septation, while AEC2s (AEC type II cells) start producing surfactant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we focused specifically on investigating the immune cell repertoire within developing lungs. Adult human lungs contain a plethora of immune cells (20% proportionally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>), known to play a crucial role in both normal lung homeostasis and pathogenesis, suggestive of potential analogous functions during development. Fetal hematopoiesis begins extremely early during human development, with immune progenitors emerging from the yolk sac and aorta gonad mesonephros of embryos as early as 1-2 pcw<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. These cells seed the early hematopoietic organs, the fetal liver and bone marrow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, which, by 8-9 pcw, go on to seed the lymphoid organs (thymus and spleen) and peripheral non-lymphoid organs such as the skin, kidney and gut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Recently, it has been confirmed that immune cells are observed in human lungs as early as 5 pcw<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Previous studies have demonstrated a role for immune cells in directing homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> (intestine, testis), regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> (adult lung) and tissue development, although the latter has only been shown in the developing mouse (e.g. mammalian gland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>). To explore the establishment of the immune system and its possible role in directing lung development, we profiled the immune cells present in early human lungs from 5 to 22 pcw, using a combination of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), CITE-seq (Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing), B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry. Furthermore, we functionally investigated potential immune cell-epithelial interactions <italic>in vitro</italic>, using three-dimensional (3D) lung epithelial organoid cultures derived from human embryonic lungs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and demonstrated that immune cell-derived IL-1β can direct epithelial differentiation. We validated the expression of relevant molecules <italic>in vivo</italic>, using techniques including smFISH (small molecule fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization) and IHC.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Immune cells are abundant in human fetal lungs</title><p id="P8">In this study we examined developing prenatal human lungs (5-22 pcw), profiling immune cells at both the cellular and molecular level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref> for experimental overview). Our single cell sequencing data is initially depicted as broadly defined immune cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>; further detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). Innate and progenitor cell types were prevalent early in development, including innate lymphoid (ILC), natural killer (NK) and myeloid cells. Over developmental time, the proportion of lymphocytes gradually increased. Given the diversity of immune cells, we also investigated the effect of immune cell signaling on epithelial differentiation as outlined in the experimental overview (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P9">IHC demonstrated that CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells were abundant in human fetal lungs throughout early development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>) and were located within all lung regions, including the endothelium (CD31<sup>+</sup>, incorporating the vasculature), epithelium (E-Cadherin<sup>+</sup> (ECAD<sup>+</sup>)) and mesenchyme. Our images showed that CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells were prevalent in lung tissue up to 8 pcw, followed by a relative decrease, before increasing again after 20 pcw. We quantified IHC in whole lung tissue sections at weekly time points from 5 to 22 pcw, in a minimum of three replicates at each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>), and confirmed the expression pattern observed in the representative IHC images, revealing a peak in the proportion of immune cells in the early pseudoglandular stage up to 8 pcw, which subsequently declined; the proportion of immune cells then increased again after 20 pcw, at the canalicular stage. As expected, adult lungs contained the same proportion of immune cells as previously reported (~20%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, approximately double the maximum number we observed in the fetus at the half-way point of normal gestation. We conclude that there exists a complex and dynamically changing immune compartment in the fetal lung.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Molecular characterization of immune cells using scRNAseq</title><p id="P10">To comprehensively characterize the subpopulations of fetal lung immune cells, we digested whole fetal lungs aged 8, 9, 12 and 20 pcw and enriched CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells by FACS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S1A</xref>). These cells were profiled using 10X Chromium 5’ scRNAseq with a subset also used for CITE-seq protein measurement, with quality control metrics given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S2A,B</xref>. To maximize cell type and cell-state discovery, we combined these data with the immune compartment of our previous unbiased single-cell whole fetal lung scRNAseq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. After filtering out cells with fewer than 200 genes detected, BBKNN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> integration was performed, followed by downstream clustering and dimensionality reduction (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). After careful curation and removal of cell clusters with high mitochondrial reads, low gene numbers and doublet signatures, we obtained a total of 77,559 high quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>) transcriptomic profiles, covering all known leukocyte lineages, including B and T lymphocytes, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid cells and the early progenitors of the aforementioned lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). Non-immune cells (“others”) such as epithelial, erythroid and stromal cells were also identified and are likely to represent cells non-specifically bound by CD45 antibodies. Although not immune cells, we included these cells in our data object.</p><p id="P11">We carefully annotated and curated the clusters of the single-cell transcriptomic profiles across all stages, presenting 59 clusters of cell types/states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>) based on marker gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S2C</xref>) as described in existing literature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Early progenitor cells, including the pre-pro-B cell, the lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor cell (LMPP), innate lymphoid cell progenitor (ILCP), megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor (MEP), common myeloid progenitor (CMP), megakaryocyte progenitor and T cell progenitors are mainly present in the earlier stages, as visualized in the stage-specific UMAP and cell type proportion bar and dot plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B,C,D</xref>). To quantitate changes in cell type proportion, we used a mixed linear model to calculate the fold-change of cell type proportions over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>). This confirmed the overrepresentation of progenitors, in particular ILCPs and LMPPs/ELPs (early lymphoid progenitors), T progenitors and MEPs at 8-9 pcw. However, a number of non-progenitor cell types, such as macrophages, mast cells and NK cells are also overrepresented early in development, in line with reports that innate immune cells develop prior to the establishment of the adaptive immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Over developmental time, we also see a gradual increase in monocytes. For the T cell lineage we detect some early progenitors, whilst single positive T cells are first observed at 12 pcw with no detection of intermediates. Their proportions are highly upregulated at 20 pcw. In contrast to T cells, B lymphocyte development occurs gradually. The developmental trajectories for B lymphocytes, NK/T and innate lymphoid cells are examined in more detail in the next sections. Finally, myeloid lineage cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, megakaryocytes and granulocytes are present from early stages.</p><p id="P12">To validate our scRNAseq results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D,E</xref>), we carried out flow cytometry, which confirmed the significant increase in abundance of total T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>), CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> and regulatory T cells with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>). At the early pseudoglandular stage, proportions of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells were negligible, as expected based on our knowledge of human thymic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The proportions significantly increased during the pseudoglandular and canalicular stages, with a CD4/CD8 ratio (1.25 and 1.67, respectively) in range of that considered normal in the healthy adult lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. The proportion of Tregs within the CD4<sup>+</sup> population was between 10% and 15%, and remained relatively stable across each stage of development. We then confirmed the presence of identified immune cell types by IHC in tissue sections and observed positive staining for the T cell markers CD4 and CD8, for the NK cell marker CD56 and the B lymphocyte marker CD20 at both 12 and 20 pcw (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S3A</xref>). We validated progenitors and rare cell types using RNAscope (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S3B,C</xref>), including extremely rare SMIM24<sup>+</sup>SPINK2<sup>+</sup> cells, likely to be HSCs as indicated by the expression pattern of these markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S3D</xref>). In fact, we observed a continuous spectrum of developing myeloid lineages <italic>in silico</italic> and spatially validated GMPs &amp; CMPs, promonocytes &amp; myelocytes, MEPs &amp; megakaryocyte progenitors and megakaryocytes in 18 and 20 pcw fetal lung samples, based on their canonical marker gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S3C,D</xref>). This suggests that myeloid cells can exit the fetal liver at premature stages and continue to differentiate in the lung.</p><p id="P13">We see a wealth of immune cell types within the developing lung. Notably the total fraction of immune cells is high at the embryonic stage at 8 pcw and again at the canalicular stage of 20 pcw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). We speculated that the early peak was partially due to the presence of maternal immune cells which are known to enter the fetus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. To investigate such events in our single cell dataset, we used genetic deconvolution (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>), which has been used successfully to detect maternal cells in the embryonic placenta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, and found that the proportion of maternal cells was negligible. It is conceivable that vascular maturation may contribute to the increase in immune cells from 20 pcw, to account for the second observed peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). To assess the proportion of vasculature in the developing lung, we used <italic>PECAM1</italic> as a surrogate readout. Expression of this gene in endothelial cells increases in embryonic development, but remains relatively constant, on a per-cell basis after this period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S3E</xref>). RT-PCR quantification showed a strong increase in <italic>PECAM1</italic> expression from the embryonic to pseudoglandular to canalicular stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S3F</xref>). Given its relatively constant expression per cell from 12 pcw onwards, this analysis suggests that the proportion of vascular cells does increase at the canalicular stage. Hence, the dynamic increase in immune cell number coincides with the increasing mass of vasculature.

This showed that epithelial tip progenitors express several cytokine receptors, including receptors to IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, IL-22, IFN-γ, TNF and TGF-β. We found analogous expression in fresh epithelial tips and organoids in a specific subset of cytokine receptors.

Alterations in their expression are, therefore, a useful measure of response to stimuli and hence we utilized SOX2 and SOX9 as markers for realtime PCR analysis, investigating the effects of our cytokine panel. Initially, organoids were treated with 10 ng/ml cytokines for 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>) and we observed that IL-1β and IL-13 caused a significant decrease in <italic>SOX9</italic> expression, while <italic>SOX2</italic> was not significantly altered. The decrease in <italic>SOX9</italic> caused by IL-13 may be explained by its known role in promoting goblet cell differentiation, which has been observed in the human adult lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, but the IL-1β result was not expected. Therefore, we decided to further explore the effect of IL-1β signaling on organoids.</p><p id="P23">First, we checked for the presence of the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) on the surface of organoids. For IL-1β signal transduction, both IL-1R1 and an accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) are required. Whole mount staining showed both IL-1R1 and IL-1RAcP expression in organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>), confirming the feasibility of IL-1β signal transduction. Importantly, the expression of IL-1R1 and IL-1RAcP were also confirmed in fetal lung epithelium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S7C,D</xref>). Knowing that both receptor components were present, we cultured organoids in the presence of IL-1β for a longer time period.

Therefore, the effect observed following organoid-treatment with IL-1β, suggests it causes the withdrawal of tip progenitors from a self-renewing state towards differentiation. We hence proceeded to look at the effect of IL-1β treatment (10ng/ml, 14 days) on several markers of airway differentiation, and found that it caused a significant increase in the expression of <italic>TP63</italic> and a non-significant increase in <italic>KRT5</italic>, both markers of basal cells; but it had no effect on the expression of secretory cell markers <italic>SCGB3A1</italic>, <italic>SCGB3A2</italic>, <italic>MUC5AC</italic>, <italic>MUC5B</italic> or the ciliated cell marker <italic>FOXJ1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5G</xref>). The effect of IL-1β treatment on organoids was also confirmed at the protein level, via whole mount staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5H</xref>) and Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5I</xref>), which showed that IL-1β caused a decrease in SOX9 and an increase in SOX2 and TP63. These results suggest that IL-1β promotes the exit of tip progenitor cells from a self-renewing state by downregulating SOX9 and increasing SOX2 expression and then causing an increase in TP63 expression, thereby promoting differentiation to basal cells.</p><p id="P24">Using an equivalent fetal lung organoid model, it has previously been shown that dual SMAD signaling activation (DSA) via TGF-β and BMP-4 induces differentiation of lung epithelial tip progenitors into immature TP63<sup>+</sup> basal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. We found that IL-1β supplementation in conjunction with DSA caused a significant increase in the mature basal cell marker, KRT5, in lung organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5J,K</xref>). This suggests that immune cells that secrete IL-1β promote mature basal cell differentiation and may work in conjunction with mesenchymal cells, which secrete TGF-β/BMP-4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. To further confirm the role of IL-1 signaling in differentiation, we also looked at the effect of IL-1β inhibition. IL-1 receptor blockade via IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) increased proliferation (Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells) and organoid size. Conversely, IL-1β decreased organoid size and proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S7E,F,G</xref>). This suggests that IL-1 signaling plays an important role in determining progenitor cell fate, either in stemness or differentiation. Furthermore, adding IL-1Ra plus IL-1β significantly attenuated IL-1β-induced basal cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5L</xref>).

We investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of dendritic cells and macrophages in the developing lungs more closely, utilizing CD1C as a marker for DC2 dendritic cells, and CD206, the macrophage mannose receptor, as a marker for macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D,E</xref>). We identified CD1C<sup>+</sup> DC2 dendritic cells and CD206<sup>+</sup> macrophages in fetal lung tissue throughout development and we found that there were dendritic cells/macrophages directly interacting with SOX9<sup>+</sup> epithelial tip progenitors. In addition, we also observed monocytes and neutrophils near the developing epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6H</xref>). We hypothesize, therefore, that several myeloid cells, including DC2s, macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils located adjacent or near to SOX9<sup>+</sup> epithelial tip progenitors secrete IL-1β, initiating IL-1β signal transduction in those tip cells. This promotes exit from a self-renewing state by first downregulating SOX9 and increasing SOX2 expression, and subsequently increasing TP63 and KRT5 expression, leading to differentiation into basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5M</xref>).</p><p id="P26">We wanted to investigate the properties of fetal lung myeloid cells in more depth, to confirm or refute our hypothesis, so we isolated dendritic cells and macrophages from fetal lungs (21 pcw).

Several cytokines were secreted by both cell types, notably IL-1β, IL-8, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TNF-β. Importantly, this data confirms that the dendritic cells and macrophages present in developing fetal lungs are able to secrete IL-1β.

IL-8 signals via the CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors, which are both absent from epithelial tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref>), and hence IL-8 signaling may not directly affect the developing epithelium. IL-10 signaling requires both components of the IL-10 receptor (α and β), but only IL-10Rβ is expressed in epithelial progenitors and organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref>), suggesting that IL-10 also cannot directly affect epithelial tips. Although IL-8 and IL-10 cannot directly signal to the epithelium, it is possible that they may influence the recruitment and activation of other immune cells that are present in the developing fetal lung, and hence could indirectly affect the epithelium.</p><p id="P27">Overall, we have shown that immune cells capable of secreting IL-1β are resident in the vicinity of the epithelial tips.

During the pseudoglandular stage of development, cell proliferation is highest at the distal tip of growing buds, which co-express SOX9 and SOX2.
