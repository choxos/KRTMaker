Here, we used global proteomic and genomic analyses during infection to understand the molecular responses driving VOC evolution. We discovered VOC-specific differences in viral RNA and protein expression levels, including for N, Orf6, and Orf9b, and pinpointed several viral mutations responsible. An analysis of the host response to VOC infection and comprehensive interrogation of altered virus-host protein-protein interactions revealed conserved and divergent regulation of biological pathways. For example, regulation of host translation was highly conserved, consistent with suppression of VOC replication in mice using the translation inhibitor plitidepsin. Conversely, modulation of the host inflammatory response was most divergent, where we found Alpha and Beta, but not Omicron BA.1, antagonized interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), a phenotype that correlated with differing levels of Orf6. Additionally, Delta more strongly upregulated proinflammatory genes compared to other VOCs. Systematic comparison of Omicron subvariants revealed BA.5 to have evolved enhanced ISG and proinflammatory gene suppression that similarly correlated with Orf6 expression, effects not seen in BA.4 due to a mutation that disrupts the Orf6-nuclear pore interaction. Our findings describe how VOCs have evolved to fine-tune viral protein expression and protein-protein interactions to evade both innate and adaptive immune responses, offering a likely explanation for increased transmission in humans.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The emergence and rapid global spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease-2019) pandemic, continues to impact public health and global economies, becoming one of the deadliest outbreaks in modern history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) began to emerge in September 2020, starting with lineage B.1.1.7 (Alpha) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), followed by P.1 (Gamma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), B.1.351 (Beta) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Phylogenetic studies indicate that VOCs have independently evolved from early-lineage wave 1 (W1) viruses, with epidemiologically dominant VOCs Alpha, Delta and Omicron BA.1 spreading globally while Beta and Gamma remained geographically restricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Omicron encodes a highly mutated Spike protein and represents the most significant antigenic shift to date, effectively facilitating evasion of adaptive immunity acquired from vaccines and prior infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 have been rapidly replaced by BA.4 and BA.5, suggesting Omicron is the first VOC to give rise to globally dominant subvariants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). The emergence and evolution of VOCs is likely driven by selective pressures to adapt to a new host (i.e. humans) as well as escape innate and adaptive immune responses, ultimately facilitating increased human-to-human transmission.</p><p id="P3">SARS-CoV-2 Spike mediates cell entry via host receptor ACE2 and is the most mutated VOC protein. However, SARS-CoV-2 VOCs have acquired additional non-synonymous mutations in non-structural, structural, and accessory proteins including Nsp3, Nsp6, Nsp9, Nsp12, Nsp13, nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E), Orf3a, Orf6, Orf7a, Orf7b, Orf8, and Orf9b. Each VOC has between 20-29 non-synonymous consensus mutations, with the exception of Omicron BA.1, which has 62 non-synonymous consensus mutations, largely localized within the Spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Each VOC also possesses between 4-10 non-coding mutations. We have previously shown adaptations outside of Spike can profoundly impact the host response to infection, reporting the Alpha variant evolved enhanced innate immune evasion by modulating specific viral protein expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), likely contributing to enhanced transmission. However, the impact of mutations outside of Spike in subsequent VOCs, including non-coding mutations, remains poorly understood. We propose that the development of prophylactic and therapeutic inhibitors, and effective management of the current and future coronavirus pandemics, will depend on a complete understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and the host responses that variants provoke.

Specifically, we compared the VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA.1) and two early-lineage wave 1 (W1) isolates: (i) VIC, isolated from Victoria, Australia in Spring 2020 and (ii) IC19, isolated from Europe in Spring 2020, the latter harboring the universal Spike D614G mutation. We began by comparing viral replication in air-liquid-differentiated primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cells. Strikingly, we found that replication of each VOC outpaced W1 IC19, with Delta reaching the highest levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-E</xref>), consistent with VOC adaptive evolution. Furthermore, we found two independent Omicron isolates replicated comparably to Alpha in bronchial epithelial cells, but not effectively as Delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Importantly, enhanced replication of VOCs was not observed in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) detecting E RNA revealed equivalent replication kinetics for W1 virus and all VOCs, except for Omicron BA.1, which displayed a 5-fold reduction in replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Calu-3 are therefore advantageous for comparing host responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), which can otherwise be confounded by large differences in replication, as observed in HAEs, as reduced infection typically diminishes the magnitude of the host response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P5">We prepared VOC-infected Calu-3 cells from two independent infections (termed experiment 1 and 2) harvested at 10 and 24 hours post infection for bulk mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2-3</xref>), mass spectrometry abundance proteomics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4-6</xref>), and phosphoproteomics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7-9</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>) analysis.

In general, we observed trends of RNA expression increases and protein expression decreases during infection relative to mock at 24 hours post infection, typically representing the induction of the inflammatory response to virus at the host RNA level and a virus-induced host translational blockade known to occur during SARS-CoV-2 infection at the protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>).

We normalized each viral RNA quantity to levels of positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome for each virus (e.g. “genomic”) and each viral protein quantity to the sum of all non-structural protein intensities, intended to control for differences in viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Next, a log<sub>2</sub> fold change (log<sub>2</sub>FC) was calculated to compare each virus to our W1 control VIC for both viral RNA and protein (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). We observed large differences in the expression of subgenomic (sg) transcripts and proteins corresponding to structural and accessory genes during VOC infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S3A</xref>). However, large differences in non-structural protein (Nsp) levels were not observed across the viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), as expected given they are translated as a polyprotein and consistent with the notion that coronavirus evolution is associated with the diversification of genes encoded by sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Interestingly, viral RNA and protein expression did not always correlate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S3B</xref>), suggesting independent regulation of transcription and protein expression (translation and/or protein stability). This was especially evident for Orf6 expression by Omicron BA.1, which showed up-regulated sgRNA but down-regulated protein levels relative to VIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S3B</xref>). This was also evident for Orf9b expression by Alpha and Delta, which both showed increased protein levels but only Alpha had upregulated Orf9b-specific sgRNA levels compared to VIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S3A-B</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We and others previously reported increased Orf9b expression during Alpha infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) and hypothesized that Orf9b sgRNA and protein expression could be controlled by distinct mutations. Orf9b is located in an alternative reading frame within N. Alpha encodes an N D3L mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), predicted to enhance a transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) driving increased Orf9b-specific sgRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). It also contains a single nucleotide deletion at position -3 upstream of N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), which we predicted influences N Kozak context and therefore Orf9b translation by increasing leaky ribosomal scanning and Orf9b translation from the N sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Comparatively, Delta contains the -3 deletion but not N D3L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), in line with increased Orf9b protein but not sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). The similar increase in Orf9b protein levels in Alpha and Delta suggests Orf9b protein expression results predominantly from leaky scanning of N sgRNA to produce Orf9b protein driven by the -3 Kozak change, rather than from translation of Orf9b-specific sgRNA. This is in accordance with our previous observation that Alpha Orf9b transcript levels are in low abundance compared to N sgRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Notably, Omicron BA.1 contains an A-T mutation in the -3 N position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), which we predict also weakens the N Kozak context, and as such results in modest upregulation of Orf9b protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). To probe regulation of Orf9b expression we generated a reverse genetics mutant virus with both N D3L and -3 A deletion in a W1 background (USA-WA1/2020 background, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Global mRNA and proteomic analyses during infection of lung epithelial A549-ACE2 cells with this virus revealed Orf9b to be specifically upregulated at both the sgRNA and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S3C-E</xref>), as expected. Interestingly, Beta and Gamma also display upregulated Orf9b protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), though at lower levels compared to Alpha and Delta, but have neither of the mutations discussed herein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), suggesting additional mechanisms regulating Orf9b expression.</p><p id="P9">In addition, we and others have reported the expression of a new sgRNA and protein of the Alpha VOC, called N* (“N-star”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), a truncated version of N starting at amino acid position 210 and continuing until the end of N. Here, we confirmed N* sgRNA and protein to be specifically expressed by Alpha, Gamma, and Omicron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>). N* sgRNA was expressed at low abundance compared to N but similar to Orf6 and E (1-2% of viral transcripts; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3F</xref>). The R203K/G204R double substitution in N is found in the B.1.1 lineage, which includes Alpha, Gamma, and Omicron, and is hypothesized to regulate N* expression because the corresponding nucleotide changes (GGG→AAC), overlapping two codons, create a novel TRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we generated a reverse genetics mutant virus with the R203K and G204R mutations (GGG→AAC) in a W1 background from Wuhan. Global mRNA sequencing during infection in Calu-3 cells confirmed specific N* expression by the R203K/G204R mutant but not by the parental control virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2L</xref>). However, N* expression was approximately half of that observed during Alpha infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3G</xref>), despite normalization to infection levels, suggesting additional mechanisms may contribute to N* expression or that Alpha upregulation of N sgRNA also results in increased N* transcripts.</p><p id="P10">We next used a SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle (VLP) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), which contains viral structural proteins N, S, M, and E and a reporter genome encoding luciferase, to examine how alterations in structural proteins affected VLP production and infectivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3H</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). We found W1 N produced the least infectious units when combined with W1 structural proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3I</xref>). Omicron N produced &gt;10x more infectious units than W1 N, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), while Alpha, Gamma, Delta and Beta N-bearing VLPs produced intermediate amounts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3I</xref>). This suggests that all the VOCs evolved mutations in N protein to enhance viral packaging, likely affecting the production of infectious particles and infectivity. We also evaluated the effects of N* on packaging and infectivity using this assay. Surprisingly, we discovered that N* can package RNA and produce infectious VLPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3J</xref>) even though it does not contain the canonical Nterminal RNA binding domain, suggesting alternative mechanisms of viral packaging, perhaps related to phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Host kinases modulate viral protein phosphorylation during infection</title><p id="P11">We have previously shown that phosphorylation of viral proteins can regulate their activity (e.g. Orf9b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Therefore, we systematically compared viral protein phosphorylation across the VOCs during infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S10</xref>). Across all viruses, we detected 53 viral protein phosphorylation sites, mapping to Nsp1, Nsp3, S, M, N, and Orf9b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), similar to our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). We quantitatively compared phosphopeptide intensities, normalized to total protein abundance, between all possible virus pairs. Importantly, we only compared peptides with identical sequences between each virus pair to control for physicochemical peptide properties that may affect their quantitation using mass spectrometry (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Twenty eight percent (15/53) of sites were conserved across all viruses, meaning they were detected during infection with every virus and were unchanging (p&gt;0.001) at all time points between any pair of viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). Conserved phosphorylation sites likely reflect regulatory interactions that are central to the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. One conserved site was Orf9b S53, which we additionally confirmed to be unchanging across viruses using targeted proteomics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4A</xref>). We previously reported that Orf9b S53 phosphorylation can inhibit its binding to human TOM70, disrupting Orf9b-mediated innate immune antagonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Using the GPS computational algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), we found TBK1, a kinase known to activate the innate immune response downstream of TOM70 and MAVS, to be the top candidate kinase for Orf9b S53 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> ADP-Glo kinase assay, we confirmed TBK1 can robustly phosphorylate Orf9b exclusively at S53 and not S50 or T60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>). Interestingly, this finding reveals a negative feedback loop between Orf9b and TBK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>); while Orf9b can inhibit TBK1 activation through TOM70, TBK1 can also block the interaction between Orf9b and TOM70 by phosphorylating Orf9b S53. These findings suggest that activation of TBK1 during infection may provide a mechanism to reverse Orf9b mediated innate immune antagonism, promoting inflammatory responses after viral sensing. Orf9b may therefore sense TBK1 activity and act as a molecular switch that responds to innate immune activation, regulating it in both directions depending on timing. However, more work is needed to understand exactly how cellular phosphorylation signaling is manipulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection and how this regulates infection.</p><p id="P13">Forty three percent (23/53) of detected sites were differentially regulated between viruses (p≤0.001; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>), mostly on N protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, 3F</xref>).

The magnitude of gene regulation per module was quantified as the average absolute value log<sub>2</sub> fold change of genes within each module, separately for RNA, protein abundance, and phosphorylation, generating a single metric per module, per virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Interestingly, we noticed most modules followed a general trend, which we defined as the Average Host Response (AHR; average regulation across modules; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). For example, the AHR was more pronounced during Delta compared to VIC infection. As expected, the AHR correlated well with the amount of viral RNA (genomic reads; R=0.59) and protein (sum of non-structural proteins; R=0.77) produced for each virus, suggesting the AHR to represent a generalized cellular response to infection, proportional to the amount viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We utilized the AHR to identify similarities and differences between VOCs. Systematic correlation of each module versus the AHR revealed most processes to be well correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>), highlighting the array of host pathways modulated in concert with a general cellular response to viral infection. Some modules correlated poorly with the AHR, representing VOC-specific differences, above-and-beyond a generalized cellular response, allowing us to hone in on key differences between the variants. The ten most correlated modules were related to cell cycle, protein folding, RNA translation and processing, chromosome organization, and the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>, top). The ten least correlated modules included defense response to foreign organisms, innate immune and cytokine response, ion transport, GPCR signaling, and metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>, bottom). The functional distinction between the most and least correlated modules was corroborated by visualizing them on a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>) and a principal components analysis (PCA) plot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S7B</xref>), showing them to be well separated in multidimensional space. Because restricting our analysis to significantly regulated genes could bias our results, we reperformed our analysis using network propagation to embed the entirety of our quantitative data per gene within their pathway network neighborhoods, which resulted in highly similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S7C</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Host translation inhibitor plitidepsin provides pan-variant therapeutic efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P20">Viruses are known to hijack host translational machinery to preferentially produce viral proteins. Analysis of host pathway responses after VOC infection revealed the translation module to be the third most correlated with the AHR, alongside three other translation-related modules, representing a conserved host response across the viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Previously, we and others found inhibition of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) with plitidepsin to exert potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 within the nanomolar concentration range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>).

On the fourth day, viral titers were quantified from the lungs via TCID50.

To probe this further, we merged genes from the five inflammation modules and separated them into two groups: interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and proinflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S12</xref>). We defined ISGs as directly induced upon interferon production after infection (containing an ISRE promoter) and pro-inflammatory genes as contributors to systemic inflammation which are driven by other transcription factors (i.e. NF-kB and AP-1), many of which have been associated with severe COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). We calculated a log<sub>2</sub> fold change of VOCs versus VIC based on the average expression change for genes within each group to compare ISG and pro-inflammatory gene regulation across the VOCs.</p><p id="P22">We found all VOCs, except Omicron BA.1, uniformly antagonized ISG production at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S9</xref>). Alpha and Beta potently suppressed ISG responses at the RNA and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E-F</xref>), which was also reflected in the level of IRF3 nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S9H</xref>). Gamma and Delta infection induced similar levels of ISG transcription relative to W1 viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>), but greater suppression was observed for particular genes, especially for Gamma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S9</xref>). More robust suppression of ISG responses at the protein level, but not always at the RNA level, suggests the evolution of more effective and selective translational inhibition of host responses whilst leaving viral translation intact. Conversely, Omicron BA.1 triggered a greater type-I interferon response and accompanying ISG expression at the RNA and protein level compared to W1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S9</xref>), despite lower levels of replication compared to all other viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>). These observations were consistent using independent isolates of the same VOCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S9D-G</xref>). Interestingly, we noticed greater rescue of Omicron replication, compared to Alpha and Delta, upon administration of the JAK/STAT signaling inhibitor ruxolitinib, underscoring how Omicron induces an antiviral interferon response that subsequently suppresses its replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>).</p><p id="P23">To further compare VOC immunomodulation, we plotted the averaged ISG vs pro-inflammatory gene induction signatures (mRNA) for each VOC, relative to VIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I</xref>). Alpha and Beta were in the lower left quadrant, representing robust antagonism of both ISG and pro-inflammatory gene expression. By contrast, Gamma regulated inflammatory gene expression similar to W1 VIC. Interestingly, Delta shifted into the upper left quadrant, displaying increased induction of proinflammatory genes compared to other VOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I</xref>), despite similar replication kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>). Strikingly, Omicron BA.1 did not cluster with any of the other variants due to increased induction of both ISGs and pro-inflammatory genes compared to other VOCs and W1 VIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I</xref>).</p><p id="P24">To investigate if inflammatory pathway regulation by the VOCs was associated with viral protein expression, as we found previously for Alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), we correlated viral protein and RNA levels with pathway module regulation from our integrative computational analysis and ranked viral genes according to their correlation with inflammatory response modules (modules 8, 13, 31, 43, and 53). Expression of N and Orf6, both well-studied innate immune antagonist proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>), were the most anticorrelated with inflammatory response modules, consistent with the notion that their enhanced expression contributes to the suppression of the host innate immune response across the VOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S7D</xref>). In conclusion, each virus evoked surprisingly different host inflammatory responses during infection; early VOCs Alpha and Beta tend to induce muted responses whereas later VOCs Delta and Omicron tend to drive greater inflammatory responses. These data suggest step-wise evolution of an increasingly sophisticated and more nuanced manipulation of host responses to promote VOC replication and transmission.</p><p id="P25">As mentioned earlier, Omicron BA.1 did not display enhanced innate immune antagonism compared to W1. This was despite a slightly higher expression of the innate antagonist, Orf9b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>). To probe Orf9b function, we generated a reverse genetics Orf9b deletion virus in the Alpha background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S8E</xref>) and observed it to trigger slightly enhanced innate immune responses during infection in Calu-3 cells relative to wild-type Alpha infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S8F</xref>). This confirmed Orf9b contribution to innate immune suppression. By contrast, we have previously shown, using an Alpha Orf6 KO virus in Calu-3, that Orf6 is a potent innate immune antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). The fact that Omicron BA.1 down-regulates Orf6 expression and only slightly upregulates Orf9b, a weaker innate antagonist, suggests Omicron BA.1 may not have enhanced expression of the full complement of antagonists required for the most effective innate immune suppression. It is also possible that mutations in Omicron and Delta Orf9b affect their functional potency. Intriguingly, we found that the Alpha Orf9b KO virus had a defect in replication in primary HAEs, which was not rescued by inhibiting interferon signaling with ruxolitinib, suggesting that Orf9b may have additional roles in promoting viral replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S8G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Omicron subvariants evolved innate immune antagonism by modulating Orf6</title><p id="P26">Phylogenetic studies indicate that the five VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA.1) evolved independently from W1 virus. However, Omicron subvariants (BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5) are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor in a complex and incompletely understood way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Omicron subvariants have co-circulated, becoming globally or locally dominant with evidence for adaptation to evade innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). To probe the molecular mechanisms underlying their differences, we globally quantified mRNA and protein levels in Calu-3 cells infected with equal doses of Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.2, BA.4, or BA.5 alongside Alpha, Delta, and W1 IC19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). Assessment of viral replication by viral genome counts in RNAseq data demonstrated that in this experiment BA.1 and BA.5 replicated comparably, and more efficiently than BA.2 and BA.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Because Omicron subvariant replication was significantly reduced relative to prior VOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>), we compared them to each other and focused on the late (48 hpi) time point to better capture the viral and host response to infection.</p><p id="P27">Strikingly, compared to BA.1, BA.2 stimulated a stronger innate immune response despite reduced replication. Host responses to BA.4 infection were decreased when compared to BA.1, particularly for pro-inflammatory gene induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C-D</xref>). Thus, poor replication (BA.2 and BA.4) does not necessarily correlate with reduced host inflammatory responses, suggesting differences in the regulation of host innate immunity between these viruses. BA.5 displayed the greatest suppression of ISG and pro-inflammatory gene induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S8D</xref>). Importantly, comparing host responses to Omicron subvariants with those to Alpha and Delta indicates that BA.5 is closest to Alpha (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S10A-E</xref>), the best overall innate immune suppressor, suggesting that BA.5 could evolve further Alpha-like host adaptations in the future to even better antagonize innate immune activation.</p><p id="P28">Based on these data and our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), we next hypothesized that Omicron subvariants evolved enhanced innate immune suppression by modulating the expression of specific viral proteins known to inhibit interferon responses. Interrogation of global viral RNA and protein expression during infection revealed differences in the production of structural and accessory proteins, but not non-structural proteins, across the Omicron subvariants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S10C-E</xref>). At the protein level, we observed decreased Orf3a and Orf7a expression in BA.2, increased Orf9b expression in BA.4, and a dramatic loss of Orf8 expression in BA.5. Interestingly, we observed an increase in Orf6 and N protein expression in BA.4 and BA.5, both known innate immune antagonists. Although Orf6 viral sgRNA was increased in BA.4, it was not for BA.5, suggesting the existence of a selective translational or post-translational control mechanism underlying Orf6 protein production for BA.5. Similarly, we previously observed increased viral sgRNA but decreased Orf6 protein production for BA.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). Furthermore, our prior integrative computational analysis found N and Orf6 to be the most anticorrelated with the innate immune response during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6J</xref>), underscoring their role in innate immune regulation. To validate the impact of Orf6 on the innate immune response, we used an Orf6 deletion virus in the Alpha background. The Orf6-deleted virus strongly induced ISG production compared to the Alpha control, reaching similar levels as Omicron BA.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S10F</xref>), consistent with the fact that BA.1 showed decreased Orf6 protein expression compared to the other VOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). These results suggest that Orf6 is an important regulator of the innate immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection and could underpin the evolved immunomodulatory profile of Omicron subvariants.</p><p id="P29">Given similar Orf6 protein levels, we were surprised that BA.4 and BA.5 induced different degrees of innate immune responses, with BA.5 seemingly suppressing ISG expression more strongly than BA.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). However, BA.4 and BA.2 both contain a protein-coding mutation in Orf6 (D61L) and comparative APMS studies revealed the D61L mutation to strongly reduce the interaction between Orf6 and the mRNA transport factor RAE1 and nucleoporin NUP98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7H-l</xref>). Orf6 is known to bind to the nuclear pore to prevent the nuclear translocation of ISG-associated transcription factors (e.g. STAT1), as well as modulate the nuclear export of ISG mRNAs for cytoplasmic translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Thus, a decreased interaction between Orf6 and RAE1/NUP98 could explain the reduced suppression of ISGs seen for BA.4 and BA.2. Furthermore, using the RAE/NUP98/Orf6 crystal structure (PDB 7VPG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>) and the SSIPe program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>), we predicted a model of the mutated complex and computed the difference of free energy change between mutant and W1 forms (ΔΔG = ΔG<sub>bind,D61L</sub> - ΔG<sub>bind,wt</sub>). This analysis confirmed the D61L substitution unfavorably affects the RAE/Orf6 binding stability (ΔΔG = 1.2 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>). Further interpretation of the structure revealed D61 to form a hydrogen bond with RAE1 R239. Other Orf6 residues, including E59, E56, D53, and E55, also formed similar interactions with RAE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7J</xref>). In addition, M58 is inserted into a hydrophobic pocket within RAE1, providing a tight binding interface. Given the number of other residues regulating the Orf6/RAE1 interaction, we predict the D61L mutation to reduce, but not completely abolish, the interaction, in accordance with our APMS results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7H-I</xref>). This mutation appears to also decrease the ability of Orf6 to inhibit the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and the export of host mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S8D</xref>; data shown in an accompanying paper).</p><p id="P30">In summary, we hypothesize the gain of the D61L mutation by BA.2 may be responsible for poor interferon antagonism and increased ISG levels compared to BA.1, in addition to low overall Orf6 protein levels. BA.4 upregulated Orf6 protein levels, which likely contributed to a boost in innate immune suppression, but due to the presence of the D61L mutation, it did not result in a potent inhibition of ISG expression. In contrast, BA.5 upregulates Orf6 and does not contain any Orf6 mutation, which likely explains why BA.5 is the strongest suppressor of innate immune activation among the Omicron subvariants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7K</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">In this study, we sought to understand the biology and selective forces underlying the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. We applied an unbiased global approach to understand VOC infection biology and the impact of mutational adaptations on viral replication and host cellular responses. Although most work comparing VOCs has focused on Spike, we found that mutations beyond Spike critically impact VOC host-virus interactions.</p><p id="P32">Global comparison of viral RNA and protein expression across the viruses revealed VOCs tend to enhance expression levels of key innate immune antagonists to manipulate defensive host responses. Given VOCs are each independently derived from an early lineage wave 1 virus, our observation of different VOCs enhancing the same set of proteins (e.g. N, Orf6, and Orf9b), as well as evolution of N* expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), strongly suggests convergent evolution of related strategies to subvert host defenses and improve transmission. Here, we were able to map several of the mutations responsible for altered protein expression, particularly for N, N* and Orf9b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), but the changes that regulate Orf6 remain elusive. We were also able to link adaptation of host-virus PPIs to specific viral mutations using APMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), discovering an array of intriguing VOC-specific modifications to the host-virus protein-protein interaction landscape. For example, the novel VOC-specific protein N* interacts with the host RNAPII-associated factor complex (PAFc), suggesting VOCs have evolved to influence host gene expression through N*. Overall, our results highlight the plasticity of viral protein evolution and of host-virus interactions, showing that viral point mutations, including non-coding changes, can have significant functional impact.</p><p id="P33">One of the most striking features of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs is their sequential replacement of the single dominant VOC, with Alpha replacing wave 1, followed by Delta replacing Alpha, and then Omicron replacing Delta, rather than continuous global co-circulation. A wealth of data implicates Spike adaptation to escape adaptive antibody responses, but our data suggests that VOC evolution is more complex. Our integrative computational analysis revealed the most divergently regulated cellular pathways across the VOCs were those connected to innate immune and cytokine responses. This suggests that improving the capacity to regulate host innate immune responses makes a significant contribution to sequential VOC dominance and improved transmission. This also likely reflects a strong selection imposed by the human innate immune system on the virus, whose ancestor was originally adapted to evade bat innate immunity. However, our data do not explain why some VOC lineages in circulation, here Beta and Gamma, did not become dominant worldwide, but they do link viral genetics to host innate immune activation and its suppression. Nonetheless, we propose that a major force in shaping virus-host adaptations is related to evasion of innate and adaptive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), as is consistent with our recent work demonstrating that evasion of innate immune responses defines pandemic HIV-1 (M) contributing to enhanced human-to-human transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>).</p><p id="P34">A significant event in SARS-CoV-2 evolution was represented by the emergence of the Omicron lineage. Omicron represents the biggest antigenic shift in SARS-CoV-2 evasion of the host adaptive immune responses, presumably driven by vaccination and/or prior infection, significantly reducing neutralization sensitivity. Omicron Spike mutations not only shifted antigenicity effectively to a new serotype, but also altered the biology of viral entry, reducing dependence on TMPRSS2 and surface fusion and instead moving towards dependence on cathepsin and endosomal fusion, and likely shifting <italic>in vivo</italic> tropism to the upper airway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). Our data shows that Omicron is less effective in suppressing innate immune responses than Alpha or Delta. However, subsequent Omicron lineages, particularly BA.5, have enhanced their capacity to express key innate immune antagonist Orf6 and effectively suppress inflammatory responses during infection. We propose that having achieved the antigenic shift required to escape widespread adaptive immune responses to Spike, Omicron, like previous VOCs, subsequently experienced the next strongest selective pressure, resulting in the enhancement of innate immune evasion via upregulation of viral protein antagonists. A simple model of enhanced innate immune evasion by increased expression of Orf6 protein is somewhat confounded by the appearance of the Orf6 D61L mutation in the Omicron sublineages BA.2 and BA.4. However, APMS studies demonstrated this mutation to weaken the interaction with RAE1 and NUP98, suggesting a weakened inhibition of nuclear transport for mediators of the inflammatory response. Strikingly, D61L is encoded by the same 3 nucleotide substitutions in BA.2 and BA.4, suggesting this mutation occurred only once, perhaps in BA.2 and then BA.4 by recombination.</p><p id="P35">Surprisingly, we also detected differences in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines between cells infected with different VOCs. Cytokines including IL-6, CCL5, IL-8, TNF, and IL-1ß have been associated with increased COVID-19 severity and poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Whether such differences could account for VOC-specific pathogenicity, for example reports of more severe disease with Delta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>) or late Omicron sublineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>), is hard to determine due to confounding pre-existing immunity. Thus, whilst VOCs, particularly Omicron with its modified Spike antigenicity, altered tropism, and enhanced innate immune evasion in later subvariants, may drive less severe disease than its predecessor Delta, which appears to be particularly inflammatory, dissecting the differences in the mechanisms driving pathogenicity and disease severity remains a necessary challenge. Although no model is perfect, a combination of cell lines, primary human cell models, and <italic>in vivo</italic> rodent models may produce the richest understanding of functional VOC evolution and its links to disease severity.</p><p id="P36">Importantly, our analysis pinpointed cellular pathways, including translation, cell cycle, and mRNA processing, that are similarly modulated across the VOCs during infection and thus represent putative targets for pan-coronavirus antivirals.

Importantly, only phosphorylated peptides that possessed a conserved sequence across each pair of viruses being compared were used for quantification of phosphorylated peptide intensities to control for physicochemical peptide properties that may affect their quantitation using mass spectrometry. Viral protein intensities were defined as the sum of peptide feature intensities from the abundance proteomics data that mapped to each viral protein (as determined by the Spectronaut search, above). We then calculated the ratio between each corresponding phosphorylated peptide intensity and viral protein intensity per biological replicate (phosphorylated peptide intensity / viral protein intensity). Next, we performed a two-tailed t-test, assuming unequal variance, generating a t-statistic and p-value per phosphorylated peptide. We required at least two biological replicates per condition to perform the t-test (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S10</xref> for full set of results).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S41"><title>Targeted proteomics for Orf9b phosphorylation</title><p id="P63">A spectral library was constructed from the DIA data to obtain Orf9b-specific transitions for abundance and phosphorylation measurements. Four Orf9b peptides were included to determine Orf9b abundance. To determine site-specific Orf9b phosphorylation, we included peptides representing Ser50 (LGS(+80)PLSLNMAR) and Ser53 (LGSPLS(+80)LNMAR). Unrelated heat shock peptides were included and used for normalization when appropriate. All samples were loaded on a 15 cm PepSep column (Bruker) packed with 1.5 μm, 150 Å ReproSil C18 particles connected to a nanoLC easy 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For abundance measurements, peptides were separated with the following 50 minute gradient at 0.6 μl min-1: 2% to 6% B (0.1% FA in 80% ACN) in 1 minute to 25% B in 35 minutes, 34% B over 4 minutes, 90% B over 1 minute, followed by a 10 minute wash at 90% B. Phosphorylated peptides were separated with the following 62 minute gradient at 0.6 μl min-1: 2% to 5% B in 2 minutes to 27% B at 32 minutes, 33% B over 15 minutes, 90% B over 1 minute, followed by a 12 minute wash at 90% B. All samples were acquired on an Orbitrap Tribrid Lumos (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated in positive ion mode. For abundance samples, each MS1 scan was acquired at a Fourier transform (FT) resolution at 120,000 (200 m/z) from 350 to 1,100 m/z. Peptide ions were accumulated for 50 ms or until reaching an AGC of 5e5. Four peptides were placed on an inclusion list and fragmented using stepped HCD at an NCE of 33 and a spread of ±3%. Peptides were isolated with a 1.4 Da window, and the resultant fragments were analyzed in the Orbitrap at 60,000 resolution (200 m/z). For analysis of phosphorylated peptides, the mass spectrometer was operated in targeted mode (PRM). One FT MS1 scan at 120,000 resolution (200 m/z) from 500 to 800 m/z was acquired for 256 ms or until reaching an AGC of 1e6, followed by four targeted scans per cycle. Precursor isolation width was set to 1.6 Da, list and fragmented using stepped HCD at an NCE of 33 and a spread of ±3%. MS2 scans were acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000 (200 m/z), and ions were accumulated for 118 ms or until reaching an AGC of 5e5. Following MS acquisition, each experiment was separately analyzed in Skyline. For all analyses, the MS1 filter was set to count and three precursors were used at 10 ppm mass error. The MS2 filtering was set to Orbitrap and the resolution was set to 60,000 (200 m/z). For the phosphorylation site experiments both b/y and a/z ions were used, whereas for the abundance experiments b and y ions were included. Peaks were manually inspected for integration and boundaries refined if necessary. For Orf9b Ser50/Ser53 the presence of the proline in the peptide sequence resulted in a split chromatographic peak between the two isomers and the second peak was used for integration for all samples. For both phosphoisomers, only phophosite-specific ions were used for quantification (y5-y9/b6-b10 for Ser53 and y9-y5/b2-b6 for Ser50).</p></sec><sec id="S42"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> kinase activity assay</title><p id="P64">ADP-Glo kinase reactions (Promega #V6930) were carried out per the manufacturer’s instructions using 10 nM TBK1 kinase (Promega #V3991) and 10 μM peptide substrate with 100 μM ATP.

The WT and mutant baits for each SARS-CoV-2 protein were transfected as one experiment on the same day, and one GFP control and one empty vector (pLVX-EF1a-IRES-Puro) control were included in each experiment. The amount of bait plasmid transfected was determined based on previous affinity purification experiments of wave 1 only SARS-CoV-2 baits (2020 Nature paper). Total plasmid was topped up to 15 μg with empty vector and the following amounts of each bait or control plasmid were transfected: 2 μg GFP; 2.5 μg N, Orf3a, Orf9b; 5.0 μg Orf7b, Nsp2, Nsp6; 6.125 μg Nsp3; 7.5 μg E, Orf8, Nsp7, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp16; 10 μg Orf6, Nsp4, Nsp5, Nsp8, Nsp11, Nsp15; 12.5 μg S, M, Nsp12, Nsp14; 15 μg Orf3b, Orf7a, Orf9c, Orf10, Nsp1, Nsp13, empty vector.

Beads were washed three times with 1 ml wash buffer and then once with 1 ml IP buffer. To directly digest bead-bound proteins as well as elute proteins with biotin, beads were manually suspended in IP buffer and divided in half before transferring to 50 pl denaturation–reduction buffer (2 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT) and 50 μl 1× buffer BXT (IBA Lifesciences) dispensed into a single 96-well KFF microtitre plate.

The KFF Purification System was placed in the cold room and allowed to equilibrate to 4 °C overnight before use. All automated protocol steps were performed using the slow mix speed and the following mix times: 30 s for equilibration and wash steps, 2h for binding and 1 min for final bead release.

These three different correlations were summarized to a composite R value using geometric mean to rank them for their correlation to AHR. The geometric mean was used to favor consistently high correlation across the three omics. To rank those least correlated, we defined the composite R value by first transforming by subtracting from 1, taking the geometric mean, and then subtracting from 1 again to convert back to a similar scale as the original R values. This transformation allowed for the handling of negative R values and still enabled the property of geometric means to favor consistently high numbers to find those that are consistently low.

Briefly, infectious supernatants were collected at 48 h post-infection and frozen at −80 °C until later use. Infectious titers were quantified by limiting dilution titration using Vero TMPRSS2 cells. Briefly, Vero-TMPRSS2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 20,000 cells/well. The next day, SARS-CoV-2-containing supernatant was applied at serial 10-fold dilutions ranging from 10−1 to 10−8 and, after 4 days, viral cytopathic effect (CPE) was detected by staining cell monolayers with crystal violet. TCID50/ml were calculated using the method of Reed and Muench. The R statistical software (package rstatix) was used to determine differences in lung titers using a two-tailed, unpaired t-test assuming equal variances at a confidence interval of 95%. Not all infections were successful in the mice. We filtered outliers using a Hampel filter.</p></sec><sec id="S60"><title>Virus-like particle (VLP) assays</title><p id="P80">Virus-like particle assays were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Plasmids CoV2-N (0.67), CoV2-M-IRES-E (0.33), CoV-2-S (0.0016) and Luc-T20 (1.0) at indicated mass ratios for a total of 375 ng of DNA were diluted in 37.5 μL Opti-MEM containing 1.125 μg PEI (polyethyleneimine, Polysciences). For experiments with N*, mass ratios were 0.33 (N), 0.33 (N*), 0.33 (M-IRES-E), 0.0016 (S), Luc-T20 (1.0). Transfection mixture was incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature and then added to HEK293T cells in each well of a 96-well plate containing 150 μL of DMEM (with fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin). Media was changed after 24 hours of transfection. At 48 hours post-transfection, VLP containing supernatant was collected and filtered using a 0.45 μm pore size filter plate. VLP containing supernatant (50 μL) was added to 50 μL of cell suspension containing 50,000 receiver cells (HEK293T ACE2/TMPRSS2) in each well of tissue culture treated opaque white 96-well plate (Corning). Cells were allowed to attach and take up VLPs overnight. The next day, supernatant was removed, and cells were lysed in 20 μL passive lysis buffer (Promega) for 15 minutes at room temperature with gentle rocking. Using a TECAN Spark plate reader, 50 μL of reconstituted luciferase assay buffer (Promega) was added to each well and mixed for 15 seconds followed immediately by luminescence measurement. Expression of VOC N protein constructs was evaluated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) and found to be equivalent across constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS156184-supplement-Supplemental_Tables.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d36aAdMbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS156184-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d36aAdMcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S61"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Wendy Barclay (Imperial College London, UK), and Alex Sigal and Khadija Khan (Africa Health Research Institute, Durban, South Africa) for the generous gifts of VOC isolates.

M58 inserts into a RAE1 hydrophobic pocket.</p><p>(<bold>K</bold>) Model of the effects of Orf6 levels and Orf6 D61L mutant status on the innate immune response. The nuclear pore (RAE1 and NUP98) physically interacts with Orf6, which suppresses the nuclear translocation of ISG-inducing transcription factors (e.g. STAT1) and export of ISG mRNAs during infection. This interaction is weakened, but not abolished, when the D61L mutation is present, resulting in diminished innate immune antagonism by Orf6. BA.1 and BA.2 downregulate Orf6 relative to early-lineage SARS-CoV-2 (IC19), which results in an increased innate immune response during infection, exacerbated by the presence of the D61L mutation in BA.2. Conversely, BA.4 and BA.5 upregulate Orf6 protein to similar levels; however, BA.5 more strongly antagonizes the innate immune response, which we speculate is due to the absence of the D61L mutation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156184-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
