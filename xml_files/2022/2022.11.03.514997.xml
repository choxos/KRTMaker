We studied the faecal microbiota composition (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) and faecal microbiome functionality (metaproteomics) in a cohort of 40 infants diagnosed with cow’s milk allergy (CMA) when entering the study. Some of the infants showed outgrowth of CMA after 12 months, while others did not. Faecal microbiota composition of infants was analysed directly after CMA diagnosis (baseline) as well as 6 and 12 months after entering the study. The aim was to gain insight on gut microbiome parameters in relation to outgrowth of CMA.</p><p id="P4">The results of this study show that microbiome differences related to outgrowth of CMA can be mainly identified at the taxonomic level of the 16S rRNA gene, and to a lesser extent at the protein-based microbial taxonomy and functional protein level. At the 16S rRNA gene level outgrowth of CMA is characterized by lower relative abundance of <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> at baseline and lower <italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic> at visit 12 months.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">The first three years of life are a key period for the development of the gut microbiome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In this period, two transition stages can be distinguished <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. During the first stage, immediately after birth, the gut microbiome is dominated by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. During the second stage, when infants start to eat solid foods until about three years of age, an adult-like microbiome, with Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes as most abundant phyla, is established <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Gut microbiome development during the first year of life is strongly influenced by various factors such as mode of delivery (vaginal/Caesarean) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, antibiotics use <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, mode of feeding (breast fed/formula fed) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and lack of siblings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Several studies provide evidence for an association between gut dysbiosis, induced by the factors mentioned above, and the development of food allergies (FA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Previous research has shown that children with allergy have lower faecal DNA levels of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> compared to healthy children.

In children with cow’s milk allergy (CMA), lower faecal DNA levels of Bacteroidetes and higher levels of Proteobacteria were observed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Metaproteomics approaches on faecal samples can provide insights into the functional roles of the intestinal microbiome in human diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. However, they have seldom be applied to allergic diseases. One study applied metaproteomics on the infant gut microbiome to unravel functional signatures in infants with atopic dermatitis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. To the best of our knowledge, metaproteomics has not been used to study the microbiome and its function in CMA. In this study, we considered both faecal metaproteomics and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data. Separate analysis was performed on each data type, but selection of core microbiota was based on combined rules applied to the two types of data. We study the changes in the microbiome of children diagnosed with CMA some of whom outgrew their CMA after one year and others did not. In this way, we aim to identify potential microbial factors associated with outgrowth of CMA.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Sample collection and experimental design</title><p id="P9">This study included 120 samples of the prospective interventional multicenter study PRESTO (NTR3725), retrieved from Danone Nutricia Research, where infants diagnosed with immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated CMA received specialized nutrition aimed to induce outgrowth of CMA.</p><p id="P10">IgE-mediated CMA was diagnosed as follows as elsewhere <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. First, infants were considered as sensitized to cow’s milk (CM) if their CM-specific serum IgE was higher than 0.1 kU/L and/or a CM skin prick test (SPT) resulted in a wheal size ≥ 3 mm. Next, diagnosis of IgE-mediated CMA was confirmed by an open or double-blind placebo-controlled cow’s milk challenge or a history of anaphylaxis reaction to isolated ingestion of CM confirmed by two physicians.</p><p id="P11">Outgrowth of CMA at visit 12 months was evaluated through a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) with CM powder, followed by an oral fresh milk challenge in case the former was negative, like described earlier <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">Some infants received an amino acid-based formula (AAF), while others received an AAF with a synbiotic blend (AAF-syn) (oligosaccharides (oligofructose, inulin) + <italic>Bifidobacterium breve M-16V</italic>). Detailed information about the dosage has been described by Chatchatee et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. After 12 months, outgrowth of CMA was not different between infants that were fed with the AAF and those that were fed with the AAF-syn, and was in line with natural outgrowth of CMA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">The PRESTO study included 169 subjects, of which 40 were selected for our study based on sample, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and immunological data availability for a study duration up to 12 months. For those 40 infants, samples were collected at three visits, resulting in 120 samples: the baseline visit (0 months) where the subjects entered the study after CMA diagnosis, 6 months after entering the study and 12 months after entering the study. Faecal microbiota characterization was performed at the three visits for these 40 infants. All infants had been breastfed and were of age 3 - 13 months of age when entering the study (baseline visit). Of these 40 infants, 24 (10 infants in AAF group and 14 infants in AAF-syn group) outgrew their CMA after 12 months, while 15 infants (6 infants in AAF group and 9 infants in AAF-syn group) were still allergic to cow’s milk. For one infant the CMA status at visit 12 months was inconclusive, and this subject was removed from the analysis.

This suggests that changes related to outgrowth of allergy mainly occur at the level of the 16S rRNA gene-based taxonomic classification and less at the protein-based taxonomic classification level. When comparing allergy groups within visits, the only significant result at the family level were higher <italic>Eggerthellaceae</italic> proteins at baseline and higher <italic>Veillonellaceae</italic> proteins at visit 6 months in infants who did not outgrow their CMA compared to the group who outgrew their CMA. To the best of our knowledge, these results have not been reported earlier.</p><p id="P110">Similar as for 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the results for metaproteomics showed an decrease in relative abundance of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> proteins between baseline and 12 months in both allergy groups.</p><p id="P111">The results of the metaproteomics analysis reveal microbial metabolic processes which are expected to play a crucial role in the mechanisms underlying outgrowth of CMA. For most of the processes, multiple bacterial families contribute to their increase over visits in the group who outgrew their CMA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S32</xref>). In infants who outgrew their CMA, increased relative abundances of <italic>Rikenellaceae</italic> and <italic>Coriobacteriaceae</italic> proteins between baseline and 12 months can be related to an increase in relative abundance of proteins involved in pyruvate metabolism and fructose and mannose metabolism respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S32</xref>).</p><p id="P112">In general, the analysis on microbial protein functional classes did identify fewer significant differences between allergy groups and visits compared to the analysis of the 16S rRNA gene-based taxonomy, suggesting that changes related to outgrowth of CMA occur at the 16S rRNA gene-based taxonomic level and less at the protein functional level.</p><p id="P113">In this study, we also determined differences in human protein classes between allergy groups and visits. For children who did not outgrew their at 12 months, significantly lower levels of human immunoglobulins were observed at visit 12 months compared to the baseline visit. Furthermore, higher relative abundances of proline-rich proteins at 12 months compared to baseline, and lower relative abundances of S100 proteins at 6 months compared to baseline were observed in the group who outgrew their allergy, but not in the other group.</p><p id="P114">The results of the RDA analysis confirm that there is a small contribution of the microbiome to outgrowth of CMA, and that this contribution mainly occurs at the 16S rRNA gene-based taxonomy level.</p><p id="P115">Our study has several limitations. First, the study has a wide age range at baseline visit (3-13 months). Given the large changes that the infant gut microbiome undergoes between 3 and 13 months, among others related to weaning, this wide range could affect the results.</p><p id="P116">Large differences in baseline microbiota and in its development over time are expected between infants of 3 and 13 months old. Moreover, infants of similar age may be included at baseline and 6 months, and at 6 and 12 months. Age-related variability within visits may have confounded the comparisons between visits, potentially obscuring changes related to age and outgrowth of CMA. Overall, adding age as fixed effect to the LMM resulted in worse goodness of fit (higher AIC) and a lower number of significant differences, in particular between visits. Second, the size of the cohort is small, and as a consequence the results have to be interpreted with caution. Validating the results in a similar but larger cohort is a direction for future research. Third, the small size of the cohort made it difficult to detect significant features from a complete list of taxa or protein classes using methods correcting for multiple testing, like LMM analysis. Methods based on effect size rather than statistical significance after multiple testing correction, like LEfSe, are more sensitive to detect discriminative features in a small cohort. Their drawback is the risk for detecting false positives. Therefore, we conducted a LMM analysis on the complete list of families (in addition to the analysis of the core taxa) and the complete lists of microbial functional and human protein classes (in addition of the analysis of the top 10). As expected, the number of significant features found by this LMM analysis was low, but we noticed that the majority of the results found by LEfSe were in the top ranked list of LMM-based unadjusted p-values. This indicates concordance between the LMM and LEfSe results, and suggests that the majority of differential features obtained by LEfSe could have also been detected by LMM in case of availability of a larger cohort.</p><p id="P117">In summary, we can conclude microbiome differences related to outgrowth of CMA can be mainly identified at the level of the 16S rRNA gene taxonomic level, and to a lesser extent at the protein-based microbial taxonomy and functional level. The overall contribution of the microbiome to outgrowth of CMA is low.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary results</label><media xlink:href="EMS156694-supplement-Supplementary_results.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d34aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table S2</label><media xlink:href="EMS156694-supplement-Supplementary_Table_S2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d34aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S36"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Guus Roeselers (Danone Nutricia Research) is gratefully acknowledged for his input in the study design.
