Mmt is expressed in a small number of neurons in the adult nervous system, with a single pair of neurons modulating protein appetite. Finally, sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that <italic>mmt</italic> is part of an ancient and conserved family of neuropeptides, including the poorly understood vertebrate <italic>neuropeptides B</italic> and <italic>W</italic> genes.

They play vital roles in the dynamic adaptation of animals to multiple internal and environmental challenges and act at different temporal and spatial scales, ranging from cellular to systemic effects. These regulatory molecules are produced in neurons and neuroendocrine cells of the nervous system, enteroendocrine cells in the intestine or several peripheral sites. As such, they play an essential role in the capacity of animals to maintain homeostasis and maximize fitness. Given their essential and highly specialized role, peptide hormones are thought to be both ancient and fast evolving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Elphick et al., 2018</xref>). Together with their small size, it is however difficult to identify them using classic bioinformatics or experimental approaches, such as proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">De Laney et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that new neuropeptides and peptide hormones remain to be discovered, including ones that are evolutionarily conserved across species.</p><p id="P3">A key aspect of homeostasis is maintaining a balanced in-take of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Leopold &amp; Perrimon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Münch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Simpson et al., 2015</xref>). Choices such as which food to eat and how much to ingest greatly impact the overall fitness of animals. Macronutrients such as proteins (amino acids), lipids and carbohydrates are essential for maintaining tissues and energy balance. Because they cannot be synthesized by the animal, essential amino acids (eAAs) are vital nutrients determining animal fitness, mainly through their effect on reproduction and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Piper et al., 2014</xref>). Despite their importance, overconsumption of AAs is known to reduce lifespan and negatively impact fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">M. E. Levine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Piper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Solon-Biet et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the intake of this macronutrient must be tightly regulated and animals, including humans, have evolved mechanisms to modify their food choices to avoid the lack or overconsumption of AAs. Accordingly, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> females, AA deprivation, mating, and the microbiome are potent modulators of protein intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ezra-Nevo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Henriques et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Malita et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Ribeiro &amp; Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). Both nutrient and reproductive states have recently been shown to profoundly alter how taste information is processed in the fly brain leading to changes in protein appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Münch et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Steck et al., 2018</xref>). Several neuropeptides and peptide hormones have been shown to regulate different aspects of the feeding process. Molecules signaling either satiety or hunger, reducing or promoting feeding, respectively, have been identified in several species, from flies to vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Andermann &amp; Lowell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Neuropeptide Y in mammals and its orthologue Neuropeptide F in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are examples of two conserved peptides involved in promoting feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brown et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Horio &amp; Liberles, 2021</xref>). However, signals regulating nutrient-specific appetites and how they act to control food choice remain less well understood.</p><p id="P4">In vertebrates, two neuropeptides that have been proposed to control feeding are the poorly studied neuropeptide B (NPB) and neuropeptide W (NPW), which share structural and functional similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brezillon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Fujii et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Shimomura et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Takenoya et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>). NPB and NPW are expressed in brain regions previously related to feeding, such as hypothalamic areas. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular administration of NPB or NPW in rodents has been shown to lead to changes in food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Baker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">A. S. Levine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Mondal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Naso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Samson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Shimomura et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, <italic>NPB</italic> knock-out mice have been reported to develop adult-onset obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kelly et al., 2005</xref>). However, the precise function of NPB and NPW remains enigmatic as some studies observed an increase in food intake upon NPB or NPW injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Baker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">A. S. Levine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Samson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Shimomura et al., 2002</xref>), while others observed a reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Mondal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Naso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, while NPB/W signaling seems to play a role in controlling food intake and homeostasis, the mechanisms underlying their mode of action remain unclear. Likewise, the evolutionary origin and history of NPB/NPW remain unknown. Identifying evolutionary orthologues could open the door to a comparative mechanistic dissection of the function of this poorly understood peptide class and hence a deeper understanding of appetite regulation.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we identify <italic>marmite,</italic> a previously uncharacterized <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> gene that encodes a predicted secreted peptide that controls protein appetite. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis show that this novel peptide is part of a conserved family of genes that likely originated early in the evolution of Bilateria and includes the vertebrate <italic>neuropeptides B</italic> and <italic>W</italic>. To characterize the behavioral relevance and anatomical distribution of <italic>marmite</italic> (<italic>mmt</italic>), we genome-engineered flies to generate animals either lacking <italic>mmt</italic> or harboring a <italic>Gal4</italic> sequence instead of the original coding region. <italic>mmt</italic> mutants and flies with neuronal knockdown of <italic>mmt</italic>, specifically increased their intake of proteinaceous food, while neuronal overexpression of <italic>mmt</italic> led to a decrease in protein appetite. Moreover, single essential AA deprivation decreases <italic>mmt</italic> expression, supporting the idea that <italic>mmt</italic> encodes a neuronal protein-specific satiety signal. This effect is corroborated by detailed anatomical and behavioral analysis, which showed that <italic>mmt</italic> is expressed in around 25 neurons in the brain, of which one pair is responsible for the protein appetite phenotype. Finally, we provided evidence that Marmite (Mmt) and NPB/NPW function is evolutionarily conserved: neuronal overexpression of human <italic>NPB</italic> or <italic>NPW</italic> genes in flies phenocopied the behavioral effect of <italic>mmt</italic> overexpression; and the overexpression of <italic>mmt</italic> in the mouse ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) mimicked the overexpression of <italic>NPB</italic>. We therefore, identified a new AA-state controlled neuropeptide gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and showed that it encodes a satiety factor controlling protein intake via the action of one pair of neurons. Together with the vertebrate <italic>NPB/NPW</italic> genes, <italic>mmt</italic> defines an ancient neuropeptide family sharing a conserved function in controlling feeding.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>CG14075</italic> encodes a novel putative <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuropeptide</title><p id="P6">Despite the importance of neuropeptides in modulating behavior and physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nässel &amp; Zandawala, 2019</xref>), it remains difficult to predict these molecules and their corresponding genes. One of the challenges is their small size and poor sequence conservation, making it difficult to use existing proteomics and/or bioinformatics pipelines to identify all neuropeptides encoded by genomes. While the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome is among the best-annotated genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adams et al., 2000</xref>), many genes - mainly those with small open reading frames - encode products with unknown functions. One such gene is <italic>CG14075</italic>. It is predicted to encode a product of 155 amino acids with no known or predicted domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gramates et al., 2022</xref>). Sequence analyses (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Materials &amp; Methods</xref>) revealed a predicted signal peptide (SP) in the amino (N)-terminus and polybasic sites in the central part of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Both are stereotypical features of neuropeptide precursors: the SP directs the peptide to the secretory pathway, while prohormone convertases typically recognize the identified basic residue motifs for proteolytic processing, a critical step in the generation of functional bioactive peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Pauls et al., 2014</xref>). These features strongly suggest that <italic>CG14075</italic> encodes an uncharacterized peptide which, given its expression in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Li et al., 2022</xref>), could act as a novel neuropeptide regulating behavior.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>mmt/CG14075</italic> is necessary and sufficient to alter protein feeding</title><p id="P7">To address the putative functions of <italic>CG14075</italic>, we generated a knock-out allele using CRISPR-Cas9-based genome engineering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Materials &amp; Methods</xref>). More specifically, we used two single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to generate a double cut in the genome upstream and downstream of the <italic>CG14075</italic> coding sequence, leading to the replacement (and hence deletion) of the entire open reading frame of <italic>CG14075</italic> by an attP landing site via homologous recombination. We, therefore, generated a null allele of <italic>CG14075</italic> while allowing for later insertions of transgenes in the <italic>CG14075</italic> locus.</p><p id="P8">Given that neuropeptides play essential roles in controlling food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Andermann &amp; Lowell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lin et al., 2019</xref>), we decided to test for phenotypes in feeding behavior and food choice using the flyPAD technology, a capacitance-based setup for testing independent changes in protein and carbohydrate feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Itskov et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, when given a choice to eat from a protein (yeast) or carbohydrate (sucrose) food source, fully fed <italic>CG14075</italic> mutant female flies showed a significant increase in protein feeding when compared to control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), while sucrose feeding was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We confirmed this phenotype using a video-tracking foraging setup allowing us to quantify the feeding behavior of flies in an arena containing protein and carbohydrate food spots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly to what we had observed using the flyPAD system, throughout the foraging assay, <italic>CG14075</italic> mutants showed a significantly longer total duration of micromovements (a proxy for feeding behavior) on yeast spots compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2a</xref>). Furthermore, we did not observe a phenotype for sucrose spots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2b</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>CG14075</italic> encodes a protein-specific satiety factor, whose loss leads to overconsumption of proteinaceous food. Given this phenotype, we named this gene <italic>marmite (mmt),</italic> referring to the vital source of protein appreciated in some cultures.</p><p id="P9">Neuropeptides are peptides expressed in neurons that play crucial roles in regulating behavior and physiology. To test if <italic>mmt</italic> acts as a neuropeptide, we assessed if neuron-specific knockdown of <italic>mmt</italic> was sufficient to phenocopy the effects of the <italic>mmt</italic> knock-out on protein appetite. Indeed, knocking down <italic>mmt</italic> specifically in the nervous system led to a strong increase in the number of sips on yeast, strengthening the idea that it encodes a neuropeptide regulating protein appetite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3</xref>). If <italic>mmt</italic> encodes a neuropeptide mediating protein-specific satiety, overexpressing it should reduce protein appetite. This effect should be more prominent in females deprived of an eAA as these show a high protein appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Ribeiro &amp; Dickson, 2010</xref>). Indeed, neuronal overexpression of <italic>mmt</italic> in mated females deprived of the eAA Isoleucine (Ile) led to a significant decrease in the number of sips on yeast when compared to control Ile-deprived females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). These data lend further support to the idea that Mmt acts as a satiety signal dedicated to specifically reducing protein intake. Given this role, we would expect that its expression could be modulated by the AA state of the animal, which is a crucial signal controlling protein appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Henriques et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Steck et al., 2018</xref>). We, therefore, compared mRNA expression levels of <italic>mmt</italic> in heads of flies kept on either a complete diet or a diet lacking Ile. In agreement with a role in linking AA state to protein satiety, Ile deprivation led to a decrease in <italic>mmt</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). These results strongly suggest that <italic>mmt</italic> encodes a neuropeptide whose expression is regulated by the animal’s AA state and that it enables the fly to alter protein appetite according to its nutritional needs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>mmt</italic> is sparsely expressed in the nervous system</title><p id="P10">Neuropeptides are usually expressed by specific, specialized, and sparsely distributed neurosecretory neurons. To identify the neurons expressing the Mmt peptide, we first used a custom-generated polyclonal antibody to visualize the distribution of the peptide in the nervous system. Mmt was sparsely expressed in the central nervous system, labeling 28 cell bodies in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a and 2e</xref>). Cell bodies could be found in the Subesophageal Zone (SEZ), the Posterior Ventrolateral Protocerebrum (PVP), the Lateral Horn (LH), and the Superior Medial Protocerebrum (SMP). Mmt was also expressed in 8 neurons in the Ventral Nerve Cord (VNC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4a</xref>). Importantly, in <italic>mmt</italic> mutant animals, most of the staining was abolished, validating both the loss of function nature of the mutant as well as the high specificity of the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Additionally, to gain genetic access to the neurons expressing <italic>mmt</italic>, we took advantage of the landing site inserted into the <italic>mmt</italic> locus in the null allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>) and generated a knock-in allele with a <italic>Gal4</italic> inserted in the <italic>mmt</italic> locus (<italic>mmt</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 5</xref>). The expression of the <italic>Gal4</italic> should therefore mimic the endogenous expression of <italic>mmt</italic>. Accordingly, mCD8::GFP driven by <italic>mmt</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic> was expressed in neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>) and the VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). To validate that the <italic>mmt</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic> line faithfully recapitulates endogenous <italic>mmt</italic> expression, we visualized Mmt peptide expression in brains of flies in which <italic>mmt</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic> drove mCD8::GFP expression. Quantification of 9 brains revealed that the large majority of neurons (23±2) expressed both GFP and Mmt, with a small minority (5±1) expressing only the Mmt peptide and almost none being labeled by the Gal4 line and not the antibody (2±1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P12">One of the most prominent labeled neurons was a pair of neurons with large somata in the medial part of the brain, which we named Medial Marmite Neurons (MMNs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c and f</xref>). Upon close inspection, we could observe strong Mmt labeling in varicosity-like structures in the projections of these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). This staining pattern in the projections is compatible with Mmt being packed in vesicles, corroborating the idea that Mmt is a secreted neuropeptide.</p><p id="P13">Together, our data shows that Mmt is sparsely expressed in the central nervous system of the fly. In general, Mmt neurons have large cell bodies, which are a hallmark of neurosecretory cells. Given that we also observed Mmt labeling in varicosity-like structures within neuronal projections, our neuroanatomical analysis further supports the conclusion that <italic>mmt</italic> encodes a secreted neuropeptide.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title><italic>mmt</italic>-expressing neurons modulate protein feeding</title><p id="P14">Given the function of <italic>mmt</italic>, we hypothesized that changing the activity of neurons expressing the peptide should also lead to specific changes in feeding. We, therefore, took advantage of <italic>mmt</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic> to activate these peptidergic neurons using the temperature-sensitive cation channel TrpA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>). Since we expected this would reduce protein feeding, we decided to do this manipulation in Ile-deprived animals.</p><p id="P15">Consistent with previous results using <italic>mmt</italic> overexpression, activation of <italic>mmt</italic>-expressing neurons led to a decrease in the number of sips on yeast when compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Given our results, it is likely that the neuronal activation effect on feeding is due to an increase in Mmt release in response to neuronal activation. To show that the <italic>mmt</italic> gene product mediates this effect, we decided to compare the effect of the neuronal activation experiment in an <italic>mmt</italic> expressing (while still being hemizygous as <italic>mmt</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic> is an <italic>mmt</italic> null allele) and an <italic>mmt</italic>-null background. Importantly, <italic>mmt</italic> null mutants showed an increase in yeast feeding when compared to hemizygous controls, confirming the reproducibility of the <italic>mmt</italic> phenotype in a different genetic background and nutritional condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 7</xref>). This effect was even clearer when focusing on the top half of the distribution (high eaters) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). This fits the rationale that flies with a low level of feeding would be less sensitive to the manipulation as they would already be subjected to a satiation signal. Importantly, whereas activation of <italic>mmt</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic> in a control condition led to a significant decrease in yeast intake, the same activation in an <italic>mmt</italic> mutant background had no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 7</xref>). These data show that the reduction in protein feeding observed upon activating <italic>mmt</italic> neurons is dependent on Mmt.</p><p id="P16">We have shown that <italic>mmt</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic> labels 25 neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c and e</xref>). For multiple neuropeptides and neuromodulators, careful neurogenetic dissection has shown that it is possible to attribute specific behavioral functions to subsets of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Waddell, 2013</xref>). We, therefore, set out to test if we could identify a subset of <italic>mmt</italic> neurons mediating the yeast satiety effect. We identified a driver line from the Vienna Tile (VT) collection (VT013947) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Tirian &amp; Dickson, 2017</xref>) whose expression pattern comprises a pair of neurons that resembles the Medial Marmite Neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c and 2c</xref>).

However, the entire repertoire of conserved neuropeptides is yet to be discovered as these are notoriously known to be highly divergent at the sequence level (Rajan &amp; Perrimon, 2012). To understand the molecular evolutionary history of Mmt and gain further insight into possible critical residues, we first aligned it with Mmt-like proteins from other <italic>Drosophila</italic> and closely related insect species. Not surprisingly, we observed relatively poor amino-acid conservation across the protein sequence, with the notable exception of a conserved motif corresponding to four cysteine residues in the carboxy (C)-terminus of the prepropeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

Using this motif, which we named the Marmite domain, and filtering hits for those predicted to also encode a signal peptide and have a similar length (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Materials &amp; Methods</xref>), we found a group of proteins in several vertebrate species corresponding to the peptide precursor (prepropeptide) of neuropeptide B (NPB), a known vertebrate neuropeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brezillon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Fujii et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

Our sequence analysis suggests that <italic>NPW</italic> has likely duplicated from an <italic>NPB</italic>-like ancestral gene.

Even though we did not find examples of Mmt-like sequences in some major clades (such as Platyhelminthes), the most parsimonious interpretation of these results is that an <italic>mmt</italic>-like gene must have been present in the last common ancestor of all bilaterians.</p><p id="P21">To rule out that the identified relationship between Mmt and NPB neuropeptides is spurious and/or both peptide families are part of an even larger family, we performed further relaxed sequence searches for other proteins with any resemblance to the identified Mmt/NPB C-terminal motif, retaining those hits that satisfied the criteria of being a putatively secreted protein in the hundred-AA-length range. This search identified insect members of a Chitin Binding Protein (CBP) family, which comprises chitinases and peritrophic matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Shen &amp; Jacobs-Lorena, 1999</xref>).

However, two major pieces of evidence indicate that Mmt/NPB are part of a distinct family of proteins: first, CBP proteins are characterized by a 6-cysteine motif instead of the 4-cysteine motif found in Mmt/NPB, and a few highly conserved aromatic residues (notably at position -3 before cysteine 3, and position 6 after cysteine 4), none of which are present in Mmt/NPB precursors. Second, whereas a minority of predicted CBP proteins have 4 cysteines (e.g., CG14300 in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>), their sequence otherwise aligns well with the other CBPs (hence their detectability as CBPs in PFAM domain searches), which is not the case of Mmt/NPB precursors. Consistent with this, phylogenetic analysis showed that Mmt-like sequences and the vertebrate NPB and NPW form a separate cluster from CBP proteins, including those containing only 4-cysteines, supporting our finding that Mmt, NPB and NPW are part of a new, ancient, and conserved neuropeptide family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).

A variety of neuronal and peripheral signals induced by the lack (“hunger” signals) or sufficiency (“satiety” signals) of nutrients have been identified in animals, including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and most of these signals correspond to neuropeptides and peptide hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Andermann &amp; Lowell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Itskov &amp; Ribeiro, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lin et al., 2019</xref>).

Other examples of satiety factors, such as FIT, MIP, DSK and Upd1, have also been described to limit food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Beshel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Carvalho-Santos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Min et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Söderberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). While most studies focus on general satiety states, few nutrient-specific satiety signals are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Münch et al., 2020</xref>). Our data suggest that Mmt functions as a protein-specific satiety signal in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. <italic>mmt</italic> mutants overconsume protein-rich food (yeast), while having no apparent phenotype for sucrose consumption, thus suggesting that the absence of <italic>mmt</italic> has a specific effect on protein but not carbohydrate appetite. This is supported by our observation that neuronal overexpression of <italic>mmt</italic> reduced yeast feeding, even in the context of eAA deprivation when flies have a strong drive to eat yeast. A third observation supporting this idea is that <italic>mmt</italic> expression is higher in fully-fed flies when compared to flies deprived of Ile. These data strongly support the idea that Mmt transforms the AA state of the fly into a neuronal signal which is then used to control protein intake. The discovery of <italic>mmt</italic> provides an opportunity to study important questions about feeding and protein homeostasis regulation. These include how internal AA availability is transformed into changes in <italic>mmt</italic> expression, what is the mature form of the processed Mmt peptide altering protein intake, and what is the receptor and concomitantly the target cells through which Mmt changes food choice. Additionally, animals have several satiety and hunger signals, some of which are nutrient-specific and some likely to control bulk food intake independently of the macronutrient content of the food. Once we have identified all the main players controlling nutrient homeostasis, a crucial but challenging task for the field will be to understand how Mmt signaling intersects with other neuronal and peripheral signals to fine-tune nutrient homeostasis across a wide range of states and temporal scales.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title><italic>mmt</italic>-expressing neurons also play a role in protein appetite</title><p id="P27">Most <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuropeptides are produced in a small subset of neurons or neuroendocrine cells.

Visualization of the peptide distribution using a custom-made Mmt antibody and membrane-targeted GFP expression driven by <italic>mmt</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic> showed that the peptide is produced in a few neurons with large cell bodies and vesicle-like structures in their projections. These features further support that <italic>mmt</italic> encodes a secreted neuropeptide. Similar to what has been observed with other neuropeptidergic neurons, the behavioral effect of genetically manipulating the peptide gene can be partially mimicked by manipulating neuronal activity: thermogenetic activation of <italic>mmt</italic>-expressing neurons led to a reduction in protein feeding while inhibiting their activity led to the opposite effect. Importantly, this effect was abolished in an <italic>mmt</italic> mutant background. This shows that while these neurons might express other neuropeptides and neuromodulators, their effect on protein appetite is mediated by Mmt. Furthermore, these data suggest that the action of Mmt is regulated at multiple levels, including the regulation of <italic>mmt</italic> expression by the AA state of the animal, as well as the regulation of neuronal activity and neuropeptide secretion. This also explains why the effect of neuronal activation and inhibition were sometimes subtler than those observed when manipulating the gene.

The identification of MMNs as important mediators of protein-specific satiety will allow a focused dissection and identification of downstream circuits controlling protein appetite. These results also suggest that the other <italic>mmt</italic>-expressing neurons and, therefore, also Mmt, might exert further regulatory roles beyond controlling protein appetite.

Thus, it is not surprising that some neuropeptides have maintained similar sequences and functions, and that orthologues are found among different taxa. However, due to their small size and the conservation of only a few critical residues in most cases, establishing evolutionary relationships based on sequence queries has been challenging. Mmt and Mmt-like gene products in related insect species share a fully conserved motif of four cysteines in the C-terminal part of the protein (Marmite domain). This domain, together with the size range of the proteins and the presence of a signal peptide, led us to identify a group of vertebrate gene products with similar features, which corresponded to the NPB prepropeptide. Once processed, this previously characterized neuropeptide is very similar to NPW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chottova Dvorakova, 2018</xref>). However, the prepropeptide of NPW, does not have the Marmite Domain. This could suggest that the precursor of NPW originated from a duplication of an NPB-like ancestral and its C-terminus diverged after that. Hence, even though the NPW prepropeptides have lost the Marmite domain, they share a common ancestor with Mmt and NPB prepropeptides. Moreover, we found Mmt/NPB-like sequences in other non-vertebrate taxa, strongly suggesting that the Mmt neuropeptide family is ancient and was already present in the common ancestor of all bilaterians.</p><p id="P30">Almost all members of the Marmite neuropeptide family have the Marmite domain. In general, this domain is by far the most strongly conserved portion of all members of the Marmite neuropeptide family (except NPW). Considering all of this evidence, we conclude that the Marmite domain is unique and most likely originates from evolutionarily-related genes with a separate evolutionary history from CBP-encoding genes, at least since the evolution of Bilateria. This raises the question of what could be the function of this domain. Prepropeptides often encode multiple peptides with different biological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Jékely et al., 2018</xref>).

While we observed a similar feeding phenotype upon <italic>NPB</italic> and <italic>mmt</italic> overexpression in the VMH, the fact that we observed a gain of feeding in mice and a reduction in feeding in flies might be interpreted as contradictory. However, it is important to note that this could be due to the complexities of NPB action or differences in the physiological role of NPB signaling in vertebrates and invertebrates. As indicated by the seemingly contradictory results in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Samson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>), the mode of action of NPB might be complex.

In this sense, it is intriguing that we observe that <italic>mmt</italic> has a protein-specific effect in flies. If this is the case for vertebrates, then the animal’s exact protein, reproductive and microbiome states, and the protein content of the food might be important variables to be considered when interpreting specific effects of manipulating NPB.

Nevertheless, the fact that both NPB and Mmt elicit the same effect in mice suggests that their biological activity is related. Our results indicate that a thorough understanding of how NPB and NPW act in the vertebrate brain will require a careful molecular and circuit dissection in the context of precisely controlled conditions, with specific attention to the protein content of the tested food. The ability to design parallel experiments in invertebrates and vertebrates should expedite such a functional understanding, be it at the level of inspiration or by using the strength of different organisms when deciding where to perform which experiment.

We hope that our discovery of <italic>mmt</italic> and the Marmite neuropeptide family is an inspiration for further digging in the gold mine that is the genome and biology of this organism. This is especially the case for molecules that help the animal manage deviations in homeostasis. It is likely that many fascinating and important molecular mechanisms will only reveal their existence and function when the animal is specifically perturbed or when using careful phenotypic analysis, as is required when studying behavior. From many existing regulatory systems controlling brain function, neuropeptides remain among the most difficult to probe. Their small size makes them difficult to discover, their multilayered regulatory mechanisms challenging to manipulate, and their mode of function difficult to parse. It is clear that we still lack tools and generalizable strategies to dissect neuropeptide function efficiently in animals. Nevertheless, their importance in regulating animal behavior and physiology makes them key players in understanding organismal function in health and disease. Advancing our understanding of these molecules should therefore be a top priority. Multi-phyla approaches have been vital in advancing our understanding of molecular processes from development to brain function. The advent of sophisticated molecular, neuronal, and genetic manipulation methods and the ability to use these in a vast repertoire of organisms make such comparative multi-phyla approaches feasible and more relevant than ever. Identifying new peptides such as Mmt, and dissecting their evolutionary relationship and mode of function is likely to be a fruitful, impactful, and fascinating research avenue for many years to come.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S16"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> rearing, media, and dietary treatments</title><p id="P35">Flies were reared on yeast-based medium (YBM) (per liter of water: 8 g agar [NZYTech, PT], 80 g barley malt syrup [Próvida, PT], 22 g sugar beet syrup [Grafschafter, DE], 80 g corn flour [Próvida, PT], 10 g soya flour [A.
