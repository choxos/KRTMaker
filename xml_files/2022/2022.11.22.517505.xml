However, some drug metabolites can reach high plasma concentrations and display relevant in vivo activity, which can be distinct from its parent drug. Here, we use computational and experimental methods to comprehensively characterise the kinase polypharmacology of M324, the major metabolite of the FDA-approved PARP inhibitor rucaparib. We experimentally demonstrate that M324 displays a distinct in vitro kinome profile from its parent drug, characterized by potent in vitro inhibition of GSK3A and PLK2 at clinically-relevant concentrations. These confirmed kinase activities of M324 could have potential implications for the efficacy and safety of rucaparib and therefore warrant further clinical investigation. The study reported here highlights the importance of thoroughly characterizing the activity of significant drug metabolites to better understanding drug responses in the clinic and maximally exploit the current drug arsenal in personalized and precision medicine.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Small molecule drugs administered orally are normally metabolized through various proteins (e.g., cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes in the liver) that catalyse distinct chemical modifications aimed at increasing aqueous solubility to facilitate excretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fura, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Guengerich, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Zhang and Tang, 2018</xref>). Accordingly, drug metabolites often show lower cellular permeability and plasma concentration than their parent drugs, preventing them from displaying relevant <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fura, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Zhang and Tang, 2018</xref>). Nonetheless, certain drug metabolites are present at high plasma concentrations and can permeate inside human cells or interact with membrane receptors to display cellular activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fura, 2006</xref>). In addition, the chemical modifications performed on drug metabolites can profoundly alter their interaction with human proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fura, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Walther et al., 2017</xref>). In these cases, metabolites can have a distinct biological activity than their parent drugs, which can have implications for both <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy and safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Baillie and Rettie, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Bender et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the simultaneous presence of active metabolites and parent drugs in the body could even synergize to produce either positive or detrimental effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fura, 2006</xref>). Unfortunately, drug metabolites are rarely characterized comprehensively in preclinical models, are often not commercially available to facilitate testing by the wide scientific community, and their protein binding activity is often overlooked in drug development, particularly beyond the known targets of their parent drug. As any other small molecule, drug metabolites can interact with multiple protein targets simultaneously, a behaviour termed polypharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Anighoro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Bolognesi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hopkins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kabir and Muth, 2022</xref>). Therefore, systematically characterizing the polypharmacology of cell-permeable drug metabolites that are present at high concentrations could help clarify the unexplained clinical activity of drugs, open new repurposing opportunities and help tailor drugs to patients.</p><p id="P3">Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) inhibitors are an established class of targeted, small-molecule drugs approved for various types of cancers displaying alterations in DNA repair genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Mateo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Rose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Sinha et al., 2021</xref>). Thus far, four PARP1 inhibitors (olaparib, rucaparib, talazoparib, and niraparib) have been approved by the FDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antolin et al., 2020</xref>). When analyzing the chemical structures of PARP1 drugs it becomes apparent that all approved PARP1 inhibitors share a common benzamide substructure (either a primary amide or a cyclic lactam, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), which mimics the nicotinamide moiety of PARP1’s substrate NAD<sup>+</sup> to form a hydrogen bond network with critical amino acid residues in the binding site (Ser904 and Gly863), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> (bottom). Moreover, the aromatic ring system where the benzamide group is attached forms a π-π stacking interaction with residue Tyr907 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Ferraris, 2010</xref>). Given these conserved interactions, FDA-approved PARP inhibitors share a similar profile against PARP enzyme family members, displaying low selectivity between PARP isoforms 1-3, and showing modest activity against other PARP family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antolin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Thorsell et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, current PARP inhibitors share many side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antolin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">LaFargue et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sandhu et al., 2022</xref>) which can be attributed to a comparable inhibitory interaction with PARP enzymes. However, it has also been reported that there are some unique side effects specific to each PARP inhibitor that cannot be explained by their similar selectivity profiles against PARP enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antolin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">LaFargue et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Despite their conserved interactions, all FDA-approved PARP1 drugs have a unique chemical structure with a different core and substituents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Our group, alongside others, has recently used computational and experimental methods to uncover that the unique chemical structure of each approved PARP inhibitor translates into different polypharmacology profiles across the human kinome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antolin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Knezevic et al., 2016</xref>). Whilst olaparib and talazoparib are unlikely to modulate kinase activity at relevant concentrations (10 μM), niraparib and rucaparib showed significant kinase polypharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antolin et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, rucaparib exhibited submicromolar <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against DYRK1B, CDK16, and PIM3, whereas niraparib potently inhibited DYRK1A and DYRK1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antolin et al., 2020</xref>). The systematic kinome-wide polypharmacology profiling enabled us to link some of the differential side effects observed between PARP inhibitors to their different kinase off-target activities. For example, unique PIM3 inhibition by rucaparib could explain the increased cholesterol levels observed in some patients taking this drug, which have not been observed with other PARP inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antolin et al., 2020</xref>). However, many differential side effects between PARP inhibitors remain unexplained, such as the increased number of cardiac adverse drug reactions, including arrhythmias, observed in patients taking rucaparib that are not observed with olaparib or talazoparib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sandhu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In general, rucaparib has a low metabolic turnover rate in human liver microsomes and <italic>in vitro</italic> metabolite profiling shows that rucaparib is metabolized predominantly by CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2016/209115Orig1s000MultiDisciplineR.pdf">https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2016/209115Orig1s000MultiDisciplineR.pdf</ext-link>). The phase I oxidative deamination reaction catalyzed by CYP450-related enzymes results in the conversion of rucaparib to its major metabolite M324, a carboxylic acid, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>) which can be detected in several species, including mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Liao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Murray et al., 2014</xref>). In animal models (Capan-1 tumour-bearing mice), pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that M324 can reach higher concentrations in plasma than the parent drug but with lower concentration inside the tumour cells. Still, M324 was able to reach single digit micromolar concentrations inside mice tumour cells and was still detectable two days after oral administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Murray et al., 2014</xref>). In humans, after giving a single oral dose of 600 mg [<sup>14</sup>C]-rucaparib to patients with advanced solid tumours, M324 was the major detectable metabolite in plasma with a concentration up to ~ 40% of rucaparib’s concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Liao et al., 2020</xref>). Although a study reported that M324 showed limited cellular enzyme activity against PARP1 in intact human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Murray et al., 2014</xref>) and it has been reported to be “at least 30 fold less potent than rucaparib against PARP1-3” <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/rubraca-epar-product-information_en.pdf">https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/rubraca-epar-product-information_en.pdf</ext-link>), the micromolar concentrations that M324 can reach inside mice tumours demonstrates its capacity to permeate inside cells. Therefore, its potential pharmacological activity, particularly beyond the PARP enzyme family, warrants further investigation and could help explain the unique clinical activity of rucaparib and facilitate its precise and personalized use.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we have comprehensively characterized the kinase off-target profile of the M324 metabolite. We firstly characterized its kinome profile using computational approaches followed by experimental validation. Our computational results confirmed our hypothesis that M324 and its parent drug have differential kinase polypharmacology landscapes that could have implications for the clinical efficacy and safety of rucaparib. We then synthesized M324 via one-step Suzuki cross-coupling reaction and experimentally tested the predicted kinase activities. The detailed results are reported here.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Chemical synthesis of the major metabolite M324</title><p id="P7">Most drugs are readily available for purchase from chemical vendors. Unfortunately, most drug metabolites are absent from vendor catalogues, limiting their experimental study and characterization by the wider scientific community. Accordingly, we first synthesized this metabolite via one-step Suzuki cross-coupling reaction starting with two available reagents (2-bromo-8-fluoro-4,5-dihydro-1H-azepino[5,4,3-cd]indol-6(3H)-one and 4-boronobenzoic acid), as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>. The resulting product was purified and obtained as a greenish solid (71% yield). The chemical structure of the compound has been confirmed by NMR and was ≥ 95% pure by HPLC/MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1-S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Kinase polpyharmacological profiles predicted using different computational approaches</title><p id="P8">Various computational methodologies have been developed for polypharmacology prediction based on integrating public bioactivity data from different sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Cereto-Massague et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lavecchia and Cerchia, 2016</xref>). In this study, we employed four different <italic>in silico</italic> approaches, covering both ligand- and structure-based methods, to predict potential kinase off-targets of rucaparib and M324, namely: (1) the six independent ligand-based methods integrated in the CLARITY platform developed by Chemotargets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Vidal et al., 2011</xref>); (2) the similarity ensemble approach (SEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Lounkine et al., 2012</xref>), a web-based tool to conduct target prediction based on chemical similarity; (3) the polypharmacology browser PPB2 incorporating different models (e.g. fingerprint comparison, machine learning or deep learning) to predict potential targets for compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Awale and Reymond, 2019</xref>); (4) GalaxySagittarius software which integrates ligand- and structure-based approaches to derive target hypothesis for a query compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). The results of the computational methods concerning only human protein kinases are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> (and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Tables S1–S4</xref>).</p><p id="P9">In total, 75 and 56 kinases were predicted to be potential kinase off-targets for rucaparib and its major metabolite, respectively. Most of the kinase predictions for both compounds are derived from GalaxySagittarius (66 kinases predicted for rucaparib and 39 for M324), followed by PPB2 with 13 and 19 kinases for the drug and the metabolite, respectively. CLARITY and SEA predicted fewer than 10 kinases for both compounds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Tables S1–S4</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> provides a network overview of the computational results which connects the predicted kinase targets with either rucaparib or M324. As expected, these two compounds with highly structural similarity have many overlapping predicted kinases (38 green nodes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). However, there are also many kinases that are only predicted to bind to the drug or the metabolite: 37 kinases (blue nodes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) are exclusively predicted for rucaparib and 18 kinases (yellow nodes) for M324. From the predicted compound-kinase network, we hypothesized that M324 could be modulating several unique kinases from those modulated by rucaparib. This different polypharmacology profile could help us rationalize the unique rucaparib-associated side effects observed in the clinic as compared to other PARP inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>In vitro kinome profiling confirms differential polypharmacology between rucaparib and M324</title><p id="P10">In order to confirm the computational predictions, we decided to experimentally evaluate the kinome activity of the metabolite M324. We had previously characterized the kinome profile of rucaparib at 10 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antolin et al., 2020</xref>) and identified 50 kinase off-target hits which were broadly distributed across different kinase groups, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> (left). These experimental kinome results enable us to assess the performance of the computational methods: only nine out of 75 predicted kinases for rucaparib (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table1</xref>) were correctly predicted; all from the GalaxySagittrarius method. The other three methods (CLARITY, SEA, and PPB2) only correctly predicted PIM1 and DYRK1A, which had already been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Antolin and Mestres, 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P11">For the experimental kinome profiling of M324, we used Reaction Biology’s HotSpot platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reactionbiology.com">http://www.reactionbiology.com</ext-link>), that measures the inhibition of the incorporation of radiolabelled phosphate into the protein substrate to directly obtain the kinase catalytic activity (<bold>STAR Methods</bold>). The kinome screening results across 370 human kinases are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> (right) (and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S5</xref>). A percentage of inhibition ≥ 50% at 10 μM concentration was set as a threshold to consider potential kinase off-targets as hits. Using this cut-off, 28 kinases were identified as off-targets for M324. Although the hits were widely distributed across the kinome tree, most of the kinases were weakly inhibited (indicated by small red circles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The comparison between experimental and predicted kinase off-targets shows that nine kinases were correctly predicted for M324 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), six of which from GalaxySagittrarius (AURKA, PIM1, CSNK2A2, GSK3B, MAPKAPK3, and CSNK1G3). CLARITY, SEA and PPB2 correctly predicted two (AURKA and GSK3A), two (MAPKAPK3 and PASK) and three kinases (PIM1, CSNK1D, and GSK3B), respectively.</p><p id="P12">Next, we explored the overlapping kinases between rucaparib and M324. Due to the different kinase coverage between the screening platforms used, seven kinase off-targets for rucaparib were not tested for M324, and five kinases that were weakly inhibited by M324 had not been tested for rucaparib, as shown by small white circles on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. Excluding the assay discrepancies, eight kinases were confirmed to be inhibited by both compounds but with significant differences in the level of inhibition. For example, rucaparib showed ~ 98% inhibition against MYLK4, whereas M324 only showed ~ 70% inhibition.</p><p id="P13">Overall, the comparison between these two kinome trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) confirms the computational prediction that rucaparib and M324 display a different kinase polypharmacology profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Specifically, rucaparib is more promiscuous than its major metabolite and strongly inhibits kinases in CMGC and CMAK groups. In contrast, M324 has a more limited number of potently inhibited kinases which are mainly distributed in the CK1 and CMGC groups.</p><p id="P14">In summary, we experimentally confirmed that rucaparib and M324 display differential polypharmacology profiles across the kinome. Due to the clinical importance of rucaparib for cancer patients, we decided to experimentally characterize these differential kinases further.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Confirmation of submicromolar in vitro kinase activity of M324</title><p id="P15">We selected the four kinases inhibited by M324 by more than 90% (green circles on the right of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) – namely CSNK1E, GSK3A, GSK3B, and PLK2 – for further analysis. These four kinases belong to three different kinase families. Prior to the measurement of IC<sub>50</sub> values, we tested rucaparib and M324 against these four kinases using the same catalytic inhibition assay provided by Reaction Biology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reactionbiology.com">http://www.reactionbiology.com</ext-link>) at 1 μM concentration. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S6</xref>), M324 did not inhibit CSNK1E at 1 μM concentration (inactive), despite the potent inhibition detected at 10 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S5</xref>). M324 maintained its strong inhibition against GSK3A and PLK2 (&lt; 50% remaining enzyme activity) and inhibited GSK3B, albeit more weakly (63.14% of remaining enzyme activity, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Rucaparib only strongly inhibited GSK3B, showing weak or no activity against the other three targets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S6</xref>). These results further confirmed the different kinase off-target profiles between rucaparib and M324, with the latter showing much more potent inhibition against GSK3A and PLK2 than rucaparib.</p><p id="P16">For completeness, we also explored the activity of the metabolite across members of the PARP enzyme family (<bold>STAR Methods</bold>). The metabolite shows 100% inhibition for PARP1-2 and TNKS1-2 at 10 μM concentration, and weaker inhibition for several other PARP family members, a profile that is very similar to that of rucaparib (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S7-8</xref>). This similarity between both profiles across the PARP family prompted us to continue focusing on kinases to identify the main differences between the pharmacology of M324 and rucaparib.</p><p id="P17">Accordingly, we measured the <italic>in vitro</italic> IC<sub>50</sub> values of the three kinase targets (GSK3A, GSK3B, and PLK2) that were potently inhibited by M324 or rucaparib (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).

Given the reports that M324 can permeate inside cells in animal models and reach micromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Murray et al., 2014</xref>), it was important to explore if these activities on isolated proteins could translate into meaningful intracellular target modulation.

Therefore, PLK2 has not been comprehensively explored in medicinal chemistry projects. Taking the resolution of the resolved PLK2 complex and the molecular size of the crystallized ligand into account, we decided to use PLK2 co-crystalized with BI 2536 (PDB ID: 4I5M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Aubele et al., 2013</xref>) as our docking template. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> (upper right panel), the predicted binding mode between M324 and PLK2 reveals several favourable interactions: (1) two hydrogen bonds between NHs in the M324 main scaffold and two cysteine residues (Cys67 and hinge residue Cys133) to stabilize the general binding confirmation; (2) the aromatic ring system on which fluorine is attached to form a π-π stacking interaction with residue Phe183; (3) multiple hydrogen-π interactions could be detected which were formed by residue Leu59 with the aromatic ring system of M324; (4) an electrostatic interaction. Interestingly, the negatively charged terminal carboxylic acid of M324 was favourably sandwiched between the two positively charged residues Lys57 and Arg136, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> (bottom right panel).</p><p id="P21">In contrast, the analysis of interactions between rucaparib and PLK2 (upper-left corner of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) uncovers a different pattern. Although a hydrogen bond (with hinge residue Ser134) and two hydrogen-π interactions (with residue Leu59) could be observed, the positively charged terminal amine group in rucaparib is unfavorably positioned in the environment where two positively charged residues (Lys57 and Arg136) are located – generating a repulsive electrostatic force. Therefore, the different charges of the terminal groups of rucaparib and M324 likely explain the variations of the docking conformations between the two compounds, as shown by the superposed poses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> (bottom left panel). These distinct predicted interactions between rucaparib and M324 likely explain the significant difference in potency against PLK2 resulting from the structural conversion of an amine group to a carboxylic acid. Secondly, we analyzed the putative binding modes for both compounds in GSK3B. Rucaparib exhibits superior GSK3B inhibition (~ 65 % inhibition at 1 μM concentration), nearly two-fold stronger than M324 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S6</xref>), although both compounds are active. For the docking analysis, we selected the GSK3B protein structure co-crystallized with the potent ATP-competitive inhibitor alsterpaullone (PDB ID: 1Q3W) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Bertrand et al., 2003</xref>) which shares several common structural features with rucaparib. The chemical structures of alsterpaullone and rucaparib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), contain a 7-membered ring with a lactone introduced in a tricyclic or tetracyclic system, which greatly contributes to their individual binding behaviors: the lactone in rucaparib interacts with two critical residues Ser904 and Gly863 in PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), whereas the amide moiety in alsterpaullone forms chelated hydrogen bonds with the hinge residue Val135 in GSK3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7a</xref>). However, the different position of the lactone in alsterpaullone and rucaparib implies that rucaparib might adopt a different binding confirmation to better fit into the pocket and interact with the hinge residues of GSK3B. Indeed, unlike in alsterpaullone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7a</xref>), in the best docking pose of rucaparib in GSK3B, its amide could not form hydrogen bonds with hinge residue Val135 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7b</xref>). Instead, it showed a flipped conformation with the main scaffold containing the lactone buried into the deep ATP-binding pocket to form a hydrogen bond with residue Lys85, and the terminal moiety (the secondary amine group of rucaparib) forming two hydrogen bonds with Val135 and Pro136. The conversion of the secondary amine group to the carboxylic acid in M324 results in the loss of the hydrogen bonding network with the hinge residues, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7b</xref> (right). Instead, the carboxylic acid only forms one hydrogen bond with residue Tyr134. In general, the flipped lactone group could explain why both rucaparib and M324 show weaker inhibition against GSK3B in comparison with alsterpaullone. In addition, the absence of the hydrogen bond network with hinge residues observed in M324’s best predicted pose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7b</xref>) could further support why this metabolite exhibits lower inhibitory activity against GSK3B than its parent drug.</p><p id="P22">Taken together, for PLK2 and GSK3B, the docking analysis provides plausible explanations to rationalize the observed differential activity profiles between rucaparib and its main metabolite and help in the future design of more potent multi-target PARP-kinase inhibitors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">In this study, we systematically characterized the kinome profile of M324, the major metabolite of the PARP1 inhibitor rucaparib, using computational methods coupled with <italic>in vitro</italic> and cellular experimental validation.</p><p id="P24">The polypharmacology of drug metabolites is seldom comprehensively characterized during drug discovery and development. One of the key limitations currently hampering the study of many drug metabolites is their lack of commercial availability. Accordingly, we first synthesized the metabolite via one-step Suzuki cross-coupling reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The initial <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of kinase off-target profiles suggested that the metabolite was less promiscuous than its parent drug with 56 kinases predicted for M324 and 75 kinases for rucaparib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S1-S4</xref>). However, both compounds had a significant number of distinct predicted kinases, suggesting that M324 could exhibit differential kinome polypharmacology compared to its parent drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Comprehensive biochemical validation, including enzyme activity measurements at 1 and 10 μM concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S5, S6</xref>), as well as concentration-response curves, confirmed that M324 displayed a unique kinase polypharmacology characterised by strong inhibition of GSK3A and PLK2 (IC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 600 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S9</xref>), none of which are potently inhibited by rucaparib (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). This contrasts with the similar profile of both compounds against PARP enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S7, S8</xref>). Moreover, the inhibition of these two kinases can be effectively translated into cellular activity, with M234 displaying single-digit micromolar binding to PLK2 (EC<sub>50</sub> = 5.08 μM) in intracellular target engagement assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S10</xref>). Overall, we demonstrate for the first time that the major metabolite of the PARP1 inhibitor rucaparib can potently inhibit kinases <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells. This potent inhibition of PLK2 could have implications for the clinical efficacy and safety of rucaparib and therefore warrants further investigation. Moreover, the different kinome profiles between rucaparib and its major metabolite highlights the importance of making drug metabolites more widely available and characterising them more thoroughly during drug discovery and development to comprehensively understand the therapeutic effects of drugs in the clinic and better tailor drugs to patients.</p><p id="P25">Computational methods to predict polypharmacology are in continuous development which greatly facilitates the target identification for small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Cereto-Massague et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lavecchia and Cerchia, 2016</xref>). We have previously used computational methods relying solely on chemical similarity and reported their strengths as well as their significant limitations in comprehensively identifying polypharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antolin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Antolin et al., 2021a</xref>). Here, we used four different approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Awale and Reymond, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Lounkine et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Vidal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Yang et al., 2020</xref>) including GalaxySagittarius, which uses protein structure information alongside chemical information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). GalaxySagittarius suggested dozens of kinases and showed the best recall, correctly predicting nine and six kinases for rucaparib and M324, respectively. For comparison, the other three methods provided two to three correct predictions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In addition to the different algorithms employed, the prediction discrepancy observed between different computational methods could be ascribed to the varying size of the protein target database and target family coverage that they exploit for polypharmacology prediction. GalaxySagittarius uses all human proteins with crystallographic structures deposited in the PDB database with a high proportion of protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we recommend the complementary use of different <italic>in silico</italic> approaches, particularly those using different data sources or training datasets, to provide the widest possible predictions of potential off-targets for any given compound to maximize recall.</p><p id="P26">The potent PLK2 inhibition of rucaparib’s metabolite could have clinical implications for both safety and efficacy. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, neither the free drug concentration of rucaparib or of its major metabolite have not been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antolin et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions but given that the reported, steady-state C<sub>max</sub> concentrations of rucaparib oscillate between 2-9 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">McCrudden et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that M324 could significantly inhibit PLK2 in humans (EC<sub>50</sub> = 5.08 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). Unfortunately, the physiological roles of PLK2 in health and disease have not been deeply studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>). Regarding the effect of inhibiting PLK2 on human safety, a recent report suggests that the loss of function of PLK2 kinase could induce cardiac fibrosis and promote atrial fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kunzel et al., 2021</xref>). We have recently shown that rucaparib has the highest frequency of reported cardiac adverse drug reactions, including arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sandhu et al., 2022</xref>) – a side effect that has not been reported with olaparib or with talazoparib. It is tempting to speculate that the unique inhibition of PLK2 by rucaparib’s metabolite could be contributing to this higher percentage of reported arrhythmias, although side effects can occur via multiple mechanisms, and it would be essential to confirm this hypothesis in clinical trials. If confirmed, these results could further support the use of alternative PARP inhibitors in patients with cardiac illnesses.</p><p id="P27">Regarding the potential effects of PLK2 inhibition in clinical efficacy, limited literature reports suggest PLK2 could be either an oncogene or a tumour suppressor depending on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Ou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>). Analysis of CRISPR and siRNA screens across large pan-cancer cell line panels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dwane et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Mitsopoulos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>) supports this view, uncovering a few cancer cell lines that are sensitive to PLK2 knockout, including non-small cell lung cancer and liver cancer models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S11</xref>). PLK2 inhibition could be beneficial for specific cancer subtypes and patients and detrimental for others. The potential benefits for liver cancer are particularly interesting as it has been reported that some liver cancers express cytochromes, and thus the conversion from rucaparib to M324 could occur directly inside liver cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Michael and Doherty, 2005</xref>), facilitating higher intracellular concentrations and activity of M324. Beyond oncology, PLK2 has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease that could potentially benefit from M324 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Weston et al., 2021</xref>). Overall, it is possible that PLK2 inhibition by M324 could have clinical implications for rucaparib’s efficacy and safety, both for cancer personalized medicine and for other indications, and this warrants further clinical investigation.</p><p id="P28">PLK2 has not been well explored in medicinal chemistry projects, as evidenced by the limited bioactivity data in ChEMBL database (version 30) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gaulton et al., 2017</xref>). The vast majority of reported PLK2 inhibitors are derived from PLK1 projects and are the derivatives of pan-PLK inhibitor BI 2536 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>), largely limiting the specific study of PLK2. There is no selective, high-quality PLK2 chemical probe recommended by the Chemical Probes Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.chemicalprobes.org/">https://www.chemicalprobes.org/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Antolin et al., 2022</xref>) and computational resources only identify a few selective inhibitors with modest potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Antolin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Antolin et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Zhan et al., 2018</xref>). In this work, we show that M324 displays very high kinase selectivity for PLK2 (showing more than 80% inhibition against only seven kinases not including PLK1 and PLK3 at 10 μM concentration, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S5</xref>). Moreover, we demonstrate that the metabolite inhibits PLK2 with sub-micromolar potency <italic>in vitro</italic> and with single-digit micromolar potency on intracellular target engagement assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, the M324 chemotype with its tricyclic ring scaffold could be an optimal starting point to develop PLK2-selective inhibitors. In addition, our docking studies provide a plausible binding mode between M324 and PLK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) that could guide the structure-based compound optimization towards developing much needed potent and selective PLK2 chemical probes.</p><p id="P29">Drugs often bind to more than one target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hu and Bajorath, 2014</xref>), and there is a growing interest in rationally designing multi-target inhibitors, including the simultaneous inhibition of PARP1 and other cancer-related targets (e.g., BRD4, PI3K, EZH2, and HDACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hu et al., 2022</xref>). However, the rational design of compounds active against several targets remains a non-trivial task, far from being routinely explored in drug discovery campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Li et al., 2021</xref>). It was recently shown that there is a strong synergistic effect between PARP1 and GSK3B inhibition through drug combination studies in colorectal cancer models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Our previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antolin et al., 2020</xref>) and current analyses suggest that rucaparib is the only approved PARP1 inhibitor exhibiting sub-micromolar inhibitory activity against GSK3B (65% of GSK3B inhibition at 1 μM concentration, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, rucaparib also represents a promising starting point for structural optimization to develop potent dual GSK3B-PARP inhibitors.</p><p id="P30">In conclusion, our computational and experimental analyses demonstrate that M324, the major metabolite of the PARP inhibitor rucaparib, displays a distinct kinome profile than its parent drug.

Therefore, these results question the preclinical study of drug action without the incorporation of abundant drug metabolites and could also open new avenues for the design of selective PLK2 inhibitors and dual PARP-kinase inhibitors. Overall, we show that drug metabolites can have different polypharmacology than their parent drugs and, therefore, they should be made more widely available and characterized more thoroughly for the benefit of personalized and precision medicine.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Procedure for the preparation of metabolite M324</title><p id="P31">To a solution of 2-bromo-8-fluoro-4,5-dihydro-1H-azepino[5,4,3-cd]indol-6(3H)-one (0.16 g, 0.57 mmol) in a mixture of toluene (15 ml) and ethanol (7.5 ml), sodium carbonate (0.15 g, 1.43 mmol), 4-boronobenzoic acid (0.14 g, 0.86 mmol) and water (0.4 mL) were added sequentially.

Dashed green and magenta lines indicate hydrogen bonds and hydrogen-π interactions, respectively. The superposed predicted binding conformations of M324 and rucaparib are displayed on the bottom left panel. As it can be observed, they adopt distinct conformations, with the amine of rucaparib moving away from the positive charges of Lys57 and Arg136. The bottom right panel shows the electrostatic surface map around the binding pocket of PLK2 kinase with the binding pose of M324. The surface is colored by electrostatic potential using a continuous spectrum from blue (most positive), through white (neutral) to red (most negative).

However, rucaparib is able to form one additional hydrogen bond compared with M324, which may explain why it is more potent than its metabolite.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS157608-f007"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>In silico and <italic>in vitro</italic> kinome profiling statistics for rucaparib and M324.</title><p>The number of kinases predicted using the four different computational methods used (see <bold>STAR methods</bold>) and the number of real kinase hits confirmed by experimental testing (≤ 50% kinase activity at 10 μM threshold) are shown for both rucaparib and M324.
