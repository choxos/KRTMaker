Its high pathogenicity is due to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) contacting host-cell receptors. A critical hallmark of COVID-19 is the occurrence of coagulopathies. Here, we report the direct observation of the interactions between S protein and platelets. Live imaging showed that the S protein triggers platelets to deform dynamically, in some cases, leading to their irreversible activation. Strikingly, cellular cryo-electron tomography revealed dense decorations of S protein on the platelet surface, inducing filopodia formation. Hypothesizing that S protein binds to filopodia-inducing integrin receptors, we tested the binding to RGD motif-recognizing platelet integrins and found that S protein recognizes integrin α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>. Our results infer that the stochastic activation of platelets is due to weak interactions of S protein with integrin, which can attribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the occurrence of rare but severe coagulopathies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In 2019 a novel member of the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family was identified to cause a respiratory illness associated with an outbreak to a global extent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) likely emerged from a zoonotic transmission similar to previous epidemic pathogens SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and is the origin of the Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus and belongs to the genus of betacoronaviruses. It is closely related to the bat coronavirus RatG and shows 79% homology to its predecessor SARS-CoV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Common symptoms are cough, pneumonia, and dyspnea, usually associated with a mild or moderate infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. A severe course of the disease can have dramatic outcomes like cardiovascular complications, respiratory failure, systemic shock, and multiple organ failure, leading to life threatening conditions and potential death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">COVID-19 is associated with abnormalities in blood coagulation in severe cases. SARS-CoV-2 is detected in the blood samples collected from COVID-19 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Although detected viral load is generally low, the amount of virus present in the plasma correlates with the severity of COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. In a study observing the clinical aspects of COVID-19, 59.6% of the COVID-19 patients had viral loads in their blood. Particularly, in critical patients, a constant high amount of viral load (176 copies/ml) was observed, in contrast to the patients with mild cases (81.7 copies/ml)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. A low count of platelets (thrombocytopenia) together with the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation, myocardial infarction and non-vessel thrombotic complications are commonly observed in COVID-19 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Platelets isolated from COVID-19 patients have also shown abnormalities such as hyperactivity and an increase in their spreading behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The causes of these abnormalities have been hypothesized as cytokines, antiphospholipid antibodies, interactions with other immune cells, and direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and platelets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Furthermore, isolated platelets from healthy donors mixed with SARS-CoV-2 or the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein show a faster thrombin-dependent clot retraction and activate platelets independent of thrombin with upregulation of signaling factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. A recent study further suggests the involvement of thrombin and tissue factor (TF) in the hyperactivation of platelets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Owing to its relevance for the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, S protein is central to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The petal shaped S protein forms a trimer that protrudes out of the viral membrane surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, and it is poised to engage with host cell receptors. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S proteins show an overall similarity of 76%, although they have specific differences that impact their functions such as a furin cleavage site (PRRAR) unique to SARS-CoV-2, leading to its increased pathogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Since the beginning of the pandemic, continuous mutations have been accumulated in S protein, making it challenging to battle infections and contain disease outbreaks.</p><p id="P5">The SARS-CoV-2 S protein consists of a S1 (residues 14-685) and a S2 (residues 686-1273) subunit, which are separated by host cell proteases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit is responsible for the attachment to host cells. Earlier structural studies by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed open and closed states of S protein in the trimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In the open state, in which RBDs are uplifted thereby revealing the receptor binding motif (RBM), S protein captures its major receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In addition to ACE2, S protein is suggested to interact with several other host receptors including neuropilin-1 (NRP1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and CD147<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 is the only betacoronavirus containing an RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) tripeptide motif in the RBD, which is typically recognized by several members of the integrin membrane receptor family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Bat-SL-CoVZC45 contains a RGD motif within the S protein but not within the RBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Initial studies observed the involvement of integrin in the SARS-CoV-2 entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> and the binding of integrins to S protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. However, these findings await further validation and in-depth analysis. While there is fragmented information from ultrastructural, pathological, and patient studies connecting the SARS-CoV-2 severity to the impact of its spike protein on platelets, very little is known what causes the coagulation of platelets in the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it is still under debate if ACE2 is present on the platelet surface, and therefore, it is not clear what the direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on platelets is<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we probed the direct interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with platelets and visualized its effect on platelet morphology using live imaging and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). In the presence of S protein, extensive elongation and increased spreading of platelets were observed. Notably, a population of abnormally shaped platelets resembling a proplatelet-like appearance was found, indicating an impact on the cytoskeleton-dependent platelet maturation process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Cryo-ET observations revealed actin-rich filopodia formation at the end of the elongated platelet and unexpectedly, there is a dense decoration of S protein on the filopodia surface. An orientation analysis revealed that S protein binds to the membrane surface with various angular distributions. Furthermore, based on the correlation of S protein binding and the filopodia formation, the interaction of platelet surface receptors and S protein was assessed <italic>in vitro.</italic> We found a weak but direct interaction of platelet residing RGD ligand integrin receptors α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> with S protein but not with integrin α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>.

COVID-19 patients exhibit conditions such as thrombocytopenia, microvascular thrombosis, and coagulation, leading to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 may directly cause platelet malfunctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. To assess the direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we isolated platelets from healthy de-identified human blood donors and tested their morphological changes in the presence of S protein. Under several extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs; i.e. fibronectin and collagen I) or poly-L-lysine, platelets occasionally adhered to ECMs without S protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Movie S1</xref>). Discoid-shaped platelets were predominant in these control conditions without S protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-C</xref>; “control”). However, in the presence of S protein, we observed the deformation of platelets to elongated morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-C</xref>, panel “spike”). The deformation of platelets was quantified by the axial ratio (ratio of the lengths of the longer to shorter axis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), showing a median value of 1.960, 1.565 and 1.786 with collagen I, poly-L-lysine and fibronectin respectively, while 1.687, 1.491 and 1.756 under control conditions without addition of S protein. The corresponding circularities in the presence of S protein decreased to 0.559, 0.649 and 0.613 with collagen I, poly-L-lysine and fibronectin respectively, compared to 0.686, 0.668 and 0.650 under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). S protein-induced elongation of platelets was observed under all coating backgrounds, indicating that the morphology change of platelets is a direct effect of S protein. The deformation of platelets reached to an extent of 32 μm in the long axis and 1.4 μm in the short axis in extreme cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1</xref>), though precise boundaries of platelets cannot be measured due to the limitations of the light microscopic resolution. The extreme elongation of platelets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1</xref>) indicates the presence of proplatelets, a platelet precursor present in the circulatory system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Typically, proplatelets are processed by cytoskeletal remodeling and abscise into smaller platelets within the circulatory system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Our observation suggests that S protein may influence the maturation of platelets by acting on the cytoskeleton-based process necessary for proplatelet division. Occasionally, we observed a proplatelet shape, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1</xref>, white arrowhead), resulting in the formation of a wide hollow, ring with one or more bulges like gemstones on a ring. Interestingly, the effect of platelet deformation is less prominent in the poly-L-lysine background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We also observed less effect in the activation of platelets with S protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) with poly-L-lysine. As poly-L-lysine is not a platelet-specific adherence factor, it suggests that the deformation of platelets may be further aided by the binding to extracellular agents. To test the effects of S protein in the activation of platelet, a solid-phase sandwich ELISA assay and western blotting were performed. In the ELISA assay, platelet factor 4 (PF4) was measured to test the secretion of alpha-granules, a marker for the activation of platelets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. The result showed an increase in secreted PF4 in platelet samples in the presence of S protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Western blot analysis showed an increase in phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (pFAK) as well, which responds to the signaling cascade of focal adhesion pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Interestingly, while pFAK was detected from platelets that adhered to the plate surface (1.45 ± 0.51 times higher than control without S protein), floating platelets did not show a detectable level of pFAK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1B-D</xref>). This indicates that the deformation of platelets is a reversible process that has little or only local influence.</p><p id="P8">On the surface of SARS-CoV-2, S protein is arranged with an average distance of 35 nm to its neighboring S protein with an estimated number of 24 S proteins per virus particle, though the reported distribution has no apparent geometrical order<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. In this way, S proteins are effectively locally concentrated on the viral surface. To reflect the local concentration effects and test the influence of the concentration of S protein on the deformation of platelets, various concentrations of S protein were added to platelets in tenfold steps from 0.2 μg/ml to 20 μg/ml (0.47 nM to 47 nM) and the morphology changes of platelets were assessed. We observed an increase in the elongation as well as activation of platelets in accordance with the concentration of S protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). While S protein was able to cause the deformation of the platelets even at the lowest concentration (0.2 μg/ml, or 0.47 nM), more dominant effects were observed under high concentrations. Our observation suggests that higher concentrations of S protein have a more pronounced impact on platelets, which could mimic locally concentrated S protein on the viral surface.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cryo-ET analysis shows S protein densely decorated on the platelet surface</title><p id="P9">To gain molecular insights into the morphological changes of platelets in the presence of S protein, we performed a cryo-ET analysis of platelets under a collagen type I background, both in the presence and absence of S protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Movie S2</xref>). Platelets incubated with S protein revealed extensive deformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-3C</xref>, highlighted in purple, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2</xref>) consistent with the light microscopic observations, while intact platelets exhibit their typical disc-like morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D-3F</xref>, highlighted in yellow). High magnification observation (33000x) revealed that the elongated morphology of platelets was facilitated by the remodeling of actin, forming filopodia-like architectures as narrow as 43 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2</xref>). Within the filopodia that we analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G and 3I</xref>), we found actin filaments assembling into tightly packed bundles, comparable to those seen in pseudopodia of untreated platelets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Accompanied by longer actin filaments running parallel to the axis of the filopodia, shorter ones were bridging between the longer filaments and the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H-3J</xref>). The angular distribution of actin segments shows two peaks, namely at 10 and 80 degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>, arrows), those of 10° corresponding to the actin filaments that are running along the filopodia axis, while those of 80° connecting between the actin bundles and membranes. The difference of 70° between peaks reinforces the notion that the connections are made by the Arp2/3 complex, which is known to mediate actin branching at 70°<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Control platelets showed filopodia-formation exclusively when contacting collagen I fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D-3F</xref>). Interestingly, in the presence of S protein, the morphological changes of platelets and their filopodia-like formation did not require the attachment to collagen I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-3C</xref>). This indicates that S protein itself has a contribution to the surface activation of platelets. Unexpectedly, we identified dense S protein densities decorating the external membrane surface of the filopodia protrusions, indicative of S protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3K</xref>, “+”, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Movie S2</xref>). In contrast, we only observed shorter faint densities of endogenous membrane receptors on the surface of intact platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3K</xref>, “-”).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to the platelet membrane surface flexibly</title><p id="P10">To further analyze the S protein densities on the platelet membrane surface, we manually selected and extracted the densities from 8 tomograms and analyzed them using subtomogram averaging approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). To facilitate a focused alignment of the decorating protein without the influence of the membrane density, the membrane signal was subtracted using PySeg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. We obtained a 3D-averaged density at a resolution of 13.8 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3</xref>) showing a characteristic trimeric shape of 15 nm in size. The obtained structure agreed well with our near-atomic resolution structure of S protein using the same protein batch for single-particle analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3</xref>) as well as previously published structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, fitted PDB 6vxx), validating the identity of S protein decorations. Furthermore, the analysis of the particles without application of C3 symmetry showed an asymmetric uplift of the tip of the S1 surface that connects to the extra density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>, right). This shows that one of the three RBD domains of S protein is lifted up upon its binding to the host cell receptors. The extra density connected to S protein represents the density from the host cell, likely the platelet surface receptor recognized by S protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To assess how S protein recognizes the platelet surface, the alignment parameters of the individually analyzed S protein densities were applied to the 3D average and plotted back to the original tomograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-H</xref>). The distribution analysis of neighboring S protein showed that the peak population had a distance of 27.3 nm (median) apart, but some molecules were also more sparsely distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). This measurement corresponds to a density of one S protein on a surface area of up to 585 nm<sup>2</sup> (a radial surface of 585 nm<sup>2</sup> is covered by one S protein), although no apparent periodical distribution was detected. Judging from the diameter of S protein (~17 nm), neighboring S protein closely located next to each other. S protein bound to the platelet membrane at a distance of 16 nm between the center of S protein to the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>) and interestingly, with a wide range of angular distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D-E</xref>) with respect to the membrane surface, indicating its flexible attachment to the platelet surface. In addition, S protein binds to a slightly more curved membrane surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G and 4H</xref>). This may be reflected by the fact that the binding of S protein induces filopodia formation with a membrane protrusion. Taken together, these results indicate that S protein approaches the platelet surface from various geometrical orientations to accommodate and enhance the docking to the membrane surface. Similarly, a broad angular distribution of S protein has been observed from the viral surface, due to several kinked points in the stalk region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Together with our observation, it suggests the orientational adjustments from both sides of S protein, namely the receptor binding S1 subunit and the stem side at the root on the virus, maximize the efficiency of the attachment of S protein to the host cell receptors. Consistent with the observed additional density on the lifted RBD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, right), some of the tomograms showed extra densities bridging between plasma membrane and S protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref>, red arrows), presumably those of platelet receptors recognizing S protein. However, subtomogram analysis only yielded a faint density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, right) without features, also suggesting a flexible attachment of S protein to its receptor on the membrane surface.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Platelet deformation in the presence of pseudotyped viral particles</title><p id="P12">After characterizing the effects of S protein on platelets, we hypothesized that locally concentrated S protein on a globular viral surface would be advantageous for increasing the local concentration and evaluated the influence of SARS-CoV-2 pseudo virus-like-particles (VLPs) on platelet deformation. We either generated or obtained SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped VLPs that are fully intact vesicle-like entities as validated by negative staining EM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4A</xref>) and by their ability to infect HEK-293T-hACE2 cells (HEK-293T cells constitutively expressing ACE2 receptor, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4B-S4C</xref>). The viral titer determined by flow cytometry was approximately 10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> particles/ml, comparable to the reported preparation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudo VLPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, however, it was low compared to VSV-G based lentiviruses. This low titer did not allow us to readily detect changes in platelet morphologies by live platelet imaging. However, we were able to find an example of a particle located in close proximity to a platelet filopodium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5B-S5F</xref>). Cryo-electron tomography revealed that the closest distance between this particle and the membrane surface of the filopodium was 20 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S5H</xref>), similar to that measured for S protein alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref> 16 nm, from the center of S protein to membrane). The cross-section views of the particle showed decorations of proteins on the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5I</xref>, red arrowheads), altogether suggesting that this vesicle may be a bound VLP. In comparison, we also found examples of extracellular vesicles with a similar shape and size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5A</xref>) that appeared to originate from intracellular vesicles, i.e. exosomes, containing alpha granules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5A</xref>, left) or budding out from the concave surface of plasma membrane, instead of filopodia and indicative of vesicle release through fusion of lysosome and plasma membrane.

However, the presence of ACE2, the major S protein receptor, on the platelet surface is still inconclusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Therefore, the relevance of the ACE2 receptor for platelet malfunction is still an open question. In contrast, integrin receptors are the major class of receptors expressed in platelets. Considering our structural analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) and the possibility that ACE2 is not abundantly expressed on platelets, we hypothesized that S protein may directly recognize integrin receptors. Interestingly, the RBD domain of S protein contains a stretch with an “RGD” motif, which is a common motif among integrin ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and a direct interaction of tissue integrin α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> and SARS-CoV-2 S protein has been shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. We therefore tested the binding of S protein to known platelet integrin receptors α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>, α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>, enriched in the tissue but also expressed on platelets, all recognizing the RGD ligand motif. We used ELISA-like solid-phase equilibrium binding assays to detect the interaction of S protein with integrins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We detected the binding of integrin α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> to S protein, while integrin α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> does not have an apparent interaction with it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). The extent of binding is most prominent with integrin α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>, while integrin α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> showed only a weak interaction. However, it should be noted that the observed binding of tested integrins was much weaker (less than 10-fold) compared to those for physiological integrin ligands: vitronectin for α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>, fibrinogen for α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> and fibronectin for α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>. Encouraged by our results, we tested the effect of platelet activation in the presence of cilengitide, a cyclic RGD pentapeptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> that blocks the binding of integrin to RGD motif-containing extracellular ligands, and indeed the activation was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). These observations generally agree with a recent discussion of the relevance of integrin recognition by SARS-CoV-2 for vascular dysregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">SARS-CoV-2 has shown unique pathological symptoms that can lead to a wide range of coagulopathic events in severe cases. In our study, we probed the direct effect of S protein to the change in morphology of platelets at a molecular level, and for the first time, we directly visualized the binding of S protein to the platelet surface (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). We hypothesized that the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by integrin receptors based on the following reasons; 1) the activation of platelets is governed by filopodia formation, 2) filopodia formation is initiated by integrin receptors, 3) the major receptors on the platelets are integrin receptors and 4) SARS-CoV-2 S protein contains a “RGD” sequence in the RBD, which is recognized by a subtype of integrin, and therefore we tested the interaction of platelet-expressed integrins with S protein. Our integrin inhibition experiment using cilengitide and <italic>in vitro</italic> solid-phase binding assays support this hypothesis, particularly with the possibility that S protein recognizes integrin α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>. The binding of S protein to integrin was much lower compared to the interaction of integrins with their physiological ligands, and interestingly, we did not detect the binding to the major platelet integrin α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>. Previously, an increased binding of the activated integrin α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> antibody PAC-1 to platelets was observed in the presence of S protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This may be due to an inside-out effect, in which the outside-in signaling is activated by the direct binding of S protein to integrin α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> and in turn, α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> would get activated through the intracellular signaling (inside-out). We surmise that the weak affinity of S protein to platelet integrin receptors and the reversible binding, may reflect the fact that blood clotting defects observed in patients are rare complications and occur in severe cases of COVID-19. However, here we should also note that there are other receptors on platelets that may also be accountable for the interaction with S protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> and combinatory effects of the binding of S protein to multiple receptors may also occur.</p><p id="P15">SARS-CoV-2 is found in the blood stream of COVID-19 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and an open question is how it can lead to rare but severe coagulation defects. We showed that the deformation of platelets itself does not always alter their intracellular signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1</xref>), or induces activation. It rather appears that platelets exposed to S protein are primed for the activation upon further stimuli, such as the attachment to an adhesion surface. Based on this observation, we speculate that the combination of the direct binding of S protein to platelets and other identified coagulation factors may induce a synergistic and irreversible activation of platelets, leading to coagulation. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, several other procoagulant players are active, for example the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, the release of TF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, elevated fibrinogen levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> and dysregulated release of cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, creating a hypercoagulative environment in the context of COVID-19.</p><p id="P16">In our study, we visualized the adaptable attachment of S protein to the platelet plasma membrane with a high degree of flexibility for the engagement to continuously curved membrane surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D and 4E</xref>).

After blocking overnight at 4°C (Blocking One, Nacalai #03953-95), velcro-tagged integrins α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>, α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> diluted at 10 μg/ml in 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.2 were incubated for 2 h at RT to allow binding to the immobilized ligands. Bound integrins were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA)-like solid-phase assay using biotinylated rabbit anti-velcro (against ACIS/BASE coiled-coil) antibody and HRP-conjugated streptavidin (VECTOR Laboratories #SA-5004). After addition of ABTS, readout was performed at 405 nm.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS157635-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d39aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS157635-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d39aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the members of Mizuno Lab for discussions and help for this research.
