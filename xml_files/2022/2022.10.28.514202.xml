However, mechanisms underlying this enigmatic potentiation remain elusive. Here, we report that GBR activation induces a transition from tonic to phasic release accompanied by a 4-fold increase in readily releasable pool (RRP) size in MHb terminals, mirrored by a similar increase in the docked vesicle number at the presynaptic active zone (AZ). The tonic and phasic release vesicles have distinct coupling distances. We identified two vesicle-associated molecules, synaptoporin and CAPS2, selectively involved in tonic and phasic release, respectively. Synaptoporin mediates augmentation of tonic release and CAPS2 stabilizes readily releasable vesicles during phasic release. A newly developed “Flash and Freeze-fracture” method revealed selective recruitment of CAPS2 to the AZ during phasic release. Thus, we propose a novel two-pool mechanism underlying the GBR-mediated potentiation of release from MHb terminals.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The synaptic connection from the medial habenula (MHb) to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) is a phylogenetically conserved pathway involved in emotion- and addiction-related behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The most striking peculiarity in this pathway is an enhancement of unparalleled scale of neurotransmitter release from terminals originating from cholinergic neurons in the ventral MHb by activation of presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GBRs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, usually inhibitory G-protein coupled receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Except for an increase in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, it is currently unknown which mechanisms mediate this increase in release. Another unique feature of the MHb-IPN synapse is the exclusive use of Cav2.3 for release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. However, Cav2.3-mediated release is not necessarily potentiated by GBR activation since it is inhibited in terminals originating in the dorsal MHb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Across the nervous system, synaptic terminals respond in either one of two fundamental ways to the repeated excitation at high frequency, facilitation of neurotransmitter release called tonic release, or depression of neurotransmitter release called phasic release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. While the depression of phasic release is mediated by a depletion of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles (SVs), the facilitation of tonic release is likely mediated by a progressive increase in release probability (P<sub>r</sub>) by residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Although the molecular properties determining the release modes in which a certain synapse type operates are incompletely understood, relevant factors include Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, stimulation frequency and the priming and docking states of SVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Here, we report that, following GBR activation, MHb terminals transition from a facilitating, tonic to a depressing, phasic neurotransmitter release mode at a physiological stimulation frequency. This transition is induced by a GBR-mediated increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which recruits additional SVs to the RRP. Using “Flash and Freeze” in acute IPN slices, we observed an increase in docked SVs following GBR activation to the same extent as the increase in RRP size. We screened SV-associated proteins expressed in MHb neurons and found synaptoporin and CAPS2 selectively involved in tonic and phasic release, augmenting release and retaining readily releasable SVs, respectively. Using a new method for nanoscale visualization of membrane-associated proteins within milliseconds after exocytosis, named “Flash and Freeze-fracture”, we discovered CAPS2 recruitment to the presynaptic active zone (AZ) and its stabilization there during phasic release.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Transition from tonic to phasic neurotransmitter release by GBR activation</title><p id="P6">Rodent MHb neurons are active at ~10 Hz <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> but postsynaptic responses in IPN neurons following repetitive stimulation of MHb axons at this physiological frequency have never been studied. Therefore, we recorded rostral/central IPN neurons in whole-cell mode and measured excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by electrical stimulation of the fasciculus retroflexus (FR), a fiber bundle arising in the habenula. In order to keep the MHb-IPN pathway intact, we prepared 1 mm-thick angled slices as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Under baseline conditions, 10–Hz stimulation for three seconds produced EPSC responses that increased in amplitude with consecutive stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Application of the GBR agonist R(+)-baclofen (1 μM) greatly potentiated initial EPSC amplitudes in the 10–Hz train but continued stimulation progressively reduced subsequent EPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-D</xref>). Normalization of EPSC amplitudes to the corresponding first baseline EPSC revealed that the enhanced EPSC amplitudes by baclofen decayed to the level of the facilitated baseline EPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). This implies that GBR-mediated depressing neurotransmission occurred in addition to and not instead of the baseline facilitating release. Thus, MHb terminals exhibited a facilitating, tonic neurotransmitter release pattern under baseline conditions and transitioned to a depressing, phasic release pattern after GBR activation.</p><p id="P7">Ventral MHb terminals co-release glutamate and acetylcholine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, therefore, we tested whether the tonic and phasic release are selectively mediated by one of the two transmitters. Cholinergic EPSC trains in the presence of the AMPA receptor blocker DNQX (10 μM) still transitioned to a phasic response pattern after GBR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 1A</xref>) similar to that of glutamatergic EPSC trains in the presence of cholinergic blockers (50 μM hexamethonium, 5 μM mecamylamine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 1B</xref>). Although the cholinergic RRP size (0.72 ± 0.18 nA, n=8) was much smaller than the glutamatergic one (3.57 ± 0.47 nA, n=8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 1C</xref>), cholinergic P<sub>r</sub> was not significantly different from that of glutamatergic neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 1C</xref>). Thus, the GBR-mediated phasic release induction equally affects cholinergic and glutamatergic release, though glutamate mainly contributes to the EPSCs.</p><p id="P8">We then quantified the recovery from activity-dependent modulations of tonic and phasic release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E, F</xref>). The facilitated baseline responses decayed exponentially with a tau of 9.1 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>), suggesting that this facilitation is augmentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Similarly, depression of phasic release recovered with a tau of 4.4 s, suggesting that the EPSC decrease results from RRP depletion. In conclusion, the two modes of neurotransmitter release from MHb terminals exhibit distinct short-term plasticity and recover from the activity-dependent modulation within seconds.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Role of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the GBR-mediated enhancement of neurotransmitter release</title><p id="P9">We next explored the role of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the GBR-mediated transition from tonic to phasic release. Using AAV injections into the MHb of ChAT-IRES-Cre mice, we expressed axon-GCaMP6s in cholinergic neurons. FR stimulation at 10 Hz for three seconds increased presynaptic GCaMP fluorescence in the IPN 4.0 ± 0.6 fold of resting fluorescence intensity whereas application of baclofen further increased it 6.5 ± 0.9 fold (n=5 slices, 5 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). However, presynaptic GBRs are known to inhibit the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) and no report shows direct GBR-mediated increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx for any VGCCs in reconstituted systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Using simulations based on our Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data, we asked whether the increase in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> could stem from the inhibition of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding ability of a buffer, resulting in an “un-buffering” of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, rather than enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). Analysis of response kinetics of our experimental GCaMP data revealed significantly faster rise times after baclofen application with no change in decay times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 2A–D</xref>). Using GCaMP6s as a model buffer, we simulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response kinetics at distinct buffer concentrations and found that high concentrations of a high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer resulted in significantly prolonged decay times and lower peak fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 2E–H</xref>), ruling out Ca<sup>2+</sup> un-buffering as the GBR-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, alterations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion also failed to reproduce the observed changes in GCaMP fluorescence after baclofen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 2I, J</xref>). Finally, we simulated alterations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and found that a 2.3-fold increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx most closely reproduced our observed increase in GCaMP peak fluorescence after baclofen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 2K–M</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Since our simulation confirmed increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx as the cause of the GBR-mediated increase in presynaptic GCaMP fluorescence, we next tested whether increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by other means was sufficient to induce phasic release. Surprisingly, elevation of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> from 2.5 to 5 mM or addition of the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl, 1 mM) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 100 μM) neither induced phasic release nor occluded its induction by baclofen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C–H</xref>). Although TEA/4-AP application strongly enhanced spontaneous neurotransmitter release, evoked EPSC responses remained tonic and exhibited augmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F–H</xref>). Thus, we conclude that increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx alone is insufficient to induce phasic release.</p><p id="P11">We next hypothesized that increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during phasic release might result in diffusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> further away from the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel to recruit SVs more distant from the AZ compared to those for baseline tonic release. Therefore, we tested the effect of a slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer, EGTA-AM (100 μM), on phasic release, first applied after baclofen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). EGTA-AM selectively reduced the EPSC amplitudes of early responses in the 10–Hz train but the phasic release pattern remained similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2J</xref>). Specifically, EGTA-AM reduced the first EPSC (EPSC<sub>1</sub>) amplitude on average by 51.8 ± 2.1% (n=8, 4 mice), suggesting that the phasic release is loosely coupled to Cav2.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In contrast, EGTA-AM had no significant effect on baseline EPSC1 amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L-N</xref>), suggesting tight coupling for SVs participating in tonic release. Most strikingly, however, EGTA-AM completely blocked the potentiation of EPSC<sub>1</sub> amplitudes when applied before baclofen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L-N</xref>), suggesting that the induction of phasic release strongly depends on Ca<sup>2+</sup> distant from Cav2.3. Although the exact presynaptic concentration of EGTA is unknown in EGTA-AM experiments, it is unlikely that presynaptic EGTA concentrations differed between tonic and phasic release since no modulation of endogenous esterase activity by GBRs has been known. Therefore, these results support our hypothesis that diffusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> away from Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels recruits loosely-coupled SVs to the RRP of phasic release.</p><p id="P12">In summary, our results suggest that 1) activation of GBRs on MHb terminals induces an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx; 2) this Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase is necessary for the recruitment of phasic SVs from distal sites of the terminal inducing phasic release; 3) however, increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx alone is not sufficient to induce phasic release; 4) the tonic SVs are more tightly coupled to Cav2.3 than phasic SVs, indicating distinct release sites for these SVs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Comparison of release properties of tonic and phasic neurotransmission</title><p id="P13">To determine whether GBR-mediated enhancement of release is ascribable to an increase in P<sub>r</sub>, RRP or both, we next compared release properties of basal and GBR-enhanced release by applying 30 stimulations at 100 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). Experiments were performed in the presence of 1 mM kynurenic acid (KA) to avoid AMPA receptor desensitization. The 100–Hz stimulation resulted in the depletion of baseline responses, allowing for the measurement of the tonic RRP in cumulative EPSC amplitude plots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Strikingly, the application of baclofen increased the RRP on average 4.1-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>; baseline RRP: 0.58 ± 0.09 nA; baclofen RRP: 2.37 ± 0.36 nA; n=16 recordings/4 mice). In addition, baclofen also increased Pr on average 2.0-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>; baseline: 0.086 ± 0.017; baclofen: 0.169 ± 0.024). Altogether, our functional data suggest that tonic and phasic release modes are mediated by two distinct SV pools with different RRP size and coupling tightness, potentially operating in parallel.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Structural correlates of enhanced neurotransmitter release</title><p id="P14">Our functional data indicated that phasic release is associated with a 4-fold increase in RRP size compared to basal tonic release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The RRP is an electrophysiological property considered to be structurally reflected by docked SVs in the AZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. To test this, we next used timed high-pressure freezing after optogenetic stimulation of MHb terminals in acute slices (“Flash and Freeze”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>). First, we measured optogenetic responses in IPN neurons of ChAT-ChR2-EYFP mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> in 200–μm thick coronal slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). In ChAT-ChR2-EYFP mice, we found that 90.2% of all asymmetrical synapses expressed channelrhodopsin2 in the rostral/central IPN region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 3A</xref>). Under baseline condition, optogenetic stimulation at 10 Hz produced tonic-like EPSC responses that decayed over time after the 10–Hz train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). However, in contrast to electrically-evoked EPSCs, the first baseline EPSC in the optogenetic train was frequently larger than the subsequent responses. This likely resulted from the desensitizing kinetics of channelrhodopsin which, upon activation from resting state, exhibits an initially larger conductance than during steady-state or repetitive activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Importantly, the application of baclofen induced phasic release, which rapidly depleted during the 10–Hz train and recovered within 10 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To distinguish tonic and phasic RRPs, we chose to freeze MHb terminals at two time points in the presence of baclofen; 1) 100 ms after the 10–Hz stimulation (Depletion group) at which time point the phasic RRP should be mostly depleted, and 2) 10 s after the 10–Hz stimulation (Recovery group) at which time point the phasic RRP should have fully recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). Control samples were prepared in the same way but without light stimulation or baclofen. Following freeze substitution, we extracted the rostral/central IPN region and prepared serial ultrathin sections (40 nm) for EM imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 3B–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). We measured SV diameters and found no significant difference between groups (Control: 46.0 ± 1.7 nm, n=16 synapses, 3 mice; 2215 SVs measured; Depletion: 43.4 ± 1.7 nm, n=18 synapses, 3 mice, 2204 SVs measured; Recovery: 43.6 ± 0.9 nm, n=18 synapses, 3 mice, 2539 SVs measured; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). In a defined perimeter around the AZ (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>), we then measured the distance from each SV’s center to the nearest presynaptic membrane in 5–nm bins. SVs in direct contact with the presynaptic membrane or whose center was within 20–nm distance of the inner leaflet of the membrane were considered docked. In control samples, the peak bins of SVs were in close proximity of the AZ (20 – 40 nm from the membrane) without making contact, thus, considered as loosely-docked<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> (5<sup>th</sup> – 8<sup>th</sup> bins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). The depletion group displayed lower absolute numbers of SVs, particularly at the loosely-docked bins. In contrast, terminals in the recovery group showed a strong increase in docked SVs (first four bins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). Furthermore, the density of docked SVs in the recovery group (2.34 ± 0.27 docked SVs / 10<sup>4</sup> nm<sup>2</sup>; n=18 terminals, 3 mice) increased 3.5-fold compared to the depletion group (0.67 ± 0.15 docked SVs / 10<sup>4</sup> nm<sup>2</sup>; n=18 terminals, 3 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>). The difference in docked SV densities between depletion and recovery groups was similar to the difference in RRP size between tonic and phasic release (4.1-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), supporting that two distinct pools of SVs mainly contribute to each release mode.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>SV-associated molecules selectively involved in tonic and phasic release</title><p id="P16">To test the two-pool mechanism hypothesis, we next aimed to identify vesicle-associated proteins selectively involved in tonic and phasic release. We first investigated the role of synaptoporin (SPO) based on its selective expression in ventral MHb neurons (Allen Brain Atlas). SPO is a vesicular membrane protein and a homologue of synaptophysin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, but its functional importance remains unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In contrast to synaptophysin, SPO was found to co-precipitate with Cav2.3 in a brain-wide proteomics study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, suggesting that it may be relevant for neurotransmission in MHb terminals which exclusively rely on Cav2.3 for release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Immunofluorescence revealed that SPO was expressed in axon-like structures in the rostral/central IPN subnuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), and at the EM level, SPO-labeling was confirmed on SVs in the vast majority of MHb terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 4A</xref>). We then generated SPO KO mice (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>) and confirmed the specificity of immunolabeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). To test the functional role of SPO, we performed whole-cell recordings from IPN neurons in SPO KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C–F</xref>). At baseline conditions, augmentation of tonic release appeared strongly impaired compared to wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). In contrast, baclofen-induced phasic release did not appear different from that of WT and P<sub>r</sub> of EPSC<sub>1</sub> remained unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E, F</xref>; measured by linear regression analysis of cumulative EPSC amplitude plots). Although there was a significant effect of genotype on phasic Pr time course (F<sub>1, 690</sub> = 7.599, P = 0.006, two-way ANOVA), Bonferroni post hoc test revealed no significant difference at any stimulation time point. These results suggest that SPO is a mediator of tonic release augmentation and thus, could be a molecular marker specific for tonic release SVs.</p><p id="P17">Phasic release requires the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS) in the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Although there are two CAPS isoforms, CAPS1 and CAPS2, only CAPS1 is required for fast, phasic neurotransmission in the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, whereas CAPS2 was found to be involved in the release of neuropeptides and neurotrophic factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Since MHb neurons exclusively express CAPS2 but not CAPS1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that CAPS2 might be involved in GBR-induced phasic release. Immunofluorescence revealed strong CAPS2 expression in all IPN subnuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>) and pre-embedding EM showed CAPS2 labeling on SVs in the vast majority of MHb terminals in the rostral/central IPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 4B</xref>).

Functionally, tonic release appeared intact, with augmentation similar to that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I, J</xref>). However, phasic release was strikingly altered in CAPS2 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K, L</xref>). Specifically, Pr of EPSC1 was reduced almost 10-fold compared to WT (WT EPSC1 Pr: 0.19 ± 0.02, n=13, 5 mice; CAPS2 KO EPSC1 Pr: 0.02 ± 0.00, n=14, 3 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5L</xref>). Furthermore, P<sub>r</sub> increased over the first four stimuli before starting to reduce gradually. Interestingly, we observed similar phasic responses in WT mice but only at the very first 10–Hz stimulation in the presence of baclofen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 5A, B</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that CAPS2 is recruited Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependently during phasic release induction and might serve to stabilize replenished SVs in a docked state. Nonetheless, the facilitation in the first several stimuli followed by depression in CAPS2 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K, L</xref>) indicates that CAPS2 does not interfere with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent recruitment of phasic release SVs. Overall, we identified SPO and CAPS2 as SV-associated proteins selectively involved in tonic and phasic release, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Activity-dependent induction and retention of phasic release</title><p id="P18">Our results in CAPS2 KO mice suggest that CAPS2 is required for the retention of newly recruited SVs in the RRP, but previous activity is necessary for the potentiation of initial EPSCs in the train. Therefore, we tested whether achieving the maximal phasic response is activity-dependent or whether baclofen without activity is sufficient to reach peak potentiation. To this aim, we recorded bilateral MHb inputs to single IPN neurons and, after establishing a baseline response, stopped stimulation on one hemisphere while washing in baclofen (silent washin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A, B</xref>). Once the 10–Hz stimulation (3 s, every 20 s) on the other hemisphere induced maximal potentiation, the same 10–Hz stimulation of the silent side resumed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Strikingly, EPSC<sub>1</sub> amplitude in the first 10–Hz stimulation train was only marginally increased whereas the second train exhibited maximal potentiation of EPSC<sub>1</sub> amplitude. This result confirmed that the induction of phasic release is activity-dependent.</p><p id="P19">Next, we asked whether the GBR-mediated potentiation, once induced, might be stored in the absence of GBR activation during periods of synaptic inactivity. To test this, we stimulated MHb inputs bilaterally to induce phasic release on both sides in the presence of baclofen. Once full potentiation was achieved, stimulation on one hemisphere was halted (silent washout) while starting the washout of baclofen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Five minutes after the washout onset, potentiation on the continuously stimulated side was fully reverted (stimulated washout). At this time point, we restarted the 10–Hz stimulation of the silent side and saw only marginal potentiation of EPSC<sub>1</sub> amplitudes in the first train (EPSC1: 213.2 ± 62.3% of baseline amplitude, n=9, 4 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). However, in the second train, EPSC<sub>1</sub> amplitudes increased to 46.8% of the peak potentiation (second train EPSC<sub>1</sub>: 374.7 ± 82.8% of baseline amplitude; peak potentiation EPSC<sub>1</sub>: 801.6 ± 120.4% of baseline amplitude). Therefore, we conclude that the GBR-mediated potentiation can be stored for minutes in the absence of GBR activation, but the retrieval of this stored potentiation also requires activity, consistent with the idea of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent recruitment of phasic release SVs.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Recruitment of CAPS2 to the presynaptic active zone by phasic but not tonic release</title><p id="P20">Given the partial storage of GBR-mediated potentiation for at least five minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>), we hypothesized that chemical fixation might be sufficiently fast to capture molecular changes underlying the phasic release induction. Therefore, we next investigated the nano-anatomical location of CAPS2 inside MHb terminals during phasic release. We combined optogenetic stimulation of MHb terminals in acute IPN slices from ChAT-ChR2-EYFP mice and immersion chemical fixation followed by pre-embedding immunolabeling (“Flash and Fix”). Control slices remained unstimulated and unexposed to baclofen whereas the “10 Hz” group received three 10–Hz light stimulations (3 s duration, 10 s intervals) without baclofen and the “10 Hz + Baclofen” group received the same stimulation after a 10 – 15 min pre-incubation in 1 μM baclofen. Immediately after the last stimulation, slices were submerged in a fixative (4% PFA, 0.05% glutaraldehyde, 15% picric acid) for 45 min. Pre-embedding immunolabeling for CAPS2 revealed that CAPS2 was specifically recruited to the presynaptic AZ in the 10 Hz + Baclofen group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A, B</xref>; Control: 0.3 ± 0.1 particles/AZ, n=58 profiles, 2 mice; 10 Hz: 0.7 ± 0.1 particles/AZ, n=68 profiles, 2 mice; 10 Hz + Baclofen: 2.6 ± 0.3 particles/AZ, n=60 profiles, 2 mice). This result suggests the recruitment and subsequent stabilization of CAPS2 in the presynaptic AZ during the phasic, but not tonic, release.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>“Flash and Freeze-fracture” reveals selective recruitment of CAPS2 to the presynaptic membrane during phasic release</title><p id="P21">SVs containing SPO or bound by CAPS2 may selectively fuse with the AZ membrane during tonic and phasic release, respectively. However, it is unclear whether all SVs contain SPO and CAPS2 or whether tonic and phasic pools are molecularly non-overlapping. To answer this question, we combined “Flash and Freeze” with freeze-fracture replication and subsequent immunolabeling. This method, which we call “Flash and Freeze-fracture”, enables the nanoscale detection of multiple proteins simultaneously in the presynaptic membrane within milliseconds of neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>).</p><p id="P22">If CAPS2 is exclusively expressed on phasic and SPO exclusively on tonic SVs, then the ratio of CAPS2 to SPO molecules in the presynaptic membrane should shift towards CAPS2 during phasic release. In contrast, if all SVs contain CAPS2 and SPO, the ratio of CAPS2 to SPO molecules in the presynaptic membrane should remain unaltered between tonic and phasic release. Thus, we next quantified the ratio of CAPS2 to SPO in the presynaptic membrane following stimulation by a single 8 ms light pulse in the absence or presence of baclofen. Since phasic SV recruitment is activity-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 6B</xref>), two 10–Hz conditioning stimuli (3–s duration, 10–s interval) were given 10 s prior to the single light pulse. Freezing was timed so that the tissue reached 0 °C 8 ms after light onset and light application continued for an additional 15 ms during freezing. To maximize release and stabilize SV- and membrane-associated proteins in the presynaptic membrane after fusion, slices were stimulated and frozen in the presence of 1 mM TEA-Cl, 100 μM 4-AP and 100 μM dynasore. Because CAPS2 is a cytosolic protein, we incubated replicas with attached tissue in 2% PFA for one hour prior to SDS digestion to crosslink CAPS2 to potential interacting transmembrane proteins. In “Flash and Freeze-fracture” replicas of “stimulation + baclofen” group, the ratio of CAPS2 to SPO (4.56 ± 0.87, n=6 replicas, 205 profiles, 6 mice) was significantly higher than in the unstimulated control group (ACSF, 0.31 ± 0.01, n=3 replicas, 153 profiles, 3 mice) and “stimulation” group (1.33 ± 0.48, n=4 replicas, 320 profiles, 4 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B, C</xref>). We confirmed the specificity of replica labeling for SPO and CAPS2 in acute-slice replicas of corresponding KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 6A</xref>). The difference in the ratio during phasic release derived from increases in the density of CAPS2 in the presynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 6B</xref>) as SPO density was similar across all three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 6B</xref>), potentially due to high spontaneous neurotransmission in the presence of TEA/4AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Comparison of SPO and CAPS2 particle numbers in individual AZs revealed significant positive correlation in the “stimulation + baclofen” group but not the “stimulation” group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 6C</xref>), indicating that baclofen induced a correlated evoked vesicular release of SPO- and CAPS2-associated SVs, whereas release of these two populations was independent in the stimulation only condition. Although control samples also showed a significant correlation, this was likely caused by the frequent absence of CAPS2 in many of the control profiles. Finally, to test for association of SPO and CAPS2 in the AZ, we compared the nearest neighbor distances (NNDs) from CAPS2 to SPO particles with those from real CAPS2 to simulated SPO particles (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Interestingly, NND analysis revealed no significant association of CAPS2 and SPO in the presynaptic membrane of both “stimulation” and “stimulation + baclofen” groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 6D</xref>), suggesting that fusion sites of CAPS2- and SPO-associated vesicles may not overlap.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">We discovered that activation of GBRs induces a transition from tonic to phasic neurotransmitter release mode in MHb terminals, which coincides with robust potentiation and an increase in action potential-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. During basal release, small Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx triggers release of tonic SVs close to the VGCC without involving the distal phasic pool. Importantly, we found GBR-mediated recruitment of additional SVs from distal presynaptic regions, resulting in increases in RRP size and docked SVs. We identified SPO and CAPS2 as two SV-associated molecules selectively involved in tonic and phasic release, respectively. The recruitment of phasic release SVs is activity-dependent and their retention at the AZ is CAPS2-dependent. Strikingly, a newly developed “Flash and Freeze-fracture” method revealed selective transfer of CAPS2 to the presynaptic membrane during phasic release. Thereby, we propose a novel two-pool mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8D</xref>) underlying the unusual GBR-mediated potentiation of neurotransmitter release from MHb terminals.</p><p id="P24">To our knowledge, all currently known synapses release exclusively in a tonic or phasic manner at a given frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The MHb terminal in the IPN is the only example capable of a rapid and reversible transition between tonic and phasic release modes at the same release frequency. The combination of our functional and structural data indicates that the two modes co-exist in the same terminals with two distinct populations of SVs selectively involved in these two modes. First, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of MHb terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>) showed increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in all responsive axons but detected no new axons appearing after GBR activation, indicating that the same axons are involved in both tonic and phasic release. Second, “Flash &amp; Freeze” revealed an increase in docked SVs in the vast majority of terminals after recovery from phasic release depletion, whereas the docked SV numbers were similarly low in the control and depletion conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>), indicating that single population of terminals increase docked SVs in phasic mode and depleted them to the same level as tonic mode. Third, “Flash &amp; Freeze-fracture” showed that the increased CAPS2 labeling in the phasic mode (Stimulation + Baclofen) always co-localized with SPO labeling at the AZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 6C</xref>), indicating that the same terminals have CAPS2- and SPO-associated SVs. Fourth, SPO- and CAPS2-deficient mice have selective impairments in tonic and phasic release, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), but the vast majority of MHb terminals were labeled for SPO and CAPS2 with a large overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>), indicating that tonic and phasic SVs co-exist in the same terminals. Fifth, tonic and phasic SVs have distinct coupling tightness, indicating different distances from Cav2.3 in the AZ. Sixth, “Flash &amp; Freeze-fracture” showed a constant level of SPO at the AZ in the presence and absence of baclofen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 6B</xref>), indicating GBR-independent release of SPO-associated SVs in both tonic and phasic modes, whereas the drastic increase in CAPS2 number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>) and CAPS2/SPO ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B-C</xref>) by baclofen indicates selective recruitment of CAPS2-associated SVs in the phasic mode. In addition, the positive correlation between SPO and CAPS2 numbers in each AZ in the presence but not the absence of baclofen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 6C</xref>) suggests that evoked co-release of SPO- and CAPS2-associated SVs occurs only in phasic release. No significant co-localization of CAPS2 and SPO in the AZ membrane also supports separated fusion sites for the two SV populations. These results provide strong support for the two-pool mechanism with distinct SV populations, SPO- and CAPS2-associated ones mediating tonic and phasic release, respectively, in the same MHb terminals.</p><p id="P25">We interpret the convergence of tonic and phasic release to similar EPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) as an indicator of their parallel nature. However, this assumes that the phasic pool depletes completely, which is not described in other phasic synapses at low stimulation frequencies. On one hand, lack of complete depletion in other synapses might be caused by the presence of an “invisible” tonic component that is masked by the depressing phasic pool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. On the other hand, in addition to a parallel SV pool model, our results could also be interpreted according to a recently proposed two-step sequential docking model which categorizes SVs into different docking categories but draws them from a single, molecularly homogenous pool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Under baseline conditions, the majority of SVs may be in a loosely docked state (SV<sub>LS</sub>) with only a small proportion SVs in a tightly docked, fusion-competent configuration (SV<sub>TS</sub>). With repeated stimulation, SVs may gradually transition Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependently from LS to TS to fusion until a steady-state is reached. Accordingly, baclofen may shift the resting ratio of LS/TS pools towards TS, resulting in a higher proportion of tightly docked SVs at rest. Although the starting pool ratios of LS/TS in tonic and phasic release are different, repeated stimulation in the presence of baclofen would still lead to the same steady-state as during tonic release, resulting in apparent conversion of facilitated tonic and depressed phasic EPSC amplitudes. According to the sequential model, the release pattern of the loosely-docked pool closely matches our partial phasic responses to the first repetitive stimulation in WT and those to all repetitive stimulations in CAPS2 KO. This could suggest that 1) SV transition from a loosely to a tightly docked state during phasic release induction and 2) CAPS2 mediates the tight docking required for the full phasic release. Importantly, however, a selective recruitment of CAPS2 to the AZ during phasic but not tonic release is difficult to explain with a molecularly homogenous SV pool from which all SVs are drawn. The distinct coupling distance of tonic and phasic SVs and no significant co-localization of SPO and CAPS2 in the AZ also favor the parallel model.</p><p id="P26">Unexpectedly, we identified SPO as a mediator of tonic release augmentation. Until now, no clear functional role of SPO has been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Synaptoporin (also called synaptophysin 2) is a homologue of synaptophysin with several molecular distinctions, one of which is the direct binding to Cav2.3 R-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. It is conceivable that the interaction of SPO with Cav2.3 in MHb terminals underlies the tighter coupling of tonic compared to phasic release vesicles. Furthermore, Cav2.3 might serve as an anchor point for tonic vesicles during augmentation and loss of this anchor might result in impaired recruitment of tonic vesicles to the AZ during tonic release.</p><p id="P27">Similar to SPO, the function of the cytosolic CAPS2 protein in fast neurotransmission has remained elusive. Although the more widely expressed CAPS1 is a known mediator of phasic release in the hippocampus, CAPS2 KO alone did not induce any alterations in fast neurotransmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Instead, CAPS2 was found to serve as a mediator of neuropeptide and neurotrophic factor release during development in other brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,</sup>. Therefore, we cannot rule out developmental alterations in MHb terminals of CAPS2 KO. The CAPS2 function found in MHb terminals, which exclusively express CAPS2 isoform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, may be masked in other synapses expressing both CAPS1 and CAPS2. Approximately 40% of CAPS proteins elude in the membrane fraction in whole-brain lysates and synaptosomal preparations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, suggesting that they are often membrane-bound. Importantly, CAPS2 is also located on SVs in parallel fiber terminals in the cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Thus, the recruitment of CAPS2 to the AZ we observed during phasic activity could result from the fusion of CAPS2-associated SVs, although we cannot rule out that cytosolic CAPS2 is recruited to the AZ by other mechanisms. Most strikingly, in WT MHb terminals, phasic release induction was activity-dependent, with the first repetitive stimulation showing a partial phasic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 5A</xref>) but inducing a fully potentiated response to the subsequent repetitive stimulation. In contrast, in CAPS2 KO mice, the repetitive stimulation induced the partial phasic response every time as if it were the first stimulation. These results suggest that phasic vesicles are activity-dependently recruited to the AZ and, upon fusion with the membrane, CAPS2 proteins associated with the fused vesicles remain at the fusion site, potentially via the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding C2 and the plexstrin homology (PH) domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The remaining CAPS2 at the AZ might serve as docking sites for replenished vesicles via their Munc13 homology (MHD) and MUN domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, resulting in an increase in the RRP. Contrary to this hypothesis, a previous study in CAPS1/2-deficient hippocampal cultured neurons found that the PH but not the MUN domain was required for CAPS2-mediated RRP recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. In the CAPS2 KO, phasic vesicles have to be recruited to the AZ “from scratch” at every stimulus train, which may be interpreted as synaptic short-term memory loss of prior activity and thus, CAPS2 might be viewed as an engram molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">Our results suggest that the same somatic firing pattern in the MHb <italic>in vivo</italic> may produce two distinct output signals from IPN neurons. Specifically, phasic release likely induces short-duration burst firing in IPN neurons followed by periods of silence, whereas tonic release may produce prolonged, uninterrupted firing. A main IPN projection target is the median raphe nucleus (MRN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, a serotonergic center that modulates a multitude of forebrain functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Interestingly, tonic excitation of MRN neurons via the IPN is hypothesized to disrupt hippocampal theta oscillation through MRN-derived serotonergic innervation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. In addition, high-frequency firing GABAergic MRN neurons have been shown to be active in either tonic or phasic rhythms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Similarly, the IPN also projects to the lateral habenula neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> which exhibit a tonic excitation and phasic inhibition patterns during motivation-related behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Interestingly, downregulation of CAPS2 in MHb neurons induces depression-like phenotypes in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Thus, tonic and phasic IPN output patterns might modulate forebrain serotonergic signaling through control of raphe activity as well as motivational states through lateral habenula projections.</p><p id="P29">Furthermore, activation of GBRs on MHb terminals might selectively strengthen inputs from low-frequency (1 Hz) firing cells, as terminals of high frequency (10 Hz) firing MHb cells might rapidly revert to basal release strength following RRP depletion. What could be the source of GABA for the transition to phasic release? Since the vast majority of IPN neurons are GABAergic and innervate each other together with MHb-derived cholinergic inputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, local GABA release from presynaptic or postsynaptic IPN neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> might regulate their MHb-driven output through the activation of presynaptic GBRs. Although the trigger for retrograde GABA release is unknown, a coincidence detection mechanism may be envisioned where secondary excitatory projections to the IPN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> raise ambient GABA concentrations high enough to activate GBRs on MHb terminals.</p><p id="P30">The surprising two-pool mechanism we discovered raises several questions: Which factors retain CAPS2 in the AZ during phasic release?

Neurons of the rostral and central IPN were visually identified using an infrared differential interference contrast video system in a BX51 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Electrical signals were acquired at 20 – 50 kHz and filtered at 4 kHz using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier connected to a Digidata 1440A digitizer (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) with pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices). Stimulating electrodes (CBBPC75, FHC, Bowdoin, ME) were placed bilaterally on the fasciculus retroflexus and electrical stimulation (10 Hz, 3 seconds, 0.2 ms pulse duration, 0.5 – 2.5 V stimulation intensity) of left or right habenular axon fiber tracts was applied via a stimulus isolator (AMPI, Jerusalem, Israel). Neurons were voltage-clamped at –60 mV in whole-cell mode. Recordings with access resistances exceeding 20 MΩ or with changes in access resistance or holding current by more than 20% were discarded. Access resistance was not compensated. At each sweep, left and right fiber tracts were stimulated separately with 5–s intervals and inter-sweep intervals of 20 s.

Because the decay time course of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in the closed single compartment model is mostly determined by the affinity and the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers, we systematically altered the GCaMP6 concentration in the simulation to examine which concentration could best reproduce the experimentally observed decay of GCaMP6. Decay time constant was linearly increased proportional to the GCaMP6 concentration. The fitting line (<bold>F</bold>) suggests the presence of 78 µM GCaMP6 in the MHb terminal under control condition. But for simplicity and convenience, we used 100 µM GCaMP6 in the simulations below. <bold>G – H</bold> The effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer change on the peak of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. The property of Ca buffers can affect not only the decay time course but also peak amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. Among the Ca buffer species in this simulation GCaMP6 is predominant, because other buffers (ATP and endogenous fixed buffer) have much larger Kd values thereby making a marginal contribution to total Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding capacity (Ks). Thus, if baclofen changes the property (affinity and concentration) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers by some cellular mechanisms, our simulation can mimic the effect by changing GCaMP6 concentration. When we increased GCaMP6 concentration, peak ΔF/F (DFF) became smaller, the opposite direction from the observed effect of baclofen. When we decreased or even removed GCaMP6 in the simulation, the simulated DFF amplitude was increased. However, the regression line (<bold>H</bold>) predicted the largest DFF of 3.5, far below the observed potentiation by baclofen (<bold>B</bold>). <bold>I – J</bold> The effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion on the peak of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. The other parameter affecting peak amplitude and decay time course of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in the single compartment is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion. In the simulation under control condition, we used extrusion rate of 0.9/ms <sup>1</sup>. Decreasing extrusion rate achieved larger DFF like the observed effect of baclofen. This simulation also suggested that GCaMP6 was not saturated. However, reduced extrusion also prolonged the decay time course (<bold>J</bold>), not consistent with the imaging experiment (<bold>D</bold>). <bold>K – M</bold> The effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx on the peak of Ca transients. In the last, we tested the possible increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the MHb terminal. This can be achieved either by the change in the conductance of single Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, the number of VGCCs, or the duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (and the combination of these). When we increased the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to 2.3-fold, the simulated traces well reproduced the GCaMP6 fluorescent change in the presence of baclofen. Increase in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in simulation also accelerated the 50% rise time (<bold>L</bold>), but not significantly affected the decay time course of transients (<bold>M</bold>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156492-f010"/></fig><fig id="F11" position="anchor"><label>Extended Data Figure 3</label><caption><title>related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>: GFP expression in MHb terminals of ChAT-ChR2-EYFP mice and “Flash and Freeze” sample preparation</title><p id="P54"><bold>A</bold> Left, an example image of HRP reaction of anti-GFP labeling in ChAT-ChR2- EYFP mice in the rostral/central IPN.

Left: In the basal release condition, tonic SPO-positive SVs are loosely docked in close vicinity of Cav2.3, whereas CAPS2-positive phasic SVs are located more distally and undocked. Action potential-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is small and only closely located SPO-positive tonic SVs fuse with the AZ membrane. Right: In the enhanced release condition, GBR activation coupled with action potential-mediated depolarization produces a massive influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which initially triggers release of closely located SPO-positive tonic SVs but also rapidly recruits larger number of distal CAPS2-positive phasic SVs (middle) to the AZ. The subsequent action potentials trigger the release of both closely located tonic and newly recruited phasic SVs, resulting in an increased RRP (right). Following the fusion of CAPS2-positive phasic SVs, CAPS2 remains membrane-bound and may act as a docking site for replenished phasic SVs, resulting in retention of the increased RRP.</p><p>See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156492-f008"/></fig></floats-group></article>
