However, these drugs often do not produce equivalent results in human clinical trials. Here, we show how different animal models infected with some of the most clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants, WA1/2020, B.1.617.2/Delta, B.1.1.529/Omicron and BA5.2/Omicron, have independent outcomes. We show that in mice, B.1.617.2 is more pathogenic, followed by WA1, while B.1.1.529 showed an absence of clinical signs. Only B.1.1.529 was able to infect C57BL/6J mice, which lack the human ACE2 receptor. B.1.1.529-infected ACE2 mice had different T cell profiles compared to infected K18-hACE2 mice, while viral shedding profiles and viral titers in lungs were similar between the ACE2 and the C57BL/6J mice. These data suggest B.1.1.529 virus adaptation to a new host and shows that asymptomatic carriers can accumulate and shed virus. Next, we show how B.1.617.2, WA1 and BA5.2/Omicron have similar viral replication kinetics, pathogenicity, and viral shedding profiles in hamsters, demonstrating that the increased pathogenicity of B.1.617.2 observed in mice is host-dependent. Overall, these findings suggest that small animal models are useful to parallel human clinical data, but the experimental design places an important role in interpreting the data.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>animal models</kwd><kwd>Omicron B.1.1.529</kwd><kwd>Omicron BA5.2</kwd><kwd>Delta B.1.617.2</kwd><kwd>WA1/2020</kwd><kwd>LD<sub>50</sub> survival</kwd><kwd>K18-hACE2 mice</kwd><kwd>Syrian hamster</kwd><kwd>body weights</kwd><kwd>lung titers</kwd><kwd>memory T cells</kwd><kwd>cytokines</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>activation induced memory (AIM)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Worldwide transmission of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the human population has contributed to the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). The emergence of new variants refers to viral genome adaptation in which mutations in the spike gene RBD (receptor binding domain) drastically increase binding affinity in the RBD-human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) complex, while also transmitting rapidly in human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The emergence of new variants in dominantly immunologically naïve populations suggests that adaptive mutations in the viral genome continue to improve viral fitness in unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals. A single amino acid change in the Spike protein at position 614 (D614G) in the ancestral strain (i.e., WA1/2020) from Aspartic Acid to Glycine was identified in a small fraction of sequenced samples and quickly became the predominant variant worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The fitness advantage conferred by this single amino acid change was supported by major increases in infectivity, viral load, and transmissibility <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P3">SARS-CoV-2 variants are still emerging around the world, posing new public health threats due to the differential efficacy of vaccines against multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains. Even in highly endemic regions, new variants have replaced the formerly dominant strains, resulting in infection and mortality spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Among the reported sub-lineages, B.1.617.1 is designated as a variant of interest and B.1.617.2/Delta as a variant of concern (VOC) by the World Health Organization. The rise in COVID-19 cases worldwide, during the second wave of infection, was speculated to be due to the high transmission potential of the Delta variant. This variant replaced the others in circulation, and was reported in 142 countries. The characteristic mutations reported in the spike gene of the B.1.617 lineage are D111D, L452R, D614G, P618R, and E484Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). These mutations suggest increased viral binding to ACE2, transmissibility, secondary attack rate, hospitalization risk, and escape of immune neutralization. The potential impacts of the Delta variant on vaccine and therapeutic effectiveness are uncertain, as limited data are available. Recent studies have reported decreased neutralization efficiency in vaccinated individuals and resistance to monoclonal antibody therapy against the Delta variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P5">A number of Omicron sublineages have been described. The initial Omicron wave was caused by the B.1.1.529 (BA.1) strain which, compared with ancestral WA1/2020, contains 30 amino acid substitutions, 6 amino acid deletions, and 3 amino acid insertions, which are largely clustered at the sites of interaction of potently neutralizing antibodies the ACE2 interacting surface, around the N343 glycan, and in the NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Immunological memory and response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to reduce the severity aid in the protection against infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). It is important to understand how the immune system in different animal models responds to infection when translating animal research to humans. CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells have been found to be induced after infection and vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). These T cells have also been found to protect animals against infection even in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Further, CD4+ T cells are critical to aid in the development of antigen-specific memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Thus, understanding how different variants stimulate immunological memory is critical. Of interest, the Omicron variant is known to be able to infect hosts regardless of ACE2 status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). In this report, we investigate the immunological response to Omicron infection in two mouse strains: one which includes the human ACE-2 receptor (K18-hACE2), and the strain of origin (C57BL/6J) which lacks this receptor.</p><p id="P7">There is now growing evidence that Omicron causes a less severe pathology than the ancestral strain and other VOCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). It has been shown that alpha, beta, gamma, and Delta VOCs replicate efficiently in the lungs of Syrian hamsters and to a similar level as the ancestral strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Here, we show the infectivity of the Omicron and Delta variants versus the WA1/2020 ancestral strain D614 in mouse and hamster models.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Enhanced lethality in B.1.617.2-infected K18 mice and reduced pathogenicity in B.1.1.529-infected K18 mice</title><p id="P8">We sought to investigate the infective dose (ID<sub>50</sub>) and/or lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) of the three most clinically relevant variants of SARS-CoV-2: B.1.617.2/Delta, the first and most prevalent in the human population in 2021 (known for being highly pathogenic in humans); B.1.1.529/Omicron (BA.1), the variant that displaced Delta and became the most prevalent in 2022 (less pathogenic but more transmissible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>)); and Ancestral WA1/2020, no longer in the population but is the strain that currently-approved vaccines are based on, as well as used to test therapeutics against COVID-19. We conducted mouse infection experiments using the ancestral WA1/2020 isolate (containing ancestral D614), B.1.617.2 (also known as 21A Delta or 21A/S:478K with the D614G substitution), and B.1.1.529 (also known as 21K Omicron with D614G and 35 more mutations). hACE2 transgenic mice (K18-hACE2) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>] were used in three independent experiments with several serial dilutions of our viral stocks. Here, we summarize the LD<sub>50</sub> for WA1/2020 compared to the lower dose of B.1.617.2/Delta and the higher dose of B.1.1.529/Omicron. Mortality started at Days 8-9 (8-9 days post-infection (d.p.i.)), where 50% of the animals infected with 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> WA1/animal succumbed to infection. Animals infected with a dose of 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> Delta/animal presented 100% mortality by Day 8 (data not shown). Interestingly, the lower dose of 1 × 10<sup>1</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> Delta/animal presented 100% mortality by Day 11. Conversely, the higher dose (our straight viral stock) of 9 × 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> Omicron/animal presented no SARS-CoV-2 disease-associated mortality as shown by the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>]. Body weight loss of 1 × 10<sup>1</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/Delta-infected mice was significantly greater (P=0.0371) than that of 9 × 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/Omicron-infected mice and similar to 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/WA1 across 14 dpi, on average [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>].</p><p id="P9">Viral burden in lungs was measured by a TCID<sub>50</sub> infectivity assay at 3 dpi with 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/WA1 (n=7), 1 × 10<sup>1</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/B.1.617.2/Delta (n=7), and 9 × 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/Omicron (n=4) on randomly selected animals after interim sacrifice. The variant with the highest viral burden was WA1 with an average of 7 × 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mg, followed by Delta with 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mg, and Omicron with 7.9 × 10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mg. However, due to high variability and small sample size, no statistically significant differences were found regarding viral burden after ANOVA analysis [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>]. Therefore, we were unable correlate higher titers and pathogenicity. Further, the animals infected with 1 × 10<sup>1</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of B.1.617.2/ Delta that met predetermined criteria for moribundity on Day 6 were euthanized to avoid unnecessary pain and distress. Lungs were collected from these moribund animals for histopathological evaluation. Moribund lungs were observed to have multifocal necrosis, neutrophilic infiltrates, hemorrhage, edema, loss of pneumocytes, epithelial hyperplasia, infiltration with neutrophils, pulmonary intra-alveolar macrophages (PIMs), and red blood cells when compared to lungs of Mock infected animals [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Host-dependent pathogenicity of B.1.617.2, WA1/2020 and BA.5 infection in hamsters</title><p id="P10">In contrast to other rodents, the Syrian hamsters (<italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic>) are naturally susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, allowing for them to be rapidly developed into a common model. The hamster SARS-CoV-2 model recapitulates many characteristic features seen in human patients with a moderate, self-limiting course of the disease, such as specific patterns of respiratory tract inflammation, vascular endothelialitis, and age dependence, while not producing the outcome of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). We aimed to elucidate whether the increased pathogenicity of B.1.617.2 compared to WA1 observed in mouse experiments translates to the non-lethal hamster model. To address this, we intranasally infected hamsters with Delta and WA1 at the mouse-lethal dose of 5 × 10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> and the higher dose of our viral stocks for Omicrons BA.1 and BA.5 of 6.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/animal.</p><p id="P11">We found that the same dose of 5 × 10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> for Delta and WA1 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>] produced similar outcomes. The body weight loss was similar for both variants in the hamster model. Animals had a weight loss of 4% on average at 4 dpi [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>]. Additionally, viral replication kinetics in lungs (estimated by RT-qPCR on lung tissues from 3 and 6 dpi for WA1 and 4 dpi for Delta), reflect similar copy numbers in both strains [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>]. In hamsters, we were also able to measure viral shedding profiles (through estimation of viral copy number by RT-qPCR) in oropharyngeal swabs at different time points after infection. Shedding profiles from hamsters infected with 5 × 10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of Delta, WA1, BA.1 or BA.5 show a peak viral load 2 dpi and a consistent decrease in viral load until 4-5 dpi; no significant differences regarding variants were observed. These data suggest that the observed increase in pathogenicity in mice by Delta is relative to the host and not directly related to the viral variant [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>]. In contrast to mice, hamsters appeared to suffer an acute peak of infection before they recover. Virus shedding was consistent between strains on Day 2, the highest viral burden in lungs was measured on Day 3, and the highest body weight loss was on Day 4 regardless of viral strain [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Reduced pathogenicity of B.1.1.529/Omicron BA1-infected mice</title><p id="P12">We next assessed the infectious dose (ID<sub>50</sub>) for B.1.1.529/Omicron in C57BL/6J mice to investigate the strain’s reported adaptation (due to multiple genetic changes) to no longer require human ACE2 for infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). We conducted mouse infection experiments in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice and the non-transgenic strain of origin, C57BL/6J [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>]. Serial dilutions of B.1.1529/Omicron viral stock, from 9 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>5</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>4</sup>, to 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/animal in K18-hACE2 mouse, and 9 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>5</sup>, to 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/animal in C57BL/6J, were utilized. The K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with the higher dose of 9 × 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> was the only group that presented a slight reduction in body weight, with a peak of −1.4% body weight loss at day 7, but on day 8 animals recovered, and further weight was gained by Day 12 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>]. However, none of the other dosing groups (either K18-hACE2 or C57BL/6J) presented a consistent body weight loss [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>] or had any other clinical signs. We next compared viral burden in lungs by RT-qPCR [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>] and TCID<sub>50</sub>. The K18-hACE2 mice sustained moderate levels of infection as shown for the average of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mg in the lungs. The levels of viral RNA were comparable to the TCID<sub>50</sub> assay [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>]. Similar results were observed for C57BL/6J mice infected with 9 × 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>. This group also presented similar levels of viral burden in lungs to K18-hACE2 mice. In this model, we aimed to have an additional readout due to a lack of clinical signs, body weight change or mortality. For ethical reasons, we are not able to perform nasal washes in mice to obtain viral shedding profiles. However, we performed oropharyngeal swabs in alert animals from Days 2-4 post-infection. The shedding profiles obtained from the oral swabs show that viral RNA had similar levels (on average) in K18-hACE2 and C57BL/6J mice infected with 9 × 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> across timepoints (P &gt;0.005, multiple regression) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Spike-specific T cell phenotypes in Omicron infected K18-hACE2 and C57BL/6J mice</title><p id="P13">Finally, we assessed inflammatory responses in the spleens of K18-hACE2 mice at 21 dpi. SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cell responses were first measured using flow cytometry activation-induced marker (AIM) assay [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>] by stimulating cells with an overlapping peptide pool of Omicron’s spike domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). When comparing AIM+ phenotypes, there was no difference in the percentage of CD8+AIM+ cells, regardless of mouse model or omicron challenge status. In contrast, in K18-hACE2 mice, the baseline of uninfected CD4+AIM+ T cells was significantly lower than in infected K18-hACE2 mice <bold>[Inner Left</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>]. This was not observed in C57BL/6J CD4+ T cells. However, when unstimulated controls were subtracted from Omicron Spike Peptide treated samples, this effect was abolished <bold>[Far Right</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>]. This phenomenon displays that there was not a marked observed difference between antigen-stimulated and unstimulated wells, regardless of challenge. It may also demonstrate that baseline antigen specificity was altered by the presence of challenge in K18-hACE2 mice that was not present in C57BL/6J mice.</p><p id="P14">SARS-CoV-2 memory T cells were measured by stimulating cells with an overlapping peptide pool of Omicron’s spike domain. Four T cell memory phenotypes were considered via flow cytometry: naïve (Tn; CD45RA+CCR7+), central memory (Tcm; CD45RA-CCR7+), effector memory (Tem; CD45RA-CCR7-), and terminally differentiated effector memory (Temra; CD45RA+CCR7-) cells. Regardless of AIM status, there was no significant difference in T cell memory phenotype in CD8 T cells between infected and uninfected animals [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, <bold>left]</bold>. In contrast, both CD4+ T cells and CD4+AIM+ T cells in K18-hACE2 infected mice observed a significant decrease in Tcm cells and an increase in Tem cells in comparison to uninfected K18-hACE2 mice [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <bold>right]</bold>. Interestingly, CD4+AIM+ cells were mostly Tem cells, with Tcm second [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <bold>right]</bold>. In contrast, CD4+ T cells without sorting for AIM+ were mostly Tcm cells, with Tem second [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, <bold>right]</bold>. Thus, while the trend of increase/decrease in the presence of omicron infection remained the same, the overall pool of memory T cells shifted when observing activation induced cells towards Tem.</p><p id="P15">Next, SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses were measured by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) for IFN-γ, TNF-α, or Granzyme B. Interestingly, while CD4+ T cells showed a possible increase in AIM+ cells and a change in memory phenotype, we did not observe significant differences in cytokine production (data not shown). Instead, cytokine production differences were observed in CD8+ T cells in K18-hACE2 mice [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>]. No significant increases in cytokine production were observed in C57BL/6 mice (data not shown). Both CD8+ and AIM+CD8+ T cells expressed a significant increase in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IFN-γ+TNF-α+. A significant increase was not observed with Granzyme B or triple producers. Data was further analyzed to assess the distribution of single, double, and triple cytokine producing T cells in K18-hACE2 mice. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> show that without Omicron infection, most cytokine producing CD8 T cells only produce one cytokine. In contrast, mice that were challenged with Omicron were dominantly double producers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">In COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory illness, the main clinical manifestation is pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, our data suggest that WA1/2020, B.1.617.2/Delta, and B.1.1.529/Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants replicate efficiently in the lungs of the K18-hACE2 heterozygous mouse and Syrian hamster models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Our results indicate that in mice, Delta is most pathogenic, followed by WA1, and Omicron was absent of clinical signs. This is similar to what has been described for human infections population-wise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Interestingly, Omicron was able to infect C57BL/6J mice that do not have the human ACE2 receptor. Viral shedding profiles and viral titers in the lungs were similar between the K18-hACE2 and the C57BL/6J. These data indicate viral adaptation to a new host and a confirmation of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers that accumulate and shed virus even in the absence of clinical signs.</p><p id="P17">Next, we show how the same dose of Delta and WA1 have similar viral replication kinetics, pathogenicity, and viral shedding profiles in hamsters. This demonstrates that the increased pathogenicity observed in mice is host-dependent and not associated with viral replication.</p><p id="P18">In contrast to similar viral shedding profiles and titers between K18-hACE2 and C57BL/6J mice, our data suggest that K18-hACE2 mice, but not C57BL/6J mice, have a change in the CD4 memory T cell repertoire towards effector memory cells and an increase in CD8 T cell cytokine production after Omicron infection. Since K18-hACE2 mice demonstrated changes in the T cell immune response while C57BL/6J mice did not, this suggests that the hACE2 receptor is necessary for generating immunological memory and T cell cytokine production against SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="P19">While we did not observe significant changes in the CD8 T cell memory markers, just cytokine production, this may be due to the timing of splenocyte collection. Typically, CD8 memory T cells spike 8 dpi after the initial encounter with a pathogen and reduce to 5-10% of that initial population over the following weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Due to this natural reduction over time, 21 dpi may have been enough time for these memory T cells to return near to baseline levels. Of note, we observed a similar trend to the CD4 memory cells (an increase in Tem) and a slight decrease in Temra, but these changes were not significant. We do observe antigen-specific cytokine responses, which does suggest that memory CD8 T cells were generated from the initial challenge and re-stimulated with the Omicron spike peptides. Further studies should be performed using peptides from other regions of Omicron (such as the nucleocapsid) and at multiple time points to determine the full T cell response against the virus in K18-hACE2 mice, as it has been reported that memory CD4 T cells can bind the M, spike, N, nsp3, nsp4, ORF3a, and ORF8 regions (among others), while CD8 can also bind the M region and multiple ORFs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Overall, these findings suggest that small animal models are useful to parallel human clinical data, but the experimental design places an important role in interpreting the data.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><p id="P20">No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.
