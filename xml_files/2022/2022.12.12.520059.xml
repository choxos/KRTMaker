Plants secrete hundreds of hydrolytic enzymes (including proteases, glucosidases and lipases), many of which accumulate to high levels during defence. These pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins include chitinases, glucanases, and proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Van Loon <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Doehlemann &amp; Hemetsberger, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). In response, most pathogens secrete hydrolase inhibitors when colonising the apoplast to manipulate the host and cause disease. For instance, the oomycete plant pathogen <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> secretes Epi1 and Epi10, which are Kazal-like protease inhibitors that suppress defence-related subtilisin-like protease P69B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Tian <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Tian <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Tian &amp; Kamoun, 2005</xref>). <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> also secretes cystatin-like protease inhibitors (EpiCs) that target papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) in the tomato apoplast. Tomato PLCPs are also suppressed by Cip1 and Avr2, secreted by the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> and the fungus <italic>Cladosporium fulvum</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Rooney <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Shabab <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">van Esse <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Shindo <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Hydrolase inhibition is not limited to proteases. Soybean pathogen <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> produces glucanase inhibitor GIP1 (Glucanase Inhibitory Protein 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Rose <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) and the fungal corn pathogen <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> produces PEP1 (Protein Essential during Penetration 1) to inhibit secreted maize peroxidase POX12, thereby preventing the oxidative burst associated with defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hemetsberger <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Taken together, hydrolase inhibition in the apoplast by pathogen-derived molecules is a common infection strategy used to manipulate the host.</p><p id="P7">We hypothesised that suppressed hydrolases play an important role in immunity. To test this, we used activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), which allows monitoring of protein activities without previous knowledge of substrates or enzyme purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cravatt <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Morimoto &amp; van der Hoorn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Benns <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). ABPP involves the incubation of a proteome with a chemical probe, which contains a warhead that covalently reacts with the active site; a linker; and a tag to facilitate detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Morimoto &amp; van der Hoorn, 2016</xref>). In combination with analysis by mass spectrometry (MS), ABPP-MS has been applied to study dynamic changes in the activities of serine hydrolases (SHs) in tomato upon infection with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>fulvum</italic> and <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic>, as well as in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis) upon infection with <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kaschani <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Sueldo <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; Planas-Marques <italic>et al</italic>., 2017). Here, we greatly increased the power of ABPP-MS with a cocktail of biotinylated probes and taking advantage of a unique model pathosystem.</p><p id="P8">The interaction between <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> and the bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> DC3000 (<italic>Pto</italic>DC3000) provides an ideal system to study hydrolase suppression in the apoplast. The extraction of apoplastic fluid from <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> is a relatively simple procedure, ensuring high yield and purity. <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> is susceptible to the model plant pathogen <italic>PtoDC3000</italic> when it lacks the type-III effector hopQ1-1 (<italic>ΔhQ</italic>), which would otherwise trigger immunity via the Roq1 immune receptor of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wei <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Schultink <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Using the <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic>-<italic>Pto</italic>DC3000 model pathosystem and a fluorescent probe labelling retaining ß-glycosidases, we previously discovered the suppression of BGAL1, an apoplast-localised ß-galactosidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Buscaill <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). BGAL1 participates in flagellin de-glycosylation and thereby plays a major role in the release of the flagellin elicitor that is universally recognised in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Buscaill <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). The activity of BGAL1 is suppressed by a small molecule inhibitor produced by <italic>Pto</italic>DC3000 to promote disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Buscaill <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). This discovery illustrates that suppressed hydrolases play important roles in plant immunity. Here, we explored hydrolase dynamics in apoplastic fluid of infected plants using ABPP-MS with a cocktail of biotinylated probes to uncover additional suppressed hydrolases during infection.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The apoplast is rich in hydrolases</title><p id="P9">To investigate the accumulation of hydrolases in the apoplast of infected and non-infected plants, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> was infiltrated with water (mock) and <italic>Pto</italic>DC3000(<italic>ΔhQ</italic>). We extracted apoplastic fluids (AFs) at 2 days post infection (2dpi), then digested the proteomes with trypsin and analysed them by LC-MS/MS. We robustly identified 217 proteins carrying a predicted signal peptide (SP, by SignalP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Almagro Armentero <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Classification of these 217 proteins using PFAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">El-Gebal <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) revealed that 48% of these apoplastic proteins are hydrolases (105 proteins, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). The other 112 apoplastic proteins are diverse and include eight inhibitors and 13 peroxidases.</p><p id="P10">The 105 detected hydrolases consist of 31 proteases, 47 glycosidases and 27 lipases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Detected apoplastic proteases belonged to the mechanistic class of Ser proteases (SPs, 20 proteins), Cys proteases (CPs, six proteins), and other proteases (five proteins) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The 20 Ser proteases include 12 subtilisin-like proteases (SBTs, S8 family) and six Ser carboxypeptidase-like proteases (SCPLs, S10). The six Cys proteases are all papain-like Cys proteases (PLCPs, C01). The 47 glycosidases belong to 18 different glycosyl hydrolase (GH) families, which include nine GH17 glycosidases, six GH16 glycosidases, five GH3 glycosidases, and four glycosidases each from families GH19, GH28 and GH35. Finally, the 27 lipases include 12 GDSL-lipases, three pectinacetylesterases (PAEs) and 12 other lipases. This proteome composition is similar to that of a previously reported proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Buscaill et al., 2019</xref>, ACE_0058).</p><p id="P11">Protein concentrations in the apoplast can increase 10-fold upon infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Table S2</xref>), so we corrected our proteomics dataset for this by calculating the MS intensity per mL of apoplastic fluid to facilitate the comparative analysis of protein concentrations. When plotted in a volcano plot, the protein concentrations of abundant hydrolases significantly increase upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), consistent with the well-known accumulation of PR proteins, such as chitinases and glucanases (Van Loon et al., 2008). Consequently, apoplastic hydrolases are a major component of the apoplastic proteome of infected plants. When ranked by MS intensity, which is an approximation for protein abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cox <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), 30 hydrolases are amongst the top quartile of most abundant proteins in the apoplast of infected plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). In conclusion, a large proportion of the extracellular proteins encountered by pathogens during infection are hydrolytic enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Large-scale activity profiling of the apoplast upon bacterial infection</title><p id="P12">To investigate changes in hydrolase activities in the apoplast caused by bacteria, we investigated changes in active hydrolases upon bacterial infection with ABPP-MS. To display the active proteome, we labelled the apoplastic proteome with a cocktail of biotinylated activity-based probes including FP-biotin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>), JJB111 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chandrasekar <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) and DCG04 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Greenbaum <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>) to display the active serine hydrolases (SHs), glycosyl hydrolases (GHs), and cysteine proteases (CPs), respectively. We also included the custom-made Biotin-PD-AOMK (DK-D04, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Figure S1A</xref>) to detect vacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs), which have been detected in apoplastic fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Sueldo <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Biotinylated proteins were purified and analysed by MS in n=4 replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The annotation of ABPP-MS spectra to the proteome of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kourelis <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) enabled the detection of 171 predicted probe targets that were all enriched (α=&lt;0.05) compared to the no-probe-control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Table S3</xref>). These probe targets included 109 SHs, 49 GHs and 13 CPs. Overall, 157 target proteins were differentially labelled between mock and <italic>Pto</italic>DC3000(<italic>ΔhQ</italic>) treatments (α=0.05), indicating that 92% of the detected active proteome changes significantly during bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>). Of the 97 activities that increased upon infection, 78 were SHs, 16 were GHs, and three CPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, we detected 60 reduced hydrolytic activities, including 24 SHs, 27 GHs and nine CPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Overall, bacterial infection induces mostly active SHs and reduces mostly active GHs and CPs. Importantly, the suppressed hydrolases include BGAL1 (3.67-fold down-regulated, p value = 1.65E-07), as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Buscaill <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). These results indicate that the active apoplastic proteome undergoes large changes during bacterial infection, including 57% of the hydrolases having increased activity, and 35% having reduced activity. Of the 97 increased active hydrolases, 74 had a fold change of at least 2 (FC≥2), consisting of 63 SHs, nine GHs and two CPs. Likewise, 25 of the 60 reduced active hydrolases also had FC≥2, consisting of six SH, 14 GHs, and five CPs.</p><p id="P14">Although the general trend is that active SHs are induced and active GH and CPs are reduced, we observed many differences within each hydrolase subfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). We identified 28 active GDSL-like lipases, 23 (most) of which showed increased activity in infected tissues. We also identified 21 subtilisin-like serine proteases (S8, SBTs), of which nine showed decreased activity and nine increased activity upon bacterial infection. Furthermore, we identified 18 serine carboxypeptidase-like proteases (S10, SCPLs) of which twelve had increased activity during infection. We also detected ten carboxylesterases (CXEs) and six pectin acetylesterases (PAEs), all of which were more active upon infection. Of the 17 detected active GH3s, seven were less active in infected tissue. We also detected six active GH79s and six GH35s, including BGAL1 (NbD029635) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Buscaill <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Eight of the 13 detected papain-like proteases (C01) had a reduced activity upon infection. Both detected VPEs are less active in infected tissue. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the active apoplastic proteome changes drastically upon bacterial infection.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>One of the tested suppressed hydrolases inhibits bacterial growth</title><p id="P15">An independent experiment confirmed differential activities for 90 of the detected hydrolases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>). We chose five new hydrolases with a predicted SP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Almagro Armentero <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) that showed robustly suppressed activities upon bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

Here, we explored the apoplast of a model plant-pathogen interaction with activity-based probes and were able to monitor 171 active hydrolases, of which 97 showed increased activity, and 50 had reduced activity upon infection. Disease assays on leaves transiently overexpressing five selected suppressed hydrolases revealed that <italic>Nb</italic>PR3 has antibacterial immunity that requires its active site residue. Despite its annotation as chitinase, <italic>Nb</italic>PR3 has no chitinase or lysozyme activity, presumably because of a E112Q substitution in the active site. This substitution is conserved in <italic>Nicotiana</italic> and is essential for antibacterial activity.</p><p id="P24">As pathogenic bacteria have adapted to a susceptible host, we anticipate that they will actively suppress secreted hydrolases that may directly or indirectly harm them. Therefore, consistently suppressed hydrolases might be components of the plant immune system that are targeted by pathogen-derived inhibitors. We identified 60 suppressed hydrolases that may play an active role in immunity. Massive changes in protein activities can be caused by altered pH or ion strength, but the influence of these factors was prevented by buffering the AF. Many of the suppressed hydrolases are Cys proteases, which might be suppressed by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, not all Cys proteases are suppressed, indicating that the suppression is caused by selective inhibitors rather than ROS. Indeed, we previously showed that <italic>Pto</italic>DC3000(<italic>ΔhQ</italic>) produced Cip1, which is selectively targeting immune-related Cys proteases of tomato (Shindo <italic>et al</italic>., 2006). Besides Cys proteases, several glycosidases are also suppressed. This includes BGAL1, which is inhibited by a small molecule produced by <italic>Pto</italic>DC3000(<italic>ΔhQ</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Buscaill et al., 2019</xref>). However, given the large proportion of changes, we cannot rule out a general apoplastic regulator (i.e. metabolites, specific ions and post-translational modifications) might influence global protein activities.</p><p id="P25">Secreted hydrolases that are suppressed during infection can be important novel components of the extracellular immune system of plants. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed the hydrolases to overcome the threshold of suppression during infection. Indeed, we found that transient overexpression of <italic>Nb</italic>PR3 results in increased immunity to <italic>Pto</italic>DC3000(<italic>ΔhQ</italic>), confirming that supressed hydrolases may act in immunity. Likewise, we found that transient overexpression of BGAL1 increases bacterial resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Buscaill <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). However, not all suppressed hydrolases reduced bacterial growth upon overexpression in our agromonas assay. This might be because their overexpression does not overcome the suppression mechanism or because they act in immunity without reducing bacterial growth in the agromonas assay.</p><p id="P26">The mechanism by which <italic>Nb</italic>PR3 mediates antibacterial immunity, however, remains mysterious. Overexpression of PR-Q in tobacco upregulates multiple defence related genes, an observation which was thought to originate from an unfolded protein response (UPR) caused by the presumed accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). We, however, found that the E92A and Q112E mutants of <italic>Nb</italic>PR3 accumulate equally well but do not trigger immunity, ruling out the UPR being responsible for the observed resistance. That the catalytically important glutamate E92 is essential for the role of <italic>Nb</italic>PR3 in our agromonas assays, implies that catalysis by <italic>Nb</italic>PR3 is required for immunity. However, despite its annotation as an endochitinase, <italic>Nb</italic>PR3 lacks endochitinase activity, at least in our current assays. The absence of bacteriolytic activity indicates that <italic>Nb</italic>PR3 does also not hydrolyse peptidoglycan, unlike Arabidopsis LYS1, a secreted GH18 lysozyme that releases immunogenic fragments from peptidoglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P27">The absence of chitinase and lysozyme activities of <italic>Nb</italic>PR3 is probably caused by the absence of the second catalytic glutamate, which is a glutamine (Q112) in <italic>Nb</italic>PR3. Interestingly, Q112 is a conserved feature of <italic>Nicotiana Nb</italic>PR3 proteins, occurring in all <italic>Nicotiana Nb</italic>PR3 orthologs, including tobacco PR-Q. This indicates that this E112Q substitution must have occurred in a <italic>Nicotiana</italic> ancestor within the solanaceous plant family ~50 million years ago. Importantly, this Q112 substitution is essential for antibacterial activity, indicating that an antifungal PR protein was <italic>neo</italic>-functionalised to gain antibacterial activity. The finding that other residues relevant for chitin binding are still present in <italic>Nb</italic>PR3 indicates that <italic>Nb</italic>PR3 acts on a bacterial glycan.</p><p id="P28">We discovered that the level of active <italic>Nb</italic>PR3 is consistently downregulated upon infection with virulent <italic>Pto</italic>DC3000(<italic>ΔhQ</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), even though the level of the <italic>Nb</italic>PR3 protein increases upon infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Figure S8</xref>), consistent with being a PR protein.

To label hydrolases, apoplastic fluid samples were incubated in a 50 μl reaction with 0.2 μM FP-TAMRA (for serine hydrolases), or a 250 μl reaction with 2 μM I912 (for cysteine proteases), in the presence of 5 mM DTT and 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5 at room temperature for one hour (serine hydrolases) or four hours (for cysteine proteases). After labelling, the reaction was stopped by precipitation in 4x ice-cold acetone followed by resuspension in 4x gel loading buffer and heating at 90°C for 5 minutes.
