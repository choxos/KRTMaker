Thirty-four clinical isolates were obtained from the same hospital 12 months later. A total of 165 isolates were characterised and whole-genome sequenced, with 24 isolates subjected to long-read sequencing. The diverse population included representatives of 59 different sequence types (STs). ICU patient and environmental isolates were largely distinct from staff isolates and clinical isolates. We observed five instances of highly similar isolates (0-13 core-gene SNPs) being obtained from different patients or bed unit environments. ESBL resistance in this collection was largely conferred by <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub> genes, which were found in 96.4% of all isolates. The contexts of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub> genes were diverse, situated in multiple chromosomal positions and in various plasmids. We identified <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub>-bearing plasmid lineages that were present in multiple STs across the surveillance, staff and clinical collections. Closer examination of IS<italic>Ecp1</italic>-<italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub> transposition units shed light on the dynamics of their transmission, with evidence for the acquisition of chromosomal copies of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub> genes from specific plasmid lineages, and for the movement of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M-55</sub> from a ST1193 chromosome to a small mobilisable plasmid. A carbapenem-resistant ST167 strain isolated from a patient that had been treated with meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam contained seven copies of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CMY-146</sub>, which appears to have been amplified by IS<italic>1</italic>. Our data revealed limited persistence and movement of ESBL-EC strains in the ICU environment, but we observed circulating plasmid lineages playing an essential and ongoing role in shaping the cephalosporin-resistance landscape in the population examined.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>ICU</kwd><kwd>ESBL</kwd><kwd>plasmid</kwd><kwd>transposition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S3" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3"><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> occupies a niche in the human gastrointestinal tract that makes it an important vehicle for mobile genes that confer resistance to clinically-relevant antibiotics. Some clones from the vastly diverse <italic>E. coli</italic> population can cause human infections,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> so the importance of antibiotic resistance gene carriage by the species is twofold: infections caused by antibiotic-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> are more difficult to treat, and antibiotic resistance genes carried by human-associated <italic>E. coli</italic> can be transferred to other Gram-negative pathogens. Extended-spectrum β-lactam (ESBL)-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> (ESBL-EC) usually carry one or more of the various horizontally-acquired β-lactamase (<italic>bla</italic>) genes that can be located in various chromosomal positions or in plasmids.

Movement of <italic>bla</italic> genes from chromosomal sites to plasmids, or between plasmids, can increase their intercellular transfer potential. Alternatively, transposition from plasmids into chromosomal sites might increase the stability of <italic>bla</italic> genes in new hosts.

statement</title></caption><p>ESBL resistance significantly impacts clinical management of <italic>E. coli</italic> infections in hospitals globally. It is important to understand the structures of ESBL-EC populations carried by hospital patients and staff, their capacity to persist in hospital environments, and the dynamics of mobile genes that drive the spread of ESBL resistance. In our three-month study, ESBL-EC strains found in the ICU environment were strongly associated with patient carriage, but distinct from strains found in staff. However, plasmid lineages carrying <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub> genes were found across the ICU populations and in a collection of clinical isolates obtained one year later. By examining their content and contexts, we have traced the recent histories of chromosomal and plasmid-borne IS<italic>Ecp1-bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub> transposition units in the ICU population. This allowed us to implicate specific plasmid lineages in the acquisition of chromosomal <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub> genes, even when the plasmids were no longer present, and to detect recent transposition of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M-55</sub> from a chromosome to a mobilisable plasmid. Similar high-resolution approaches to the study of mobile genetic elements will be essential if the transmission routes associated with the spread of ESBL resistance are to be understood and subjected to interventions.</p></boxed-text><boxed-text id="BX2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Data summary</title></caption><p>Sequencing reads are available under NCBI BioProject accession PRJNA907549.
