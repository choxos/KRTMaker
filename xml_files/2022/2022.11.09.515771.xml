Communication across biofilms has been shown to involve chemical signaling and, more recently, electrical signaling in Gram positive biofilms. We report for the first time, community-level synchronized membrane potential dynamics in three-dimensional <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms. Two hyperpolarization events are observed in response to light stress. The first requires mechanically sensitive ion channels (MscK, MscL and MscS) and the second needs the Kch-potassium channel. The channels mediated both local spiking of single <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms and long-range coordinated electrical signaling in <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms. The electrical phenomena are explained using Hodgkin-Huxley and 3D fire-diffuse-fire agent-based models. These data demonstrate that electrical wavefronts based on potassium ions are a mechanism by which signaling occurs in Gram negative biofilms and as such may represent a conserved mechanism for communication across biofilms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>biofilm</kwd><kwd>Kch</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Dense microbial communities attached to surfaces are classified as biofilms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.

A microcluster is defined as a cell community in which intercellular distances do not exceed two cellular diameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1 C</xref>). We applied the same light stimuli as before to <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α microclusters. We observed a rapid rise in intensity, a decay and subsequently a persisting second peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S2</xref>). The analysis of time-to-first peak latencies in sparse and microclustered cells showed that the average time-to-first peak was 7.34 ± 10.89 ± 4.44 min (<italic>mean ± SD ± SE</italic>) and 3.24 ± 1.77 ± 0.53 min (<italic>mean ± SD ± SE</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>) respectively. The membrane potential dynamics of single cells showed more variability in spikes and less synchrony in the phases of the first spikes than those in microclusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B, Fig 1D</xref>). This suggests that random electrical signaling in <italic>E. coli</italic> synchronizes as the cells become clustered. We would expect that mutual shielding from the light at higher cell densities should decrease the irradiance that cells experience which should increase the reaction time of the bacteria, however, in our experiments the opposite is observed.

We exposed our biofilm to blue light. We observed a spontaneous rapid rise in spikes within cells in the center of the biofilm while cells at the periphery remained significantly less bright (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A, 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S3</xref>). The ion-channel mediated wave fronts moved from the center of the biofilm to the edges. At this point, the whole biofilm had an equal level of fluorescence intensity. The wavefronts then rapidly collapsed from the edges to the center of the biofilm. Once the wavefront reached the center, the whole system engaged in a period of quiescence and remained dark even in the presence of the continued external light stimulation. After a few minutes of inactivity, the wavefront reemerged from the center of the biofilm and slowly reached the periphery of the biofilm. After reaching the edges for the second time, the hyperpolarization persisted, and the entire biofilm remained bright and showed no noticeable change in response to the continued presence of the external stimuli. The latency of the first peak was 2.73 ± 0.85 ± 0.15 min (<italic>mean</italic> ± <italic>SD</italic> ± <italic>SE</italic>).

Furthermore, the variability of the latency (<italic>SD</italic>) was much lower.</p><p id="P11">Biofilms of different shapes and sizes were grown and we observed similar intensity profiles for all the biofilms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The peaks of the spiking profiles in all the biofilms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) show that the amplitude of the action potentials does not depend on the size of the biofilm. Consequently, we focused our analyses on time-related properties of the wavefront profiles. Action potentials in eukaryotic organisms are stereotyped events; therefore, the time-dependent properties of the spikes carry the information about the amplitudes of external stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The intensity profile of different biofilms across several experiments shows that the wavefront dynamics is robust once the biofilm has an appreciable size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). These data provide evidence that coordinated signalling directs ion-channel mediated wavefronts in <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms.

For all the irradiances we observed a first peak in the ThT fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). The time to the first peak decreased as the light irradiance was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). The fast burst of hyperpolarization and repolarization only occurred above the threshold of 15.99 μW/mm<sup>2</sup>. For irradiances above this threshold, the dynamics exhibited progressively faster hyperpolarization to the second peak with increased light, which was not observed for irradiances below the threshold.</p><p id="P16">We thereafter examined the extracellular changes in the potassium ion, K<sup>+</sup> ions, within regions close to biofilms. We used the yellow-green fluorescent potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) indicator, ION potassium Green-4 (IPG-4), which can track changes in extracellular concentrations of potassium. We observed a sharp rise, a quiescence period and then a plateau similar to that of the ThT dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).

Student t-test showed that blue light stress damage to the kch-mutant is significant when compared with the DH5α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>).

Our Hodgkin-Huxley conductance model predicts that the membrane potential dynamics in <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms are due to cooperative signaling between two distinct positively charged ion channels (Q and Kch) whose conductivities are voltage gated. We propose that the dynamics causes a process of long-range electrical communication of light stress in the <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm. We also propose that the source of the photooxidative stress was due to increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the vicinity of cells which gradually builds up as the light stress persists.</p><p id="P21">We predicted that the ion-channels activate and deactivate differently under the light stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A,5B</xref>). Ion channel Q activates faster than the Kch channel, but deactivates slower than the Kch channel. Hence, while the Q channel activation dynamics is more pronounced for the sharp spike of the first peak, the Kch channel controls its subsequent decay. After the first action potential, the Q channel inactivates and contributes minimally to the dynamics. The Kch ion channel then controls the slow refractoriness and plateau which persists for a longer period in the presence of constant light stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>). This prediction supports our results from the deletion of the Kch ion channel from <italic>E. coli</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Our two ion-channel electrophysiological model correctly produced the same profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>) as the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). This model also predicts that the two spikes perform different roles in <italic>E. coli.</italic> The first spike registers the presence of light stress in the environment, while the second spike modulates the light stress by keeping the cell dynamics robust to the intensity of the external light stress. This mode of signaling is like a specialized type of electrical signaling in neurons called <italic>habituation</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs 6A,6B</xref>).

The model also predicts that the opening of the ion channels creates an increased concentration level of the extracellular ions which subsequently results in the depolarization of neighboring cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">We hypothesized that <italic>E. coli</italic> not only modulates the light-induced stress but also handles the increase of the ROS by adjusting the profile of the membrane potential dynamics. We therefore varied the ROS stress production coefficient at different levels of light in the model. We observed a noticeable change in the membrane potential dynamics. With reduced ROS, the first spike became sharper and the quiescent time lasted longer than previously, with the second peak occurring at much higher intensities of light. With increased ROS, the first spike lasted less than 30 seconds and the 2<sup>nd</sup> spike plateau rose to a much higher fluorescence value.

The model consists of two ion-channel gates. The first channel (bronze, Q) is unknown. The second channel is the potassium channel, Kch (yellow). At the onset regime 0, both ion channels are closed. Exposure to light stress results in a rapid opening of the <italic>Q</italic> channel, which has a faster-opening gating variable than the Kch channel (regime I). The <italic>Q</italic> channel has little contribution to the repolarization event, hence the overlap of regimes I and II (the blue light is present for both regimes).
