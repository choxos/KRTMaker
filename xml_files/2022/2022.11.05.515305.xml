Despite the recent success of vaccines and approval of first-generation anti-viral inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2, an expanded arsenal of anti-viral compounds that limit viral replication and ameliorate disease severity is still urgently needed in light of the continued emergence of viral variants of concern (VOC). The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is the major non-structural protein required for the processing of viral polypeptides encoded by the open reading frame 1 (ORF1) and ultimately replication. Structural conservation of Mpro among SARS-CoV-2 variants make this protein an attractive target for the anti-viral inhibition by small molecules. Here, we developed a structure-based <italic>in-silico</italic> screening of approximately 11 million compounds in ZINC15 database inhibiting Mpro, which prioritized 9 lead compounds for the subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> validation in SARS-CoV-2 replication assays using both Vero and Calu-3 cells.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, the etiological agent of COVID-19 and its ever-increasing evolutionary variants, has become a global health emergency with an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies to combat the disease. Despite the remarkable and rapid success of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> in the U.S. and other developed countries, significant infection risk remains among unvaccinated people, immunocompromised or otherwise vulnerable individuals forming a substantial reservoir to support viral spread, which make small-molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication urgently needed. In addition, vaccines mitigate but do not eliminate the likelihood of severe disease. Finally, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), such as the latest strain Omicron, which is highly contagious with increased likelihood to escape vaccine-derived immune surveillance, have raised concerns about the efficacy of the current vaccines, thus illustrating the importance of a wide arsenal of tools to combat the evolving current SARS-CoV-2 strains or novel future coronaviruses altogether.</p><p id="P3">The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes several structural proteins including the membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S) proteins as well as multiple non-structural proteins that are necessary for viral replication or the manipulation of the host immune response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CLPro) is a cysteine protease that is critical for the cleavage of two polypeptide chains encoded by the overlapping open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b into functional proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Among these proteins is the essential RNA polymerase RdRp that is responsible for the replication of viral genome and whose activity is severely compromised without prior proteolytic cleavage by Mpro. In addition to the processing of viral proteins necessary for the viral replication machinery, Mpro has also been suggested to interfere with the induction of cellular type I and type III interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokine responses, either directly through the proteolytic cleavage of members of the IFN signaling cascade or indirectly by promoting the processing of other viral proteins that themselves interfere with IFN signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The pharmacological inhibition of Mpro may therefore also limit viral replication by inducing a type I and type III IFN-dependent anti-viral state of the host cells.</p><p id="P4">To identify novel inhibitors of Mpro, we developed an <italic>in-silico</italic> pipeline to screen compounds in the ZINC15 database against Mpro and prioritized 9 lead compounds. We then validated the function of these lead compounds by using replication assays with SARS-CoV-2 in both rhesus monkey kidney-derived Vero cells and human lung-derived Calu-3 cells and identified three novel compounds that can significantly suppress the replication of SARS-CoV-2 by interfering with Mpro, therefore these compounds serve as starting point for further drug development.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mpro is conserved among SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern</title><p id="P5">The frequent occurrence of mutations in the viral spike (S) protein among SARS-CoV-2 VOCs suggest that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 remains under evolutionary pressure to adapt to the human ACE2 receptor. Mpro may be less sensitive to such selective pressure as it has a substrate specificity for viral proteins with unique glutamate-containing cleavage sites that are distinct from the sites used by known human proteases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. To evaluate whether Mpro is indeed structurally conserved among known SARS-CoV-2 strains, we compared the consensus sequence of original North-American WA1 strain to a range of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including B.1.1.7(Alpha), B.1.351(Beta), B.1.427 &amp; B.1.429 (Epsilon), B.1.525 (Eta), B.1526 (Iota), B.1.526.1, B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta), P.1 (Gamma), P.2 (Zeta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron), as well as the more distantly related human coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS. We found that there are only three substitutions (K90R, L205V, P132H) in Mpro across all VOCs of SARS-CoV-2 (Online Method, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The recently determined X-ray crystal structure of Mpro (PDB ID: 6W63) reveals four distinct regions of the main protease protomer, namely Domain I (residue 10-99) and Domain II (residue 100-184) that form antiparallel β-barrels, followed by a long connecting region (residues 185-200), and finally Domain III (residues 201-303) that forms a cluster of helices <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The substrate binding site is located in the cleft between domain I and domain II <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Compared to WA1, we found only three mutations in Mpro, namely a K90R mutation in the B1.351 (Beta) strain and a L205V mutation in the P2 (Zeta) strain, and P132H mutation in B.1.1.529 (Omicron), none of the mutated residues were part of the substrate binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, the mutation rate was significantly higher in S protein with 78 mutations (substitution, deletion, and insertion) (Online Method, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Together, this comparison suggests that the substrate binding site of Mpro is more conserved among all known human SARS coronaviruses, thus making this an ideal anti-viral drug target.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Integrative <italic>in-silico</italic> screening identified novel candidate inhibitors of Mpro</title><p id="P6">Structure-based virtual screening is a fast and powerful method for lead compound discovery. We developed an integrative approach for <italic>in-silico</italic> screening and prioritizing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, Online Method) compounds targeting Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. In step 1, we downloaded 11 million Drug-Like In-Stock 3D small molecules from ZINC15 database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and the X-ray crystal structure of Mpro from RCSB Protein Data Bank. In step 2, we prepared the X-ray crystal structure of Mpro with the Protein Preparation Wizard in Maestro from Schrödinger and prepared ligand by removing compounds with reactive functional groups to obtain 10.4 M compounds. In step 3, we defined the binding pockets of Mpro based on the reported inhibitor X77 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6W63">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6W63</ext-link>). In step 4, we performed virtual screening with Schrödinger <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> to select top-500 lead compounds(Online Method). In step 5, we prioritize the top-ranked 500 lead compounds by integrating two complementary strategies (Online Method), which lead to the selection of total 9 lead compounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) for <italic>in-vitro</italic> testing.</p><p id="P7">The identified 9 lead compounds showed higher binding affinity with Mpro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). From the molecular interaction analysis of docked complexes, we observed that all the 9 lead compounds show hydrogen bonding interactions and other potential hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions with Mpro. All the 9 lead compounds were bound to the same binding site. Residue Leu141, Asn142, Gly143, Glu166, and Gln189 were the common interacting residues between Mpro and 9 lead compounds, which suggested the crucial role of these residues in stabilizing the Mpro-ligand complex. Importantly, to demonstrate our 9 lead molecules are robust against VOCs of SARS-CoV-2, we built Mpro structures with K90R mutation in the B1.351 (Beta), L205V mutation in the P2 (Zeta), and P132H mutation in B.1.1.529 (Omicron), by using UCSF Chimera<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> followed by the Protein Preparation Wizard in the Schrödinger package and validated all compounds by docking them to these three mutant structures of Mpro. The docking results showed very similar binding affinities of these lead compounds to the mutant structures compared to wild-type Mpro suggesting that these lead compounds have the potential for the robust inhibition of the currently known VOCs of SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> validation of inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection</title><p id="P8">We tested the ability of the selected 9 lead compounds to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection in two experimental settings. Initially, we infected Vero cells with SARS-CoV-2 immediately after the addition of increasing concentrations of the lead compounds and measured the number of infected cells by viral reduction plaque assay 4 days later. Cells infected in the absence of the compounds served as positive control, whereas uninfected cells cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of the compounds served as control for cytotoxicity. We observed a significant decrease in the number of infected cells compared to positive control for three of the 9 lead compounds, i.e. PATH-6, PATH-7, and PATH-8. We measured the cytopathic effect (CPE) on Vero cells 4 days after infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of increasing concentrations 0.001 to 100 μM of the three compounds, starting at the time of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In parallel, we also determined the cytotoxicity of these compounds over the same dose range. These experiments revealed that PATH-6, PATH-7, and PATH-8 inhibited virus-induced CPE with an EC50 between 1.57 – 9.3 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). Importantly, PATH-6 showed no sign of cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and PATH-7 showed no sign of cytotoxicity within 10 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Overall, these experiments confirmed 3 out of the total 9 lead compounds significantly suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection <italic>in vitro</italic> and especially PATH-6 is a promising compound for further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P9">Mpro, the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, plays a central role in the cleavage of the ORF1-encoded pp1a and pp1ab polypeptides to produce active viral proteins, including the RNA polymerase RdRP. Pharmacological inhibition of Mpro therefore likely inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection directly by preventing the replication of viral RNA genomes. Across currently 12 VOCs of SARS-CoV-2, the sequence of Mpro is significantly more conserved than the sequence of Spike protein, with only 3 mutations outside its known binding pocket. Therefore, Mpro represent an attractive drug target to interfere with viral replication. Recent studies have reported the possible inhibitors against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Indeed, the recent approval of Paxlovid (PF-07321332), a derivative of the Mpro inhibitor GC376, demonstrated this target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. While the emergence of the first clinical SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor is encouraging, it is also clear that the continued expansion of the arsenal of anti-viral drugs is highly desirable.</p><p id="P10">In the present study, we developed an <italic>in-silico</italic> screening pipeline which integrated the structure-based docking with pharmacokinetics prediction to prioritize approximately 11 million compounds for their ability to bind to Mpro and to block its enzymatic activity in the process of viral replication. To cross-check the binding affinities of the experimentally validated compounds predicted by our <italic>in-silico</italic> screening pipeline, we examined the binding mode of these compounds; PATH-6 occupied the binding pocket with a Glide docking score of -11.79 kcal/mol, Vina score of -8.73 kcal/mol, and MOE score of -14.81 kcal/mol. It forms seven hydrogen bonds with residues of Gly143, His164, Glu166, Thr190 and Gln192. PATH-7 fitted in the binding pocket with a Glide docking score of -8.99kcal/mol, Vina score of -7.77 kcal/mol, and MOE score of -6.86 kcal/mol. There are three hydrogen bonds formed between this compound and residue Ser144, Cys145, and Gln189. PATH-8 located in the binding site with a Glide docking score of -9.00 kcal/mol, Vina score of -9.97 kcal/mol, and MOE score of -7.6 kcal/mol. Four hydrogen bonds were formed between the compound and residues Cys44, Thr190, and Gln192. The hydrogen bond, van der Waals, hydrophobic and Pi-Pi interactions between the validated three compounds and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro mainly occurred at the catalytic pocket with strong bonding to His41 and Cys145, indicating these residues may be particularly responsible for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.</p><p id="P11">To test their inhibitory activity of SARS-CoV-2, we performed two rounds of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. The initial <italic>in vitro</italic> infection of cells with SARS-CoV-2 identified three out of the 9 lead compounds (PATH-6, PATH-7 and PATH-8) as potentially inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We further fully confirmed the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection for these compounds using a diverse set of assays in two distinct cell lines, namely African green monkey Vero cells and human lung Calu-3 cells.</p><p id="P12">In summary, our study identified 3 novel compounds, i.e. PATH-6, PATH-7, and PATH-8, that not only directly inhibit viral replication by binding to Mpro, but also released the suppression of cellular anti-viral immune response by the virus. Hence, our antiviral compounds can be further optimized and added to the existing reservoir of the COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors for future drug development against SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Sequence alignment of Spike and 3C-like proteinase and its variants</title><p id="P13">The protein sequences of Spike glycoprotein variants and 3C-like proteinase variants of SARS-CoV-2 isolates were retrieved from NCBI <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/coronavirus/proteins/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/coronavirus/proteins/</ext-link>).

The cells were routinely monitored for the absence of mycoplasma infection.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Compounds</title><p id="P22">Potential inhibitors of Mpro identified in the virtual screens were obtained from MolPort and eMolecules and dissolved at 10 mM in PBS or PBS + 10% DMSO. The compounds were further diluted &gt;100-fold in tissue culture medium containing 5% FCS to obtain working concentrations for the viral replication assays.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Virus production</title><p id="P23">SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1 and West Nile virus (WNV) strain NY99 were obtained from BEI Resources and propagated in Vero cells. The cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.005 and with WNV at an MOI of 0.01. After 48 hr (SARS-CoV-2) or 72 hr (WNV) of culture, the cells were harvested with a cell scraper and spun and together with the culture medium at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were set aside while the resuspended cell pellets were treated with a Dounce homogenizer and subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles before combined with the original supernatants. Following an additional centrifugation step, supernatants were aliquoted, frozen, and subsequently titered in serial dilutions by viral plaque assay. All work with SARS-CoV-2 and WNV was performed under BSL3 conditions in a facility with negative pressure and PPE that included Tyvek suits and N95 masks for respiratory protection.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Viral plaque and foci assays</title><p id="P24">The number of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions was quantified by viral plaque assay. To this end, Vero cells were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 for 2 hr and subsequently overlaid with 1% methylcellulose in culture medium. After 3-4 days, the cells were fixed in 10% formalin for 30 min, washed under tap water, and stained with crystal violet. The number of plaques corresponding to infections of individual cells by single virions was counted on a light table. The quantification of infectious WNV virions was performed similarly with the exception that the number of infected cell foci was determined by intracellular staining using a biotinylated anti-WNV-E antibody (clone E16), followed by an HRP-labeled anti-streptavidin antibody. HRP activity was detected with KPL Trueblue substrate (SeraCare).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Cytopathic effect and cytotoxicity measurements and other assays to determine drug activity</title><p id="P25">Viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of Mpro inhibitors was measured in Vero or Calu-3 cells in three ways. In the first approach, Vero or Calu-3 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01in the presence of indicated concentrations of Mpro inhibitors and, if applicable, with 1.5 μM of the P-gp inhibitor CP-100356. The virus-induced cytopathic effect was measured by determining the fraction of formalin-fixed adherent cells that remained after 3 days (Vero cells) or 4 days (Calu-3 cells). To this end, the cells were stained with crystal violet, PBS-washed, and air-dried. Following resuspension in methanol, crystal violet staining was measured in the Spectrophometer at OD594. Cytotoxicity of the compounds was measured in parallel by the staining of uninfected cells incubated with the Mpro. In a second approach, drug activity was determined in Vero cells directly by viral plaque assay, using between 100-500 Pfu/well of virus and indicated concentrations of Mpro inhibitors. In a third approach, Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 or WNV at an MOI of 0.01 in the presence of 100 mM of Mpro inhibitors for 2-3 days. Viral replication was measured indirectly at indicated time points by quantifying the titers of infectious virions in the supernatants with viral plaque or foci assays in the absence of the compounds. Viral replication in Calu-3 cells in the presence of indicated concentrations of compounds was determined similarly.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>RT-qPCR</title><p id="P26">RNA was isolated from infected cells, reverse-transcribed with random hexamers, and subsequently amplified using the SYBR mix on a Quant3 Real-Time PCR cycler.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Sequence comparison of Mpro across SARS-CoV-2 variants and other human β-coronaviruses.</title><p id="P27">The locations of non-synonymous mutations resulting in a lysine to arginine mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 (Beta) variant, a leucine to valine mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 P.2 (Zeta) variant, and proline to histidine mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant are shown in red box.</p></caption><media xlink:href="EMS156844-supplement-Figure_S1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d207aAdEbC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>Sequence comparison of Spike protein across SARS-CoV-2 variants and other human β-coronaviruses.</title><p id="P28">Mutations of Spike protein across all VOCs of SARS-CoV-2 are highlighted in red box.

CPE (red line) and cytotoxicity (black line) of the inhibitors was determined 3 days later and expressed as fraction of adherent cells in infected samples relative to uninfected controls (CPE) or untreated cells (cytotoxicity). The amount of adherent cells was quantified by the spectrophotometrical measurement of crystal violet staining. Shown are the results of (A) PATH-6, (B) PATH-7, (C) PATH-8. Each experiment was set-up in triplicates and independently repeated three times.
