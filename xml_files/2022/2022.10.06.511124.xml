O<sub>2</sub> was slowly depleted in the mesoglea in darkness, and O<sub>2</sub> concentration remained higher than ambient water in large (&gt; 6 cm diameter) individuals, even after 50 min in darkness. Light-dark shifts in large medusae showed that the mesoglea slowly turns from a net sink during photoperiods into a net source of O<sub>2</sub> during darkness. In contrast, small medusae showed a more dramatic change in O<sub>2</sub> concentration, with rapid O<sub>2</sub> buildup/consumption in response to light-dark shifts; in a manner similar to corals. These effects on O<sub>2</sub> production/consumption were also reflected in moderate pH fluctuations within the mesoglea.

Local photon scalar irradiance was highest near apical parts of the animal, while it dropped by 30-80 % underneath the same anatomical structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The largest decrease was observed between measurements on the subumbrella and exumbrella epidermis along the rhopalia canal, which dropped by 80 % on the exumbrella side. Additionally, spatial heterogeneity was observed over the subumbrella bell tissue, with rhopalia canals experiencing on average ~30 % higher photon flux compared to the anastomosing tissue right next to it.</p><p id="P27">Depth profiles of spectral scalar irradiance measured in tissue close to rhopalia canals and in anastomosing tissue showed that light scattered differently within the upper 600 μm of the two regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Profiles in anastomosing tissue showed small variations in spectral scalar irradiance measured in the top 400 μm of this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Such small variations indicate the presence of a dense symbiont population spread out in the top 400 μm of the mesoglea, between the subumbrella epidermis and the gastric network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Estes et al., 2003</xref>). Similar studies on corals have shown that light can be scattered by host tissue and symbionts in the surface layers, enhancing the chance of photon absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Wangpraseurt et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jacques et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, we observed a strong light attenuation over the first 400 μm of the tissue near rhopalia canals, with an initial enhancement of local scalar irradiance that quickly attenuated to levels below what was observed at the same depth in anastomosing tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). <italic>Cassiopea</italic> contain distinct white striated patterns in dense layers along the rhopalia canals in the bell and under oral arms (see white patches in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bigelow, 1900</xref>).

Depth profiles of O<sub>2</sub> concentration measured at saturating irradiance showed the presence of a diffusive boundary layer (DBL) over the bell tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). In light, the O<sub>2</sub> concentration increased towards the bell tissue-water interface and continued to increase as the sensor penetrated deeper into the tissue and mesoglea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). We measured to a maximum depth of 4 mm into the mesoglea reaching an O<sub>2</sub> concentration of roughly 2-fold that of the surrounding seawater concentration. A similar study, measuring O<sub>2</sub> in cut-off oral arms of <italic>Cassiopea</italic> sp., found that O<sub>2</sub> concentration was highest near symbiont populations (i.e. near the epidermis), while it decreased to a more constant level deeper into the oral arm mesoglea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Arossa et al., 2021</xref>). However, our measured depth profiles in bell tissue did not show any indication that O<sub>2</sub> buildup would stagnate or decrease at this point, suggesting even higher concentrations might be possible in the bell mesoglea relative to oral arms. Passive accumulation of O<sub>2</sub> has been reported in non-symbiotic jellyfish like <italic>Aurelia labiata</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Thuesen et al., 2005</xref>), which was found to build up O<sub>2</sub> in the mesoglea when in O<sub>2</sub>-rich water, indicating that the mesoglea can act as a natural reservoir for O<sub>2</sub> in jellyfish. However, similar to measurements in oral arms of <italic>Cassiopea</italic> sp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Arossa et al., 2021</xref>), measured depth profiles of O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in non-symbiotic jellyfish like <italic>Aurelia</italic> appear to have the highest O2 concentration near the tissue-water interface, with a steady decline towards the center of the bell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Thuesen et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast our measurements indicate that the presence of photosynthetic endosymbionts harbored within amoebocytes in the mesoglea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Colley and Trench, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Medina et al., 2021</xref>) leads to internal O<sub>2</sub> production and accumulation in deeper tissue layers during photo periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kühl et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Arossa et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P29">The diffusion of O<sub>2</sub> through cnidarian tissue and mesoglea has received little attention, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Brafield and Chapman (1983)</xref> determined an O<sub>2</sub> diffusion coefficient of 7.69x10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (Fick’s law) in the mesoglea of the sea anemone <italic>Calliactis</italic> sp. Such a low diffusion coefficient in the mesoglea (as compared to seawater) will impede mass transfer, especially in cnidarians with a particularly thick mesoglea like jellyfish and sea anemones, and is probably a key factor in the observed buffering of O<sub>2</sub> dynamics in the <italic>Cassiopea</italic> sp. bell. We further investigated the dynamics of O<sub>2</sub> in darkness and found that the top 1 mm layer of <italic>Cassiopea</italic> bell tissue turned from a net O<sub>2</sub> source into a sink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Measurements in the DBL showed a switch from a net export from the tissue into the surrounding seawater to a diffusive import of O<sub>2</sub> from the seawater within the first 15 min (compare DBLs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). A more pronounced depletion of O<sub>2</sub> was observed in the top 1 mm of the bell after 50 min darkness. The higher O<sub>2</sub> consumption near the subumbrella epidermis probably reflects the presence of abundant musculature required for bell pulsation and motility of jellyfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Blanquet and Riordan, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Thuesen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aljbour et al., 2017</xref>), as well as the presence of a dense population of endosymbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Estes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lampert, 2016</xref>). Both have previously been ascribed to heavy diel fluctuations of O<sub>2</sub> measured in <italic>Cassiopea</italic> oral arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Arossa et al., 2021</xref>). However, the O<sub>2</sub> concentration remained high at depths deeper than 1 mm into the bell even after 50 min of darkness, reflecting a lower cell density and diffusive transport of O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="P30">In the present study, experimental light-dark shifts performed on intact small (&lt; 5 cm) and large (&gt; 6 cm) <italic>Cassiopea</italic> sp. showed that the O<sub>2</sub> concentration in small medusae with a (relatively) thin bell of 2 mm thickness changed almost immediately in response to light-dark shifts similar to observed O<sub>2</sub> dynamics in corals and dissected oral arms of <italic>Cassiopea</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kühl et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Arossa et al., 2021</xref>). Unlike the fast response observed in small medusae, larger medusae with a thicker bell tissue showed a much slower response of O<sub>2</sub> levels to changes in light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). In fact, detailed O<sub>2</sub> dynamics measured in several large and small medusae revealed a consistent pattern where O<sub>2</sub> would continue to build up in the thick mesoglea of larger medusae for a few minutes after onset of darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). These observations indicate that O<sub>2</sub> generated in other regions with higher photosynthetic activity due to higher light levels and/or higher symbiont density can diffuse into and accumulate in the mesoglea, from where it is not efficiently exchanged with the surrounding water due to the relatively low O<sub>2</sub> diffusivity in mesoglea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Brafield and Chapman, 1983</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Furthermore, an inverse relationship between medusa size and photosynthetic rate have previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Verde and McCloskey, 1998</xref>). We observed a similar inverse relationship, with smaller medusae on average reaching roughly 2-fold higher photosynthetic rates (net and gross) at photon irradiances above 200 μmol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Post-illumination respiration also increased in small individuals, while larger medusae did not show changes to respiration after illumination. The combined effect of the diffusive properties of mesoglea, the relative thickness of the mesoglea, and the overall size of the animal might together explain why the O<sub>2</sub> dynamics is more pronounced in medusae (and other cnidarians) with a thin mesoglea like in juvenile <italic>Cassiopea</italic> bell or oral arms, while the O<sub>2</sub> dynamics in medusae with a thick mesoglea is much more buffered.</p><p id="P32">Consistent with the measured O<sub>2</sub> dynamics, we found that pH changes in the mesoglea were affected by changes in light, because pH increases due to photosynthetic carbon fixation in the light and decreases during darkness due to respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). This relationship between photosynthesis, respiration, and pH seems prevalent in symbiotic cnidaria (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kühl et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">de Beer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Klein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Arossa et al., 2021</xref>), largely driven by the shifting equilibrium between carbonate species (i.e.; CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) and the balance between photosynthesis and respiration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">de Beer et al. (2000</xref>) found that pH in coral tissue followed the trend of O<sub>2</sub> during experimental light-dark shifts but with a delayed response (seconds to minutes), and attributed the delay to hypothetic processes, such as proton pumps and other similar cross-tissue transport, that would buffer pH in coral polyps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Palmer and Van Eldik, 1983</xref>). External buffering has also been reported in polyps of <italic>Cassiopea</italic>, where <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Klein et al. (2017</xref>) found that polyps retained their internal pH at ambient water pH during the night, and only symbiotic polyps would increase their internal pH during photoperiods due to a shifting carbonate equilibrium. We observed a similar, but much longer (&gt;10 min) delay before a pH change was observed in the mesoglea of large medusa after light-dark shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10B</xref>). While external buffering is likely to occur in medusae of <italic>Cassiopea</italic> as well, the pH dynamics inside the mesoglea is probably more affected by diffusive transport phenomena. Depth profiles done in both small and large medusae thus show that within 15 min of darkness the top 1 mm of the bell tissue became more acidic relative to ambient water pH (0.3-0.5 pH lower; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>), while pH in deeper tissue layers (&gt;1000 μm into the bell) remained alkaline and above ambient water pH. This strongly suggest that the mesoglea has a buffering effect on pH in the bell tissue of <italic>Cassiopea</italic>.</p><p id="P33">The buffering capacity of the mesoglea could be of benefit for both host and symbionts. A reservoir of O<sub>2</sub> can e.g. act as a steady supply of O<sub>2</sub> to both host musculature, needed for bell pulsation, and to symbionts during dark periods or exposure to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Thuesen et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, buffering pH could lower the possibility of the holobiont experiencing cellular acidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Smith and Raven, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gibbin et al., 2014</xref>) that would otherwise disrupt cell-function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Madshus, 1988</xref>). Thus, symbionts harbored in amoebocytes in the <italic>Cassiopea</italic> mesoglea may exist in a more stable ecological niche as compared to algae in corals that are more prone to rapid chemical dynamics. We speculate that the buffering of the chemical microenvironment in the mesoglea of <italic>Cassiopea</italic>, might also be reflected in the fact that <italic>Cassiopea</italic> medusae generally seem to only engage with a specific type of Symbiodiniaceae. Indeed, specific strains of Symbiodiniaceae have been speculated to be favored by different hosts in symbiotic cnidarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Schoenberg and Trench, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Biquand et al., 2017</xref>), including <italic>Cassiopea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Colley and Trench, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fitt, 1985</xref>). While specificity is generally attributed to a combination of symbiont cell size and a hospitable host microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Biquand et al., 2017</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fitt (1985</xref>) found a correlation between symbiont cell size and respective photosynthesis and respiration rates, and proposed that only specific symbiont strains are able to establish symbiosis due to metabolic rates matching the hosts specific microenvironment. As such, the <italic>Cassiopea</italic>-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis may be successful even in extreme environments as <italic>Cassiopea</italic> is capable of maintaining less stress-tolerant species due to the buffering nature of the <italic>Cassiopea</italic> chemical microenvironment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Sofie Lindegaard Jakobsen for excellent technical assistance with keeping <italic>Cassiopea</italic> specimens used in this study.</p><sec id="S24"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported with an Investigator award from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (MK; Grant no.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Summary</title></caption><p>In comparison to corals, <italic>Cassiopea</italic> shares similar optical properties to that of reef-building coral tissue. Both macroscale host anatomy and microscale structures play a role in modulating the internal light field experienced by the symbionts via light scattering. Precisely how these structures affect symbiont photosynthesis remains to be explored further. Furthermore, our microsensor measurements indicated a buffering of chemical dynamics in the thick mesoglea matrix of <italic>Cassiopea</italic> sp. medusae, suggesting that the internal physico-chemical microenvironment of the holobiont remains more constant when experiencing abrupt changes in light conditions. This is in strong contrast to the rapid dynamics seen in coral tissue, which has a much thinner mesoglea and where the endosymbionts are found within endoderm cells. We hypothesize that the stabilization of the internal host microenvironment can be beneficial to the holobiont during unfavorable external environmental conditions such as hypoxia, where stored O<sub>2</sub> in the mesoglea might act as an important reserve for keeping internal homeostasis. This may also be key to the apparent success of <italic>Cassiopea</italic> to invade and persist coastal tropical habitats with strong environmental fluctuations, that often preclude coral colonization. However, further studies are required to determine the effect of the buffering capacity of large individuals in combination with true environmental stressors over short and long periods.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Normalized photon scalar irradiance (PAR, 400-700 nm) measured at (A) the manubrium center (Man.), oral arms, rhopalia canals (Rhop. canal) and anastomosing tissue (Anas. tissue) on a single adult medusa of <italic>Cassiopea</italic>.
