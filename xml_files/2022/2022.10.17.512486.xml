Growth is continuous whilst the cell cycle consists of discrete events. How the production of biomass is controlled as cells increase in size and proceed through the cell cycle is important for understanding the regulation of global cellular growth. This has been studied for decades but has not yielded consistent results. Previous studies investigating how cell size, the amount of DNA, and cell cycle events affect the global cellular production of proteins and RNA molecules have led to highly conflicting results, probably due to perturbations induced by the synchronisation methods used. To avoid these perturbations, we have developed a system to assay unperturbed exponentially growing populations of fission yeast cells. We generated thousands of single-cell measurements of cell size, of cell cycle stage, and of the levels of global cellular translation and transcription. This has allowed us to determine how cellular changes arising from progression through the cell cycle and cells growing in size affect global cellular translation and transcription. We show that translation scales with size, and additionally increases at late S-phase/early G2, then increases early in mitosis and decreases later in mitosis, suggesting that cell cycle controls are operative over global cellular translation. Transcription increases with both size and the amount of DNA, suggesting that the level of transcription of a cell may be the result of a dynamic equilibrium between the number of RNA polymerases associating and disassociating from DNA.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Scaling</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>cell size</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Proliferating steady state eukaryotic cells undergo two fundamental processes: they increase in biomass and they undergo cycles of cell division. Biomass increase is a continuous process whilst the cell cycle consists of an orderly transition through a series of specific discrete events. How these continuous and punctuated processes impact upon the accumulation of proteins and RNA, the major drivers of biomass increase, is important for understanding how overall cellular growth is regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Proteins make up 35-60 % and RNA 4-12 % of the dry mass of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] and their production consumes more than half of the ATP of a cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Previous studies of the patterns of protein and RNA through the cell cycle have led to highly conflicting results. In this paper we have addressed this problem using unperturbed steady state growing fission yeast cells.</p><p id="P4">Knowing the pattern of protein and RNA accumulation during the growth of cells though the cell cycle is an example of the general problem of scaling, a power-law relationship between two variables. The accurate scaling of protein and RNA synthesis with cell size maintains their concentration at a constant level, and there is evidence that loss of proper scaling of biosynthesis leads to cellular dysfunction and may be a causal driver for aging and senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Growth is continuous whilst cell cycle events are temporally discrete changes within cells. In particular, the amount of DNA, the template for RNA production, doubles once during S-phase early on in the cycle, and mitosis and cell division at the end of the cell cycle involve major cellular reconstruction. These can affect global cellular translation, the rate of synthesis of all proteins, and global cellular transcription, the rate of synthesis of all RNA molecules.</p><p id="P5">Global cellular translation has been investigated in numerous systems with varying results. Studies using incorporation of exogenous amino acids to measure global translation in populations of synchronised yeasts have yielded conficting results, either that global cellular translation undergoes significant changes during the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] or remains constant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. In mammalian cell cultures, studies monitoring global cellular translation through synchronised cell cycles were also contradicting, with some finding no changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] whilst others found increases and/or decreases of varying magnitudes during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Asynchronous cultures of yeasts and mammalian cells have not detected major cell-cycle related changes suggesting that previous discrepancies may have been due to synchronisation methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Previous studies of global cellular transcription through the cell cycle have relied on population measurements of the incorporation into RNA of pulse-labelled nucleobases or nucleosides in synchronous cultures. In the two yeasts, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], these studies have yielded variable results. Some studies found that RNA synthesis increased at a discrete stage of the cell cycle, either at DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] or later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], whilst others found a constant increase throughout the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. It is likely that these discrepancies arise from the different protocols used to generate synchronous populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Work in unperturbed mammalian cell lines suggests that global cellular transcription increases from G1 to G2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><p id="P6">In this work, we characterise the scaling of global cellular translation and global cellular transcription through the growth of cells and progression throughout the cell cycle using single-cell approaches in steady-state exponentially growing fission yeast cells to avoid problems induced by cell-cycle synchronisation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Single-cell assays to measure global cellular translation and transcription in asynchronous steady state exponentially growing cultures</title><p id="P7">To measure rates of global cellular translation and transcription through the cell cycle of fission yeast cells, we developed assays to quantify these rates whilst measuring cell size and identifying cell cycle stages in thousands of single cells in exponentially growing cultures. This is possible because fission yeast cells are rods that grow by tip elongation, so cell length is an indicator of cell cycle position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p><p id="P8">To quantify global cellular translation, we incubated cells with a methionine analogue, L-homopropargylglycine (HPG), and measured its incorporation into proteins using Click Chemistry. Wild type cells were incubated for 5 minutes with HPG, and were stained with an Alexa Fluor azide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). The increase in HPG labelling had almost no lag and was essentially linear for a 5-minute period after HPG addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that a 5-minute pulse could be used to estimate the rate of HPG incorporation. The pulse signal was five times the background signal. Digestion of protein molecules using Proteinase K removed the fluorescent signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>), and inhibiting translation using cycloheximide inhibited HPG incorporation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). Thus, a 5-minute HPG incubation and labelling can be used as a measure of global cellular translation. There is some HPG signal in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), which is possibly the result of nuclear translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] and/or rapid translocation into the nucleus of peptides synthesised in the cytoplasm.</p><p id="P9">To quantify global cellular transcription, we incubated cells with the uridine analogue, 5-ethynyluridine (EU) and measured its incorporation into all major RNA species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] using Click Chemistry to fluorescently label EU molecules. EU was added to a culture of exponentially growing cells expressing the human Equilibriative Nucleoside Transporter 1 (hENT1) and the herpes simplex virus Thymidine Kinase (hsvTK), necessary for the uptake and phosphorylation of EU (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). After 10 minutes, cells were fixed, permeabilised, and EU molecules were fluorescently labelled with an Alexa Fluor azide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). The EU labelling signal was linear from 2 min to 12 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>) indicating that a 10-minute incubation could be used to estimate the rate of EU incorporation into RNA. Linearity is also not much influenced by a longer 20-minute incubation. However, in contrast to the translation assay, the transcription pulse signal was less strong and was only twice the background signal so may be a less accurate estimate of the rate of transcription. Digestion of RNA molecules using RNAse A removed the EU labelling signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>), and inhibition of RNA polymerases using 1,10-phenanthronline inhibited EU incorporation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). Thus, a 10/20-minute EU incubation and labelling can be used as a measure of global cellular transcription. Although the precise fractions of the different types of RNA in global transcription have not been fully characterised, recent work indicated that only half of the newly synthesised RNA consists of ribosomal RNA molecules, suggesting that a significant portion of transcription is dedicated to the production of messenger and other RNA molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><p id="P10">To obtain single-cell measurements of cell size and global translation or transcription, we used brightfield and fluorescence microscopy in combination with automated segmentation tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. A fluorescent DNA dye (Nuclear-ID Blue) was used to identify and remove binucleated cells allowing analysis of a cell population in which all cells are composed of a single nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Global cellular translation and transcription change with cell length</title><p id="P11">We used these two assays to investigate how global cellular translation and transcription are affected by cell size, and by progression through the cell cycle within an asynchronous population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, D</xref>). We used cell length as a measurement of size, as cell length is correlated with cell volume because <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> cells are cylinders that grow by tip extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Binucleated and septated cells were excluded from the analysis to eliminate the effects of mitosis and cell division, as well as S-phase which occurs during septation in wild type cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. The median global translation increased smoothly with cell length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) and global translation per cell length was found to be constant with size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A, S2B</xref>). Thus, in the wild type cells, global translation scales linearly with cell size as mononucleated cells proceed through the cell cycle.</p><p id="P12">Likewise, median global transcription increased smoothly with cell length in the <italic>hENT1 hsvTK</italic> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), although global transcription per cell length increased somewhat as cell length increased during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A, S2B</xref>). Because the cells are growing in steady state it would be expected that the rate per unit cell length at the end of the cell cycle would be the same as at the beginning of the cell cycle. We speculate that the increase we observed may be a consequence of the low signal to noise ratio of around 2:1 leading to a technical defect in the background estimate. However, we can conclude that the rise in transcription as cells grow does not exhibit any discontinuities.</p><p id="P13">To investigate the effect of sizes beyond those of wild type cells, we used the temperature sensitive <italic>cdc25</italic>-<italic>22</italic> allele. When grown at a semi-permissive temperature, <italic>cdc25</italic>-<italic>22</italic> cells divide at longer lengths than wild type cells whilst maintaining the same growth rate and not displaying any cell cycle defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. We found that global translation increased with cell length only in cells up to a length of 15 µm, a size approximately 10 % more than the size at which wild type cells divide. In cells longer than 15 µm, the rate of global translation reduced and then plateaued at lengths above about 18 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H, I</xref>). In contrast, in an asynchronous population of <italic>cdc25</italic>-<italic>22 hENT1 hsvTK</italic> cells grown at a semi-permissive temperature of 30 °C, global transcription decreased only slightly with cell length up to lengths of 22 µm around 60 % longer than dividing wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J, K</xref>). A decrease in transcription was reported in a population of enlarged fission yeast cells blocked in the cell cycle progression, but these cells were larger being over twice the size of dividing wild type cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Therefore, the global transcription machinery is not saturated in cells up to 22 µm wilst the rate of translation plateaus at 18 µm. We conclude that the plateau of global translation is unlikely to be due to transcription becoming limiting.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Global cellular translation from G1 to G2</title><p id="P14">We next sought to determine how global translation and transcription scale with the increase in the amount of DNA at S-phase and with the cellular changes happening as cells proceed through mitosis and cell division. Wild type <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> cells spend the majority of their cell cycle in G2. The G1 phase is short so that DNA replication starts soon after completion of mitosis and is mostly completed by the time septated cells split to form two daughter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. This is also the case for the <italic>hENT1 hsvTK</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). To assay protein and RNA synthesis in exponentially growing populations with cells of overlapping sizes in G1 and G2, and to assess cell-cycle effects in cells of the same size, we used the <italic>cig1</italic>Δ <italic>cig2</italic>Δ <italic>puc1</italic>Δ (<italic>CCP</italic>Δ) strain. This mutant strain has a delayed and more variable onset of S-phase compared to wild type cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A</xref>). This means that the cell population has cells that are of the same size but which are located in the G1 or G2 phases of the cell cycle. <italic>CCP</italic>Δ cells were assayed for global translation and their DNA was stained with Nuclear-ID Blue. The maximum DNA concentration was determined within each cell and was used to classify cells as having either 1C, or 2C DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Cell lengths were also measured. In both the 1C and the 2C DNA content subpopulations, the median global translation per cell increased with cell size. The median global translation in cells of similar length increased by 35-40% in the G2 cells with a 2C DNA content compared with G1 cells with a 1C DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C, D</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To understand further the increase in global translation from G1 to G2, we identified the S-phase subpopulation using a strain containing PCNA fused to an EGFP fluorescence marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. During S-phase, EGFP-PCNA forms foci on replicating DNA so that cells in S-phase can be identified using fluorescence microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E, F</xref>). The population of cells identified with EGFP-PCNA foci almost entirely overlapped with the population of cells replicating their DNA when assayed using 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B-D</xref>) indicating that the presence of EGFP-PCNA foci reliably identifies S-phase cells. These <italic>CCPΔ EGFP-pcn1</italic> cells were assayed for global translation. We identified cells with EGFP-PCNA foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>) and classified the remaining cells as in G1 or in G2/M based on their DNA concentration and cell length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). The distributions of total fluorescence intensity per cell of Nuclear-ID Blue are similar to the distributions of DNA content in the three populations indicating a reliable attribution of cell cycle stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>). Global translation was observed to increase with cell length in all subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>). For a given cell length, global translation increased from the S to the G2/M subpopulation by about 30-35 %, but by less than 5 % from the G1 to the S-phase subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J, K</xref>). This indicates that on transition of cells from S to G2 there is about a one third increase in the rate of translation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Global cellular transcription from G1 to G2</title><p id="P16">To understand how changes related to the G1, S, and G2 phases affect global transcription, we assayed <italic>CCP</italic>Δ <italic>EGFP</italic>-<italic>pcn1 hENT1 hsvTK</italic> cells for global transcription using a 20-minute EU incubation to compensate for their lower signal production. We identified cells with EGFP-PCNA foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) and classified the remaining cells as in G1 or in G2/M based on their DNA concentration and cell length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Global transcription increased for a given cell length from the G1 to the G2/M subpopulation by around 30-35 % and the S-phase subpopulation was found to have an intermediary global transcription value between the G1 and G2/M subpopulations of around 20-25 % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J, K</xref>). This indicates that global transcription increases through S-phase, scaling approximately with the amount of DNA. An increase in global transcription with cell length and from G1 to G2 was also observed in a strain without the EGFP-PCNA marker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A-C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Thus, both global translation and global transcription increase from G1 to G2. Tanslation increases at the S/G2 transition or early in G2 and so is likely to be due to a subsequent cell cycle event dependent upon S-phase, whilst transcription increases throughout S-phase.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Global cellular translation and transcription at mitosis</title><p id="P18">Next, we determined the dynamics of global translation and transcription at mitosis. To identify mitotic cells, we used strains expressing synCut3-mCherry, a truncated version of the condensin subunit Cut3 fused to the mCherry fluorescent reporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. The synCut3-mCherry fusion protein is localised in the cytoplasm through interphase and rapidly accumulates in the nucleus at mitotic onset before being exported back to the cytoplasm from anaphase A onwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). Thus, in an asynchronous population, the progression through mitosis of each cell can be assessed based on the localisation of the synCut3-mCherry fluorescence signal and the number of nuclei in the cell. Uninucleated and binucleated cells with low nuclear synCut3-mCherry are in interphase, uninucleated cells with high levels of nuclear synCut3-mCherry are in mitosis between mitotic onset and anaphase A, and binucleated cells with high nuclear synCut3 are post-anaphase A. We assayed global translation in a <italic>synCut3-mCherry</italic> population and classified uninucleated and binucleated cells as having high or low nuclear synCut3 using their mean and median synCut3-mCherry fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). We observed changes associated with the progression of cells into and through mitosis. For a similar cell size, global translation increased around 10 % early in mitosis, and decreased by about 20 % after anaphase A to below pre-mitotic levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D, E</xref>). Thus, global translation increases and then decreases as cells proceed through mitosis. In contrast, when we assayed global transcription in the <italic>synCut3-mCherry hENT1 hsvTK</italic> strain and categorised cells as uninucleated or binucleated and having either high or low nuclear synCut3-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>), we found no change in global transcription for a given cell length in the different mitotic subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). This suggests that global transcription is not affected by the cellular changes happening in mitosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">The rate of global transcription and to a lesser extent of translation have been investigated during the cell cycle of various eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], but the outcomes of these experimental investigations have been inconsistent with one another. This is probably due to effects of the different methods of synchronisation, perturbations due to a lack of steady state growth, and possibly variations between organisms and cell types. In this work, we use a single-cell approach to generate thousands of measurements of cell size, cell cycle stage, and global cellular translation and transcription, investigating unperturbed, steady-state, exponentially growing fission yeast cells.</p><p id="P20">The rate of global cellular translation increases linearly with cell size in wild type cells but plateaus at larger sizes. It is unclear what factor(s) may become limiting for global cellular translation in these larger cells. However, since global cellular transcription increases with cell size and but does not plateau within the range of sizes assayed, the plateau in global cellular translation is unlikely to be due to RNA becoming limiting. This is consistent with previous work suggesting that growth is mainly driven by the number of active ribosomes in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] and that cells enlarged beyond wild type sizes using cell cycle arrests experience cytoplasmic dilution of their proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. The increase in global cellular translation at the S/G2 transition and at the beginning of mitosis, and the decrease later in mitosis, suggest that there is regulation of global cellular translation as cells proceed through the cell cycle. This is consistent with recent work in synchronised mammalian cells showing an increase in translation early in mitosis followed by a decrease later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Interestingly, proteins involved in translation initiation have been identified as substrates of the fission yeast cyclin dependant kinase (CDK1) Cdc2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>] and CDK1 has been shown to phosphorylate the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1) in mammalian cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>].</p><p id="P21">The rate of global cellular transcription increases with cell size in both wild type cells, and in <italic>cdc25</italic>-<italic>22</italic> mutant cells which are up to 60 % larger, and the rate of transcription is increased in cells undergoing S-phase by 20 % and is 35 % higher in G2 cells which have completed S-phase, indicating that DNA content is limiting the global rate of transcription. Previous work has suggested that transcription by one of the RNA polymerases Pol II, increases with cell size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. This, in addition to the fact that global cellular transcription does not plateau in <italic>cdc25</italic>-<italic>22</italic> cells which are up to 60 % larger than wild type cells, suggests that Pol II and other RNA polymerases are not saturated in these enlarged cells. Therefore, the increase in global cellular transcription we observe from G1, through S-phase to G2, is unlikely to be the result of an increase in the amount of saturated DNA, but rather the result of an increase in the amount of unsaturated DNA leading to an increase in the probability of association of RNA polymerases with DNA. This is consistent with the dynamic equilibrium model for Pol II proposed for budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. The dynamic equilibrium model assumes that the increase in the occupancy of RNA polymerases is due to a dynamic equilibrium between free polymerases associating with the DNA and detaching from the DNA. We did not observe a reduction in global cellular transcription through mitosis unlike previous work in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>] and budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. It is possible that undertaking mitosis without breaking down the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] prevents the reduction in transcription observed in mammalian cells undertaking an open mitosis. Another explanation might be that the larger genome of mammalian cells undergoes greater condensation for longer than is the case for fission yeast. The work carried in budding yeast was done using synchronised populations of cells so the difference observed might be the outcome of a perturbation as a consequence of synchronisation.</p><p id="P22">We propose that for the fission yeast, both translation and transcription steadily increase with cell size, but that the rate of translation becomes rapidly restricted when cells become larger than wild type dividing cells. This suggests that a component or components required for translation become limiting. It is unlikely that synthesis of RNA is the limiting factor since transcription still increases with size in cells larger than the wild type whilst translation does not. This may be related to the large resource and energy requirements of protein synthesis, meaning that there is only limited capacity for continued increase in the rate of translation. In cells dividing at wild type cell lengths, translation is regulated at different stages of the cell cycle; positively at the S/G2 transition and early in mitosis, and negatively later in mitosis. Perhaps changes in CDK activity through the cell cycle could influence the fraction of active ribosomes and be responsible for the cell cycle related changes in translation. Although the rate of transcription does not appear to be limiting in cells of this size, it is limited by DNA content. We suggest that global transcription is regulated by RNA polymerases which operate in dynamic equilibrium with DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>] and that global cellular translation is positively regulated in G2 possibly to coordinate with the increase in global cellular transcription that occurs during DNA replication.</p><p id="P23">Previous studies of global cellular translation and transcription during the cell cycle have given conflicting results. Our single cell approach gives us confidence that we have accurately described the changes of both translation and transcription with increasing cell size and progression through S-phase and mitosis/cell division in fission yeast cells. Knowledge of these changes is important for thinking about cellular control of macromolecular synthesis, and cell growth importance for the overall increase in cellular biomass. The approach we have used is employable with other eukaryotes to determine if there are conserved principles operating on these global cellular controls.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>STAR Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Key Resources table</title><table-wrap id="T1" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Reagent of Resource</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source</th><th align="left" valign="top">Identifier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="3"><bold>Chemicals</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">EMM</td><td align="left" valign="top">MP<break/>Biomedicals</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat# 114110012-CF</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">5-Ethynyluridine</td><td align="left" valign="top">ThermoFisher</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat# E10345</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">L-Homopropargylglycine</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cambridge<break/>Bioscience</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat# 11785-50mg-CAY</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">16% Formaldehyde (w/v)</td><td align="left" valign="top">ThermoFisher</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#11586711</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">NUCLEAR-ID Blue DNA stain</td><td align="left" valign="top">Enzo Life Sciences</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#ENZ-CHM103-0200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">BSA</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#A7906-100G</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Triton X-100</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#T9284-100ML</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">PBS</td><td align="left" valign="top">Gibco</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#11594516</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Sodium citrate</td><td align="left" valign="top">Fisher<break/>Bioreagents</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#BP327-500</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="3"><bold>Critical Commercial Assays</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Click-iT Plus Alexa Fluor 488 Picolyl Azide Toolkit</td><td align="left" valign="top">ThermoFisher</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat# C10641</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Click-iT Plus Alexa Fluor 647 Picolyl Azide Toolkit</td><td align="left" valign="top">ThermoFisher</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat# C10643</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="3"><bold>Experimental Models: Organisms/Strains</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>S. pombe: h- 972wt</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top">Lab collection</td><td align="left" valign="top">PN1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>SS. pombe: h- cdc25-22</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top">Lab collection</td><td align="left" valign="top">PN143</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>SS. pombe: h- leu1-32::pFS181[adh1-hENT1 leu1+] his7-336?

Fluorescence excitation is performed with a Lumencor Spectra X light engine fitted with the following excitation filters; 395/25 nm for imaging Nuclear-ID Blue; 470/24 nm for imaging EFGP, and Alexa Fluor 488; 575/25 nm for imaging mCherry; 640/30 nm for imaging Alexa Fluor 647.

Then the Analyze &gt; Analyze particles function is used with the cell masks to calculate their corresponding fluorescence measurements on the fluorescence images, comprising of the total pixel intensity, mean pixel intensity, the median pixel intensity, and maximum pixel intensity. The masks are indexed so that the single-cell measurements of the different channels and the measurement of the number of nuclei are attributed to their corresponding cell mask.</p><p id="P35">The data is then processed using R (version 4.1.0) and RStudio (version 1.4.1106). For the global cellular transcription and translation signals, the median total fluorescence intensity of the background sample(s) within an experiment (cells immediately fixed after addition of EU, or HPG) is calculated. Then, the total fluorescence intensity of each cell is divided by the median background total fluorescence intensity. This allows all experiments to have fluorescence values roughly on the same scale and is convenient for processing.</p><p id="P36">Next, the background is subtracted based on cell length. Cells are grouped based on their length in bins spanning 1 µm (unless stated otherwise). For each length bin, the median background total fluorescence intensity is calculated on the background samples and subtracted to each cell total fluorescence intensity according to its length. The total fluorescence intensity of a cell normalised by the median background total fluorescence intensity, with the median total fluorescence intensity corresponding to its length then subtracted, is used as a measure of EU, or HPG incorporation</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figure Legends</label><media xlink:href="EMS155805-supplement-Supplemental_Figure_Legends.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d37aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank J.
