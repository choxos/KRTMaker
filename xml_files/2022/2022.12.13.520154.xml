ZairaChem is fully automated, requires low computational resources and works across a broad spectrum of datasets, ranging from whole-cell growth inhibition assays to drug metabolism properties. The tool has been implemented end-to-end at the Holistic Drug Discovery and Development (H3D) Centre, the leading integrated drug discovery unit in Africa, at which no prior AI/ML capabilities were available. We have exploited in-house data collected from over a decade of drug discovery research in malaria and tuberculosis and built models to predict the outcomes of 15 key checkpoint assays. We subsequently deployed these models as a virtual screening cascade at an organisational scale to increase the hit rate of current experimental assays. We show how computational profiling of compounds, prior to synthesis and experimental testing, can increase the rate of progression by up to 40%. Moreover, we demonstrate that the approach can be applied to prioritise small molecules within a chemical series and to assess the likelihood of success of novel chemotypes, promoting efficient usage of limited experimentalresources. This project is part of a first-of-its-kind collaboration between the H3D Centre, a research centre operating in a low-resource setting, and the Ersilia Open Source Initiative, a young tech non-profit devoted to building data science capacity in the Global South.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The cost of bringing new medicines from the bench to the bedside has risen steadily since the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">DiMasi, Grabowski, and Hansen 2016</xref>). Recent estimates suggest a median cost of $1.1 billion per drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Wouters, McKee, and Luyten 2020</xref>) with research and development taking an average of ten years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Brown et al. 2022</xref>). To tighten its research pipelines and avoid costly failures, the drug discovery industry has turned to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to accelerate research timelines and reduce attrition rates. The application of AI/ML aims to transform drug discovery from a slow, sequential, high-risk process to a fast, finely-tuned and integrated pipeline that expedites the delivery of novel clinical candidates with reduced risk of failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Vamathevan et al. 2019</xref>). Notably, investment in AI/ML-based drug discovery by pharmaceutical companies and biotech startups has soared in the last five years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kirkpatrick 2022</xref>), bringing over 150 small molecules to discovery pipelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Jayatunga et al. 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The promise of AI/ML for biomedicine extends to the field of infectious diseases, which are currently underrepresented in drug discovery portfolios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">WHO 2022</xref>). Infectious diseases predominantly afflict lower-to-middle-income countries (LMICs), most of which are situated in the Global South. For example, Africa carries over 95% of the 240 million annual global cases of malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">World Malaria Report 2021</xref>) and 25% of global deaths from tuberculosis (TB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Jeremiah et al. 2022</xref>). Historically, the pharmaceutical industry’s efforts to tackle these challenges have principally occurred in the Global North; consequently, African drug discovery efforts have largely been dependent on international funding agencies with programmes driven from abroad. AI/ML methods offer an opportunity to revitalise and expedite drug discovery projects conducted in those countries that are most affected by these scourges; however, a lack of data science expertise and limited access to computational resources hinder the uptake of AI/ML at research institutions and universities in LMICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alami et al. 2020</xref>). It is anticipated that lowering these barriers may lead to important scientific contributions from those countries that disproportionately suffer from the bulk of infectious diseases, a milestone towards their eradication.</p><p id="P4">Since its launch in 2010, the Holistic Drug Discovery and Development (H3D) Centre at the University of Cape Town in South Africa has made significant advances in innovative drug discovery projects and infrastructure development, intimately aligned with capacity strengthening across the African continent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Winks et al. 2022</xref>). This includes the discovery of the first ever small-molecule clinical candidate, for any disease, researched on African soil by an international team led by an African drug discovery centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Nordling 2013</xref>) which, subsequently, reached Phase II human trials in African malaria patients. To advance its mission of discovering and developing novel, life-saving medicines for infectious diseases that predominantly affect African populations, H3D works closely with the Ersilia Open Source Initiative (EOSI), a non-profit organisation aimed at disseminating AI/ML methodologies applied to urgent biomedical needs in LMICs.</p><p id="P5">Here we describe ZairaChem<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">1</xref></sup>, an automated pipeline for AI/ML modelling, designed for fast and easy implementation in low-resource settings. We demonstrate the application of ZairaChem to key assays in the antimalarial and antitubercular drug discovery programs conducted at H3D. The AI/ML models are arranged in the form of a virtual screening cascade that mirrors the progression of compounds in a real-world experimental setting. Virtual screening is a critical tool in drug discovery, allowing for the identification of new hits at a fraction of the time and cost associated with experimental assays. Large chemical libraries can be filtered through this computational cascade to prioritise compounds for testing, resulting in a significant reduction in experimental attrition rates. The developed AI/ML assets include models corresponding to whole-cell phenotypic screening assays against <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (<italic>Pf</italic>) and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), the causative agents of malaria and tuberculosis, respectively. The cascade also supports later phases of the drug discovery pipeline aimed at de-risking hits with respect to liabilities such as microsomal clearance and cytotoxicity.</p><p id="P6">This is the first comprehensive AI/ML-based virtual screening cascade that, to our knowledge, has been brought to production in a drug discovery setting on the African continent. ZairaChem can run on conventional computers and is fully automated, requiring limited data science expertise and allowing for periodic model updates with new data. We believe that this virtual screening cascade, based on in-house data and free open-source software, has the potential to set the basis for sustainable, affordable and scalable drug discovery initiatives in the Global South.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Available data and screening cascades at H3D</title><p id="P7">We have modelled two virtual drug discovery cascades focused on identifying novel antimalarial and antituberculosis compounds. Both cascades start with whole-cell activity assays and progress with common absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We have selected assays representative of each step of the experimental drug screening cascade and for which H3D had sufficient available in-house data (i.e. at least 100 molecules). Key assays for compound progression in the cascade but for which only a small subset of data was available (e.g. human cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition and hERG blockade) have been developed using publicly available data (see Materials and Methods). Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) assays, characteristic of a lead optimisation phase in the drug discovery pipeline, have not been included in the virtual screening cascade at this stage of implementation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref> contains a summary of each assay and the number of compounds available. Expert knowledge was used to establish a measurement cut-off to obtain binary outcomes (1/0; active/inactive, soluble/not soluble, etc.) for each of the assays.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Automated AI/ML modelling with ZairaChem</title><p id="P8">Using known binary (1/0) outcomes, we trained robust AI/ML classification models able to predict the probability of ”1” (typically an ”active” assay outcome) of new compounds, given only their chemical structures represented as a SMILES string. To streamline model training and facilitate adoption of the AI/ML models at H3D, we developed an automated AI/ML tool named ZairaChem. Details of the ZairaChem pipeline are provided in the Materials and Methods section, and a scheme of the methodology is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>. In brief, molecules are represented numerically using a combination of distinct descriptors, including physicochemical parameters (Mordred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Moriwaki et al. 2018</xref>)), 2D structural fingerprints (ECFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Rogers and Hahn 2010</xref>)), inferred bioactivity profiles (Chemical Checker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Duran-Frigola et al. 2020</xref>)), and graph-based embeddings (GROVER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Rong et al. 2020</xref>)). The rationale is that combining multiple descriptors will enhance applicability over a broad range of tasks, ranging from aqueous solubility prediction to phenotypic outcomes. Subsequently, a battery of AI/ML algorithms is applied using modern automated learning (AutoML) techniques aimed at yielding accurate models without the need for human intervention (i.e. algorithm choice, hyperparameter tuning, etc.). Automation is key to ensure continuous integration and continuous deployment of the AI/ML assets in an environment like H3D, where data science capacity is limited. The AutoML frameworks FLAML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Wang et al. 2019</xref>), AutoGluon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Erickson et al. 2020</xref>) and Keras Tuner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">O’Malley et al 2019</xref>) were incorporated, covering mostly tree-based methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) and neural network architectures. We benchmarked the ZairaChem pipeline in the Therapeutics Data Commons ADMET binary classification tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Huang et al. 2022</xref>). Out-of-the-box, ZairaChem models demonstrated state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all classification tasks, scoring between 1st and 7th in all benchmark datasets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Extended Data Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P9"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> exemplifies ZairaChem applied to the H37Rv strain of <italic>Mtb</italic>. As of November 2021, 3,244 molecules had been screened in this assay at H3D, spanning a diverse chemical space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In total, 81 chemical series are represented, with 20 series covering 80% of the molecules. Setting an MIC<sub>90</sub> cut-off of 5 μM yields 483 actives available for training the AI/ML model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). To evaluate predictive performance, we held out 10% of the data as a test set and trained a model on the remaining 90%. An ensemble of models was fitted based on the multiple small-molecule descriptors and performance was evaluated for each model individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). The outcome of models inside the ensemble was aggregated in a consensus score estimating the probability of observing an “active” (1) assay outcome. Indeed, in the hold-out test set, known active molecules scored higher than known inactive compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Measured in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space, which evaluates the balance between sensitivity and specificity of a model, the consensus score achieves an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.895, higherthan any of the individual classifiersalone. In this case, a score threshold of 0.25 can be established to classify predictions as ”actives” (1) and ”inactives” (0). Based on this threshold, the model predicted 62 active molecules from the test set, of which 37 were true positives, corresponding to a precision of 59.7% and a recall of 68.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Systematic AI/ML modelling of H3D screening cascades</title><p id="P10">We applied the ZairaChem pipeline to the experimental assays available at the H3D Centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>).The resulting models showed good performance (AUROC &gt; 0.7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) and well-scaled prediction scores within the [0-1] range for all in-house datasets: <italic>Pf</italic> NF54, <italic>Pf</italic> K1, <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv, CHO, HepG2, Aqueous solubility (Aq. sol.), Caco-2 permeability (Caco-2) and Intrinsic clearance (CL<sub>int</sub>) for human (H), mouse (M), and rat (R) microsomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). We observed that ZairaChem classifiers successfully up-rank active compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), with significant enrichment of hits within the top 50 candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). We found similar performance for the remaining assays developed with in-house data beyond those depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">2</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Data points were scarce for key assays related to more advanced stages of the screening cascade. Experiments related to drug metabolism, such as interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), or inhibition of the hERG ion channel, are costly and often not performed on-site for many drug discovery organisations. In the case of CYPs, we gathered bioactivity data for over 15,000 molecules available from the PubChem BioAssay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kim et al. 2022</xref>) and ChEMBL databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Davies et al. 2015</xref>). We built AI/ML models for the CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 isoforms. Remarkably, except for CYP2C19, CYP models built with public data were able to achieve good performance (AUROC &gt; 0.65) in the H3D chemical space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b and 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>), assigning high scores to active (“1”, CYP inhibitors) and low scores to inactive compounds (“0”, no CYP inhibition observed) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). These models successfully enable the selection of compounds that are not likely to interact with the selected CYPs (50 bottom-ranking compounds; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In addition to publicly available datasets, pre-trained AI/ML models are becoming more frequent in the scientific literature. The core mission of EOSI is to collect such public models in a unified, easy-to-use repository named the Ersilia Model Hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Turon and Duran-Frigola, 2022</xref>). As of December 2022, the Ersilia Model Hub contains over eighty models for drug discovery, with a focus on infectious disease research. To demonstrate the potential of this resource, we chose to fetch a hERG blockade prediction model from the Ersilia Model Hub (identifier: eos2ta5), corresponding to CardioToxNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Karim et al. 2021</xref>). This model was used “as is”, without further fine-tuning with H3D data, and showed excellent accuracy (AUROC = 0.852) on H3D compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b and d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Extended Data Table 3</xref>), with good discriminative scores between active (1, cardiotoxic) and inactive compounds (0, non-cardiotoxic) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), as well as an enrichment of inactivity in the bottom-ranked 50 compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Finally, to measure the advantage of using AI/ML models to prioritise compounds for experimental screening, we have calculated the hit enrichment potential of each model. Overall, assays where an “active” outcome is desired (<italic>Pf</italic> NF54, <italic>Pf</italic> K1, <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv, Aq Sol and Caco-2) show between 25% and 41% enrichment in the top 50 molecules. For example, out of 50 randomly-selected molecules in the <italic>Pf</italic> NF54 dataset, by chance, 10 would be active (20%); however, if we rank the data according to the AI/ML model scores, 42 molecules (84%) are found to be active (IC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 0.1μM). Assays where the desired outcome is “inactivity” (cytotoxicity, intrinsic microsomal clearance, CYP inhibition and hERG cardiotoxicity) show an enrichment of 30% to 50% of inactive molecules in the bottom 50 molecules ranked by the AI/ML model score (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Extended Data Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">4</xref>). Moreover, we demonstrate how models trained on external datasets (P450 CYPs models) can improve their performance when in-house data points are included in the training set. Notably, the AUROC of the worst-performing model on H3D data (CYP2C19) goes from 0.54 to 0.7 upon adding internal data points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>AI/ML performance by chemical series</title><p id="P14">In the early stages of a drug discovery project, derivatives of a compound which retain the structural core, or pharmacophore, are designed and synthesised to optimise the biochemical properties of that chemical series. Given the high performance of ZairaChem models for datasets spanning broad chemical space, we turned our attention towards the capability of the models to capture granular detail within a set of closely-related analogues, focusing on predictions of bioactivity against <italic>Pf</italic> and <italic>Mtb</italic>. We trained sets of models on bioactivity data and gradually increased the number of training points from specific chemical series to observe the effect of increasing “local” training data on model performance. As expected, the predictive potential for a chemical series improved with an increase in local data density, where approximately 30 molecules from a given series provide a good starting point to produce predictive models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,g</xref>). Secondly, we measured the impact of the availability of global data on model quality at the chemical series level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d,h</xref>). In general, the addition of more data, even if they correspond to a broader chemical space, improves model performance. Series 2 of <italic>Mtb</italic>, the exception to this trend, had very few active compounds available for training, leading to poor model performance that the addition of global data could not rescue.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Application to an unseen collection of compounds</title><p id="P15">Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the virtual screening cascade for <italic>de novo</italic> screening of molecular libraries, we reproduced the discovery of a potent antiplasmodial compound at H3D from a series of 2,4-disubstituted imidazopyridines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Horatscheck et al. 2020</xref>). In this study, the authors identified two initial hits with moderate antiplasmodial activity against asexual blood stage parasites (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.24 μM and 0.49 μM, respectively) and derived a series of 65 compounds for experimental testing. All molecules were tested against asexual blood stage drug-sensitive (NF54) and drug-resistant (K1) <italic>Pf</italic> strains, and their cytotoxicity in CHO cells as well as aqueous solubility (pH 6.5) were experimentally determined. In addition, some molecules progressed further in the cascade and were tested for cardiotoxicity risk (hERG blockade) and microsomal metabolic stability (Mouse CL<sub>int</sub>). To simulate a prospective study for this series, we removed these compounds from the training sets of the relevant AI/ML models in the virtual screening cascade (<italic>Pf</italic> NF54, <italic>Pf</italic> K1, CHO, Aq. Sol. at pH 6.5, Caco-2, CL<sub>int</sub> Human, Rat, and Mouse). CYP and hERG models were developed with external data and thus do not contain any H3D molecules in the training set. ZairaChem models show good performance (AUROC &gt; 0.75) on the experimentally validated library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Next, we leveraged the model scores to create visual fingerprints for ease of identification of potential hits: those with high scores for the desired activities (dark red) and low scores for the undesired activities (light blue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). We selected a few molecules that showed the desired pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) and compared their predicted activity from the ZairaChem models with the experimental results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Compound 1, the initial hit of the series, is also shown for reference. We demonstrate that AI/ML models allow for the selection of candidates with high chances of progression in the cascade (compounds 37 and 55) and, conversely, molecules with undesired side effects could be discarded prior to experimental testing, despite their high bioactivity against <italic>Pf</italic> (compounds 22 and 58). Indeed, compound 37, one of the molecules selected by our model predictions for its high activity against <italic>Pf</italic> and low toxicity profile, was the lead compound from this study, showing <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy in the humanised SCID NSG mouse malaria infection model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">We have introduced ZairaChem, a robust and parameter-free AutoML tool that is broadly applicable to small-molecule property prediction tasks. ZairaChem makes use of a range of chemical descriptors in combination with an ensemble of AI/ML algorithms to train models with SOTA performance as an out-of-the-box tool. We implemented the tool systematically to the existing drug discovery pipeline at H3D, yielding 15 production-ready models corresponding to key assays related to antimalarial and antitubercular screening cascades. ZairaChem models, whether trained on in-house data or from public data sources, showed excellent performance, with most AUROC scores above 0.75. The resulting hit enrichment reduces attrition rates of the experimental pipeline, potentially accelerating the bench-to-bedside turnaround time. For example, here we show that by testing just 50 compounds of the whole-cell screening data, we find four times more active compounds against <italic>Pf</italic> (NF54 strain) and <italic>Mtb</italic> (H37Rv strain) compared to testing the same number of compounds selected at random. This is particularly relevant in the context of research conducted within LMICs, where resources are typically constrained.</p><p id="P17">Subsequent analysis of local (series-specific) regions of the chemical space aimed to answer two questions; firstly, whether our AI/ML models were able to capture differences between closely-related compounds within a specific chemical series and, secondly, whether the presence of broader “global” data contributed to the improvement of predictions in these series. With no local training data, the prediction quality of ranking analogues varies from series to series; some chemical series are readily modellable (<italic>Pf</italic> NF54 Series 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) while others require additional “local” training data to improve predictions (<italic>Pf</italic> NF54 Series 2, and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). While a limited local training set of just ten compounds has the potential to skew model performance depending on the specific split of data points, having approximately 30 local molecules within a chemical series appears to be a useful rule-of-thumb to produce models that can distinguish between small variations in chemical structure. Additional data, whether local (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c &amp; 3g</xref>) or global (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d &amp; 3h</xref>), generally further enhances model performance.</p><p id="P18">Finally, we have demonstrated the potential of AI/ML virtual screening cascades to identify hits in a <italic>de novo</italic> library by recreating a study performed at the H3D Centre in 2020. The visual representation of compounds’ colour-vectors, based on AI/ML model scores, allowed for the quick identification and selection of the best compounds (highly potent against <italic>Pf</italic> with low toxicity) for experimental testing.</p><p id="P19">Overall, we have successfully deployed 15 AI/ML models at H3D. These models are intended to serve two main purposes. On the one hand, they are used to screen large compound libraries to discover new chemical matter as starting points for drug discovery projects. On the other hand, they provide a means to prioritise compounds for synthesis in the hit-to-lead and lead optimisation phases of existing screening campaigns. In the latter scenario, medicinal chemists frequently design dozens of potential compounds but have limited resources (including time) for chemical synthesis. The ZairaChem virtual screening cascade is intended to be used in conjunction with other existing software tools to generate complementary data points that facilitate decision-making, reduce attrition rates and accelerate project progression. As models can provide predictions for many molecules, scientists are able to explore much longer lists of compounds than they might otherwise propose, allowing them to interrogate a broader chemical space. Furthermore, predictions for design ideas can be obtained from the entire virtual screening cascade to identify compounds with potential benefits and liabilities much earlier in the design-make-test cycle, including those with predicted favourable ADMET assay outcomes that might typically only be considered later in a drug discovery programme.</p><p id="P20">Currently, ZairaChem is limited to single-output binary classification tasks. Although the framework is prepared to deal with regression (i.e. continuous data) tasks, we chose to restrict the scope to the former at this first stage of development. This choice matches decision-making guidelines at H3D, where expert cut-offs are defined for each assay to determine progression criteria. Likewise, although ZairaChem is now being extended in new directions, including interpretability, data augmentation for low-data regimes, and confidence estimation, these functionalities were not implemented in the current study, which is primarily focused on overall assessment of hit rates and predictive performance. Finally, ZairaChem can natively incorporate any AI/ML model available from the Ersilia Model Hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Turon and Duran-Frigola 2022</xref>), including modern descriptors, embeddings extracted from pre-trained models such as GEM (geometry-enhanced molecular representation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fang et al. 2022</xref>), or models fitted to a broad range of bioactivities using, for instance, the FS-Mol training set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Stanley et al. 2021</xref>). Here, we chose four representative descriptors corresponding to physicochemical properties, classical 2D structure fingerprints, advanced graph embeddings and bioactivity signatures. Improvement or extension of this default set is outside the scope of the study; however, this could serve to further improve the performance of the models presented here. It is worth noting that, in addition, the Ersilia Model Hub contains a growing number of predictive models for specific assay outcomes, developed either by third parties or by EOSI using publicly-available data (e.g. from ChEMBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gaulton etal. 2017</xref>) or PubChem BioAssay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kim etal. 2022</xref>)). For example, the MAIP antimalarial model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bosc et al. 2021</xref>) is readily accessible, as well as popular ADMET servers (SwissADME, ADMETlab 2.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Daina, Michielin, and Zoete 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Xiong etal. 2021</xref>) and hERG inhibition models. ZairaChem can treat the outcome of these models as additional features for prediction. MAIP, for instance, can predict H3D <italic>Pf</italic> NF54 outcomes with AUROC = 0.73 as a standalone estimator. Thus, the ZairaChem framework offers a unique opportunity to transfer knowledge from the public domain to in-house modelling efforts.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p id="P21">In summary, we have successfully developed and deployed an AI/ML-based virtual screening pipeline based completely on open-source code and conventional computing capacity. This is the first instance of a virtual screening cascade built with data produced on and for the African continent. We hope that the work presented here serves as a proof-of-concept for the potential of AI/ML tools to support drug discovery efforts in LMICs. Incipient centres in West Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Amewu etal. 2022</xref>) and Central Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Namba-Nzanguim etal. 2022</xref>) may benefit from similar implementations. More globally, ZairaChem offers a competitive, free and constantly-updated software solution to model small-molecule bioactivity data, where no strong data science skills are required to run the tool.</p><p id="P22">In order to encourage scientists at H3D to use our models, a series of internal and external webinars have been held to introduce AI/ML in the context of drug discovery and to explain how the models were trained as well as how to interpret the results (see, for example, the recent “Bringing data science and AI/ML tools to infectious disease research” workshop co-organized by the H3D Foundation and EOSI; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ersilia.gitbook.io/event-fund">https://ersilia.gitbook.io/event-fund</ext-link>). “Champions” in each core team at H3D helped to promote the tools and brought ideas and suggestions back to the development team. In this rollout phase of the implementation, a list of compounds was sent to the AI/ML team who employed the pipeline and then shared the results with the medicinal chemistry project team. In the longer term, it is envisaged that scientists will be able to run predictions on their own. We also anticipate expanding the array of available models and building models on demand, especially for target-based projects such as those based on the clinically-validated <italic>Pf</italic> phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Arendse et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Paquet et al. 2017</xref>). Continued revision and maintenance of the models ensure that they are updated with the latest data being generated at H3D. Likewise, contrary to many ‘static’ AI/ML tools published in an academic setting, ZairaChem is in continuous development, including novel descriptor types and algorithms over time.</p><p id="P23">Finally, plans for the future include the coupling of ZairaChem AI/ML assets to generative models, with the goal to design compounds <italic>de novo</italic> and/or aid the hit-to-lead optimisation step. In the context of the Open Source Malaria (OSM) and Open Source Antibiotics (OSA) consortia, EOSI has demonstrated how a “reinforcement learning” scheme can be applied to generate compounds with predicted desired biochemical properties<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">2</xref></sup>. Thus, we envisage a wet-lab/dry-lab cycle implemented at H3D whereby AI/ML models are trained based on historical in-house data and then incorporated into a generative framework to suggest new small-molecule candidates with optimised prediction outputs. Upon clerical inspection by medicinal chemists, candidates would eventually be synthesised and tested. Results of the assay will in turn be incorporated in the next training round, improving the AI/ML model and its correspondence with the existing experimental screening facilities. The current successful and sustained implementation of ZairaChem at H3D represents the first step towards truly integrated AI/ML usage in productive drug discovery settings in the Global South.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Data collection</title><p id="P24">Bioactivity data for the assays defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref> were extracted from H3D’s curated database. Compounds with large variations in replicated measurements were identified and removed. The replicate values for remaining compounds were averaged regardless of date and site of experiment development.</p><p id="P25">Cytochrome inhibition data was obtained for CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 from PubChem (AID1851, AID899, AID891, AID883, AID884) and ChEMBL. PubChem BioAssay data were already binarized (1, active; 0, inactive). The ChEMBL database was queried and only compounds with “Standard Type”, “IC<sub>50</sub>” or “<italic>K</italic>i”, and “Standard Units”: “nM” were considered. Compounds were assigned as “active” (1) if bioactivity was smaller or equal to 10 μM, and “inactive” (0) otherwise. In addition, compounds with “Comment” equal to “Not Active” or “No Inhibition” were classified as inactive. Bioactivity data not matching these criteria were discarded.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>The ZairaChem pipeline</title><p id="P26">Each H3D assay was modelled independently using ZairaChem with default parameters. ZairaChem has two running modes, namely “fit” and “predict”. ZairaChem training runs are scheduled to be executed twice a year for all assays in the virtual screening cascade.</p><sec id="S13"><title>Data pre-processing</title><p id="P27">The data pre-processing module consists of several steps. First, an input file is analysed and relevant columns are identified. In particular, the column containing SMILES strings is kept, together with the outcome (e.g. activity) column. ZairaChem determines the type of task (i.e. regression or binary classification). In this study, only binary classification tasks were considered. Small-molecule SMILES are standardised following the MELLODDY-Tuner protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Oldenhof et al. 2022</xref>). MELLODDY-Tuner is also used to identify LSH-based as well as Murcko scaffold-based splits, which can be used optionally. In addition, ZairaChem enables random and time-based splits, as well as a splitting scheme that takes into account clusters and LSH hashes to identify equally-sized splits. By default, five random stratified splits are done, keeping 10% of the data as test sets.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Small-molecule descriptors</title><p id="P28">ZairaChem can query the Ersilia Model Hub, EOSI’s repository of pre-trained, ready-to-use AI/ML models. Some of the assets available in the Ersilia Model Hub provide as output a numerical vector for each molecule, typically capturing physicochemical or topological characteristics of the compound. By default, ZairaChem calculates such vectors for each molecule, corresponding to four representative descriptor types. In particular, we calculate (1) Mordred descriptors (an array of &gt;1600 physicochemical parameters), (2) ECFP fingerprints (a count-based vector of 2048 dimensions based on circular exploration (radius 3) of all atoms in a molecule), (3) Chemical Checker signatures (a dense vector of 3200 dimensions capturing known and inferred bioactivity data across a wide range of bioactivity outcomes), and (4) GROVER embeddings (a 5000-dimension graph-based representation of the molecules). Other vectorial descriptors are available in the Ersilia Model Hub and can be specified to ZairaChem by simply referring to their model identifier.</p><p id="P29">Continuous data descriptors are quantile-normalised and missing data is imputed with a nearest-neighbour approach. Invariant columns are removed. GROVER is used as a reference descriptor for additional processing. We perform PCA (four components) and UMAP (two components). In addition, supervised versions of these techniques are applied based on the binary outcomes. We choose linear optimal low-rank projection (lolP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Vogelstein et al. 2021</xref>) as an alternative to PCA for this supervised task. UMAP accepts both unsupervised and supervised modes. In addition to vector-like descriptors, it is possible to incorporate other models from the Ersilia Model Hub as auxiliary predictor variables for ZairaChem. ZairaChem treats these auxiliary models as additional columns in the pooling step described below.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>AutoML methods</title><p id="P30">Currently, ZairaChem executes four AutoML methods independently. Each of the AutoML models is focused on enhancing a specific feature (e.g. interpretability, robustness, etc.) in the overall ZairaChem pipeline.</p><p id="P31">The first AutoML module performs independent modelling for each of the descriptors. The focus of this module is to identify which descriptor types are the most appropriate for the task of interest. With default parameters, five models are built, corresponding to the descriptors mentioned above. FLAML(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Wang et al. 2019</xref>) is used to perform rapid search of Random Forest hyperparameters.</p><p id="P32">The second module is focused on visual interpretation of the chemical space. Thus, this module takes as input the low-dimensional PCA and UMAP projections obtained for the reference descriptor (in total, 12 variables). We use AutoGluon-Tabular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Erickson et al.2020</xref>) with default parameters to obtain robust classifiers and regressors.</p><p id="P33">The third module leverages GROVER, a data-driven descriptor trained on a large collection of molecules. This module is illustrative of a “transfer learning” approach where a large chunk of a neural network is “frozen” (the GROVER part) and a few extra layers are fine-tuned for the task of interest. Here, we add an additional dense layer. The number of dimensions of this layer, in addition to the training parameters, are automatically selected with Keras Tuner.</p><p id="P34">Finally, the fourth module leverages image-based representations of the molecules, enabling application of computer vision techniques, which are particularly advanced in the field of AI/ML. Compounds are represented as MolMaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Shen et al. 2021</xref>). These are concise, multi-descriptor images (maps) where regions of the image correspond to descriptors that are correlated. For example, in a MolMap one can find a region that relates to size and molecular weight, whereas other regions are related to lipophilicity, solubility, etc. It has been shown that convolutional neural networks can be used out-of-the-box taking MolMaps as input, without the need for intense architecture and hyperparameter search.</p><p id="P35">ZairaChem is prepared to be extended with additional AutoML modules, if and as necessary. However, the balance between computing time and gain in performance is an important consideration before adding further modules.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Pooling</title><p id="P36">Each of the models above provides point predictions that can be aggregated in a consensus (pooled) prediction. By default, ZairaChem applies a “blending” approach, based on a weighted average between individual predictions.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Reports and output</title><p id="P37">At the end of the ZairaChem pipeline, performance reports are automatically provided, including the most common validation metrics for binary classification tasks. A single spreadsheet with prediction output and performance metrics is provided as a primary result, along with multiple reporting plots (AUROC, UMAP projections, etc.).</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>ZairaChem benchmarking</title><p id="P38">We selected Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) as a benchmark framework. TDC contains multiple datasets across a broad range of tasks and activities. To prove SOTA performance on the H3D Centre’s data, we selected the TDC ADMET Group as the one containing tasks most similar to the ones described in this project. In line with this, only classification tasks were evaluated. Data was downloaded from TDC and split into train and test according to the TDC guidelines. Models were trained with default ZairaChem parameters with 8-fold cross validation. Results were calculated using TDC guidelines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Analysis of H3D’s chemical series</title><p id="P39">To investigate the change in model performance within a localised region of chemical space through the incremental addition of local training data, chemical series with at least 200 compounds were selected from the H3D library for analysis.</p><sec id="S20"><title>Train-test splits</title><p id="P40">Datasets for model training were constructed according to the following protocol: first, all compounds in a series of interest were removed from the bulk global training data of the H3D library; then, the data was shuffled and 100 compounds were randomly selected with stratification as a standard test set; the remaining 100 molecules were systematically added back to the bulk H3D activity data and models trained for each dataset. A final separate ‘local-only’ model was trained on the 100 series-specific compounds alone, without the broader H3D library data, in order to investigate the effect of global training data on model performance.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>AUROC percentage change</title><p id="P41">To measure the contribution of additional global training data to a model’s performance in a localised chemical space, we calculate the percentage change in AUROC score according to the following steps: 1) first, we find the difference between the AUROC scores of the model trained on 100 series-specific compounds with the H3D library included as well as the ‘local-only’ model trained on the series-specific compounds alone; 2) next, for the ‘local-only’ model, we find the AUROC score that is still possible to be achieved (1 - ‘local-only’ AUROC); 3) lastly, we take the difference in models scores (from step1) as a percentage of the score that could still be achieved (from step 2). This metric represents the additional performance gained or lost out of the total AUROC score that was still available to capture. AUROC scores were calculated with the SciKit-Learn package from a five-fold cross-validation.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Plots</title><p id="P42">Chemical space visualisation was constructed by describing compounds using the Morgan Fingerprint algorithm, with a radius of 3 and vector length of 2048 as implemented in the RDKit package.
