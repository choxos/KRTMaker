Remarkably, its catalytic efficiency <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> can be boosted more than 100-fold by complex formation with a partner enzyme. Recently, an autonomously fully active MtCM variant was generated using directed evolution, and its structure solved by X-ray crystallography. However, key residues were involved in crystal contacts, challenging the functional interpretation of the structural changes. Here, we address these challenges by microsecond molecular dynamics simulations, followed up by additional kinetic and structural analyses of selected sets of specifically engineered enzyme variants. A comparison of wild-type MtCM with naturally and artificially activated MtCMs revealed the overall dynamic profiles of these enzymes as well as key interactions between the C-terminus and the active site loop. In the artificially evolved variant of this model enzyme, this loop is pre-organized and stabilized by Pro52 and Asp55, two highly conserved residues in typical, highly active chorismate mutases. Asp55 stretches across the active site and helps to appropriately position active site residues Arg18 and Arg46 for catalysis. The role of Asp55 can be taken over by another acidic residue, if introduced at position 88 close to the C-terminus of MtCM, as suggested by MD simulations and confirmed by kinetic investigations of engineered variants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Active site</kwd><kwd>enzyme catalysis</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics simulations</kwd><kwd>protein engineering</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystal structure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Pericyclic reactions are common in industrial processes, but very rare in biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Chorismate mutase (CM) catalyzes the only known pericyclic process in primary metabolism, the Claisen rearrangement of chorismate (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></bold>) to prephenate (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></bold>), <italic>via</italic> a chair-like transition state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Scheme 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). This catalytic step at the branch point of the shikimate pathway funnels the key metabolite chorismate towards the synthesis of tyrosine and phenylalanine, as opposed to tryptophan and several aromatic vitamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). The CM reaction is a concerted unimolecular transformation that is well studied both by experimental and computational means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). It proceeds ostensibly <italic>via</italic> the same transition state both in solution and in enzyme catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Due to these factors, CM has long been a model enzyme for computational chemists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Natural CMs belong to two main classes with two distinct folds AroH and AroQ, which are equally efficient, with typical <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values in the range of 1-5 × 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). The AroH fold, exemplified by the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> CM, has a trimeric pseudo α/β-barrel structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), whereas the structures of AroQ enzymes have all-α-helical folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The AroQ family is further divided into four subfamilies, α-δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The AroQ<sub>δ</sub> subfamily shows abnormally low catalytic activity compared to prototypical CM enzymes. In fact, the first discovered AroQ<sub>δ</sub> enzyme, the intracellular CM from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MtCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), is on its own only a poor catalyst (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> = 1.8 × 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>)), despite its crucial role for producing the aromatic amino acids Tyr and Phe. However, this low activity can be boosted more than a 100-fold to a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 2.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> through formation of a non-covalent complex with the first enzyme of the shikimate pathway, DAHP synthase (MtDS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The active site of AroQ CMs is dominated by positive charges, contributed by four arginine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). In MtCM, these are Arg18’, Arg35, Arg46 and Arg58 (with the prime denoting a different MtCM protomer). Of particular importance for catalysis is Arg46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), or its corresponding cationic residues in other CMs (of both AroH and AroQ families) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). However, high catalytic prowess is only achieved when this cationic residue is optimally positioned, such that it can stabilize the developing negative charge at the ether oxygen in the transition state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Scheme 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). In MtCM, this is not the case unless MtCM is activated by MtDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The MtDS partner repositions residues of the C-terminus of MtCM for interaction with the H1-H2 loop of MtCM that covers its active site, thereby inducing a characteristic kink in this loop (orange circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This interaction leads to a rearrangement of active site residues to catalytically more favorable conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) and is likely a key contributing factor for the increase in CM activity, as shown by randomizing mutagenesis of the C-terminus followed by selection for functional variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Complex formation also endows MtCM with feedback regulation by Tyr and Phe through binding of these effectors to the MtDS partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Such inter-enzyme allosteric regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) allows for dynamic adjustment of the CM activity to meet the changing needs of the cell.</p><p id="P5">The naturally low activity of MtCM in the absence of its MtDS partner enzyme also provided a unique opportunity for laboratory evolution studies aimed at increasing MtCM efficiency. After four major rounds of directed evolution, the highly active MtCM variant N-s4.15 emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), which is abbreviated as MtCM<sup>V</sup> in this manuscript. This variant showed autonomous CM activity (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> = 4.7 × 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) twice exceeding that of wild-type MtCM in the MtCM-MtDS complex, and can no longer be activated further through the addition of MtDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). The biggest gains in catalytic activity were due to replacements T52P and V55D in the H1-H2 loop and R87P, L88D, G89A, and H90M at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-E</xref>). Of these residues, Pro52 and Asp55 are conserved in the H1-H2 loop of naturally highly active CMs, such as the prototypic CMs from the α- and γ-AroQ subclasses, <italic>i.e.</italic>, EcCM from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and *MtCM, the secreted CM from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). The single amino acid exchange that had the largest beneficial effect on activity was V55D (12-fold enhancement of <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>), followed by T52P (6-fold gain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Combined, these two mutations, discussed in detail in a previous publication, gave a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> that was 22 times higher compared to wild-type MtCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). The four C-terminal mutations together increased the activity more modestly (by a factor of 4), and the five mutations introduced in the two final evolutionary rounds yielded an additional factor of 5. The resulting combination of large-impact and more subtle residue substitutions in MtCM<sup>V</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-E</xref>) gave a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> about 500 times greater than that of the parental starting point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The crystal structure of MtCM<sup>V</sup> revealed a strongly kinked conformation of the H1-H2 loop. This is reminiscent of the conformation adopted by MtCM when in the complex with MtDS (the crystal structure of MtDS-bound MtCM is in the following referred to as MtCM<sup>DS</sup>), and differs considerably from that observed in free MtCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). However, in the crystal structures of free wild-type and top-evolved MtCM<sup>V</sup>, both the H1-H2 loop and the C-terminus are involved in extensive crystal contacts, making an unbiased structural evaluation of the mutational effects in these parts of the enzyme impossible. In solution, these regions are assumed to be more flexible compared to the α-helical segments of MtCM.</p><p id="P7">Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the behavior of MtCM in the absence or presence of ligands, and to analyze whether the protein is able to interconvert between activated and non-activated conformations in the absence of the MtDS partner enzyme. We also compared the wild-type MtCM with the evolved MtCM<sup>V</sup>, to see if the acquired amino acid substitutions introduced any new interactions or if they altered the probabilities of existing ones, with potential impact on catalytic activity. From an assessment of the dynamic properties of MtCM and MtCM<sup>V</sup>, we proposed a set of single, double and triple C-terminal variants of the enzyme and subsequently tested these experimentally.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Construction of Untagged MtCM Variants</title><p id="P8">General cloning was carried out in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DH5α or XL1-Blue (both Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA).

Instead, the MD simulations revealed large changes from the initial crystal geometries in the apo protein structures, causing a rather high root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) from the original crystal structure geometry for the CM core regions (RMSD = 2.8 ± 1.2 Å (MtCM) or 3.4 ± 1.5 Å (MtCM<sup>V</sup>)). In particular, helix H2 showed a tendency to unravel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Due to the large flexibility observed, the two protomers making up the biological dimer instantaneously broke their symmetry, independently exploring different conformations in two chains. In contrast, the ligand-bound structure MtCM<sup>LC</sup> retained the secondary structure throughout the 1-µs simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), with a lower RMSD (1.7 ± 0.6 Å) than the two apo structures.

Whereas in the X-ray structure of the MtDS-activated MtCM, the H1-H2 loop is strongly kinked, this is not the case in non-activated MtCM. We investigated the conformational landscape of this loop by simulations, using Arg53 from the loop as reporter residue. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, in one of the two protomers of MtCM, Arg53 remained in an extended conformation for the entire 1-µs MD simulation. In contrast, the same amino acid in the other protomer oscillated between the extended and the helical region of the Ramachandran plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), the latter being characteristic of the catalytically active conformation of the loop. Statistically averaging the two distributions, it appears that the apo form of MtCM is preferentially found in its inactive conformation, whereas in MtCM<sup>V</sup> both protomers assumed the kinked active loop conformation, and retained it for the whole length of the simulation. However, TSA binding promoted the active conformation also in wild-type MtCM (represented by MtCM<sup>LC</sup>). The fact that the fluctuations of the MtCM<sup>V</sup> H1-H2 loop are contained within the conformational basin of the catalytically competent geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) is an indication that MtCM<sup>V</sup> has an intrinsically pre-organized loop, a condition that helps to minimize the entropy loss during substrate binding and consequently favors catalysis.</p><p id="P31">To test the effect of ligand binding, we repeated simulations of MtCM loaded with only one TSA ligand (MtCM<sup>LC1</sup>).

In the absence of a ligand, Arg18’, Arg46, and Arg58 repelled each other, and at least one of the residues was pushed out of the active site in the majority of the simulations. Only one of the four arginine residues (Arg35) maintained its position (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), appropriatedly placed for substrate binding by wild-type MtCM.

Structuring is promoted, in particular, by increasing the number of the negatively charged carboxylate groups that can both shield the electrostatic charge of the various arginine side chains within or next to the active site and orient catalytically important residues by hydrogen bonding and salt bridge formation. Simulations of MtCM<sup>V</sup> revealed the special importance of Asp55 in the V55D variant for coordinating Arg18’ and Arg46, thus promoting the preorganization of the active site region.

However, in MtCM<sup>V</sup> and MtCM<sup>V55D</sup>, the kink is exacerbated by crystal contacts, which are different in the two crystal forms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2</xref>). This kink is much less prominent in wild-type MtCM, or even MtCM<sup>T52P</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>), and completely lost during the simulations of MtCM<sup>WT</sup> (we did not carry out simulations on the single variant MtCM<sup>T52P</sup>). Thus, this conformation may well be a crystallization artifact rather than a prerequisite for an active MtCM.</p><p id="P48">Nevertheless, pre-organization and pre-stabilization appear to be of crucial importance for the catalytic prowess of MtCM. V55D is the single substitution among the MtCM<sup>V</sup> mutations that resulted in the largest boost in catalytic activity (12-fold enhancement) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). This residue is located on the C-terminal side of the H1-H2 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D/E</xref>) and forms a salt bridge to the catalytically important Arg46 at the top of helix H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), an interaction that is also observed in the crystal structure of MtCM<sup>V55D</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1G/H</xref>). During the MD simulations of MtCM<sup>V</sup> and the single variant MtCM<sup>V55D</sup>, the presence of Asp55 reduced the mobility of active site residues. By interacting with Arg18’ and Arg46, this residue helps to pre-organize the active site for catalysis and reduce unfavorable conformational fluctuations caused by electrostatic repulsion in the absence of a substrate. This is supported by the lower RMSF values of MtCM<sup>V</sup> compared to uncomplexed wild-type MtCM (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and by a slightly higher melting temperature of MtCM<sup>V55D</sup> (ΔT = 3 °C from preliminary differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) measurements; preliminary data). By decreasing thermal fluctuations in the active site, Asp55 likely also reduces the entropic penalty associated with substrate binding. Pro52 appears to exert a similar stabilizing effect on the protein, despite the rather small structural changes, as suggested by a 2 °C increase in melting temperature of MtCM<sup>T52P</sup> in DSF experiments compared to MtCM (preliminary data). This single substitution raises the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of the enzyme by a factor of six (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). It is worth noting that the simultaneous substitution of T52P and V55D increased the melting temperature by 6 °C (monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy) and boosted <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> by 22-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Importance of the C-Terminus</title><p id="P49">MtCM activation by MtDS involves a change in conformation of the C-terminus of MtCM and its active site H1-H2 loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Specifically, a salt bridge is formed between the C-terminal carboxylate of MtCM (which is repositioned upon MtDS binding) and loop residue Arg53, possibly bolstered by a newly formed hydrophobic interaction between Leu88 and Leu54 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3A</xref>). The 1-µs simulations suggest that salt-bridge formation with Arg53 occurs in solution in all tested cases, whereas the hydrophobic contact is less important.</p><p id="P50">Directed evolution experiments carried out by randomizing the final four C-terminal positions 87-90 of MtCM had previously revealed that a great variety of residues with quite distinct physical-chemical properties are compatible with a functional catalytic machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Conserved positions emerged only when probing for an intact activation mechanism by MtDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Still, when residues 87-90 of MtCM<sup>V</sup> were evolved from Arg-Leu-Gly-His to Pro-Asp-Ala-Met (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>), an increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> by roughly a factor of four was achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Here, we resolved this apparent paradox by investigating C-terminal factors important for the fine-tuned optimization of CM function. Even though the replacement R87P induced a kink in the structure, the presence of the proline did not appear to have a major influence in the simulations. Notably, the C-terminal substitutions together result in a change in net charge from +1 to −2, including the terminal carboxylate, providing the basis for more extensive electrostatic interactions with the positively charged Arg53 than is possible for wild-type MtCM. Indeed, our kinetic analysis of Asp88-containing MtCM variants demonstrates that this residue increases CM’s catalytic efficiency (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The fact that Asp88 did not significantly augment <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> in the context of the MtCM double variant T52P V55D (<italic>i.e.</italic>, MtCM Triple; <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) suggests that the extent of catalytic improvement by L88D depends on the particular structural context.</p><p id="P51">Our simulations indicate that in free wild-type MtCM, an interaction of the C-terminal carboxylate with the key active site residue Arg46 is possible, but infrequent due to fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, in MtCM<sup>V</sup> and MtCM<sup>DS</sup> the side chain of Arg46 points towards the catalytic pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), and any unproductive reorientation of Arg46 towards the C-terminus would easily result in a clash with the H1-H2 loop. Thus, an additional feature of this loop may be to act as a conditional shield (illustrated for MtCM<sup>V</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). In the conformation assumed in MtCM<sup>V</sup> and MtCM<sup>DS</sup>, this loop blocks reorientation of Arg46 towards the C-terminus and hence prevents an unproductive conformation accessible for free wild-type MtCM. MtCM<sup>DS</sup> and MtCM<sup>V</sup> use different means to correctly position active site residues, which correlates with a bent H1-H2 loop in both cases. This is either achieved through conformational changes imposed upon MtCM<sup>DS</sup> by MtDS binding, or by establishing a salt bridge across the active site, between Arg46 and Asp55, as seen for MtCM<sup>V</sup> and also for the single variant MtCM<sup>V55D</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1E/G/H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>General Implications for CM Catalysis</title><p id="P52">It is obviously impossible to directly transfer our findings of critical detailed molecular contacts from the AroQ<sub>δ</sub> subclass CM of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to the evolutionary distinct AroH class CMs, or even to the structurally and functionally divergent AroQ<sub>α</sub>, AroQ<sub>β</sub>, and AroQ<sub>γ</sub> subclasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Neither of those groups of CMs have evolved to be deliberately poor catalysts that become proficient upon regulatory interaction with a partner protein such as MtDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). To be amenable to ‘inter-enzyme allosteric’ regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), the H1-H2 loop in MtCM must be malleable and allow for conformational switching between a poorly and a highly active form. In contrast, this region is rigidified in a catalytically competent conformation in the overwhelming majority of CMs from other subclasses. This is exemplified by the prototypic EcCM (AroQ<sub>α</sub> subclass) and the secreted *MtCM (AroQ<sub>γ</sub>), which possess the sequence <sup>45</sup><bold>P</bold>VR<bold>D</bold><sup>48</sup> and <sup>66</sup><bold>P</bold>IE<bold>D</bold><sup>69</sup>, respectively, at the position corresponding to the malleable H1-H2 loop sequence <sup>52</sup><bold>T</bold>RL<bold>V</bold><sup>55</sup> of wild-type MtCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Remarkably, the two most impactful substitutions T52P and V55D occurring during the evolution of MtCM<sup>V</sup> have led to the tetrapeptide sequence <sup>52</sup><bold>P</bold>RL<bold>D</bold><sup>55</sup>, with both Pro and Asp being conserved in naturally highly active CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P53">The AroQ<sub>δ</sub> subclass CM from <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> is another structurally well characterized poorly active CM (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> = 110 M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) that requires complex formation with its cognate DAHP synthase for an impressive 180-fold boost in catalytic efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). In that case, inter-enzyme allosteric regulation involves a conformational change of a different malleable segment between helices H1 and H2. Thus, while the molecular details important for the activation of a particular AroQ<sub>δ</sub> CM cannot be transferred directly from one system to another, our findings suggest as a general regulatory principle the deliberate and reversible destabilization of a catalytically critical loop conformation.</p><p id="P54">In both the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) and the <italic>C. glutamicum</italic> systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>) crystal contacts in the H1-H2 loop region impede the structural interpretation of the activity switching. The MD simulations shown here represent an interesting alternative approach to dynamic high-resolution structure determination methods for sampling the conformational space adopted by malleable peptide segments with and without ligands.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P55">MD greatly aided the analysis of crystal structures that were compromised or biased by extensive crystal contacts at the most interesting structural sites. Our aim was to obtain insight into the crucial factors underlying CM activity by comparing the structure and dynamics of the poorly active wild-type MtCM (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> = 1.7 × 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) with a highly efficient MtCM variant (MtCM<sup>V</sup>; <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> = 4.3 × 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), which emerged from directed evolution experiments. Both in MtDS-activated wild-type MtCM and in MtCM<sup>V</sup>, high activity correlated with a kinked H1-H2 loop conformation and an interaction of this region with the C-terminus of MtCM. The autonomously fully active variant MtCM<sup>V</sup> had mutations in both of these regions that augment these structural features. In this report we focussed on substitutions T52P, V55D, and L88D.</p><p id="P56">The active site of all natural CMs contains a high density of positive charges. In MtCM, four arginine residues (Arg18’, Arg35, Arg46, and Arg58, of which Arg18’ is contributed by a different MtCM protomer) are responsible for binding and rearranging the doubly negatively charged substrate chorismate. Only one of these residues (Arg35) is firmly in position before the substrate enters the active site. Of critical importance for catalysis is Arg46. During the MD simulations, Arg46 competes with another arginine residue (Arg53) for binding to the C-terminal carboxylate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>) and adopts a catalytically unproductive conformation unless an aspartate residue (Asp55 or Asp88) comes to its rescue. As shown here, Asp55 not only properly orients Arg46 for catalysis, but additionally stabilizes the active site. Together with T52P, which pre-orders the H1-H2 loop, the V55D exchange results in reduced mobility of residues in the active site through stabilizing interactions, thereby pre-organizing it for efficient catalysis and lowering the entropic cost of substrate binding. Another aspartate residue (Asp88), also acquired in the top-evolved MtCM<sup>V</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), helps to balance charges, and—by interacting with Arg53—imposes a steric block that prevents non-optimal positioning of Arg46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>), explaining why the L88D exchange can increase <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> by about 2-3 fold.</p><p id="P57">In summary, we tested our hypotheses on the specific importance of critical substitutions acquired during the directed evolution of MtCM<sup>V</sup>, namely T52P, V55D, and L88D by investigating single variants as well as combinations with other residue replacements that were found to augment catalysis. The variants were characterized by crystallography, MD simulations, and enzyme kinetics. The two residues Pro52 and Asp55 exert a major impact by pre-stabilization and pre-organization of catalytically competent conformations of active site residues, while Asp88 fine-tunes and optimizes the catalytic process. By expanding on the previous directed evolution studies, we have shown here how the accumulated set of amino acid substitutions found in MtCM<sup>V</sup> has resulted in an activity level matching that of the most active CMs known to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS156916-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d21aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figure 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS156916-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d21aAdFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Figure 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS156916-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_3.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d21aAdFdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Figure 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS156916-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_4.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d21aAdFeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS156916-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d21aAdFfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Regula Grüninger-Stössel for help with the construction of the T52P and V55D variants of MtCM, and Joel B.
