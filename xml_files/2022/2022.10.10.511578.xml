The impact of phosphorylation on arrestin interactions has been well studied only for very few GPCRs. Here we have characterized the interactions between the phosphorylated CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and arrestin2. We detected several new CCR5 phosphorylation sites, which are necessary for stable complex formation with arrestin2. Crystal structures of arrestin2 in apo form and in complexes with CCR5 C-terminal phosphopeptides together with NMR spectroscopy, biochemical and functional assays revealed three phosphoresidues in a pXpp motif that are essential for the arrestin2 interactions and activation. The same phosphoresidue cluster is present in other receptors, which form stable complexes with arrestin2. We propose that the identified pXpp motif is responsible for robust arrestin2 recruitment in many GPCRs. An analysis of available sequences, structural and functional information on other GPCR·arrestin interactions suggests that a particular arrangement of phosphoresidues within the GPCR intracellular loop 3 and C-terminal tail determines arrestin2 and 3 isoform specificity. Taken together, our findings demonstrate how multi-site phosphorylation controls GPCR·arrestin interactions and provide a framework to probe the intricate details of arrestin activation and signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>beta-arrestin</kwd><kwd>arrestin</kwd><kwd>G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)</kwd><kwd>CCR5</kwd><kwd>chemokine</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>phosphopeptide</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">GPCRs represent a large family of cell-surface receptors mediating signaling events via G proteins and arrestins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.

The receptor·arrestin complex acts as a scaffold for various further signaling proteins thereby activating e.g. ERK1/2 and MAP or inducing receptor internalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The many hundreds non-visual GPCRs in the human body are regulated by two genetically and structurally conserved non-visual arrestin subtypes, arrestin2 and arrestin3 (also known as β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2, respectively). While both isoforms can bind to the same receptor, their interaction may activate different signaling partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The arrestin-mediated signaling depends on the phosphorylation pattern of the GPCR C-terminal tail, which is modulated by the interactions of the GPCR with various GRKs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. These findings have led to the hypothesis of a phosphorylation ‘barcode’ for the receptor C-terminal tail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The molecular details of the specificity of GPCR-arrestin interactions and the causes for the different functional outcomes of varying phosphorylation patterns are still poorly understood. Previously solved full-length GPCR·arrestin complex structures comprise a rhodopsin-arrestin1 fusion complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, a fusion complex of the engineered constitutively active arrestin2 with the truncated 5HT<sub>2B</sub> serotonin receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, an arrestin2 complex with a chimera of the M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R) and the vasopressin 2 receptor C-terminal phosphopeptide (V2Rpp)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, a β1AR-V2Rpp chimera·arrestin2 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, as well as native V2R·arrestin2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and NTR1·arrestin2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> complexes. Of these, the rhodopsin fusion, the M2R-V2Rpp and β1AR-V2Rpp chimera, as well as the truncated 5HT2B serotonin receptor fusion complexes show similar orientations of the arrestin. However, the arrestin2 orientation differs significantly in the NTR1 and V2R complexes, which have native receptor C-terminal tails. The phosphate groups in the C-terminal tails have only been resolved in the M2R-V2Rpp, β1AR-V2Rpp, and V2R complexes. Higher resolution has been obtained in complex structures of arrestins with phosphorylated GPCR C-terminal tail peptides, which have revealed the position and coordination of several phosphates in addition to the hallmarks of arrestin activation, i.e. the replacement of arrestin strand β20 by the phosphorylated receptor peptide, conformational changes within the arrestin loops and a twist between its N- and C-terminal domains. However, these studies have been limited to V2Rpps binding arrestin2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, an ACKR3 (formerly known as CXCR7) C-terminal phosphopeptide binding arrestin3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, and a rhodopsin C-terminal phosphopeptide binding arrestin1 (visual arrestin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">We have recently determined the structure of the human chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in an active complex with the chemokine super-agonist [6P4]CCL5 and the heterotrimeric Gi protein by cryo electron microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. CCR5 plays a major role in inflammation by recruiting and activating leukocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.

The structure of the active [6P4]CCL5·CCR5oG<sub>i</sub> complex has provided detailed insights into the mechanism of CCR5 activation via the [6P4]CCL5 N-terminus, which differs from other solved chemokine·GPCR complexes.</p><p id="P5">Much less is known about the molecular basis of chemokine receptor interactions with arrestins, which play a similar critical role as G protein interactions in the immune response and inflammatory signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Here we have characterized the CCR5 phosphorylation induced by the super-agonist [6P4]CCL5 and GRK2. We discovered several new phosphorylation sites within the CCR5 C-terminal tail and used them together with previously reported sites to design a set of phosphopeptides for analyzing their effects on arrestin interactions. We determined high-resolution crystal structures of arrestin2 in apo form and in complex with two of these phosphopeptides with resolved positions of the phosphate groups in their electron density. The phosphate groups form a distinct pXpp phosphopeptide sequence motif that induces the active arrestin2 conformation by dominant electrostatic and beta-sheet interactions. An identical pXpp motif exists in the V2Rpp and forms the same activating interactions with arrestin2. A combination of NMR, biochemical and cellular assays confirmed the importance of this motif and quantified the contributions of individual phosphoresidues to arrestin binding and activation. A comparison of the new structures to other arrestin complexes together with an analysis of GPCR sequences provides hints on the molecular basis of arrestin2/arrestin3 isoform specificity.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Revisiting CCR5 phosphorylation by a G protein kinase</title><p id="P6">Agonist-driven phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in GPCRs by GRKs is generally required for arrestin binding. Although CCR5 has seven such potential phosphorylation sites in its C-terminal tail, phosphorylation of only four C-terminal serine residues has been reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. To clarify this situation, we characterized CCR5 phosphorylation by GRK2 that plays a prominent role in the regulation of many chemokine receptors, including CCR5 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. For this, GRK2 was co-expressed with CCR5 in insect cells and phosphorylation induced by the addition of the super-agonist chemokine [6P4]CCL5. Phosphoproteomics of the purified CCR5 clearly revealed phosphorylation of S349 and S325, which had not previously been reported, in addition to a double phosphorylation of S336 and S337, as well as a not well-defined single phosphorylation site in the region T340 to T343 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). Similar assignment ambiguities have been related previously to the heterogeneity of phosphorylation by GRKs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. A further western blot analysis with CCR5 phosphosite-specific antibodies confirmed the previously not reported phosphorylation of T340 as well as that of the serine residues S336/337, S342, and S349 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To assess the impact of these various CCR5 phosphoresidues on arrestin2 binding and conformation, we designed seven distinct CCR5 synthetic phosphopeptides in addition to the V2Rpp phosphopeptide mimicking V2R phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, which served as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). These designed CCR5 phosphopeptides did not include pS325, which is unlikely to play a major role in the arrestin interaction due to its location at the beginning of the CCR5 C-terminal tail directly following the palmitoylated cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This is confirmed by functional assays (see below).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>CCR5 phosphorylation levels govern arrestin2 binding</title><p id="P8">The interaction of the synthesized phosphopeptides with arrestin2 was first investigated by solution NMR spectroscopy using a truncated arrestin construct (arrestin2<sup>1-393</sup>, residues 1-393), which comprises the C-terminal strand β20, but lacks the disordered C-terminal tail. Upon addition of the phosphopeptides, the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC-TROSY spectra of arrestin2<sup>1-393</sup> [<sup>15</sup>N-labeled, ~80% deuterated] show continuous shifts in several resonance positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>) indicating fast to intermediate chemical exchange on the microsecond time scale. A nonlinear fit of the chemical shift changes to binding isotherms provided dissociation constants K<sub>D</sub> in the ten to hundred micromolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>), which is similar to previous observations on phosphopeptide·arrestin1 complexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Functional binding of the phosphopeptides to arrestin is expected to induce a conformational change, where arrestin’s C-terminal strand β20 is released from the β-sheet with its N-terminal β-strand and replaced by the phosphopeptide (see below). This exposes previously inaccessible cleavage sites in the arrestin C-terminus (R393 for arrestin2), which can be probed by trypsin digestion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Such a trypsin proteolysis carried out on full-length arrestin2 (arrestin2<sup>1-418</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) confirmed the functional conformational changes induced by the binding of the synthetic phosphopeptides.</p><p id="P10"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> summarizes the quantitative results of the NMR titrations and the trypsin proteolysis assays. The tightest binding was observed for the six-fold phosphorylated CCR5 6P peptide (K<sub>D</sub> = 45 ± 6 μM) and the eight-fold phosphorylated V2Rpp (K<sub>D</sub> = 19 ± 3 μM), whereas the three- and four-fold phosphorylated peptides have weaker affinities in the hundred micromolar K<sub>D</sub> range, agreeing with the expectation that the phosphorylation level dominates the arrestin·peptide interaction. However, individual phosphorylation sites contribute differently to the overall affinity. Hence, 5P1 (lacking pT343) shows weaker affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 147 ± 7 μM) whereas 5P2 (comprising pT343) has an affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 54 ± 6 μM) similar to 6P suggesting that phosphorylation of T343 is essential for tight arrestin binding.</p><p id="P11">The trypsin proteolysis rates of the arrestin·phosphopeptide complexes correlate with the determined affinities. Whereas the low-affinity (K<sub>D</sub> &gt; 100 μM) peptides (5P1 and all three- or four-fold phosphorylated peptides) had a trypsin digestion midpoint at around 30 minutes, for both 6P and V2Rpp the digested band became dominant already after only 5 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Of note, 5P2 comprising pT343 also had an accelerated digestion midpoint at about 20 minutes.</p><p id="P12">To probe active arrestin2 conformation induced by the synthetic CCR5 phosphopeptides, we incubated full-length arrestin2 with the peptides and synthetic antibody fragment Fab30 that selectively recognizes active arrestin2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The mixtures were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Both CCR5 phosphopeptide 6P (red) or V2Rpp (green) induced a shift of the elution volume to ~2.3 ml from the ~2.6 ml observed for the inactive apo form (black), which indicates the formation of stable phosphopeptide·arrestin2·Fab30 complexes. An identical result was obtained for the peptide 3P2 (blue), which is only phosphorylated at the central T340, S342, and T343 residues, despite its more than four-fold lower affinity. In contrast, all other CCR5 phosphopeptides with similar low affinities as 3P2 resulted in mixtures between active and inactive arrestin populations. These results suggest that the 3P2 phosphorylation pattern pXpp is specific, necessary, and sufficient for inducing the active arrestin2 conformation as assayed by Fab30 binding, while the other 6P phosphosites only contribute to the overall affinity.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Crystal structures of human arrestin2 in apo state and in complex with distinct CCR5 phosphopeptides</title><p id="P13">To obtain insights into structural changes of arrestin2 induced by phosphopeptide binding, two complexes of human arrestin2 (arrestin2<sup>1-359</sup>, lacking the C-terminal strand β20, see below) with the CCR5 4P and 6P phosphopeptides and the stabilizing Fab30 were prepared and their crystal structures determined at resolutions of 3.2 and 3.5 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Furthermore, also the crystal structure of full-length human arrestin2 was determined in its apo state at a resolution of 2.3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The latter is highly similar to the structure of bovine arrestin2 (PDB 1G4M) with the conserved fold composed of the two N- and C-terminal β-sandwich domains, the characteristic parallel β-sheet between the N- and C-terminal strands β1/β20, as well as a disordered C-terminal tail beyond residue 396 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup></p><p id="P14">While only parts of the phosphopeptides have well-defined electron densities in both phosphopeptide complex structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>), the phosphopeptide electron density is better defined in the 6P complex structure, indicating lower structural disorder in this region. For 6P, eight peptide residues (V338–E345) including the three phosphosites (pT340, pS342, pT343) have clearly defined density. In contrast, the electron density for 4P is reasonably defined only for four residues (A335–V338) including only two phosphosites (pS336, pS337) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Both 6P and 4P coordinate as extended β-strands with the arrestin2 N-terminal strand β1 in an antiparallel manner with their observable phosphate groups interacting with the same arrestin2 residues (see below). Strikingly, however, there is a register shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) such that the two consecutive phosphosites pS336, pS337 of the 4P complex take the positions of the two consecutive phosphosites pS342, pT343 in the 6P complex.</p><p id="P15">Both phosphopeptide complexes exhibit the hallmarks of arrestin2 activation, i.e., the formation of the anti-parallel intermolecular β-sheet between the arrestin strand β1 and the phosphopeptide, which replaces strand β20 of the intramolecular parallel β-sheet in the inactive apo arrestin2 structure, a twist of the C-domain relative to the N-domain of approximately 21°, and significant changes in the lariat, finger and middle loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). The two phosphopeptides induced very minor differences in the orientations of Fab30 relative to arrestin2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>) and consequently also very minor differences in unit cell dimensions and crystal packing of their crystallized complexes despite identical space groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). As compared to the 4P complex, the electron density of the 6P complex is less well-defined for arrestin2 residues 64-70 (center of finger loop) and 308-313 (at the end of the lariat loop). This may be caused by the variations in the crystal packing, but also indicates structural plasticity of these loops, which participate in receptor (finger loop) and clathrin (lariat loop) binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Key CCR5 phosphorylation sites responsible for arrestin2 activation</title><p id="P16">The polar core of apo arrestin harbors a network of highly conserved ionic interactions formed by D26 and R169 in the N-domain, D290 and D297 on the lariat loop of the C-domain and R393 located in an extended stretch after the C-terminal strand β20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Together with a salt bridge between R25 and E389 and the hydrogen bonds forming the parallel β-sheet between strands β1 and β20, these strong interactions connect the two arrestin domains and stabilize the inactive conformation.</p><p id="P17">The central element of arrestin activation is the disruption of this polar core by the β-strand exchange of the arrestin strand β20 with the receptor phosphopeptide and the subsequent relocation of the gate loop <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Arrestin2<sup>1-359</sup>, which was used for solving the crystal structures of the active complexes with the CCR5 phosphopeptides, lacks strand β20, thereby facilitating the formation of the intermolecular anti-parallel β-sheet to arrestin2 strand β1. In the 6P complex, the intermolecular β-sheet comprises CCR5 residues 341 to 344 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The first visible phosphoresidue pT340 forms intermolecular salt bridges to R25, K11, and K294 (lariat loop), thereby apparently disrupting the salt bridges between R169 and D290/D297, pulling the lariat loop towards the N-domain, and forcing a twist of the C-domain. The 6P complex is further stabilized by extensive electrostatic interactions of CCR5 residues pS342, pT343, and E345 with arrestin2 residues R7, K10 on strand β1 and R103, K107 on helix α1. In addition, the phosphate of pS342 forms a salt bridge to R67 on Fab30 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>).</p><p id="P18">While the 4P peptide also establishes an intermolecular anti-parallel β-sheet with strand β1 of arrestin2, there are fewer stable intermolecular contacts with no engagement of the arrestin2 lariat loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The two visible phosphoresidues, pS336 and pS337, form intermolecular salt bridges with arrestin2 residues R7, K10, and K107 in a similar way as the 6P phosphoresidues pS342 and pT343.</p><sec id="S7"><title>Cellular assays</title><p id="P19">The effect of individual CCR5 phosphorylation sites on arrestin2 recruitment and conformation was tested in a cellular context using several previously developed luciferase (NanoBiT) complementation assays <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> on seven S/A and T/A C-terminal point mutations of full-length CCR5.</p><p id="P20">For testing the direct recruitment of arrestin2 by CCR5 in response to [6P4]CCL5 stimulation, CCR5 fused to a small fragment (SmBiT) and arrestin2 fused to a large fragment (LgBiT) of luciferase (NanoBiT) were co-expressed in HEK293 cells and the complementation-induced luminescence was measured upon stimulation with the super-agonist [6P4]CCL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A</xref>). With the exception of the strongly attenuated T343A, all other CCR5 mutants recruited arrestin2 with similar efficiency as wild-type CCR5. We attribute the reduced recruitment by T343A to the abolishment of the direct ionic interaction of the pT343 phosphate group with the side chain of the arrestin N-terminal residue R7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), which also leads to a three-fold reduction in the phosphopeptide affinity as assayed by NMR (see above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P21">The intrabody30 (Ib30, a single chain derivative of Fab30) specifically recognizes the activated conformation of arrestin2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.

Whereas most mutations had only a moderate effect, the CCR5-T340A and S342A mutants almost completely abolished arrestin recognition by Ib30.

In contrast, the strong effect of T340A mutation apparently indicates a genuine change of the arrestin2 conformation, which strongly impedes recognition by Ib30.

Despite V2Rpp containing five more phosphorylation sites than CCR5 6P, both peptides form a completely analogous antiparallel β-sheet between their central residues and strand β1 of arrestin2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). This β-sheet is stabilized by an identical set of contacts between positively charged residues of arrestin2 and a central pXpp motif on the phosphopeptides (6P: pT340, pS342, pT343; V2Rpp: pT360, pS362, pS363). Similar to pT360 of V2Rpp, pT340 of CCR5 6P is oriented towards the connector region between arrestin’s N- and C-domains and forms salt bridges to K11 and R25 in the N-domain as well as K294 on the lariat loop. The latter interaction may constitute a main component of the force that reorients the arrestin domains upon activation. This notion is corroborated by Ib30-based functional studies, which show that both pT340 in CCR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and pT360 in V2R <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> strongly impact the conformation of arrestin2. Thus, this first phosphoresidue of the pXpp motif appears crucial to drive arrestin activation. Of note, the interaction of this first phosphoresidue is not present in the 4P complex where only the consecutive pS336 and pS337 take the role of the last two phosphoresidues in the pXpp motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, the presence of Fab30 and crystal packing may stabilize the active arrestin domain orientation even for this incomplete pXpp motif.</p><p id="P25">Besides these main interactions, further phosphosite interactions are observable in the V2Rpp complex, which are not present in the CCR5 6P complex: pT359 is involved in crystal contacts and pS357 as well as pS364 interact with the same arrestin residues as their respective adjacent pT360 and pT363. Remarkably, the N-terminal V2Rpp residues pT347 and pS350 form contacts with observable electron density to the arrestin2 finger loop and nearby residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, these two phosphoresidues do not form visible interactions with arrestin2 in full-length receptor complexes such as the M2R-V2Rpp chimera·arrestin2 (PDB: 6U1N), the β1AR-V2Rpp chimera·arrestin2 (PDB: 6TKO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) and the recently solved V2R·arrestin2 structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Rather in these complexes, only the phosphosites beyond V2R residue 356 coordinate with the arrestin2 N-domain in an identical manner as in the V2Rpp and CCR5 6P complex structures. This is presumably due to steric constraints imposed by the direct binding of the receptor core to the arrestin2 finger loop <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.

A comparison of the C-terminal sequences of structurally and functionally characterized GPCRs in the context of arrestin2 recruitment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) reveals that this pXpp motif is commonly found at a distance of 15 to 30 residues downstream of helix 8 (defined by the GPCRdb numbering scheme <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). This is the case for V2R, NTR1, and the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). A similar pattern occurs in many other chemokine receptors, such as CCR3 and CCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). In agreement with these observations, the indicated phosphorylation sites have been suggested as key arrestin binding motifs in V2R <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, rhodopsin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, and NTR1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. In summary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), this suggests that the pXpp cluster which follows a flexible linker of at least 15 amino acids after helix 8 is crucial for full arrestin2 engagement and stable arrestin2 complex formation. As judged from the high similarity of the solved CCR5 6P and V2Rpp complexes and the functional data, the first phosphoresidue of the pXpp cluster engages the lariat loop thereby triggering arrestin activation, whereas the last residue seems more important for overall arrestin2 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Structural insights into arrestin isoform recognition</title><p id="P28">The arrestin2 and arrestin3 isoforms of non-visual arrestins have highly conserved sequences and similar three-dimensional structures.

Similar to the CCR5 6P peptide, ACKR3pp binds in an extended conformation to the groove formed by the N-terminal arrestin β-sheet. However, its position is shifted towards the arrestin finger loop and it does not form an antiparallel β-sheet with the arrestin3 N-terminal strand β1. The arrestin3 binding groove also has a higher positive charge density than arrestin2, which extends towards the finger loop thereby explaining the engagement of ACKR3pp residue pS335 with this region. Both peptide positions overlap at the sites of pT340 (6P) and pT342 (ACKR3pp), interacting with a similar set of residues in arrestin2 and arrestin3, respectively. Interestingly, pS337 of CCR5, although not resolved in our structure and manually placed for comparison in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> would fit well into the arrestin3 binding interface and would form the same set of charge interactions as pT338 of ACKR3pp. In agreement with these observations, functional data on CCR5 indicate that an S337A mutant reduces both arrestin3 and arrestin2 binding to a similar extent, whereas arrestin3 binding is less reduced than arrestin2 binding for S342A and S349A mutants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.

The first group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, top) comprises receptors with very short IL3s (&lt; ~5aa) containing few possible phosphorylation sites and short (~20–50 aa) C-terminal tails with dense clusters of serine and threonine residues often harboring the pXpp motif. Receptors of this group are almost all peptide-binding GPCRs including chemokine receptors with a number of them known to form stable arrestin complexes and characterized as class B receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). As indicated, both CCR5 and V2R belong to this group. The high density of potential phosphorylation sites and the specific recognition of the pXpp motif in this class of receptors may explain the higher affinity for arrestins and the long lifetime of the arrestin complexes.</p><p id="P33">The second group of receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, bottom) have longer to extremely long (&gt;100 aa) IL3s and C-terminal tails with diverse lengths ranging from very short (&lt; 10 aa, muscarinic, dopamine, and some 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors) to very long (~150 aa, α-adrenergic receptors). The density of potential phosphorylation sites within ICL3 and the C-terminal tail is lower for this second group than for the first group. The receptors in this second group, which have been characterized for arrestin binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), interact with arrestins in a transient manner and in part have a preference towards arrestin3 as would be expected for class A receptors.

Moreover, the structure of active arrestin3 in complex with ACKR3pp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) shows that the peptide interaction surface is very close to the finger and middle loops, which are engaged with the receptor core. Considering this close proximity of the arrestin3 binding interface to the receptor core, it is likely that both the C-terminal tail and ICL3 participate in the arrestin3 complex formation. Of note, D2R, which has a long ICL3, but no C-terminal tail after helix 8, recruits arrestin3 even in absence of GRK phosphorylation suggesting that arrestin3 recruitment might be less dependent on phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P35">In conclusion our structural and biophysical analysis of the interactions between the CCR5 phosphorylated C-terminus and arrestin2 has identified a key pXpp motif for arrestin2 recruitment and activation, which appears to be conserved across many class B GPCRs such as V2R, NTR1, rhodopsin, CXCR3 and CXCR4.

Phosphoresidues are shown in stick representation. Center: schematic diagrams of key 6P/V2R·arrestin2 interactions. Solid red lines represent polar interactions, dashed red lines H-bonds, gray lines other interactions. Right: V2Rpp·arrestin2 binding interface in the β1AR-V2Rpp·arrestin2 cryo-EM structure (PDB 6TKO). Unresolved parts of the ICL3 and C-terminal tail are depicted as dashed lines. (B) Single-particle analysis of negative-stain EM images of the [6P4]CCL5·CCR5·arrestin2·Fab30 complex. (C) Sequence alignment of C-terminal tails of several GPCRs (green), which are known to form a stable complex with arrestin2. Bold green indicates solved complex structures, light green functionally well-characterized receptors. Receptors indicated in black are examples of other not well characterized chemokine receptors harboring a pXpp motif. The GPCR C-terminal tail sequences were downloaded from the GPCRdb <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. The common pXpp motif (highlighted in green) is typically located about 15–30 residues downstream from receptor helix 8.
