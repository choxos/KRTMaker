How it does so and the degree to which these adaptations reflect changes in its fundamental design principles remain unclear. Here, we investigate the process of PAR polarization within the highly tractable <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline P lineage, which undergoes a series of iterative asymmetric stem cell-like divisions. Compared to the zygote, we observe significant differences in the pattern of polarity emergence, including an inversion of the initial unpolarized state, changes in symmetry breaking cues, and the timings with which anterior and posterior PARs segregate. Beneath these differences, however, polarity establishment remains reliant on the same core pathways identified in the zygote, including conserved roles for cortical actin flows and PAR-dependent self-organization. Intriguingly, we find that cleavage furrow-directed cortical actin flows play a similar symmetry-breaking role for the germline cell P1 as centrosome-induced cortical flows in the zygote. Through their ability to induce asymmetric accumulation of PAR-3 clusters, these furrow-directed flows directly couple the geometry of polarization to cell division, which could be a general strategy for cells to ensure proper organization within dynamically growing systems, such as embryos. In summary, our data suggest that coupling of novel symmetry-breaking cues with highly adaptable core mechanochemical circuits enable robust PAR polarity in response to changing developmental contexts.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">During development, the highly conserved PAR polarity network is continuously redeployed in a variety of cell and tissue types.

The germline precursors in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are set aside during a program of four sequential PAR-dependent asymmetric stem cell-like divisions. Beginning with P0 and proceeding through P1, P2 and P3, each cell polarizes and undergoes an asymmetric division that yields one P lineage daughter, which retains germline potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). These divisions ultimately give rise to the germline founder cell, P4, which divides symmetrically to generate the two primordial germ cells, Z2 and Z3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Rose and GÃ¶nczy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Most of what we know about PAR polarity in this system comes from study of the zygote (P0). Here, PAR polarity relies on mutual antagonistic cross-talk between two groups of proteins that form opposing membrane-associated domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>): anterior or aPAR proteins (PAR-3, PAR-6, PKC-3, CDC-42) and posterior or pPAR proteins (PAR-1, PAR-2, LGL-1, CHIN-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Beatty et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Boyd et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Etemad-Moghadam et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gotta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Guo and Kemphues, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hoege et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kumfer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Tabuse et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Watts et al., 1996</xref>). Each group excludes the other from its respective domain: the polarity kinase PKC-3 excludes pPARs from the anterior, while the kinase PAR-1 and the CDC-42 GAP CHIN-1 suppress aPARs in the posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kumfer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Sailer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Prior to symmetry breaking, aPARs are enriched uniformly throughout the plasma membrane and largely restrict pPARs to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cowan and Hyman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Schonegg and Hyman, 2006</xref>). Symmetry is broken through two semi-redundant cell-intrinsic cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, cortical actin flows, which typically manifest alongside pronounced ruffling of the cell cortex, segregate aPARs towards the nascent anterior half of the cell and allow pPARs to associate with the posterior membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Goehring et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Munro et al., 2004</xref>). Second, formation of the pPAR domain is further promoted by the ability of PAR-2 to self-organize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>). This so-called PAR-2 pathway relies on the combined effects of the RING domain and microtubule-binding activity of PAR-2, which provides membrane stabilization and local protection from PKC-3 phosphorylation at the posterior respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>). As a nascent pPAR domain forms, PAR-2 stabilizes PAR-1, which in turn promotes local displacement of aPARs through phosphorylation of PAR-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>). While cortical flows appear to be the dominant early cue in wild type zygotes, when flows are absent or compromised, the PAR-2 pathway is sufficient for polarization, allowing pPARs to invade uniform aPAR-enriched membranes to form a domain that eventually gains the capacity to exclude aPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gross et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Zonies et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Previous work has shown that asymmetric divisions of later P lineage cells retain a dependence on PKC-3 for polarization, consistent with a continued requirement for PAR polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hubatsch et al., 2019</xref>). However, the extent to which polarity pathways found in P0 are redeployed in later P lineage cells, and whether individual PAR proteins remain involved is largely unexplored. Several observations suggest that the machinery driving polarization may differ. First, because the P lineage daughter necessarily arises from the pPAR-enriched half of the cell during asymmetric division, P1-P3 are all born with a cortex enriched for pPAR proteins, in striking contrast to P0, in which the cortex is initially aPAR enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hubatsch et al., 2019</xref>). Second, polarity in P1-P3 is not associated with large scale membrane ruffling associated with cortical actin flows in P0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Munro et al., 2004</xref>). Third, experiments using a temperature sensitive <italic>par-2</italic> allele suggest that the requirement for PAR-2 may be lost in later P lineage divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cheng et al., 1995</xref>). Finally, P2 and P3 exhibit a so-called polarity reversal, consistent with a switch from intrinsic to extrinsic polarity cues, which is critical for ensuring the proper orientation of polarity and asymmetric divisions with respect to neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Arata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Schierenberg, 1987</xref>). In P2 and P3, signaling with their respective endoderm precursor neighbors, EMS and E, promote segregation of PAR-2 towards, rather than away from the cell contact, which occurs in P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Altogether, these data imply substantial modification of polarity pathways in these closely related cells.</p><p id="P7">Here we sought to characterize the mechanisms of polarization in the P lineage with a focus on P1. Specifically, we asked if the polarity pathways found in the zygote are also deployed in the P lineage or alternatively, if PAR polarization in later P lineage cells represent a shift in paradigm. We found that despite a visually distinct pattern of polarity establishment, the pathways used for polarization appear highly conserved in P lineage blastomeres, including roles for PAR-2 self-organization, mutual antagonism between aPARs and pPARs, and cortical flows. Notably, we find a conserved role for symmetry-breaking cortical flows, which in P1 are directed by the ingressing cleavage furrow rather than the centrosome as in the zygote. By concentrating PAR-3 at the nascent cell contact, these furrow-directed flows effectively couple daughter cell polarity to the prior cell division. Thus, our work both highlights (1) the intrinsic adaptability of core polarization mechanisms to changing cellular contexts and symmetry-breaking cues, and (2) suggests a role of cleavage furrow-directed cortical flows in linking the geometry of PAR polarity to cell division, which could be a broadly applicable strategy for ensuring proper cell organization in dynamically growing systems.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>pPAR polarization precedes aPAR segregation in P1</title><p id="P8">To understand how PAR polarity is reestablished in P lineage blastomeres, we first characterized the behavior of aPARs and pPARs through the cell cycle of the more tractable P1 cell. By imaging P1 immediately following division of the zygote, we found that pPARs initially appeared uniformly enriched at the membrane, while aPARs were either confined to the cytoplasm or present very weakly at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). This initial state of P1 is inverse to that of zygote, in which aPARs are initially enriched at the plasma membrane while pPARs are cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The first obvious signs of polarization in P1 typically occurred within 3-5 minutes following completion of cytokinesis in the zygote, as PAR-2 cleared from region of the cell contact with AB, which corresponds to the anterior of P1, and was concentrated into a well-defined posterior domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-ii, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A, B</xref>). Importantly, we cannot rule out some level of pre-existing aPAR asymmetry in P1, due to high membrane concentration of aPARs in AB and the coincidence of AB and P1 membranes at the cell contact site.</p><p id="P10">Surprisingly, despite the formation of a PAR-2 domain, aPARs loaded onto the plasma membrane in a relatively uniform manner, such that aPAR and pPARs overlapped in the posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-ii</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C-F</xref>). Thus, PAR-2 appears to self-organize into a posterior domain prior to segregation of aPARs. This behavior is similar to what has been observed in the zygote when the predominant symmetry-breaking cue, actin flow, is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gross et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Zonies et al., 2010</xref>). Only after approximately 7 mins, did aPARs begin to segregate from the posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-iii, D</xref>). Finally, by ~10 mins, P1 exhibited the typical complementary, mutually-exclusive arrangement of aPAR and pPAR domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-iii</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Movie S1</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Thus, the process of PAR polarization in P1 appears to be inverted relative to the zygote: (i) pPARs are initially enriched at the plasma membrane, while aPARs are predominantly cytoplasmic; (ii) an early symmetry-breaking cue induces segregation of PAR-2; (iii) aPARs subsequently load and segregate away from the posterior, following formation of a pPAR domain (compare this sequence to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> - Zygote).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Actin flow and pPAR antagonism contributes to segregation of aPARs in P1</title><p id="P12">In the zygote, cortical actin flows and posterior exclusion by pPARs act in a semi-redundant manner to drive aPAR segregation towards the anterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Munro et al. (2004</xref>) reported contemporaneous flows of PAR-6 and NMY-2 to the anterior of P1. Consistent with these findings, during aPAR segregation, PAR-3 and NMY-2 appeared to flow together towards the cell contact (cell anterior) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, we observe NMY-2 flow velocities undergoing a sharp increase at the time of onset of aPAR segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F, G</xref>). Note that in contrast to the symmetry-breaking flows in the zygote, these flows occur well after PAR-2 segregation, and therefore we refer to them as âlate flows.â</p><p id="P13">To determine whether these âlate flowsâ are necessary and/or sufficient for aPAR segregation in P1, and whether they act redundantly with pPAR exclusion of aPARs, we inhibited cortical flows and pPAR-dependent exclusion alone or in combination. To eliminate cortical flows, we utilized a fast-acting temperature sensitive allele of <italic>nmy-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), and shifted the temperature three minutes after cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>), which was the earliest time that did not lead to regression of the cleavage furrow (data not shown). To disrupt pPAR-dependent exclusion we utilized an allele of <italic>par-3</italic>, <italic>par-3(S950A</italic>), which lacks the dominant PAR-1 phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, because of the redundancy of the two pathways in the zygote, <italic>par-3(S950A)</italic> zygotes still polarize (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). The latter was critical, as it allowed us to use <italic>nmy-2(ts</italic>); <italic>par-3(S950A)</italic> zygotes to generate P1 cells at the permissive temperature and then inactivate cortical flows through acutely shifting 2-cell embryos to the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Regardless of whether one or both pathways was inhibited in P1, PAR-2 still segregated into a posterior domain, which is similar to what has been observed in zygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>). By contrast and similar to the zygote, while disruption of either pathway alone had no obvious effect on aPAR segregation, aPARs remained uniformly enriched throughout the plasma membrane when both pathways were inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). Taken together, our data suggests that similar to the zygote, both cortical flows and pPAR-dependent aPAR exclusion from the posterior contributes to aPAR segregation in P1.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The PAR-2 pathway promotes early polarization of pPARs in P1</title><p id="P15">We next sought to determine whether the polarization of pPARs in P1 relies on the same pathways that operate in the zygote. In wild type P1 cells, pPAR polarization takes place prior to segregation of aPARs from the posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-ii</xref>), and as we have shown can proceed in the absence of aPAR segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Previous work has shown that polarization of pPARs in the zygote can also proceed in the absence of aPAR segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>). However, this result does not imply that aPAR activity is not required as either depletion or inhibition of PKC-3 completely blocks pPAR polarization in the zygote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Ng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>). To determine whether the same was the case in P1, we turned to an analog sensitive version of PKC-3, PKC-3<sup>AS</sup>. Consistent with previous findings, and in support of a strict requirement for PKC-3 activity in P1, acute treatment of <italic>pkc-3<sup>AS</sup></italic> embryos with the ATP analog 1NA-PP1 at birth of P1 completely blocked pPAR polarization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hubatsch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Ng et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P16">In the zygote, the ability of pPARs to polarize in the absence of aPAR segregation is thought to rely on PAR-2 self-organization in response to local microtubule cues provided by the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>). It has been postulated that the ability for PAR-2 to bind to microtubules provide local resistance to PKC-3 phosphorylation, and enables PAR-2 to load onto the posterior membrane in presence of aPARs. Subsequently, the RING domain of PAR-2 helps stabilize the protein on the posterior membrane even after the centrosome departs from the posterior membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, in absence of aPAR segregation, pPAR polarization in the zygote becomes sensitive to mutations in either the PAR-2 RING domain, or the PAR-2 microtubule binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gross et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore sought to determine whether these requirements were also maintained in P1.</p><p id="P17">To selectively disrupt microtubule binding of PAR-2, we introduced the previously described R183-5A mutation into the endogenous locus, hereafter <italic>par-2(MT-)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>). Because polarization is largely unaffected in <italic>par-2(MT-)</italic> zygotes when cortical flows are normal, they undergo normal asymmetric division to generate AB and P1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>). Although PAR-2(MT-) supported a smaller PAR-2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, B</xref>), which we also observed in the zygote (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>), counter-intuitively, it polarized to the posterior even earlier than PAR-2(WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, C</xref>). This result suggests that microtubule binding by PAR-2 at the posterior is not the dominant symmetry breaking cue in P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5E</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We next turned to the RING domain. We disrupted the RING domain by introducing a C56S mutation into the endogenous locus to disrupt one of the zinc-chelating cysteines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hao et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, polarization and asymmetric division of the zygote is largely unaffected by <italic>par-2(C56S)</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>) due to aPAR segregation by cortical flows (data not shown). We found that PAR-2 membrane levels decreased during cytokinesis in PAR-2(C56S) zygotes, such that by birth of P1, PAR-2(C56S) was largely cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thereafter, PAR-2(C56S) failed to localize to the membrane or support pPAR domain formation at the normal time. Instead, we observed weak posterior loading of PAR-2(C56S) late in the cell cycle at a time that coincided with the onset of aPAR segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D, E</xref>). This suggests that, as in the zygote, PAR-2(C56S) is only able to localize to regions of the plasma membrane devoid of aPARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D, E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hao et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, we conclude that, similar to the zygote, the RING domain is required in P1 for PAR-2 to self-organize in absence of aPAR segregation, and thus required for robust and timely PAR-2 polarization in P1.</p><p id="P19">Finally, we asked how disrupting PAR-2 polarization would affect polarization of PAR-1 in P1, which as we have shown occurs with PAR-2 polarization and prior to aPAR segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). To disrupt PAR-2 polarization, we introduced an S241A mutation into the endogenous locus, which prevents displacement from the membrane by PKC-3-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>). Somewhat surprisingly, despite uniform PAR-2 at the membrane, PAR-1 and PAR-6 were still able to polarize in the zygote, leading to normal asymmetric division (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C, D</xref>). We found that in the resulting <italic>par-2(S241A)</italic> P1 blastomeres, PAR-1 polarity was both substantially weaker and delayed such that it occurred concurrently, instead of prior to, the onset of aPAR segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5F</xref>). Thus, similar to the zygote, in absence of aPAR segregation, PAR-2 self-organization promotes timely polarization of PAR-1.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Furrow-directed flows enrich PAR-3 within the nascent cell contact</title><p id="P20">The invariable segregation of pPARs away from the nascent cell contact, which was more pronounced in <italic>par-2(MT-)</italic> embryos, suggested the presence of an early acting symmetry-breaking cue that biases polarization of pPARs. While imaging the segregation of aPARs at the cortex of P1 cells, we noticed that PAR-3 appeared to be transported into the nascent cleavage furrow by furrow-directed cortical flows as the zygote divided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Movie S2</xref>), which were distinct from the âlateâ flows we have documented above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). This transport of PAR-3 was particularly prominent for PAR-3(S950A), which exhibits elevated levels at the membrane compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Subsequent imaging of dividing embryos in cross-section revealed a marked enrichment of PAR-3 towards the leading edge of the ingressing furrow, similar to what was reported by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Pittman and Skop, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-E</xref>). Importantly, we found that this was not observed for the plasma membrane marker PH-PLCd1 and thus does not simply reflect an increased membrane accumulation at this site. Together, these data suggest that PAR-3 flows towards the leading edge of the cleavage furrow.</p><p id="P21">We next sought to follow the fate of this accumulation in the furrow after the zygote divided. However, imaging of aPARs at the nascent cell contact of P1 is complicated by the coincidence of membranes from both AB and P1, together with much higher levels of aPARs inherited by AB. To specifically visualize proteins in P1, we devised a photobleaching technique to remove the contribution of fluorescence signals from AB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A</xref>). Briefly, just after cytokinesis, we bleached the entire AB cell, which necessarily includes a portion of the P1 membrane at the contact site. This was followed by continuous bleaching of a region of AB away from the cell contact to bleach any residual pool of fluorescent protein in AB.

Consequently, unlike PAR-2(WT), PAR-2(S241A; 4mer) was efficiently segregated by cortical flows into the anterior of the zygote along with aPARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Outside of this selective enrichment, aPAR membrane concentrations are initially low throughout the rest of the cell, while pPARs are uniformly high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Next, PAR-2 self-organization drives timely formation of a posterior pPAR domain, the position of which is consistent with being biased by aPARs at the cell contact. Concurrently, aPARs load progressively throughout the plasma membrane of P1, leading to overlap between aPAR and pPAR proteins at the posterior. Finally, pPAR-dependent exclusion of aPARs and âlateâ cortical flows combine to drive bulk segregation of aPARs into a visible anterior domain, resulting in the characteristic mutually exclusive distributions of aPARs and pPARs. Although technical limitations prevented more extensive analysis in P2, we were able to obtain data which suggests that this basic picture is preserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>). Notably, in addition to polarity being sensitive to disruption of cortical flows and aPAR exclusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8B</xref>), we also found that PAR-2 was initially biased away from the contact site as in P1, before eventually reversing due to the signaling from its neighboring endoderm precursor EMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Arata et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that the furrow-associated cue is also active but ultimately overridden in P2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8C</xref>).</p><sec id="S9"><title>Diverse patterns of PAR polarization arise from a common set of core mechanisms</title><p id="P29">Compared to the zygote, the pattern of polarization in P lineage blastomeres differs in several notable ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). First, the initial state of PAR proteins at the membrane prior to polarization is inverted relative to the zygote, i.e. with pPARs high and aPARs low. Second, in contrast to the zygote in which aPAR and pPAR domains emerge together as aPARs are segregated into the anterior by cortical flows, emergence of aPAR and pPAR domains in P lineage blastomeres is decoupled. Third, there are extensive periods in which aPAR and pPAR localisations are not mutually exclusive. Finally, rather than being linked to a single period of polarizing cortical flow, polarity in P1 is linked to two distinct periods of cortical flow separated by a temporal gap: an âearlyâ cleavage furrow-directed cortical flow breaks symmetry by driving an accumulation of a PAR-3 pool at the cell anterior, while a second period of âlateâ flow helps drive bulk segregation and coalescence of aPARs into an anterior domain. Zygotes also exhibit so-called late flows. However, unlike those found in the P lineage blastomeres, late flows in the zygote closely follow the cessation of early flows and are oriented bidirectionally from both the anterior and posterior towards the embryo midline, where they are primarily thought to reenforce and stabilize the PAR boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Sailer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Given such differences, it is rather striking that the core mechanisms of PAR protein segregation are largely conserved between these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>): (1) Polarization begins with an initial symmetry breaking event involving segregation of aPARs by cortical flows; (2) Polarity is promoted by PAR-2 self-organization; (3) Segregation of aPARs is driven by semi-redundant contributions of cortical flow and exclusion by pPARs.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Patterns of polarity emergence are defined by the cell state</title><p id="P31">We suggest that the disparate manifestations of polarity establishment in these cells arise not from distinct polarity mechanisms, but from distinct peculiarities of each cellâs life history. For example, in the zygote, the earlier timing of aPAR domain formation can be explained by the fact that aPAR membrane levels are already high at the onset of cortical flows, which allows them to be segregated into an aPAR domain early in the cell cycle. In contrast, in later P lineage blastomeres, the cessation of furrow-associated flows occurs prior to bulk loading of aPARs onto the plasma membrane. Thus, bulk aPAR segregation is delayed until the onset of late flows. Consistent with this interpretation, disruption of âearlyâ flows in the zygote shifts polarization to a P1-like program: PAR-2 now polarizes prior to aPAR segregation, leading to transient overlap of aPARs and pPARs in the posterior, until the combined action of antagonistic pPAR activity and a period of âlateâ cortical flows drive aPAR exclusion from the posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Zonies et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Similarly, the distinct initial states of the zygote vs P lineage blastomeres could explain the rather striking difference in behavior of PAR-2(MT-) mutants: whereas the protection against PKC-3 provided by MT association is an advantage in the zygote, in which PAR-2 must invade an aPAR-dominated cortex, it may be a disadvantage in P1, in which aPAR levels on the membrane are low initially and PAR-2 must be cleared from the anterior. Consistent with this interpretation, we have found that early polarization of P1 in PAR-2(MT-) mutants can be suppressed by mild aPAR depletion (data not shown).</p><p id="P33">Finally, our data suggest that the mutually exclusive nature of aPAR and pPAR domains, enforced through mutual antagonism, is a tunable parameter of the system rather than an intrinsic requirement for the establishment of PAR domains per se. Notably, we found that in P1, formation of aPAR and pPAR domains is temporally uncoupled, which leads to overlap between the two domains for much of the cell cycle. The canonical mutually exclusive localizations of aPARs and pPARs, which is more typical of the zygote, only appears late in P1. Intriguingly, in the zygote, such uncoupling has been observed when anterior and posterior PAR proteins are out of balance. In these cases, aPARs and pPARs initially overlap but are sometimes able to resolve into mutually-exclusive domains later in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dickinson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lim et al., 2021</xref>), which is almost identical to what we observe in wild-type P1 cells. Therefore, the temporal progression towards an increasing mutual exclusion of aPARs and pPARs that we observe in P1 could suggest that embryos temporally optimize levels of PAR cross-talk, potentially adding to already established roles for cell cycle-dependent regulation of PAR polarity and cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carvalho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dickinson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Klinkert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Peglion and Goehring, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Wirtz-Peitz et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Furrow-induced flows as a paradigm for division-linked symmetry breaking</title><p id="P34">Work in many systems has demonstrated the coupling of cell polarity to cell division, which presumably allows coordination of cellular geometry in tissues that are actively dividing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Buckley and St Johnston, 2022</xref>).

Membrane concentrations at each position were calculated as the amplitude of the Gaussian component. This protocol is similar to previously published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gross et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Reich et al., 2019</xref>) and identical to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Ng et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Image analysis â defining anterior and posterior poles in the zygote</title><p id="P52">The overall geometry of the zygote was first defined by fitting the shape of the ROI to an ellipsoid. The anterior and posterior pole was defined as the ROI coordinate closest to the tip of each side of the major axis.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Image analysis â alignment of time series data in P1</title><p id="P53">Because PAR domains are more variable in position during polarization in P1, membrane profiles were aligned throughout the cell cycle for each embryo, followed by alignment between embryos to ensure accurate representation of PAR polarization dynamics. To align membrane concentration profiles throughout the cell cycle of an embryo, membrane profiles that were adjacent in time were averaged; individual profiles within that time span were aligned to the mean, and this process was iterated until a lowest mean squared error was obtained. To align membrane profiles between embryos, an averaged membrane profile for time points around NEBD was used as a reference for each embryo, and aligned in a way identical to before, i.e. the membrane profiles of individual embryos were aligned to the mean of all embryos, and the process was iterated until the lowest mean squared error was achieved. Membrane profiles were also geometrically corrected, through automated tracing of the ROIs in both clockwise and anti-clockwise fashion, and to flip membrane profiles of individual embryos so that the average of all embryos has the lowest mean squared error when aligned.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Image analysis â ASI</title><p id="P54">For calculating ASI, the following equation was used: ASI = (A â P) / (2 * (A + P)), where A and P denote the sum of fluorescence signals in the anterior or posterior 30% of the cell respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P55">As embryos vary slightly in their cell cycle length, to match ASI from cytokinesis to NEBD between different embryos, a cubic interpolation was used to normalize data to the same length.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Image analysis - domain size</title><p id="P56">For calculating domain size, fluorescence profiles were first fitted to an error function with a defined gradient center and width. The domain size was calculated as total length of <italic>fluorescence profile â (gradient center â 0.75 * gradient width)</italic>. Domain size is then defined as a fraction of the embryo perimeter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Ng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS158975-supplement-Supplemental_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d86aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Movie S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS158975-supplement-Supplemental_Movie_S1.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d86aAdFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplemental Movie S2</label><media xlink:href="EMS158975-supplement-Supplemental_Movie_S2.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d86aAdFdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplemental Movie S3</label><media xlink:href="EMS158975-supplement-Supplemental_Movie_S3.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d86aAdFeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplemental Movie S4</label><media xlink:href="EMS158975-supplement-Supplemental_Movie_S4.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d86aAdFfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S28"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Nic Tapon and Clare Buckley for comments on the manuscript and Lesilee Rose for discussions of unpublished data.

P lineage blastomeres. Top, a schematic of PAR localizations in each blastomere at early and late stages of the cell cycle. Note the reversal of PAR domain orientation in P2 and P3 such that the PAR-2 domain (cyan) is oriented towards the E lineage neighbor (EMS, E). Below - for reference, the general mechanisms of polarization as understood from work in the zygote. Here, prior to symmetry breaking, the membrane is uniformly enriched with aPARs (red) and depleted of pPARs (cyan). The centrosome then induces symmetry breaking by triggering cortical flows (dotted red box), which segregates aPARs to the anterior, and induces self-organization of a PAR-2 domain (dotted blue box) at the posterior through microtubule binding. Once polarity has been established, mutual antagonism (dotted box with gradient) keeps aPAR and pPAR domains segregated. Mutual antagonism is driven by (i) phosphorylation of PAR-3 by PAR-1, which inhibits clustering, (ii) deactivation of CDC-42 by CHIN-1, and (iii) phosphorylation-dependent membrane displacement of PAR-1, PAR-2, and LGL-1 by PKC-3. Anterior exclusion of CHIN-1 is PKC-3 dependent, but it is still unknown whether CHIN-1 is a direct target.</p><p>(B) A time series of midsection confocal images of embryos expressing both mCherry::PAR-2 and PAR-6::mNG (NWG0268) during polarity establishment in P1.

Thirty seconds after P0 cytokinesis, a region encompassing the entire AB cell, necessarily including the anteriormost region of P1 and the AB-P1 contact, was bleached (dotted box). We then allow fluorescence recovery in P1, while continually bleaching a small region of AB to further ensure that no fluorescence pool remains in AB. Consequently, any remaining signal at the cell contact should reflect proteins from P1.

SB is triggered by centrosomes, which induces âearlyâ cortical flows that segregate aPARs to the anterior. Self-organization of PAR-2 at the posterior also helps form and stabilize a posterior pPAR domain, which excludes aPARs from the posterior. By mitosis, aPARs and pPARs display mutually exclusive localizations, which are maintained via cross-inhibition. The boundaries of each PAR domain are also stabilized by âlateâ cortical flows which are directed towards the midline. (Right) During P0 cytokinesis, âearlyâ cleavage furrow-directed flows lead to accumulation of PAR-3 at the leading edge, which concentrates PAR-3 at the nascent cell contact (anterior) of P1. By completion of P0 cytokinesis, these âearlyâ flows cease, leading to low aPAR levels across the membrane of the cell apart from enrichment at the cell contact. In contrast, pPARs are uniformly distributed throughout P1 initially. Soon after, pPARs polarize away from the cell contact (anterior), matching where aPARs accumulate during âearlyâ flows, and are dependent on PAR-2 self-organization for timely formation of a pPAR domain. Concurrently, aPARs load throughout the cell, resulting in overlap of aPARs and pPARs at the posterior. Finally, âlateâ flows and posterior exclusion of aPARs by pPARs segregates aPARs towards the anterior, resulting in the stereotyped mutually-exclusive localization of aPARs and pPARs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS158975-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
