When an injury occurs in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), scar tissue develops which, while necessary to limit further damage to nearby tissue, also inhibits regrowth of axons through the lesion site. In contrast, injury to the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is followed by a robust regenerative response during which axons may regrow and reconnect with their targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">This opposite response of the CNS and PNS to injury has been subject of intense research, focusing largely on the chemical makeup of the injured tissue.

The nerve endoneurium, which makes up most of the nerve cross-sectional area, houses all neuronal axons and Schwann cells. Sections of endoneurium are bundled into fascicles by tightly packed perineurial cells, which make up the nerve perineurium. Finally, the outer portion of the nerve is protected by the ECM-rich epineurium consisting of fibroblast-like cells and collagen, which is subdivided into an outer epifascicular and an inner interfascicular portion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). We investigated the mechanical stiffness of these four nerve compartments in acutely excised <italic>ex vivo</italic> sciatic nerve preparations using AFM indentation measurements, in which forces were applied at similar length (~μm), time (~s), and force (~nN) scales at which cells probe their environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">To identify the nerve compartments for AFM analysis, we stained cross-sections of nerve samples from the sciatic nerve of adult rats with the live marker fluoromyelin, which labels myelin sheets around axons in the endoneurium and highlights both the unlabelled narrow perineurium and the thicker interfascicular epineurium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B-C</xref>). Immunostaining of fixed nerve tissue for markers of perineurial cells (Glut 1) and nerve fibroblasts commonly found in the epineurium (CD34)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> confirmed that fluoromyelin provided an accurate guide to identify nerve compartments in live nerve samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D-E</xref>). The interfascicular epineurium was identified as the tissue enveloping the exterior of the endoneurial cross-sections, and the epifascicular epineurium accessed by placing an un-sectioned sample of nerve on its side.</p><p id="P8">We performed AFM-based raster scans in areas of nerve cross-sections containing all compartments and pooled the measurements belonging to each nerve compartment for each nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F-G</xref>). The elastic stiffness of endoneurium, perineurium, and interfascicular epineurium was similar with median apparent reduced elastic moduli <italic>K</italic> = 66 Pa, 59 Pa, and 59 Pa, respectively. The epifascicular epineurium was significantly stiffer than the other nerve tissues (median <italic>K</italic> = 101 Pa, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn-Sidak multiple comparisons test).

To test whether this mechanical anisotropy of the endoneurium is due to the longitudinal orientation of morphological structures (e.g., axons), we performed acute crushes on dissected nerve samples in ice-cold solution two hours prior to measurement, to damage those structures while minimising inflammatory responses.

Compression of the nerve causes damage to the tissue, disrupting axon integrity and resulting in long-term loss of nerve conduction. Crush injury triggers an inflammatory response, leading to changes in the cellular and ECM composition at the injury site. This response is a vital step leading to axon regeneration and restoration of peripheral nerve function. To test whether these injury-associated changes in tissue composition may be associated with changes in tissue mechanics, we carried out a compression injury in the sciatic nerve of rats and evaluated accompanying changes in tissue stiffness and ECM composition at the crush site 3 days as well as 90 days post injury.</p><p id="P11">The injury immediately eliminated all sciatic nerve-related motor control and sensory perception in the operated limb.

Transection injury, also known as neurotmesis, occurs when a nerve becomes fully severed, resulting in the formation of two nerve stumps with a gap between them. The subsequent healing response by the body requires the formation of a tissue bridge, formed by cells migrating from the nerve stumps and eventually becomes the substrate within which axons regrow across the lesion. During the regenerative response, the nerve tissue bridge is a distinct tissue type with unique cell and ECM content; it becomes similar in composition to nerve tissue over a time period of months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">To test how tissue mechanics changes after transection injuries, we generated a 5-mm gap between the stumps of transected rat sciatic nerves <italic>in vivo</italic> and implanted a PDMS conduit to house the nerve bridge and guide nerve regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Measurements of both nerve bridges and stumps were done at 5 days post-transection, at which time point stumps are still distinguishable and bridges contain macrophages, fibroblasts, a dense ECM, and Bungner/Schwann cells migrating from the nerve stumps, while regenerating axons are not yet found<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We also evaluated bridges at 90 days post-surgery, when regeneration is complete, and animals had recovered limb sensation and motion.</p><p id="P17">As after crush injuries, we found that nerve bridges were significantly stiffer than naïve control nerves (median <italic>K</italic> = 759 Pa) 5 days post-injury (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−10</sup>, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn-Sidak multiple comparisons test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). The stiffness of these nerve bridges was even considerably higher than that of regenerating, stiffened tissue of crushed nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Also after transection injuries, the observed greater stiffness in bridges was accompanied by changes in ECM composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C, D</xref>). Nerve bridges exhibited significantly geater collagen I (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0003, Student’s t-test) and nuclear densities than control nerves (<italic>p</italic> = 0.011). Here, we also observed an increase in fibronectin fluorescence (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004, Student’s t-test relative to naïve samples) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P18">After 90 days of recovery, the stiffness of nerve bridges was significantly lower than at 5 days post injury (<italic>K</italic> = 93 Pa compared to 759 Pa; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−10</sup>, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn-Sidak multiple comparisons test), dropping to similar (but still significantly higher) stiffness values compared to healthy tissue (<italic>K</italic> = 66 Pa <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1×10<sup>−10</sup>, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn-Sidak multiple comparisons test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>).

The relative area occupied by nuclei, however, remained similar to that found in the bridge tissue at 5 days post-transection and higher than in the healthy control (<italic>p</italic> = 0.014 relative to naïve, two-tailed Student’s t-test). Fibronectin values also decreased but remained significantly higher than naïve nerve levels (<italic>p</italic> = 0.039, two-tailed Student’s t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Nerve transection injuries also cause an inflammatory response at the nerve stumps. Damage-associated changes in the stumps are important to regeneration following a transection injury, as macrophages, fibroblasts and Schwann cells become activated and migrate into the gap from the stumps to form the nerve bridge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We evaluated the stiffness of the nerve stumps at 5 days post transection, after the nerve bridge had already formed.

Upon injury, they transdifferentiate from an axon-supporting cell type into mediators of nerve regeneration. In this state – often referred to as Bungner cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> – Schwann cells polarize, extending processes and becoming proliferative and motile to guide and remyelinate regenerating axons across the injured nerve. As our results showed that injured nerves experienced significant increases in stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), we tested whether a stiffened environment may serve as a cue to trigger Schwann cell transdifferentiation.</p><p id="P21">Schwann cells isolated from primary tissues are usually expanded in tissue culture flasks prior to seeding them into Petri dishes.

To avoid this, we here developed a protocol which allowed us to culture acutely isolated primary Schwann cells directly onto soft polyacrylamide substrates of varying stiffnesses for 6 days immediately after extraction from their host tissue before we evaluated changes in morphology, proliferation, and migration.</p><p id="P22">On the softest substrates, which were similarly soft as naïve nerve tissue (~0.1 kPa), Schwann cells remained spherical, a morphology typically found in Schwann cells cultured in differentiation-inhibiting media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.

We here avoided the use of tissue culture plastics and exclusively used substrates whose stiffness was matched to the stiffness of healthy and post injury nerves identified in this study.</p><p id="P28">Primary Schwann cells polarized and became more motile and proliferative on substrates with a stiffnesses above that of healthy nerve tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>), suggesting that the observed increase in nerve tissue stiffness after injury could contribute to activating Schwann cells, thus facilitating nerve regeneration. Focal adhesions are known mediators of Schwann cell activity in development and regeneration via molecules such as Focal Adhesion Kinase and downstream effectors such as the mechanosensitive transcriptional regulators YAP/TAZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. We found a higher abundance of focal adhesions in Schwann cells on substrates with stiffnesses close to that of injured nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>), suggesting a possible molecular mechanism contributing to their regenerative response.</p><p id="P29">While the baseline stiffness of CNS white matter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and peripheral nerves is similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>), injury leads to opposite mechanical responses of the tissues. Adult mammalian PNS tissue becomes stiffer after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), whereas adult mammalian CNS tissue becomes softer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. An increased stiffness of peripheral nerves after injury may not only lead to enhanced Schwann cell proliferation, motility, and polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>), thus extrinsically supporting neuronal regeneration, but also to enhanced axon growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, while the soft environment mammalian neurons encounter after injuries to the CNS may slow down axon growth and limit the promotion of pro-regenerative factors released by glial cells. In line with this thought, injuries to the spinal cord of zebrafish, which in contrast to the mammalian spinal cord can regenerate after injury, lead to the stiffening of the tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Our results thus suggest that, in addition to chemical signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, the increase in nerve tissue stiffness after injury may significantly contribute to facilitating neuronal regeneration, and that future approaches to treat spinal cord injuries should include strategies to stiffen the injury site.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Surgical procedures and sciatic nerve tissue harvesting</title><p id="P30">All animal procedures carried out were in compliance with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedure) Act of 1986 and institutional guidelines.

Lewis strain rats (Charles River UK) were used when surgical procedures were carried out prior to tissue harvesting, while Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River UK) were used when naïve tissue was used.</p><p id="P31">Animals undergoing surgical procedures were housed in groups of 5 and provided <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to water and food for at least 7 days prior to surgery. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained using isoflurane in oxygen delivered via a facemask, at the beginning of which animals received a subcutaneous injection of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam (1.5 mg/ml). Body temperature was monitored and maintained at 37ºC during anaesthesia using a rectal probe and thermal blanket. During surgery, the right sciatic nerve of animals was accessed dorsally around the site of the nerve trifurcation, accessed through the septum between the biceps femoris and vastus lateralis muscles, and either a nerve crush or nerve gap injury was carried out for each animal.</p><p id="P32">Nerve crush injury was carried out by applying pressure using tube occluding forceps equipped with a ratchet mechanism to ensure constant application of force during and between crushes. Tissue was crushed for 10 seconds starting at 2 mm proximal to the trifurcation. A total of four sequential crushes were carried out proximal to that point until the lesion reached a total length of 7 mm. In sciatic nerve gap injuries, the sciatic nerve was cleanly transected using surgical scissors 2 mm and 7 mm proximal of the trifurcation. The resulting nerve stumps were placed inside a 6 mm-long silicone tube (2 mm diameter, Portex), and sutured ~0.5 mm into the tube (three or two sutures through tube and nerve epineurium, 9/0 nylon Ethicon), resulting in a 5 mm-long nerve gap with no additional nerve tension or slack introduced. All animals were allowed to recover following surgery, and provided a further dose of meloxicam the day after surgery. Animals were sacrificed after a post-operative period of 3 days or 90 days (nerve crushes), or 5 days or 90 days (nerve gap injuries).</p><p id="P33">At the end of the post-operative recovery period (or immediately, for naïve animal tissue) animals were sacrificed and the tissue was collected for atomic force microscopy and/or stain intensity analysis (immunohistochemistry). Animals were sacrificed by overdose of euthatal (pentobarbitone) administered intraperitoneally, followed by neck dislocation. Euthatal was combined at a 1:1 v/v ratio with lidocaine anaelgesic and delivered at a total dose of 3 ml/kg of bodyweight. Anaesthetic overdose was chosen as a method of sacrifice instead of rising CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, as the latter has been associated with acidosis and tissue stiffening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Sciatic nerves (approximately a 1 cm fragment proximal to the trifurcation) were immediately dissected. The fragment was split into two, with one half being immediately fixed in paraformaldehyde and processed for immunostaining (see below), and the other half being transferred into mammalian buffer saline (for AFM, see below) on ice. In the case of nerve injury tissue, the contralateral sciatic nerve was also collected to use as a naïve control. All AFM measurements were carried out within 5 hours of sacrifice, minimising tissue degradation.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Atomic force microscopy indentation experiments</title><p id="P34">Harvested sciatic nerves were transferred into dishes containing ice-cold mammalian physiological saline (121 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 23.8 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 5.6 mM glucose, previously described by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>). Mammalian physiological saline was prepared freshly prior to the experiment. To establish a pH of 7.3, a gas mixture of 95% CO2 and 5% O2 was bubbled through the solution. Under a dissection microscope, external blood vessels and any excess tissue surrounding the nerve were removed, and the nerve stumps were trimmed off with a steel blade. The remaining nerve was then cut into ~3 mm fragments for mounting and sectioning. Just prior to cutting into fragments, some nerves (Crush_0day condition, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>) were crushed for 10 seconds using forceps, in a similar fashion to the crush injury protocol described above.</p><p id="P35">Nerve fragments were embedded in warm 4% w/w low melting point agarose (A9539, Sigma) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Once cooled and hardened, the agarose was trimmed into blocks and mounted onto a vibrating microtome filled with chilled mammalian physiological saline, where nerve fragments were cut into 500 μm sections, either longitudinally or as cross-sections. Sections were stained for axons for 1 hr at room temperature with fluoromyelin (1:250 v/v in mammalian physiological saline; Invitrogen, F34651). These were then mounted onto 35 mm plastic dishes (Z707651, Sigma) with thin strips of cyanoacrylate glue (Super Glue, Loctite), which adhered to the agarose, and filled with room temperature mammalian physiological saline. Nerve samples used for epifascicular epineurium measurements were not embedded in agarose or sectioned, and simply mounted on their side on a bed of agarose on a plastic dish.</p><p id="P36">To perform indentation experiments, dishes containing mounted nerves were transferred to an optical inverted microscope (Axio Observer.A1, Carl Zeiss Ltd.) equipped with a motorised xy stage. The sample was imaged with a CCD camera (The Imaging Source GmbH), and a region of interest was defined based on the fluoromyelin stain pattern. A custom python script broke down this area of interest into a grid of 20 × 20 μm squares. At the centre of each of these squares an elasticity measurement was carried out sequentially using a cantilever probe mounted on a JPK Nanowizard Cellhesion 200 AFM (JPK Instruments AG). After indentation measurements, some naïve sciatic nerve samples were fixed and immunostained to identify nerve compartments and confirm the fluoromyelin stain pattern was accurate (see below).</p><p id="P37">Measurements were taken using tipless cantilever probes, onto which a polystyrene bead (37.28 ± 0.34 µm diameter; Microparticles GmbH) had been previously glued (ultraviolet curing, Loctite).

For each elasticity measurement, the cantilever probe was lowered onto the sample at a speed of 10 μm/s, indenting it until a force threshold of 10 nN was reached.

Tissue was mounted on optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek, 4583), transferred to a cryostat (CM3050 S, Leica), and sectioned into 12 µm sections. Tissue sections were transferred to glass slides, allowed to dry at room temperature overnight, and stored at -20 ºC until used for immunostaining. Tissue samples previously used for AFM were already sectioned using a vibratome as part of the indentation experiments sample processing, and were therefore not cryoprotected or further sectioned.
