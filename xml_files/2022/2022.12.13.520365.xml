The rate at which this process occurs, might depend on the epigenetic state of the genome and vary between, or even within, cell types. To accurately measure DNA replication speeds, we developed a technology to detect recently replicated DNA using single-cell sequencing. Replication speed is not constant but increases during S-phase of the cell cycle. Using genetic and pharmacological perturbations we are able to alter this acceleration of replication and conclude that DNA damage inflicted by the process of transcription limits the speed of replication during early S-phase. In late S-phase, during which less transcription occurs, replication accelerates and approaches its maximum speed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">A large number of cell divisions are required to construct an adult animal body from a one-cell embryo. Before each cell division, the genome has to be faithfully replicated and DNA replication errors have to be averted to prevent developmental defects and tumorigenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). DNA replication can be roughly divided in four steps; origin licensing, origin firing, fork elongation and fork termination(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Prior to DNA replication, the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) is loaded on specific genomic regions, known as replication origins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The assembly steps of the pre-RC are tightly regulated and separated in time, which prevents multiple rounds of origin licensing in one cell cycle. After licensing DNA replication origins, the cell accumulates pro-proliferative signals until it reaches the threshold required to build the replication machinery (or replisome) at the pre-RC(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Once the replication machinery is assembled at the pre-RC, several kinases are recruited and their stimulatory activity induces the firing of replication origin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). However, not all licensed DNA replication origins fire simultaneously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Limiting origin firing is required to support the high demand of replisomes on both nucleotides and histones(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Following activation of the replisome, DNA helicases unwind the DNA double strand which allows subsequent copying of both strands by DNA polymerases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). However, the copying process of both strands is not identical due to directionality of the DNA molecule; these different modes of replication are referred to as the leading and lagging strand synthesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Finally, two converging replisomes result in the termination of DNA replication for that particular location in the genome. The replisomes get dissembled when in close proximity and residual replication is mediated by a complex hand-off between several DNA polymerases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). The fields of genetics and biochemistry have revealed many DNA replication factors and how they cooperate to ensure high fidelity duplication of genomes. However, these methods are limited in their ability to probe the positional information of DNA replication. More recently, DNA sequencing methods have been used to unravel replication timing, replication fork directionality, origin and DNA polymerase usage(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Especially, single-molecule approaches have been invaluable to monitor this process by visualizing DNA replication and subsequent detection by microscopy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) or long-read sequencing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). However, these methods randomly sample molecules from a large population of cells and are therefore insensitive to heterogeneity in replication dynamics between individual cells. Here, we describe a novel method, scEdUseq, which allows high resolution single-cell investigation of DNA replication fork dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>scEdU-seq reveals ordered DNA replication profiles throughout S-phase</title><p id="P3">In order to measure heterogeneity of DNA replication fork dynamics between cells, we developed single-cell EdU sequencing (scEdU-seq), a sequencing method to identify replicated nascent DNA in individual cells. scEdU-seq relies on metabolic labeling with the nucleotide analog 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) and subsequent affinity capture of newly synthesized DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We make use of CuAAC Click chemistry to covalently link a biotin moiety to the uracil base(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Subsequently, we digest the single-cell genome and ligate adapters containing a T7 promoter, cell-specific barcodes and a unique molecular identifier (UMI)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). After pooling cells, we biotin-capture the EdU containing DNA molecules and release the non-EdU modified strand by heat denaturation. Finally, we regenerate the complementary strand via primer extension followed by amplification to prepare for sequencing. We first compare scEdU-seq to Repli-Seq(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) in human RPE-1 hTERT cells and find high overlap of early and late DNA replication profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1A,B</xref>). Next, we set out to generate DNA replication profiles in single cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1C,D</xref>). We can use these single-cell DNA replication profiles to reconstruct the progression through S-phase by ordering the cells based on the overlap coefficient(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) and by computing a 1-D UMAP(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), which we define as “S-phase progression” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1E,F</xref>). We observe that the S-phase progression accurately reflects the position in the cell cycle as determined by the FUCCI(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) reporters, a fluorescent read-out which reflects cell cycle state, as well as DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1G</xref>). Implementing the single-cell S-phase progression ordering, we construct DNA replication tracks over the entirety of S-phase from an ensemble of 1343 RPE-1 hTERT FUCCI cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). The start of these tracks coincides with positions in the genome that were previously identified as initiation zones (IZ) of DNA replication in RPE-1 cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Furthermore, our S-phase ordered scEdU-seq data is consistent with published bulk DNA replication timing using cell-cycle sorted populations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In addition, we observe that in late S-phase the scEdU-seq domains consist of large blocks of active DNA replication, whereas the middle of S-phase mainly consists of long-lived replication forks. Recently, scRepli-Seq has been developed to study replication timing in single cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). This method relies on whole genome amplification followed by smoothing to identify replicated regions during S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1H</xref>). In contrast, scEdU-seq relies on the identification of active DNA replication forks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). This allows for more accurate detection of sites where active DNA replication takes place, whereas scRepli-seq can only be used to determine which regions have already undergone DNA replication. Taken together, scEdU-seq allows high resolution profiling of DNA replication forks in single cells. Furthermore, these data allow accurate ordering of cells throughout S-phase.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Double pulse scEdU-seq allows DNA replication speed assessment</title><p id="P4">Next, we set out to estimate DNA replication speeds in single cells by using double-pulse EdU labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> - top). After receiving two EdU pulses, the genome of a single cell in S-phase will be decorated with patches of EdU-containing DNA that are separated by a distance Δ<italic>x</italic>. The average replication velocity is then approximated by the distance Δ<italic>x</italic> divided by the inter-pulse duration Δ𝑡. To systematically analyze this type of data, we make use of the pair correlation function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), which reflects the distribution of all pairwise distances between EdU-containing reads in a single cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> - bottom). For two EdU pulses one would expect the pair correlation function to display two maxima: one at Δ<italic>x</italic> = 0 originating from pairs of reads that were labeled within one of the two pulses, and a second maxima is expected at <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mtext>Δ</mml:mtext><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Δ</mml:mtext><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> corresponding to read pairs that were labeled in separate pulses. It is the latter inter-pulse distances from which we can estimate the average length traveled by DNA replication forks in a single cell. Finally, we compute the average DNA replication fork speed for each cell by dividing the average distance traveled <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Δ</mml:mtext><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> by the time between pulses Δ<italic>t</italic>.

It could increase the overall background of the pair correlation function, because nearby replication forks will not be as regularly spaced as the double pulse signal. Consistently, the experimental pair correlation for a single cell exposed to a single EdU pulse only displays one maximum at Δ<italic>x</italic> = 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). Single cells exposed to a double EdU pulse (i.e., Δ<italic>t</italic> = 45, 75 or 105 min) additionally show a second maximum. As expected, this second maximum shifts to larger values of Δ<italic>x</italic> as Δ<italic>t</italic> is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, top). The replication speed obtained from the experiments using different values of Δ<italic>t</italic> is comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, bottom). Subsampling the pairwise distances per chromosome shows similar distributions of <inline-formula><mml:math id="M4"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Δ</mml:mtext><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Taken together, we can use double pulse EdU labeling combined with pair correlation analysis to identify DNA replication speeds in single cells. To quantitatively model the pair correlation function we use a mixture model. This model separately fits distributions based on the intra-pulse differences (maximum at Δ<italic>x</italic> = 0), inter-pulse differences (maximum at <inline-formula><mml:math id="M5"><mml:mtext>Δ</mml:mtext><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Δ</mml:mtext><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>) and the background (caused by, for example, nearby replication forks). The resulting distributions can subsequently be separated to infer the replication speed and the corresponding confidence interval in single cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3 &amp; 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Transcription limits DNA replication speeds in early S-phase</title><p id="P5">We can approximate DNA replication speeds in single cells by using a double EdU pulse labeling strategy in combination with a mixture model. Several representative cells from a single-cell double EdU pulse experiment (Δt=75) demonstrate that the mixture model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>, red dashed line) accurately describes the experimental pair correlation function (black solid line). Overall, we find DNA replication speeds in an expected range based on previous literature(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Unexpectedly, we observe a large variability in replication speeds between individual cells (~1.5-fold difference, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c, d</xref>). A large part of this variability can be explained by the S-phase progression of single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). When analyzing DNA replication speeds during S-phase progression, we observe a steady average increase in DNA replication speeds suggesting an acceleration of replication as S-phase progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). DNA replication timing studies have shown that early replicating DNA is in proximity to actively transcribed regions of the genome(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Since we observe the lowest average replication speeds in early S-phase, we hypothesize that these lower speeds might be correlated to transcription. Therefore, we use previously generated single-cell nascent RNA sequencing data on RPE-1 hTERT cells to test this assumption (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5A-D</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). We observe the highest levels of nascent transcription in regions of the genome that are covered by scEdU-seq domains at the start of S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, both the number of transcribed regions as well as transcription levels decrease as DNA replication progresses over S-phase. The presence of high levels of transcription in early S-phase therefore correlates to lower DNA replication speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). This could imply that transcription limits DNA replication speeds. If active RNA polymerase 2 (RNAP2) transcription reduces DNA replication speeds, we would expect an increase in DNA replication speeds in early S-phase by inhibiting transcription. In order to assess DNA replication speeds without active RNAP2 transcription, we treat cells with the transcription inhibitor 5,6-Dichlorobenzimidazole 1-β-D-ribofuranoside (DRB, 60 min, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5E-I</xref>) between the two EdU pulses, which does not alter either initiation zones or replication timing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5J-K</xref>). We observe an overall increase in DNA replication speeds in RNAP2 inhibited cells versus DMSO treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, bottom). Furthermore, this difference in speed is a result of increasing DNA replication speeds during early S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D, top</xref>). In summary, DNA replication accelerates over S-phase, which is, in part, a result of limiting DNA replication speeds during early S-phase by RNAP2 transcription.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Transcription-coupled damage decreases DNA replication speeds</title><p id="P6">RNAP2 activity has been correlated to a variety of DNA damage, for example, by generating SSBs through Topoisomerase I cleavage complexes or repair of bulky adducts by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Moreover, conflicts between the DNA replication fork and transcription machinery results in the formation of RNA:DNA hybrids, which result in double-strand breaks if improperly handled(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Indeed, short inhibition of RNAP2 (1 hr) during S-phase results in a reduction of DNA damage as assayed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, γH2AX). This suggests that RNAP2 activity, at least in part, causes transcription-coupled DNA damage during S-phase. The activity of the DNA damage sensor PARP-1 is stimulated by a wide variety of DNA damage lesions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Since PARP-1 activity has previously been linked to DNA replication speeds(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), we reason that the decrease of DNA replication speed in early S-phase might be due to transcription-coupled DNA damage and subsequent PARP activation. We observe a decrease in the level of pan ADP-ribose, the modification deposited by PARP enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, pan ADP-ribose). This suggests that RNAP2 transcription not only induces DNA damage, but also activates PARP. In order to explore how transcription-coupled DNA damage might affect DNA replication speed in single cells, we make use of the PARP inhibitor, Olaparib. First, we treat wild-type RPE-1 cells with a PARP inhibitor and observe very similar behavior compared to RNAP2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 6A-E</xref>). Overall DNA replication speeds are higher in PARP-inhibited cells without altering either IZ or replication timing. Additionally, the most notable difference of DNA replication speeds occurs in early S-phase suggesting a connection to RNAP2 transcription. To directly address the role of PARP activity in regulating DNA replication speeds, we set out to hyperactivate PARP-1 by generating an RPE-1 cell line in which the gene XRCC1 was knocked out (XRCC1Δ RPE-1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 6 G,H</xref>). The XRCC1 protein is required for efficient repair of DNA damage. In the absence of this protein, steady-state levels of DNA damage increases causing PARP hyperactivation, which eventually leads to cerebral ataxia(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-E</xref>). XRCC1Δ RPE-1 cells have a lower proportion of EdU+ cells compared to wild-type cells, which is partially mitigated by the addition of a PARP inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). This implies that excessive PARP signaling in XRCC1Δ RPE-1 results in lower DNA replication speeds. In line with this observation, the XRCC1Δ RPE-1 cells display overall lower DNA replication speeds compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 6I,J</xref>). In contrast to RNAP2 or PARP inhibition, we observe a ubiquitous decrease in DNA replication speeds in all cells and not just early S-phase cells. This suggests that hyperactivation of PARP, outside of transcribed regions, results in lower DNA replication speeds. In addition, we can rescue the global decrease of DNA replication speeds in XRCC1Δ RPE-1 by the addition of a PARP inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). This suggests that PARP activity is critical in regulating DNA replication speeds in response to transcription-coupled DNA damage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P7">Taken together, we developed a method with which we can profile DNA replication forks and their speeds in single cells. We show that DNA replication speeds accelerate during S-phase. Reduced DNA replication speeds at the start of S-phase occur in genomic regions with high levels of RNAP2 transcription. Inhibition of RNAP2 transcription increases DNA replication speeds at these locations. We find that inhibition of RNAP2 results in both lower PARP activity as well as lower DNA damage. We continue to show that lowering PARP activity allows for higher DNA replication speeds, specifically in early S-phase. In addition, the hyperactivation of PARP in RPE-1 cells lacking XRCC1 results in a genome-wide decrease of DNA replication speeds. We can revert this decrease by lowering PARP activity, indicating a direct role in regulating DNA replication speeds. Overall, this implies that transcription-coupled DNA damage increases PARP activity, which in turn reduces DNA replication speed.</p><p id="P8">Our data suggests crosstalk between DNA replication fork speeds and transcription through the activity of PARP enzymes. Interestingly, proteomic profiling has identified DNA replication and transcription as the two biological processes regulated through ADP-ribosylation by PARP enzymes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Several core DNA replication factors have been implicated in regulating fork speeds(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). However, which specific components are regulated by ADP-ribose to reduce replication fork speeds remains to be uncovered. scEdUseq in combination with a small scale genetic perturbation screen would be uniquely suited to identify these components. In addition, several studies have shown the role of PARP activity in directing transcriptional activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). As of yet, we are unable to identify the direct effect of transcription on DNA replication. Conversely, we can not assess the effect of active DNA replication on RNAP2 transcription. Therefore, integration of transcriptome profiling with scEdU-seq would allow the coupling of RNAP2 transcription dynamics to the proximity of active DNA replication. Furthermore, we would be able to discern dynamic or transient cell states by transcriptome profiling and relate these to rare DNA replication phenotypes (e.g. fast DNA replication speeds in early S-phase).</p><p id="P9">Potential limitations of related techniques, including scEdU-seq, is that they rely on incorporation of non-natural nucleotides which might disturb the system in non-biologically relevant ways. Searching for endogenous read-outs for active DNA replication in single cells would be important to circumvent such a potential limitation.</p><p id="P10">We expect that scEdU-seq will have applications to identify single-cell DNA replication timing as well as replication speeds in a wide range of biological systems. In addition, unscheduled DNA replication such as homologous recombination as well as replication intermediates from previous cell cycles could potentially be detected through scEdU-seq. Finally, extracting transcriptome profiles in conjunction with DNA replication profiles will allow uncovering of molecular crosstalk as well as identification and characterization of rare events.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Cell lines and Reagents</title><p id="P11">RPE-1 hTERT FUCCI and RPE-1 hTERT XRCC1Δ cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 1 × GlutaMAX (Gibco) and 1 × Pen-Strep (Gibco) at 37 °C with 5% CO2.
