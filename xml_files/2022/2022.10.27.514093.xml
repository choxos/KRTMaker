Among different approaches, <italic>de novo</italic> construction of a synthetic compartment is the most coveted but also most difficult option. Restructuring the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), via the introduction of recombinant oligomerising ER-membrane resident proteins, is an alternative starting point for building a new compartment. The presence of such proteins leads to a massive expansion of the ER and the formation of organised smooth endoplasmic reticulum (OSER), a large membranous compartment. However, OSER is poorly characterised and our understanding of its effect on the underlying biology of the plant is limited. Here we characterise a range of OSER compartments and show how the structure of the inducing polyprotein constructs affect the final compartment morphology, with the cytosolic-facing antiparallel oligomerisation domain demonstrated to be an essential component to trigger OSER formation. We show that while OSER retains a connection to the ER, a diffusional barrier exists to both the ER and the cytosol. Using high-resolution quantitative image analysis, we also show that the presence of this large compartment does not disrupt the rest of the ER network. Moreover, transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> constitutively expressing the compartment-forming polyproteins grew and developed normally. These properties collectively suggest that OSER could be developed as a plant synthetic biology tool for compartmentalisation, combining the benefits of several existing strategies. Only a single protein construct is necessary to induce its formation, and the compartment retains a delimiting membrane and a diffusional barrier to the rest of the cell.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Subcellular compartmentalisation is a fundamental principle of life on Earth, allowing the spatiotemporal separation of distinct cellular functions from the environment and other compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Bolsover <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Monnard and Walde, 2015</xref>). The membranous organelles of eukaryotes are the typical examples of such structures (e.g., the nucleus, mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)), but membraneless organelles are also broadly used by both eukaryotes and prokaryotes for a variety of purposes: for example, protein-shell based bacterial microcompartments are widespread structures to contain the catabolism of toxic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Agapakis, Boyle and Silver, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kerfeld <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Compartmentalisation allows different metabolic pathways to be physically separated and quasi-independently regulated by modulating substrate availability and the subcellular microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Boeynaems <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). This allows mutually incompatible pathways (e.g., due to different solution requirements, competition for substrates or futile cycling) to exist in the same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sweetlove and Fernie, 2013</xref>), and permits compartments to specialise in certain metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Sweetlove and Fernie, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, toxic intermediates or final products generated by specialised cellular metabolism can be sequestered into compartments, protecting the bulk of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sweetlove and Fernie, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cárdenas, Almeida and Bak, 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Due to these benefits, the engineering of <italic>de novo</italic> synthetic compartments has long been an attractive target for synthetic biology. While repurposing pre-existing organelles is considered simpler (e.g., by re-targeting enzymes to them utilising specific signals) and has produced several successes in improving the production of compounds of interest in plants (e.g., dhurrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Henriques de Jesus <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>), artemisinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Malhotra <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>), terpenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">van Herpen <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Eljounaidi <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>)), this approach can face challenges from competing endogenous pathways in their new environment, which were optimised by millions of years of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Polka, Hays and Silver, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gao and Zhou, 2019</xref>). Synthetic new compartments can reduce this issue. For example, liquid-liquid phase separated membraneless organelles have recently become a popular alternative approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alberti, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Uversky, 2019</xref>). Their popularity is fuelled by the limited number of constructs required to engineer them with often a single scaffold molecule sufficient to trigger the formation of membraneless organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Nott <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bracha, Walls and Brangwynne, 2019</xref>), and specific cargo-capture (Banani <italic>et al</italic>., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Reinkemeier, Girona and Lemke, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Garabedian <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) and optogenetic control methods now exist to improve their utilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bracha, Walls and Brangwynne, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). However, while the lack of a delimiting membrane eliminates some engineering challenges (e.g., the requirement for specific pores or channels), it also reduces control over the local microenvironment and permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Polka, Hays and Silver, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Schuster <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P5">A completely synthetic membranous compartment could in theory be superior to the aforementioned compartmentalisation strategies. Due to its lack of native functions, a synthetic membranous compartment would have limited crosstalk with the host background, and the presence of a membrane would facilitate control over the contents of the compartment. However, this approach requires a much higher level of understanding of the biology of the host, making it a far more difficult strategy compared to re-purposing existing compartments or utilising membraneless organelles. While some progress has been reported in recent years in this field (e.g., by the use of the maize storage protein γ-Zein to build functionalised vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Reifenrath <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>)), there is still no broadly usable method for the generation of synthetic compartments for metabolic engineers.</p><p id="P6">One potential candidate to serve as the basis for developing a new compartment is the ER. This is the starting point for the membrane endogenesis pathway involved in the formation of several organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Stefano and Brandizzi, 2018</xref>), and itself is highly dynamic and undergoes large-scale restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Almsherqi <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sparkes, Hawes and Frigerio, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Stefano and Brandizzi, 2018</xref>). ER-membrane resident proteins (such as the reticulons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Voeltz <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Shibata <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), atlastins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Ueda <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) and Lunapark proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kriechbaumer <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>)) influence the architecture of the ER, facilitating interconversion between different ER morphologies (tubules, three-way junctions and cisternae, respectively).</p><p id="P7">The ability of the ER to change shape allows it to take on some highly specialised forms. One of these is the appearance of tightly stacked arrays of smooth ER sheets, forming concentrated whorls or regular sinusoidal arrays with cubic symmetry, collectively known as organised smooth endoplasmic reticulum (OSER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Snapp <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Borgese, Francolini and Snapp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sandor <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). While OSERs were primarily investigated in yeast and mammalian cell lines, studies utilising recombinant fluorescent proteins to explore the secretory pathway of plant cells have revealed much about how OSER is formed; for a detailed review on this topic see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sandor <italic>et al</italic>. (2021)</xref>. These discoveries were mostly serendipitous, as oligomerising membrane-bound proteins often accidentally trigger the formation of OSER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Yamamoto, Masaki and Tashiro, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Snapp <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Barbante <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). As such, much that was uncovered about OSER was incidental and studies were not done in a systematic way since OSER was often not the main focus of the researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sandor <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). To employ OSER as potential compartmentalisation tool in plant cells, an in-depth characterization of this structure and knowledge on the molecular underpinnings needed to modulate its formation seem necessary.</p><p id="P8">Here, we report an in-depth characterisation of OSER structures formed from a range of ER-membrane-resident protein constructs to assess the relationship between the constitutive domains of the OSER-inducing protein and the OSER structure whose formation it triggers. We show that the OSER compartment has a diffusional barrier to both the ER and the cytosol. Quantitative analysis of the dynamics and morphology of the remaining ER shows that it is not significantly disrupted by the formation of the OSER structure. These findings, together with the capacity to constitutively or transiently express OSER in plants without any obvious negative phenotype suggest that OSER could be utilised as a compartmentalisation tool in plant cells and would be a valuable asset to the growing field of plant synthetic biology.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Serendipitous discovery of an ER-remodelling polyprotein</title><p id="P9">To interrogate trafficking in the plant endomembrane system, a fluorescent polyprotein probe was developed, consisting of a 22 amino acid transmembrane domain (BP22 – derived from the BP80 vacuolar sorting receptor from <italic>Pisum sativum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Paris <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Brandizzi <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>)) flanked by a N-terminal GFP and a C-terminal YFP (due to this organisation, the construct was named G22Y) targeted to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). While the construct was expected to pass through the endomembrane system to the plasma membrane as it was previously reported when GFP was genetically fused to the BP22 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Brandizzi <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), when transiently expressed in mature tobacco leaves, this double-tagged construct instead integrated into the ER forming large (up to 25 μm in diameter), self-organising compartments as apparent from the GFP and YFP signal observed by fluorescent confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, these G22Y structures showed a clear helical patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). To assess the formation of the G22Y structures, a time-course experiment was carried out imaging the structures every 12 h until 168 h after transient expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). The G22Y signal consistently started to appear around 36 h as small (up to 5 μm) compartments which aggregated into a single (or, in rare cases, two) large compartment per cell by 60 h. Cells with compartments remained viable up to 6 weeks, demonstrating the stability of these compartments.</p><p id="P10">To confirm that the compartments are derived from the ER, they were co-expressed with RFP-HDEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Nelson, Cai and Nebenführ, 2007</xref>) and TAR2-RFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kriechbaumer, Botchway and Hawes, 2016</xref>), two fluorescent markers for the ER lumen and ER membrane, respectively. The overlapping signals suggested that both the lumen and the membrane of the compartment are contiguous with the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). To determine if the compartment retains connection to the ER network, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to assess lateral diffusion between the ER and the G22Y compartment, by photobleaching compartments co-expressed with RFP-HDEL or the bulk ER (control). The ER lumenal marker rapidly recovered into the compartment, confirming that it was still connected to the ER. However, the rate of recovery of fluorescence was significantly reduced when compared to the rest of the ER, suggesting a diffusional barrier between the bulk of the ER and the lumen of the G22Y compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Expanding the suite of compartment-forming polyproteins to investigate the structural basis of the OSER compartment</title><p id="P11">The formation of the G22Y compartment with its unusual helical organisation and diffusional barrier to the lumen of the ER warranted further exploration. To determine how the protein domains affected the formation of the compartment, a range of five alternative G22Y-derived constructs were generated.</p><p id="P12">First, to assess the requirement of a cytosolic or ER-lumenal facing dimerising domain for the formation of the compartment, we removed either dimerising fluorescent proteins, which yielded the G22 and 22Y constructs, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In two further constructs, the removed fluorescent protein was replaced with a synthetic dimerising coiled-coil domain CC-Di (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fletcher <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), which is of similar length to GFP or YFP, but has a much stronger binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub> &lt; 10<sup>-8</sup> M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fletcher <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>) and dimerises in parallel, in contrast to GFP and YFP, which dimerise at lower affinity (K<sub>D</sub> ≈ 10<sup>-4</sup> M) in an antiparallel fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Zacharias <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). These two constructs (C22Y and G22C) enabled us to explore the effects of different binding orientations and strengths of the scaffold proteins on the compartment. The final construct G-Y(cyt) had its transmembrane domain and ER-targeting signal peptide removed to determine if ER membrane integration is essential for the formation of this compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Fluorescent confocal microscopy imaging of transiently transformed tobacco leaves revealed that two of the constructs formed compartments of similar (or in some cases larger) size to the previously described G22Y compartments: 22Y often presented more elongated structures, while C22Y showed more globular compartments. G22 and G22C fluorescent signal accumulated in numerous smaller (&lt; 5 μm) compartments. G-Y(cyt) did not induce the formation of any compartments and appeared to be located mainly in the cytosol and nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Cells with compartments showed normal cell behaviour (e.g., cytoplasmic streaming and ER network rearrangements identical to untransformed cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Video SV1</xref>)) until leaf senescence, highlighting the unlikely toxicity of the compartments.</p><p id="P14">To further determine the subcellular localisation of the fluorescent signal, the new constructs were co-expressed with a range of fluorescent markers. Co-expression of C22Y and 22Y with the ER-lumenal RFP-HDEL and ER-membrane-localised TAR2-RFP revealed co-localisation of the two fluorescent signals, confirming that the compartment’s membrane is derived from the ER. The cytosolic marker Peredox-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hung and Yellen, 2014</xref>) also partially co-localised with the C22Y and 22Y compartments, suggesting the presence of trapped cytosol in or around the compartment structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). These markers also highlighted the formation of several spherical vacuoles in close proximity to 22Y compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Co-expression of G22C and G22 with RFP-HDEL revealed no overlapping signal between the small compartments and the ER lumen, and the co-expression of G22C with the peroxisomal marker YFP-PEX2 revealed that the small compartments are likely peroxisomes, suggesting a mis-localisation of the polyproteins instead of forming an ER-derived compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Further investigation into the C22Y and 22Y structures</title><p id="P16">The two variants construct forming large ER-derived compartments, C22Y and 22Y, were further investigated using high-resolution airy-scanning confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to observe the detailed structures of the compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The two constructs induced the formation of morphologically distinct compartments. 22Y compartments were composed of several long fibrous strands, likely double-membraned ER cylinders with cytosol trapped in the centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-C</xref>). C22Y compartments showed a more homogenous fluorescent signal, which could not be further resolved using Airyscan confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). TEM images of C22Y compartments presented complex patterns of internal organisation, with densely packed membrane structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-F</xref>), which are likely too dense for clear resolution using confocal imaging.</p><p id="P18">To determine if the two new compartment types retain their connection to the ER, and if they have a similar diffusional barrier as the G22Y compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), FRAP was carried out by co-expressing the compartment-forming proteins with RFP-HDEL. When photobleached, the RFP-HDEL signal recovered rapidly, but significantly slower than for the peripheral ER in cells not expressing OSER constructs (control), suggesting that both the 22Y and C22Y compartments are connected to the ER, but a diffusional barrier exists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P19">As co-expression with Peredox-mCherry suggested that these compartments have cytosol trapped within their complex membrane structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>), a FRAP experiment using Peredox-mCherry was also carried out. This showed similar results to the RFP-HDEL FRAP, suggesting a diffusional barrier to exist between the bulk cytosol and the cytosol trapped by the compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P20">The presence of the diffusional barrier to the rest of the cell means that molecules can be effectively compartmentalised temporarily by these structures. However, to determine if the compartment-forming scaffold proteins are also sequestered primarily in the compartment, the proportion of the total cellular fluorescence inside the compartments were measured for C22Y. This showed that the scaffold proteins almost exclusively reside in the compartment (an average of 92.7% of total cellular fluorescence was present in the compartment – <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Quantitative analysis of the architecture and dynamics of the ER</title><p id="P21">As the G22Y, C22Y and 22Y compartments are derived from the ER, their substantial size raised the possibility of a significant disruption to the host cell’s ER. To determine if this was the case, the remaining ER was visualised in cells containing one of the three compartments using co-infiltrated RFP-HDEL. Initial visual inspection showed that non-compartmentalised ER retains a normal phenotype. However, a more accurate method for determining the potential ER disruption was needed. To this end, short (20 s) time-series were captured using high-resolution Airyscan confocal microscopy focusing only on the peripheral ER (the compartments were not imaged) and quantitatively analysed using the AnalyzER software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Pain <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). 41 parameters were measured and analysed including topological, morphological and kinetic parameters of the ER cisternae, tubules and the polygonal regions enclosed by them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). ANOVAs of the 41 parameters showed only a single one of the parameters (the average persistency of cisternae) was significantly different between the WT and any of the compartment types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), but this significance disappeared when accounting for multiple testing. This suggests that the formation of the OSER compartments did not significantly disrupt the structure and dynamics of the rest of the ER in the compartment-carrying cells.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Expressing the compartment in stably transformed <italic>A. thaliana</italic></title><p id="P22">To determine if the compartments can be developed and maintained in stably transformed <italic>A. thaliana</italic> as well as with transient expression, the two constructs which produced the largest compartments, C22Y and 22Y were introduced under the drive of the strong constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Odell, Nagy and Chua, 1985</xref>).

It is possible that the binding topology (antiparallel, parallel or missing) has an effect on what membranes can be bridged by these polyprotein oligomers, leading to these differences. An antiparall (head-to-head) binding domain is expected to be more flexible, capable of bridging different membranes together in trans, while a parall binding domain is spatially more restricted, likely to only binding to the same membrane in cis. Further studies using more compartment-forming polyproteins could be used to gain more insight into the exact relationship between the oligomerising domain topologies and the induced compartment structures.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>A putative OSER subclass</title><p id="P28">Similarities between the synthetic compartments and previously described OSER structures are notable enough to warrant comparison.

Furthermore, the formation of OSER did not affect the normal functioning of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ferrero <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), and the quantitative analysis of the ER network in our study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) also showed no significant disturbance to the ER. Plants stably transformed with the compartments developed normally, similar to what was reported by previous studies for OSER (Ferrero <italic>et al</italic>., 2015).</p><p id="P29">Morphologically, the C22Y compartments are also similar to some of the larger OSER structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ferrero <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sandor <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), and the fibrous 22Y structures resemble elongated lamellae, another typical OSER phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sandor <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Notably, 22Y compartments are morphologically identical to the OSER structures described induced by the <italic>nuc</italic> mutation of the MVP1 protein in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Jancowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). However, the MVP1 is predicted to be a non-membrane resident monomeric protein indirectly involved in ER-to-Golgi export, and the mutation was hypothesised to induce OSER by blocking this export pathway, inadvertently causing the accumulation of other OSER-inducing proteins in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Jancowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). By contrast, in this study the results from the quantitative ER analysis using AnalyzER showed no major disruptions to the ER, making it unlikely that 22Y causes the formation of the compartment described in this study in the same manner.</p><p id="P30">Equally, there are also clear morphological differences between our compartments when compared to OSER: for example, the helical patterning of G22Y compartments have not been described previously in connection with OSER to our knowledge. OSER also usually presents as multiple structures in a cell, unlike in our study, where a single compartment was formed almost exclusively in each cell.</p><p id="P31">The induction of compartment formation also presents some similarities to OSER formation. OSER can be induced by two types of proteins: ER-resident membrane proteins and proteins disrupting ER-to-Golgi export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sandor <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). For the former group, there is some controversy in the literature to the necessity of a cytosol-facing oligomerising domain, with some studies showing it to be essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Yamamoto, Masaki and Tashiro, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Snapp <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Barbante <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), while others refuting this claim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Marti <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Jancowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ferrero <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Grados-Torrez <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Recently these opposing views were attempted to be reconciled into a single unified theory of OSER formation, which hypothesised multiple parallel pathways to induce OSER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sandor <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). In this study, only ER-resident membrane proteins were capable of inducing the formation of our compartment. Furthermore, a cytosol-facing antiparallelly dimerising domain was essential for the formation of the compartments.</p><p id="P32">Overall, this compartment system seems to have significant similarity to previously described OSER structures in terms of formation and effects on the host cell, but there are some morphological differences as well, suggesting that the structures described above might constitute a subgroup of OSER.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Potential applications of the synthetic compartment system</title><p id="P33">The compartment system described in our study has a number of valuable properties that make it a good candidate for functionalisation as a plant synthetic biology tool. No detrimental effects were observed on transiently or stably transformed plants, and the ER of the transformed cells were quantitatively shown to be not significantly disrupted. The compartments show a consistent morphology across two different species, and the constitutive polyprotein scaffold almost exclusively accumulates inside the compartment structure. These properties together suggest that this compartment system could be used to improve the production of recombinant proteins, especially difficult-to-express membrane proteins or toxic proteins which would be mostly sequestered from the bulk of the cell. Proteins of interest could be genetically fused directly to the polyprotein scaffold, or via the introduction of a modular attachment method (e.g., the SpyCatcher – SpyTag system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Reddington and Howarth, 2015</xref>) to covalently bind the target recombinant protein to the scaffold before or after release to the cytosol) to potentially allow greater expression of valuable proteins before purification.</p><p id="P34">Another potential application is to develop this system as a synthetic microdomain. This is enabled by the high specificity of the scaffold molecules to the compartment in combination with the diffusional barrier between the compartment lumen and the ER lumen, as well as the trapped cytosol and the bulk cytosol. Together, these properties are expected to be sufficient to generate enable probabilistic metabolic channelling, where if two subsequent enzymes of a pathway are co-localised at high concentrations (by binding them to the compartment), the intermediate of the pathway is more likely to encounter the next enzyme of the pathway, rather than to diffuse to the bulk cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Sweetlove and Fernie, 2018</xref>). This would be a valuable tool for the metabolic engineering of plants, by providing a way to channel flux down a pathway of interest, especially if the intermediate if unstable, toxic or secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sweetlove and Fernie, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cárdenas, Almeida and Bak, 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P35">A new modular compartmentalisation system would be of great interest for plant synthetic biology, and an OSER-based membranous compartment has numerous advantages. Compared to current popular approaches (co-opting existing organelles, building novel compartments and membraneless organelles) OSER has a number of attractive properties: unlike membraneless organelles, it is delimited by a membrane bilayer allowing greater control over the internal composition and is induced by a single polyprotein construct, making is similarly simple to use. While the compartment retains some connections to the ER, there is a clear diffusional barrier making it a more specific tool than simply targeting proteins to the ER, retaining some of the benefits of a novel compartment and the host ER is not significantly impacted. Overall, these properties give this strategy notable potential as a tool for plant synthetic biology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Plant husbandry and materials</title><p id="P36">Ethanol-sterilised <italic>A. thaliana</italic> seeds were grown own MS-agar (4.33 g L<sup>-1</sup> Murashige &amp; Skoog medium (Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem, Netherlands), 15 g L<sup>-1</sup> agar) medium plates with 50 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> kanamycin and 200 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> cefotaxime in a growth cabinet with a 16 light - 8 h dark photoperiod (at light intensity of 120 μM m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) at 20 °C.
