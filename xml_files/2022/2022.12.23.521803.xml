In the current study we tested the hypothesis that increasing the salience of environmental cues would be most effective in improving impulse control, as assessed in a stop-signal task, in subjects with low environmental susceptibility as indexed by low pre-stimulus EEG alpha power. In addition, we anticipated that an external-reward intervention improves performance during a Go/No go task, especially in individuals with low task-induced motivation as indexed by low theta/ beta power ratios. High salience of stop signals enhanced stopping performance but there was no difference in responsivity to the salience intervention between participants with high and low EEG alpha power. Individuals with low theta/ beta power ratios responded more accurately when rewards were at stake. Together these results suggest that increasing the salience of external cues may help impulse control in general, whereas the effectiveness of external-reward interventions is higher in individuals with low task-induced motivation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>impulse control</kwd><kwd>salience</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>susceptibility</kwd><kwd>EEG alpha</kwd><kwd>EEG theta</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Impulsivity can be defined as a range of actions that are “poorly conceived, prematurely expressed, unduly risky, or inappropriate to the situation, and that often result in undesirable outcomes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Daruna &amp; Barnes, 1993</xref>). The ability to control impulsive actions has important implications for social and economic decision-making in daily life, but pronounced individual differences exist.</p><p id="P3">The ability to keep control over impulses is, for example, important in situations where individuals have to follow rules in order to prevent harm to themselves or others, such as the physical distancing rules in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Humans have an innate tendency to engage in close social and physical contact and adherence to physical distancing rules may therefore be difficult. Some individuals know the rule(s) and perhaps intend to adhere, but nonetheless fail to comply on many occasions.</p><p id="P4">This raises the question of whether impulsive tendencies can be influenced. In the current study, we considered two possible interventions that may enhance impulse control: increasing the salience of external cues that signal the need for impulse control, and rewarding fast and accurate action selection.</p><p id="P5">Several studies including a previous study in our lab have shown that increasing the salience of external cues that signal the need for impulse control enhances stopping competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Blizzard, Fierro-Rojas, &amp; Fallah, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Kenemans, Schutte, Van Bijnen, &amp; Logemann, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Montanari, Giamundo, Brunamonti, Ferraina, &amp; Pani, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Van Der Schoot, Licht, Horsley, &amp; Sergeant, 2005</xref>), the generally accepted objective index of impulse control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Kenemans, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that rewards affect stopping competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boehler, Schevernels, Hopf, Stoppel, &amp; Krebs, 2014</xref>) as well as task performance in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Schutte, Heitland, &amp; Kenemans, 2019</xref>). However, how individual characteristics can contribute to differences in responsivity to such interventions remains unclear.</p><p id="P6">It has been shown that enhanced alpha power in the electroencephalogram (EEG) is associated with reduced susceptibility to potentially critical external signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dockree et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">O’Connell et al., 2009</xref>). This may indicate that individuals with high alpha power are less able to attend to and/or process environmental cues, including cues that signal the need for impulse control.</p><p id="P7">The ratio between low-frequency EEG theta and high-frequency EEG beta power has been put forward as a trait-like index of reward sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Massar, Kenemans, &amp; Schutter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Schutter &amp; Kenemans, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Schutter &amp; Van Honk, 2005</xref>) and has been found to explain unique variance in reward-related task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Schutte, Kenemans, &amp; Schutter, 2017</xref>). Increased theta/ beta power ratios were for example associated with enhanced reward-learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Massar et al., 2014</xref>) and risky decision-making and reward-seeking during the Iowa gambling task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Massar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Schutter &amp; Van Honk, 2005</xref>). A previous study revealed that individuals with higher theta/ beta power ratios during resting state were also better at stopping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Lansbergen, Schutter, &amp; Kenemans, 2007</xref>). This observation was explained in terms of these individuals being driven by increased task-induced motivation to maximize stopping performance.</p><p id="P8">In the current study, we used existing data sets to relate EEG indices of environmental susceptibility and reward sensitivity to stopping competence, and reward-induced enhancement of action selection in a Go/Nogo context. The rationale behind the present work is that EEG alpha and theta/ beta power assessments may provide useful means to examine individual states of susceptibility and reward sensitivity. In turn, this enabled us to assess individual differences in responsivity to interventions regarding the salience of withhold-cues and regarding reward manipulation.</p><p id="P9">Specifically, we addressed five hypotheses: 1) High susceptibility/ low alpha predicts better impulse control. 2) Enhanced stop-signal salience induces better impulse control. 3) Enhanced salience induces better impulse control in specifically low-susceptibility/ high alpha individuals. 4) Introducing a reward induces more accurate and faster action selection. 5) Introducing a reward induces more accurate and faster action selection specifically in individuals with low levels of task-induced motivation (i.e., individuals with low theta/ beta power ratios). Furthermore, a secondary aim was to replicate our previous finding that theta/ beta power ratio during rest is associated with better stopping competence (hypothesis 6).</p><p id="P10">A combination of stopping performance data under conditions of low and high stop-signal salience and stop task-related EEG data allowed us to analyze whether low alpha power preceding the stop signal is correlated with better stopping competence as indexed by stop signal reaction times (SSRTs; hypothesis 1). In addition, it enables to examine the effect of salience on SSRT, and whether this effects differs for low-versus high-alpha-power groups (hypotheses 2 and 3, respectively). If anything, this relationship was expected to particularly manifest in a condition in which high trait susceptibility is presumably most beneficial. We, therefore, analyzed these data for a condition during which the stop signal is low-salient and subsequently examined whether salience enhancement results in better stopping performance, and mostly so in individuals with high alpha power preceding low-salient stop signals.</p><p id="P11">A combination of performance data in a cued-go/nogo reaction-time task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Schutte et al., 2019</xref>), under conditions of reward versus no reward, and resting-state EEG data allowed us to address hypothesis 4 and 5: Does reward induce better action selection, and mostly so in participants with low theta/ beta power ratios? Finally, a third data set consisting of stopping performance and resting-state EEG allowed us to attempt to replicate our previous finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Lansbergen et al., 2007</xref>) of a positive relation between theta/ beta power ratio during rest and stopping competence (hypothesis 6).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>1</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Subjects and datasets</title><p id="P12">For hypotheses 1, 2, and 3 we used stop-signal EEG and stop-signal performance data from one previously collected sample (n = 30; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Kenemans et al., 2022</xref>)).

The stop task used for the analysis of hypothesis 1, 2, and 3 (anticipated relationship between alpha, impulse control, and salience manipulation) is summarized below. Details can be found in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Kenemans et al., 2022</xref>). Subjects discriminated between two letter stimuli (go stimuli; “X” and “O”) by pressing a pre-specified button. Go stimuli were presented slightly above a fixation cross for 150 ms. Inter-trial intervals were set between 1500 and 1800 milliseconds.</p><p id="P19">Twenty-five percent of go stimuli were followed by a stop signal. The stop signal indicated that subjects had to try to withhold their already ongoing response to the go stimulus. The salience of the stop signal was manipulated across three different conditions: an auditory, and a high and a low-salient visual stop signal condition. In the auditory condition the stop signal was a 1000-Hz tone played binaurally at approximately 70 dB for 150 ms. The highly salient stop signal was a red background of the computer screen with a duration of 150 ms. The low-salient stop signal was a dollar sign with a visual angle comparable to the go stimuli.</p><p id="P20">The task consisted of 1 practice block (go stimulus only) with 126 trials which was followed by the three salience conditions. The order of the conditions was counterbalanced across subjects. Each salience condition started with a practice block followed by three main blocks, each consisting of 128 trials. After three main blocks the stimulus-hand mapping was switched and another practice block and three main blocks followed. The practice blocks also served to determine the duration of the optimal (i.e., yielding approximately 50 % successful stops) average go-stop interval of the first main block of a particular condition. The initial go-stop interval of each practise block was set to be the average go-stop interval of the previous main block, after applying an adaptive tracking algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">De Jong, Coles, &amp; Logan, 1995</xref>). The go-stop interval of the first trial of the very first practice block was set to 250 ms. During all practice blocks go-stop intervals were increased by 50 ms after a successful stop, and shortened by 50 ms after a failed stop trial. The average go-stop intervals for main blocks 2 and 3 were based on the stopping performance of the previous block and determined by means of an adaptive tracking algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">De Jong et al., 1995</xref>). For all main blocks, go-stop intervals were jittered from -99 ms to 99 ms relative to the average go-stop interval.</p><p id="P21">Participants included in the analysis of the relation between resting state theta/ beta power ratio and stopping competence were subjected to only the auditory-stop version of a similar stop task. Details can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Massar (2012)</xref>. Go stimuli in this task were blue circles and squares. Fourty percent of stop stimuli were followed by a stop signal, which consisted of a 1000-Hz tone played at 83 dB for 400 ms. Average go-stop intervals for each block were based on a staircase procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Massar, 2012</xref>). Go-stop intervals were jittered from -125 ms to 125 ms relative to the average go-stop interval. Subjects performed 8 task blocks consisting of 126 trials each.

In short, letters were presented on the screen and participants were instructed to press the right button when a cue letter (always letter A) was followed by target letter X and to press the left button when cue letter A was followed by target letter Y, as quickly and accurately as possible. The response hand-target mapping was counterbalanced across participants. Each letter stimulus was presented for 150 ms and was followed by an inter-stimulus interval with a random duration between 1400-1600 ms. In addition to A, X, and Y, the sequence was made up of 8 other letters, and the overall probability of an A was 20%.</p><p id="P23">The CGN task consisted of a practice block with 100 letter presentations and four main blocks of 400 letter presentations. The blocks differed with respect to whether correct and fast responding was rewarded or not and with respect to the probability of target appearance after the cue. The four blocks covered the following conditions: 0 Euros/ 50% probability given A, 0 Euros/ 98% probability given A, a maximum of 5 Euros/ 50% probability given A, and a maximum of 5 Euros/ 98% probability given A. The order of these conditions was counterbalanced across participants and participants were fully informed about the reward and probability condition of a block before the start of the block.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><label>2.4</label><title>Resting state EEG</title><p id="P24">All resting state EEG data were recorded using the Active-Two system (Biosemi, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).

Reaction times (RTs) of all go trials (including omission trials and trials with pre-mature responses; RTs of trials with omissions were set to 1500 ms) were rank-ordered from shortest to longest for each block. The timing of the end of the stop process is estimated to correspond to reaction time <italic>n</italic> in the rank-ordered RT distribution. <italic>N</italic> is computed by multiplying the number of go trial RTs in that distribution by the probability of a failed stop during a given block (i.e., 1-proportion successful stops). SSRTs were computed for each block and condition separately by subtraction of the average go-stop interval of a given block from the <italic>N</italic>th RT of that block. SSRTs were subsequently averaged across the 6 blocks for each of the three salience conditions.</p><p id="P26">High-minus-low salience difference scores were created by subtraction of SSRTs for the low-salient stop signal from those for the high-salient and auditory conditions, respectively (i.e., SSRT high-salient minus SSRT low-salient and SSRT auditory minus SSRT low-salient).</p><p id="P27">For hypothesis 6 we used the same procedure to estimate SSRTs as used in the Lansbergen et al. study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Lansbergen et al., 2007</xref>), previously described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">De Jong, Coles, Logan, &amp; Gratton, 1990</xref>). This method differs from the integration method in that the RT distribution only includes valid responses to go stimuli (trials with RTs between 150-1500 ms after stimulus onset and omission trials were excluded).

Data were segmented from -950 until +50 ms surrounding go stimuli that were followed by a stop signal. Data were segmented separately for go stimuli followed by correct and failed stops. Before eye blink correction we removed segments with extreme artifacts (maximal allowed voltage step: 50 μV, amplitude between -400 and +400 μV, and lowest allowed activity: 0.5 μV).

In addition, we investigated how individual characteristics can contribute to differences in responsivity to such interventions. This was adressed by relating putative markers of environmental susceptibility (EEG alpha power) and reward sensitivity (theta/ beta power ratio) to impulse control and reward-induced performance enhancement, respectively. These electrophysiological markers, in turn, were used as a means to examine individual differences in responsivity to the reward and salience interventions.</p><p id="P47">Our results show that impulse control can be enhanced simply by increasing the salience of external cues. We did, however, not find evidence for a relationship between EEG alpha power and impulse control, and no differences in responsivity to the salience intervention between participants with high and low alpha power. We found that introducing a reward for correct performance induces overall better task performance. Moreover, we found evidence for individual differences in responsivity to the reward intervention. In participants with a relatively low theta/ beta power ratio, reward increased correct action selection.</p><p id="P48">Prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dockree et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">O’Connell et al., 2009</xref>) have shown that EEG alpha power preceding a visual target is associated with detection errors, suggesting that EEG alpha power can be seen as an electrophysiological correlate for the susceptibility to signals in the environment. Therefore we hypothesized that participants with relatively low levels of alpha power preceding stop signals would be better able to attend to or to process stop signals. Hence, it was expected that low levels of alpha power preceding stop signals would be associated with enhanced stopping performance, the objective index of impulse control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Verbruggen et al., 2019</xref>). We anticipated that increasing the salience of stop signals (i.e., making them more distinguishable) would lead to enhanced stopping performance and that this intervention would have a greater effect in participants with high alpha power. The salience manipulation did exert the expected effect on overall stopping performance. In line with previous studies stopping was faster when the stop signal was high compared to low in salience. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Blizzard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Montanari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Van Der Schoot et al., 2005</xref>). Contrary to our expectation, we did not observe a relationship between EEG alpha power preceding stop signals and stopping performance, and no difference in the effect of the salience manipulation between participants with high and low alpha power. These findings indicate that enhancement of the salience of external cues is an effective intervention for the overall improvement of impulse control. This result also suggests that average task-related alpha power may not reflect trait-like susceptibility to signals in the environment. Results of studies showing that alpha power can distinguish between misses and hits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dockree et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">O’Connell et al., 2009</xref>) may rather indicate that alpha power fluctuations across trials result in transient shifts in susceptibility.</p><p id="P49">In a prior study it was found that alpha power attenuation from an eyes-closed to eyes-open resting-state condition (alpha reactivity) was larger for individuals diagnosed with ADHD compared to control subjects. No such effect was observed for absolute alpha power during either the eyes-open or eyes-closed condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">van Dongen-Boomsma et al., 2010</xref>). Based on these findings it is possible that, unlike task-related alpha power, alpha reactivity during resting state conditions relates to stopping performance and the effect of the salience manipulation on stopping. This may be an interesting avenue for future research.</p><p id="P50">Several studies have shown that reward affects performance in go/ no go tasks, e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Demurie, Roeyers, Wiersema, &amp; Sonuga-Barke, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Schutte et al., 2019</xref>). This performance improvement by reward is likely due to interactions between reward-related brain areas and networks related to perception and executive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Pessoa &amp; Engelmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Schutte et al., 2019</xref>). Several studies have also shown that reward improves stopping performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boehler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Demurie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Doekemeijer, Verbruggen, &amp; Boehler, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Kohls, Herpertz-Dahlmann, &amp; Konrad, 2009</xref>), indicating that rewarding successful impulse control may be a promising intervention strategy to improve impulse control.</p><p id="P51">Prior studies have shown that frontal theta/ beta power ratio is positively related to reward-learning, risky decision-making, and reward-seeking during gambling tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Kelley, Hortensius, Schutter, &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Massar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Schutter &amp; Van Honk, 2005</xref>). In an earlier study it was found that stopping performance was better in individuals with high theta/ beta power ratio’s, which in turn was interpreted as reflecting stronger task-induced motivation in the high theta/ beta group. Hence, individuals with low theta/ beta power ratio were expected to benefit more an extrinsic monetary reward.</p><p id="P52">The results show that the reward intervention did exert the expected improving effect on overall performance during the cued go/ no go task. More specifically, in line with our hypothesis, the response to the reward intervention was enhanced in participants with a relatively low theta/ beta power ratio. These individuals showed more correct responses when a reward compared to no reward could be obtained compared to individuals with a relatively high theta/ beta power ratio. This finding is consistent with our hypotheses that theta/ beta power ratio is associated with task-induced motivation and that an extrinsic reward intervention exerts a greater effect on performance in individuals with weak task-induced motivation. Individuals with a low theta/ beta power ratio may have had lower levels of intrinsic motivation to perform well on the task in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Lansbergen et al., 2007</xref>). Consequently, the addition of performance-contingent reward may have led to improved performance specifically in the low theta/ beta group, because there was more room for improvement to occur in this group compared to the high theta/ beta power ratio group. The high theta/ beta group may have had higher levels of motivation to perform well, even without additional reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Lansbergen et al., 2007</xref>). An alternative interpretation is that individuals with a relatively low theta/ beta power ratio showed more correct responses during reward blocks, because they were more sensitive to punishment (which results from an incorrect response during a reward block). A prior study, however, has shown that the positive relationship between theta/ beta power ratio and risky decision-making during the Iowa gambling task is driven by these individuals displaying increased approach rather than reduced avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Massar et al., 2014</xref>). This finding renders the alternative interpretation less likely.</p><p id="P53">It has been argued that the theta/ beta power ratio reflects cortical-subcortical interaction and as such the theta/ beta power ratio may involve the extent to which reward (subcortex) modulates cognitive control and attention (cortex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Schutter &amp; Knyazev, 2012</xref>) or vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Angelidis, Hagenaars, van Son, van der Does, &amp; Putman, 2018</xref>). Results of prior studies have shown that a low resting-state theta/ beta power ratio is associated with high resilience against disruption of attentional control by emotional stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Angelidis et al., 2018</xref>). These latter results suggest that theta/ beta power ratio can also be seen as a neural marker of attentional control over emotional stimuli, rather than as a neural marker of reward sensitivity. Interestingly, the results of the current study show that the high and low theta/ beta power ratio groups only differed with respect to the effect of the reward intervention on accuracy, not with respect to the effect of the reward intervention on reaction speed. It may be speculated that individuals with a relatively low theta/ beta power ratio were better able to adjust the level of cognitive control in order to improve the accuracy of their responses during the reward blocks; this idea is consistent with thet results of a recent tACS study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Wischnewski, Joergensen, Compen, &amp; Schutter, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P54">Finally, it should be noted that in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Lansbergen et al., 2007</xref>) it was reported that individuals with a high theta/ beta power ratio during rest are better at stopping, this relationship was not replicated in the current study. One possible explanation for this discrepancy may be that in the earlier study only individuals scoring very high and very low on self-reported impulsivity were included. This is clearly deviant from the current study in which participants were not pre-selected. Furthermore, other findings have demonstrated a positive relationship between impulsivity and theta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Snyder &amp; Hall, 2006</xref>) and a negative relationship between impulsivity (ADHD) and inhibitory control (stopping) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Lijffijt, Kenemans, Verbaten, &amp; van Engeland, 2005</xref>). It is therefore possible that the difference in subject characteristics contributes to the discrepancy between our current finding and that of the earlier study.</p><p id="P55">In conclusion, results show that increasing the salience of external cues may be a feasible way to positively affect impulse control. The efficacy of reward interventions however partially depends on individual characteristics with respect to reward seeking tendencies. Reward interventions may be specifically effective in individuals with low levels of intrinsic motivation. From a practical point of view, the results imply that salience and reward interventions are possibly worthwhile as a measure to enhance adherence to rules such as the physical distancing rules during the Covid pandemic and that require inhibition of automatic behavioral tendencies and impulses. Examples of possible interventions are flags or salient auditory signals when a 1.5-meter boundary is transgressed or additional discounts in a supermarket after physical distancing.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by a Covid-19 research grant from the Utrecht University Faculty of Social and Behavioral
