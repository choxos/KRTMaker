process requiring localised actin dynamics at their tip to alter membrane shape.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) Mammalian photoreceptor outer segments comprise an expanse of folded membranes (discs) at the tip of highly-specialised connecting cilia (CC), in which photosensitive GPCRs like rhodopsin are concentrated. In an extraordinary feat of biology, outer segment discs are shed and remade daily.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) Defects in this process, due to genetic mutations, cause retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an untreatable, blinding disease. The mechanism by which photoreceptor cilia generate outer segments is therefore fundamental for vision yet poorly understood. Here, we show the membrane deformation required for outer segment disc genesis is driven by dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton in a process akin to ectocytosis. Further, we show <italic>RPGR</italic>, a leading causal RP gene, regulates activity of actin binding proteins crucial to this process. Disc genesis is compromised in <italic>Rpgr</italic> mouse models, slowing the actin dynamics required for timely disc formation, leading to aborted membrane shedding as ectosome-like vesicles, photoreceptor death and visual loss. Manipulation of actin dynamics partially rescues the phenotype, suggesting this pathway could be targeted therapeutically. These findings help define how actin-mediated dynamics control outer segment turnover.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>photoreceptor</kwd><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>retinitis pigmentosa</kwd><kwd>ciliopathies</kwd><kwd>outer segment</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>RPGR</kwd><kwd>ectocytosis</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>disease modelling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Most mammalian cells assemble a primary cilium; a microtubule-based structure that protrudes from the cell body and functions as a sensory organelle by detecting changes in the extracellular environment and initiating signalling.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) Cilia dysfunction, due to pathogenic mutations in critical genes, leads to a spectrum of human diseases termed the ciliopathies, which comprise multisystem disorders of the brain, lung, kidney and eye, amongst others.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) Thus, tight control of cilia signalling is crucial for human health.</p><p id="P3">Cilia function is optimised by compartmentalising the initiators of signalling cascades, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), in its membrane. This is achieved by high volume trafficking to the cilia, but more recently it has been shown that dynamic membrane changes at the ciliary tip can regulate GPCR concentration within the cilium in a process termed ectocytosis, which involves the shedding of cilia-membrane-derived vesicles into the extracellular space.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) Ectosome formation is facilitated by local changes in the actin cytoskeleton to initiate the membrane deformation required to form these structures that will be subsequently pinched off and shed. How important this biological process is across cell types and in the context of human health remains unclear.</p><p id="P4">The photoreceptor contains one of the most highly specialised primary cilia, that has evolved to optimise our visual processing capabilities by compartmentalising its photosensitive GPCRs within hundreds of disc-like membranous processes that stack on top of each other at the distal end of the cilia to form the cell’s outer segment (OS).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) To enable recycling of its contents, the photoreceptor OS is completely renewed every 7 to 10 days,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) with distal discs shed for phagocytosis by the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) A fine balance, with continuous birth of photoreceptor discs to replace the shed OS material, is critical to support vision. The mechanism that drives the ciliary membrane remodelling required for disc formation is yet to be fully determined, but evidence is mounting that it is an actin-driven process(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and it has been speculated that the process has evolved as a form of ectocytosis.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) Failure to renew photoreceptor discs has been implicated in retinitis pigmentosa (RP),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) a heterogenous group of inherited retinal dystrophies affecting 1 in 3000 people(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) that cause blindness. Patients present with night blindness and progressive constriction of their visual fields, prior to loss of central vision, as their photoreceptors degenerate.</p><p id="P5">Here, using cryo-electron tomography, novel reporter mice and advanced live imaging techniques, we provide evidence supporting a model whereby the membrane deformation required for photoreceptor disc formation is an actin driven process akin to ectocytosis. Further, we show that retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator <italic>(RPGR)</italic>, mutations in which cause 15% of RP,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) functions to control the tempo of disc formation by binding the actin severing protein cofilin in the distal photoreceptor cilia and regulating its activity. <italic>RPGR</italic> mutations compromise cofilin activity, resulting in lengthened actin bundles in the newly forming disc, slowing their maturation. As a result, compromised discs are instead shed as ectosome-like vesicles, resulting in a reduced rate of disc morphogenesis, outer segment abnormalities, retinal stress, photoreceptor degeneration and loss of vision. We conclude, therefore, that highly regulated actin control in the nascent photoreceptor disc controls the cadence of disc genesis in the same manner as ectosome formation and that <italic>Rpgr</italic> plays a crucial role in the process.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Disc formation is an active, actin driven process</title><p id="P6">There is growing evidence that disc formation is actin-dependent.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) It has not been definitively shown, however, if this is due to an active process, whereby progressive nucleation of actin microfilaments (akin to lamellipodia formation)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) mechanically deform the membrane. Alternatively, it could be a passive process (such as blebbing), whereby loss of adhesion between the membrane and underlying cortical actin allows the hydrostatic pressure within a cell to deform the membrane.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) To distinguish between these possibilities in situ at nanoscale, we used cryo-electron tomography (cryoET).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) Flash freezing isolated mouse rod photoreceptor outer segments (ROS) allows visualisation of 3-dimensional architecture at an ultrastructural level by creating 3-dimensional maps from a tilt series of electron tomograph images. Three dimensional reconstructions showed microfilaments extending from the distal CC into the nascent disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-c</xref>). Sub-tomogram averaging of these microfilaments revealed similarities to filamentous actin’s published structure of 166.67° twists per molecule and a 27.8 Å rise per molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-f</xref>).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) Using live imaging of retinal slice cultures incubated with silicon rhodamine-actin (SiR-Actin), a fluorogenic, cell permeable probe based on the highly specific F actin binding drug jasplakinolide, we observed elongation, constriction and movement of the microfilaments within the connecting cilium evident over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Extended Data Movie 1</xref>). We thus conclude that dynamic actin changes occur within nascent photoreceptor discs, suggesting a role for actin in disc genesis.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>RPGR is required for photoreceptor outer segment turnover</title><p id="P7">Mutations in <italic>RPGR</italic> account for 70-90% of X-linked RP (XLRP) and 10-15% of all RP and result in a severe form of disease.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) RPGR is alternatively spliced, with a retinal specific isoform containing a repetitive, disordered C-terminal domain of unknown function (conventionally termed ‘ORF15’) that is a mutational hotspot for disease.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) RPGR localises to the photoreceptor CC and its loss results in perturbation of CC actin regulation, with subsequent photoreceptor degeneration.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) To determine if RPGR plays a role in actin-driven disc genesis, we generated novel <italic>Rpgr-</italic>mutant mice harbouring humanised disease-causing mutations.</p><p id="P8">N terminal <italic>RPGR</italic> mutations are associated with more severe human disease than those in the C terminal ORF15 domain.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) However, mouse genetic background has been shown to influence disease severity.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) To determine if mouse disease correlated with that of human, and was therefore an appropriate model for this work, two novel mutations were generated in the same strain of mice, each replicating human pathogenic mutations (see <italic>Methods</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). One harboured a frameshift mutation in <italic>Rpgr’s</italic> N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>; hereby referred to as <italic>Rpg<sub>ĩ</sub><sup>Ex3d8</sup></italic>), while the other harboured a truncation mutation in the C-terminal repetitive domain of the retina-specific isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>; hereby referred to as <italic>Rpgr<sup>ORFd5</sup></italic>).</p><p id="P9">Fundoscopy revealed retinal degeneration, characterised by punctate lesions at the posterior pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figs. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">3a</xref>) whilst fundus blue light autofluorescence showed accumulation of autofluorescent material within the retinas of both models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figs. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">3b</xref>), a clinical biomarker for photoreceptor disease. Electroretinograms (ERGs) that measure retinal photoreceptor function were recorded as mice aged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figs. 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">4</xref>). The dark-adapted scotopic ERG reflects primarily rod photoreceptor function at lower stimulus intensities, whereas the light-adapted photopic ERG reflects cone photoreceptor function. Both models developed significant loss of their scotopic ERG a-wave amplitude (representing rod photoreceptor dysfunction) at 18 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figs. 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">4</xref>). Cone photoreceptor function (photopic ERG a-wave amplitude) in the R<italic>Rpgr<sup>ORFd5</sup></italic> mouse remained comparable to wild type but was significantly reduced from 6 months of age in the <italic>Rpgr<sup>Ex3d8</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Optical coherence tomography showed loss of the outer nuclear (photoreceptor) layer at 18 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figs. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">3c</xref>), which was supported by conventional histology in both models but was more severe in <italic>Rpgr<sup>Ex3d8</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figs. 2d</xref>,e and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">3d,e</xref>). In summary, loss of all Rpgr isoforms leads to more severe disease than loss of the retinal specific isoform alone, similar to human patient mutations. The <italic>Rpgr<sup>Ex3d8</sup></italic> mouse was brought forward for further studies.</p><p id="P10">We have previously shown <italic>RPGR</italic> mutations perturb actin regulation in both mouse and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human photoreceptors.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) Further, <italic>RPGR</italic> mutations result in loss of the retinal ellipsoid and interdigitating zones of XLRP patients on optical coherence tomography imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Figs. 5</xref>); signifying OS loss. We therefore assessed the outer segments of our <italic>Rpgr</italic>-mutant mouse lines using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). At 6 weeks of age, long before the mice show signs of retinal stress <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figs. 2g</xref>) and over 12 months before they undergo retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figs. 2d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">3d,e</xref>), mutant outer segments display a ‘split disc’ phenotype. Their discs have lost compaction and appear spaced out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Further, mutant outer segments are significantly shorter from base to RPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) than wild type, suggesting <italic>Rpgr<sup>Ex3d8</sup></italic> outer segments contain fewer discs. This conclusion is supported by proteomic data of 6 week mouse isolated rod outer segments and 3 month isolated retinas, which show <italic>Rpgr<sup>Ex3d8</sup></italic> retinas contain lower amounts of photoreceptor disc component (PRCD, Progressive Cone-Rod Dystrophy) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Tables. 1 and 2</bold>), a 6 kDa membrane protein that localises exclusively to photoreceptor discs and segregates to the outer disc rim.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) Reduced PRCD in <italic>Rpgr<sup>Ex3d8</sup></italic> retinas was confirmed on immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). Basal discs at the base of the <italic>Rpgr<sup>Ex3d8</sup></italic> outer segment, however, are able to form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P11">While basal discs are still able to form, a reduced rate of disc formation could account for the split disc phenotype. <italic>Rpgr<sup>Ex3d8</sup></italic> mutants accumulated high levels of vesicles in the extra cellular space at the base of outer segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Vesicles of similar morphology were recently determined to be ciliary ectosomes in a RDS/peripherin mutant mouse (rds<sup>-/-</sup>), which displays defective disc formation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) Abnormal ciliary membrane deformation, therefore, with compromised discs instead shed as ectosomes, could slow the rate of completed disc formation and account for this split disc phenotype. RPGR is located at the site of disc formation in the distal CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and could therefore play a role in disc genesis. To test this, we engineered a novel reporter mouse that would allow tracking of outer segment turnover. The C terminal end of the photosensitive GPCR, Rhodopsin, was tagged with the self-labelling peptide SNAP using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to target single cell embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figs. 6a,b</xref>). These mice will hereinafter be referred to as <italic>Rhod<sup>SNAP</sup></italic>. Rhodopsin is the major protein component of outer segment discs, and so incubating <italic>Rhod<sup>SNAP</sup></italic> retinal slice cultures with SNAP fluorophores results in outer segment labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figs. 6c</xref>). The heterozygous SNAP tag knock-in is non-disruptive; heterozygous <italic>Rhod<sup>SNAP</sup></italic> mice have normal retinal function at 6 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figs. 6d,e</xref>). Temporal <italic>Rhod</italic><sup>SNAP</sup> labelling with different SNAP tags <italic>in vivo</italic> allowed optimisation of a block-chase experiment to determine the rate of disc formation over 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6f,g</xref>) and so were crossed with the <italic>Rpgr<sup>Ex3d8</sup></italic> mouse. At 6 weeks of age, <italic>Rpgr<sup>Ex3d8</sup></italic> mice had a reduced rate of new disc formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c-e</xref>). We conclude that perturbation of RPGR results in a slowed rate of disc formation, leading to shortened, ‘split disc’ outer segments and vesicle shedding.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title><italic>Rpgr</italic> mutations lead to dysregulation of cofilin activity</title><p id="P12">Previous work by ourselves and others supports a role for RPGR in regulating photoreceptor actin.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) To further explore this, we undertook an unbiased total proteomic approach in control and <italic>Rpgr</italic> mutant retinal extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). At 3 months of age, computational analysis of differentially expressed proteins using Enrichr(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) ranked retinitis pigmentosa as the top disease in <italic>Rpgr<sup>Ex3d8</sup></italic> retina compared to wild type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). Further, analysis of protein pathways using Panther ranked cy-toskeletal regulation by Rho GTPases as a significantly disrupted pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Tables. 1 and 2</bold>). Of note, there was altered expression of the ARP2/3 complex protein ARP3, known to play a role in disc morphogenesis.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) To further explore this, immunoblotting was carried out on separate total retinal extracts, probing for a panel of actin nucleators and polymerisers. No changes were seen in levels of Cdc42, profilin, Vasp or Wave proteins in <italic>Rpgr<sup>Ex3d8</sup></italic> retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>), but there was a small, significant reduction in the ARP2/3 complex protein ARP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4b</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The ARP2/3 complex directly competes for binding sites on actin filaments with the actin depolymeriser cofilin, which we have previously shown to have reduced activity in patient-derived RPGR-mutant, iPSC retinal organoid cultures(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) and is thought to be present in early discs.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) To this end, we analysed <italic>Rpgr<sup>Ex3d8</sup></italic> retinal lysates with immunoblotting, which showed increased phosphorylation, and therefore inactivation, of cofilin at Serine 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Using immunofluorescence, we demonstrate that cofilin localises to the photoreceptor CC membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>), at the site of disc morphogenesis and overlapping with RPGR localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We therefore sought to determine whether there is a biochemical interaction between RPGR and cofilin in vivo. Endogenous co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments using murine retinal lysates confirmed an interaction between endogenous cofilin and the retinal specific isoform of RPGR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) Given actin’s multifunctionality and its abundance throughout the cell, it is crucial that local, sub-cellular turnover is tightly controlled to ensure cellular processes are precisely executed, both temporally and spatially. Our findings support that RPGR binds and regulates actin binding protein activity in the distal CC to regulate basal disc formation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Perturbation of RPGR dysregulates actin-mediated photoreceptor disc formation</title><p id="P14">Having demonstrated dysregulation of actin binding proteins in <italic>Rpgr<sup>Ex3d8</sup></italic> mice, and a reduced rate of disc formation, we examined local actin dynamics in the CC in the absence of RPGR.

However, cryoET provides only a snapshot of the very dynamic process of actin turnover.

With this rescue experiment, we conclude that the shedding of aborted discs as vesicles and a reduced rate of disc formation in <italic>RPGR</italic> mutants is due to compromised dynamic turnover of actin microfilaments extending from the photoreceptor CC into basal discs, due to cofilin dysregulation. Our results suggest that these defects in the cadence of disc biogenesis, resulting from increased length of these mutant actin microfilaments, can be therapeutically modulated short-term.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">Our <italic>in vivo</italic> data support that RPGR functions locally at the photoreceptor CC to spatially regulate activity of actin severing proteins, such as cofilin, in order to appropriately pace actin-mediated disc formation. We have previously shown that RPGR interacts with another actin severing protein, gelsolin, and these interactions are perturbed in pathogenic human RPGR retinal organoids(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). We propose, therefore, that the glutamylated RPGR isoform serves as a structural scaffold that facilitates the timely recruitment and activation of actin binding proteins (ABPs) to control the appropriate pace of disc biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). Our study raises important questions about what the molecular nature of this pacemaker is that controls the regular tempo. Previous work at the primary cilia tip has demonstrated the highly localised role that actin plays in ciliary membrane deformation in a content-dependent manner. Here, excision of a membranous bud (ectosome) at its distal end, facilitates the exit of GPCRs to regulate cilia content appropriately(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Similar mechanisms at the distal CC / transition zone may operate to ‘sense’ regulate membrane content, such as rhodopsin concentration, to regulate disc formation. Further studies are necessary to distinguish these models. We propose that photoreceptor disc formation shares a common ancestral mechanism of ectocy-tosis and RPGR’s retinal specific isoform may have evolved to promote this.</p><p id="P17">It is over 30 years since disc formation was first proposed to be an actin-dependent process. In seminal TEM experiments, it was shown that actin was present in the distal CC(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) and that depolymerising actin inhibited the formation of new discs, but not the addition of membrane to existing ones,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) suggesting actin bundling was required for the initial membrane deformation to begin the process. Subsequently, it was confirmed that the process of disc morphogenesis is one of evagination(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), which would support a process of ac-tive, actin protrusions initiating the process. In recent years, progress has been made in defining the molecular pathways that govern actin regulation in the CC(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Here, for the first time, we confirm the presence of actin microfilament bundles within the basal disc and, by live imaging, demonstrate the dynamic changes in actin orientation that occur precisely at the level of the distal CC.</p><p id="P18">Force generation lies at the heart of all cellular membrane morphogenesis, which the actin cytoskeleton can produce due to its ability to form higher order structures. But these resulting structures can remain stable for an incredibly long time.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) In order for cells to perform the rapid actin turnover critical for a metronomic, repeated membrane deformation such as that required for disc formation, regulated dismantling of these networks is equally important. Thus, it would be predicted that a hyperstabilised actin cytoskeleton at the site of basal disc formation, as seen in our <italic>Rpgr</italic>-mutant mice, would compromise the cadence of disc genesis, which we demonstrate. The actin severing protein, cofilin, plays a central role in actin-filament length oscillation by trimming the aged end of a filament that continues to grow at the barbed end,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) allowing branched networks to be disassembled.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) Of interest, cofilin competes for binding to actin with the actin polymeriser, ARP2/3, a protein previously demonstrated to be crucial for disc formation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) Cofilin is known to regulate primary cilia length through actin rearrangement.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) Our work suggests cofilin is required for mammalian photoreceptor disc formation, and the observation that cofilin is present in aborted photoreceptor ectosomes when normal disc formation is disrupted(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) further supports this model.</p><p id="P19">The molecular architecture of this RPGR-dependent scaffold at the distal CC involves SPATA7 and RPGRIP,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) mutations in which also cause RP in humans. RPGR is mislocalised away from the distal CC in mice lacking either SPATA7(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) or RPGRIP,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) with failure of normal outer segment disc genesis. Importantly, while RPGR, RPGRIP and SPATA7 appear critical for photoreceptor function, they appear dispensable for cilia function in most other cell types. We speculate, therefore, that they have evolved as a scaffold at the site of disc formation to which actin binding proteins, critical for timely disc formation, can be recruited. Pharmaco-manipulation of actin activity could reverse the underlying cellular phenotypes disrupting disc biogenesis. Further work is required to address the translational potential of our study, specifically to establish if actin modulation could slow the retinal degeneration seen in <italic>RPGR/XLRP</italic> patients.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Animal experiments</title><p id="P20">All experiments followed international, national and institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals.

Movement of actin microfilaments was tracked by individually selecting the region of interest and measuring Brownian motion over time captured. 6 to 20 mobile actin filaments were analysed per sample. Data was exported to Excel and total distance moved in the X axis over time was calculated. Data for all filaments was then plotted in Prism software, where Student’s t-test statistical analysis was performed.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Isolation of rod outer segments (ROS)</title><p id="P43">Mice were maintained in a 12/12 hour light (400 Lux)/dark cycle.
