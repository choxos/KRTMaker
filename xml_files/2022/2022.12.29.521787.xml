Recent advances in microscopy have led to the creation of increasingly detailed images of murine hematopoietic tissue. Accurate, efficient, and informative methodologies to extract and analyze the large amount of data generated are, however, still lacking. Indeed, cells are very densely packed in the bone marrow and therefore difficult to efficiently and accurately segment. In addition, currently employed statical analyses of cellular localization are generally unsuitable for the investigation of interactions between more than two cell types. To overcome these limitations, we developed PACESS, a readily applicable method based on neural network classification of hundreds of thousands of cells in thick 3D bone marrow samples, and a combination of statistical techniques to assess the spatial interactions between multiple cell types. To validate this approach, we used it to investigate the spatial organization of T cells, megakaryocytes and leukemic cells. We demonstrate that the presence of large clusters of leukemic cells affects the distribution of both T cells and megakaryocytes, albeit differently, resulting in the generation of previously unrecognized, unique microenvironments adjacent to each other within the same bone marrow cavity. We believe that this approach can contribute to unravel the BM cellular organization.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P4"><fig id="F5" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS198704-f005"/></fig></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">The cellular architecture of organs is known to be a key feature for the maintenance of their function, and changes of cellular organization are often linked to disease. This has been extensively demonstrated for tissues that have well-known structures such as the skin or the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The Bone Marrow (BM) is the organ where hematopoiesis, the process of maintaining all blood cells’ turnover through the daily generation of billions of diverse cell types in mouse, and trillions in human, takes place. The combination of flow cytometry, single cell transcriptomics and functional assays has provided a wealth of information on the different hematopoietic cell populations co-existing in the BM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. However, still very little is understood about the spatial organization of this tissue. BM is the softest tissue in the body and has long been considered as an amorphous, even liquid, structure with a wide range of different cell types tightly packed within a confined cavity. These features make the BM a uniquely challenging tissue for histological imaging and quantification. To address this challenge, researchers in the field have made use of increasingly sophisticated BM multidimensional imaging techniques (3D or greater) focusing on visualizing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) populations in large BM tissue preparations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. While these led to the emerging concept that the BM is spatially and regionally organized to differentially support distinct HSPC populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, the spatial organization of multiple hematopoietic cell types remains unclear. Understanding it holds clues for more effective harnessing of HSPC function, development of improved therapies for hematological disorders and overall healthier ageing. Quantification of multicellular interactions within large BM 3D image datasets has not yet been achieved for two main reasons. First, image segmentation by intensity thresholding, which is, historically, the most widely used method for identifying cells of interest, underperforms in scenarios where cells are compressed or tightly packed together, as in the BM, where boundaries between cells become more difficult to distinguish. Hence, a high number of cells are not identified and are lost. The second challenge relates to the statistical methodologies available to assess multicellular interactions. Inferences have typically been made using pairwise hypothesis testing, but this approach is limited as it does not facilitate the direct examination of the relationships between a higher number of cell types, making it challenging to formulate definitive conclusions from the underlying data.</p><p id="P6">Here we present PACESS (Practical AI-based Cell Extraction and Spatial Statistics), a pipeline for extracting and analyzing hematopoietic cells from large 3D BM images, overcoming existing limitations (graphical abstract). This pipeline makes use of convolutional neural- network based object-detection to classify and identify the locations of cells in 2D, followed by an automated method that creates 3D understanding. We introduce an augmented object detection deep neural network trained using 2D data alone, for which images can be rapidly annotated. Annotations are created for each image-layer in the 3D data and the output from multiple layers are automatically combined to identify each cell’s type and location within the 3D space. Once the spatial data are extracted, we apply a set of 3D spatial statistical analyses. The steps in this process include: generating exploratory statistics that quantitatively assess spatial heterogeneity; identifying regions of high cellular density of specific cell types; visualization of the local density of cell types; and, finally, identification and visualization of location-dependent relative abundance between cell types. The resulting analysis is presented as a holistic ‘statistic model map’ of BM tissue.</p><p id="P7">We applied PACESS to study the spatial interactions of megakaryocyte and T cells in the context of leukaemia. Leukaemia progression leads to healthy hematopoietic cells being dislodged <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and therefore represents a good model for studying changes in multiple cell populations’ spatial interactions. First, PACESS was able to efficiently extract the cellular information for the three cell populations, even in areas tightly packed with leukaemia. Then, the statistical analysis revealed that the density of AML cells at a specific BM location significantly affects T cells and megakaryocytes’ densities, albeit with distinct patterns, resulting in the generation of multiple microenvironments characterized by unique relative densities of these three cell types.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Large 3D image datasets of murine BM represent a computational challenge for analysis</title><p id="P8">By nature, the bone marrow (BM) is an organ where cells are highly packed together. This is exacerbated during acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), when malignant cells outcompete healthy hematopoiesis through mechanisms that are still not fully understood. To study the spatial relationship of different cell types within the BM, it is informative to work with large 3D tissue specimens. We generated these using agarose embedding and a vibratome to cut 200-300 μm thick sections of various bones, a combination of elements from previously described clearing protocols developed for BM or other tissues, and careful troubleshooting of tissue fixation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Heme is highly abundant in the BM and is known to interfere with light penetration, generating background noise and thus reducing image quality. We first used the Reagent 1 (or ScaleCUBIC1) solution from the CUBIC method to decolorize heme efficiently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. To quickly clarify BM samples while maintaining their integrity over time, we selected the Ce3D tissue clearing reagent and kept the samples in it for imaging and storing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Finally, we embedded samples in Histodenz reagent, resulting in the generation of transparent samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-B</xref>). To confirm that our clearing protocol did not distort BM tissue, we imaged the calvarium BM cavities of a vWF megakaryocyte transgenic reporter mouse using two photon excitation intravital microscopy (without any clearing) first, and then again following explant and clarification. The mouse was injected with FITC-conjugated dextran to identify vasculature during IVM, and the calvarium sample was stained with anti-endomucin antibody to achieve the same result <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Juxtaposition of the tilescans obtained via IVM and following clearing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>) revealed no changes in the overall appearance of the tissue. Moreover, quantification of the diameter of megakaryocytes demonstrated no difference in the two images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>). Finally, to maximize the signal to noise ratio in thick BM sections we tested the effect of fixation on immunostaining clarity. While we found fixation length affected some antibodies more than others, we identified 2 hours fixation as the ideal, goldilocks timing that allowed both efficient vibratome cuffing and easily interpretable immunostaining results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E-F</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To generate our exemplar image, we injected a wild type C57Bl/6 mouse with tomato+ AML cells generated through retroviral transduction of the oncogene MLL-AF9, a well-established and widely used murine model of AML <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. We harvested bones at an intermediate disease stage, whereby flow cytometry analysis confirmed an overall infiltration of femur bone marrow of 15%. A 250 μm thick section from the contralateral femur was stained with an antì-CD8 antibody followed by species specific fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody and DAPI nuclear counterstain to highlight cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), cleared and imaged using a combination of confocal and two photon microscopy. In the resulting 3D tilescan image, bone was visualized through second harmonic generation (SHG) signal of collagen (represented in grayscale), and AML cells, CTLs and megakaryocytes (MKs) were identifiable through their membrane expression of tomato fluorescent protein (red), antì-CD8 immunostaining (green), and characteristic morphology (large size, multilobate nucleus) and autofluorescence (pale green/red signal), respectively. Moreover, all nuclei were visible thanks to DAPI counterstain (blue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">An initial inspection of the image confirmed the uneven distribution of AML cells, whereby the BM region near the growth plate was very heavily infiltrated by AML cells, tightly packed together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A i</xref>), whereas the remaining tissue displayed varying levels of local AML infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A ii and iii</xref>). However, it was evident that it would be a challenge to quantify local differences in the density of T cells and megakaryocytes, as well as subtle differences in AML cell density, and, even more, to identify whether the density of each cell type may be a function of the density of one or both the other cell types. Such work is important to understand the cellular dynamics taking place in BM tissue as AML cells invade it, and relies on the precise identification and annotation of all the cell types of interest.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Data extraction using deep convolutional neural network</title><p id="P12">The image we generated is 15 GBs large in size and is the result of the juxtaposition of 15,776 partially overlapping 2D images acquired as adjacent z stacks, precisely 32 2D tiles of 493 512x512 pixel tiles, with a z dimension step size of 5 μm. Traditional image analysis software would open the entire image in order to process it and are not equipped to process 3D images of this size. We therefore selected a convoluted neural network model that could be trained using small 2D image samples randomly selected from the overall tilescan, would operate on image portions and generate output data of much smaller size and therefore easy to handle computationally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. We manually annotated a total of 18,240 cell examples, of which 14,655 were AML cells, 3,056 CTLs and 529 MKs. 70% of these annotations were used for training, 20% for validation and 10% for testing. After 200 iterations (epochs), we identified the optimally trained network as the one generated after 60 epochs. This fully trained network annotated 506,611 cells across all 2D slices using bounding boxes that could be easily inspected by eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Next, to measure the model’s accuracy, we manually classified all test images according to whether they represented areas of high, moderate or low AML infiltration (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1Ai, ii and iii</xref>, respectively) and we compared our manual annotation with the results of the model to generate precision/recall curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Areas where AML cells were tightly packed together were the ones where the model performed worst in identifying AML cells themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, top left panel), even though it still returned high numbers of AML cells (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, top panel). In these same areas CTLs and MKs were identified efficiently by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), however there were too few of them to generate meaningful precision/recall curves. In areas of intermediate and low AML infiltration the neural network achieved a mean AUC 0.8942 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), with AML cells, CTLs and MKs all accurately identified consistently (see respective AUCs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> panels). In conclusion, the model was able to identify cells in 2D images based on a combination of fluorescent signals and morphology features.</p><p id="P13">To generate maps of the 3D locations of cells across the entire dataset, neighboring boxes from across different image layers were linked together using a 3D aggregation algorithm we designed. This was an important simplification of the workflow because these 3D maps could be generated without the need for 3D labelled images, however the resulting 3D boxes could be viewed in samples of the original image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 2A-C</xref>). To test the accuracy of this step, we randomly selected 3 separate 210x210x50 μm 3D regions with high, medium and low AML infiltration within the overall image, manually annotated AML cells, CTLs and MKs in 3D, and compared manual and predicted annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Importantly, we didn’t have a large deviation from the diagonal when we plotted the results of the two methods, with only a slight underestimate of cell counts by the model compared to manual classification found at higher cell densities. Using the automated approach, we identified 197,726 AML cells, 8,225 CTLs and 2,160 MKs, which would be infeasible manually. In addition to their number, their specific localization was extracted by this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E-G</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Visualization of all identified cells highlighted how 2D slices of BM tissue can lead to an underestimate of the prevalence of AML cells even in areas that appear to be little infiltrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Consistent with previous reports of healthy hematopoietic cells being excluded from highly infiltrated areas of BM tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, the area near the growth plate appeared devoid of CTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>), however MKs seemed to present a different distribution pattern from that of CTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>), highlighting the need for a dedicated pipeline of spatial analysis that would allow better understand the spatial organization of each cell type and the spatial relationships between cell types.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Spatial heterogeneity and automated identification of areas of high cellular density</title><p id="P15">To visualize and analyze the spatial distribution and relationships between AML cells, CTLs and MKs, space was discretized into non-overlapping, adjacent cubes that cover the entire 3D area, and are the units analyzed using spatial statistics. The latter were first used to quantify heterogeneities in the distribution of cell types and, next, to explore cells’ interdependencies. To assess spatial heterogeneity we used two steps: first, we used Moran’s I (also known as spatial autocorrelation function) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, to assess the similarity of adjacent cubes; next, we linked similar cubes to outline areas of high cellular density using DBSCAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The first step was to identify the ideal cube size to work with. For meaningful visualization, the discretization needs to be such that some aggregation of cell counts occurs, but a few cells of the same type are found in each cube. A cube size of 45 μm<sup>3</sup> was selected to be sufficiently fine that geographic resolution was retained, but sufficiently coarse that the resulting data could still be computationally assessed without undue burden. The number of cells of each type in each cube was recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel), and with that discretization we could visualize the density of AML cells, CTLs and MKs as a function of their position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). This information was the basis to quantify spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of each cell type and of combinations of cell types.</p><p id="P17">To quantitatively assess the homogeneity of each cell type’s spatial distribution, we calculated Moran’s I. To calculate Moran’s I, one must consider the similarity between each spatial unit (one of the cubes) and its neighbors. Neighbors can be defined in several ways and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, middle panel, illustrates our definition of neighborhood, which is well-suited for the following steps of our spatial statistics pipeline. Briefly, when cubes had one edge in common, they were considered to be neighbors, resulting in each cube being the central one of a neighborhood of seven neighboring cubes where six have a face in common with the central one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, middle panel). Moran’s I is a measurement of the overall homogeneity of cell numbers in cubes across the tissue with reference to their neighbors. If Moran’s I is positive, cells tend to be aggregated in common areas. If Moran’s I is close to zero, cells are distributed randomly in space. When its value is less than zero, cells are more homogeneously dispersed than one would expect from a random process. Moran’s I for the AML cells was 0.81, quantitatively substantiating the observation that AML cells were concentrated in relatively few areas. Moran’s I for CTLs was 0.34, suggesting some positive spatial clustering but less than found for AML cells. Moran’s I of 0.05 for MGKs indicated these cells had a weak geographical dependency, resembling that of random locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P18">While Moran’s I can indicate that cells of a given type are overall co-located or scattered throughout the tissue, a distinct methodology is needed to identify tissue regions where those cells are at high density. To do this, we used the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. If the average number of cells in the cubes of a 7 cubes neighborhood was greater than the third quartile value for that population in all cubes across the sample, whereby only a quarter of cubes have more cells than this value, the neighborhood was considered dense. This calculation would be repeated by shifting the neighborhood center from one cube to one adjacent one, until all possible neighborhoods would be considered. As a result, dense neighborhoods were agglomerated to highlight contiguous areas spanning cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel).</p><p id="P19">For the AML data, DBSCAN identified 18 distinct high-density areas, or clusters. The largest 14 are marked in decreasing order from largest to smallest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). The largest cluster accounted for 61.8% of all AML cells in the image, and the following two largest for 5.9%, and 2.0% of all AML cells. The two largest clusters of AML cells, 1 and 2, were proximal to the growth plate, on either of its two sides. Cluster 3 was more distal, and the overall the distal region of BM contained much smaller clusters. Interestingly, larger clusters were located adjacent to the endosteum, while centrally located clusters tended to be smaller. For CTLs and MKs, respectively, approximately 70% and 90% of cubes recorded a zero cell-count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel), and, consequently, DBSCAN returns no clustered areas. This was consistent with these cells being less abundant than AML cells, generally not clustered and returning Moran’s I values that were positive but close to zero.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Spatial dependencies between cell types</title><p id="P20">The key to understanding the principles regulating multicellular tissues is based on understanding how diverse cell types interact with each other to enable tissue function. It is therefore important to explore whether local heterogeneities in the distribution of specific cell types depend on those of other cell types, and to identify and map the resulting different cellular neighborhoods. To do this, we first asked whether, besides low Moran’s I and lack of clustering, CTLs and MKs localization could be described as a function of AML cell presence and/or density. To investigate this, we used permutation tests and logistic regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">For CTLs, visual inspection of the image indicated that their density was uneven throughout the tissue, and there were very few CTLs in the area containing the largest AML cluster, cluster n.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B-C</xref>). To statistically assess if the distribution of CTL counts was influenced by any areas of high AML density, permutation tests were used to challenge the null hypothesis that the mean number of CTLs within each cube is independent of whether the cube is within an AML cluster or adjacent to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, left panel). The null hypothesis was rejected only for the AML cluster 1 area, highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>. The remaining 17 smaller AML clusters all failed to reject the null hypothesis. This analysis indicated that only the largest AML cells high density area influenced the mean number of CTLs per space unit. In other words, CTLs were generally missing where the largest AML cluster was located, but their density was not affected in the smaller areas with dense AML cells.</p><p id="P22">Spatial permutation tests were also performed to test the null hypothesis that the mean number of MKs in each cube is independent of whether the cube is within an AML cells high density area or adjacent to it. The results showed no evidence that MKs had a different distribution within versus around any AML dense area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, visual inspection of the image highlighted how the largest dense AML area could be further split into two sub-regions based on higher and lower density of MKs, indicating that further spatial statistical tests and visualization tools were needed.</p><p id="P23">To measure the likelihood of finding CTLs, MKs, or both cell types in dense AML areas compared to non-dense AML areas, we used logistic regression, a statistical model that reports on the likelihood of an event to occur or not given a certain binary condition, in our case the presence of CTLs, MKs or both inside vs. outside dense AML areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, right panel). The likelihood of finding cubes with CTLs or both CTLs and MKs inside dense AML areas was 80% lower than that of finding such types of cubes outside of dense AML areas (both p values &lt;2e-16). The likelihood of finding cubes with MKs but not T cells inside dense AML areas was lower, but not significantly, than outside of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). For MKs, this latter result was driven by heterogeneity within dense AML area 1, where a sub-area was present that was devoid of MK cells, while a large proportion of this area still contained MKs, and MKs there appeared to be denser than in the rest of the image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, right panel, black and blue arrows, respectively).</p><p id="P24">To highlight how AML density alone would not be sufficient to determine whether MK density would be affected, we developed a visualization tool whereby we binned all cubes based on their quartile AML density values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>. Next, we further classified each cube according to whether it contained T cells and/or MK cells. This resulted in 16 possible cellular composition types based on AML density and presence/absence of CTLs and MKs. While all 16 possible neighborhoods existed, some were more abundant than others, with areas containing both CTLs and MKs being rarest, independently of AML density quartile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). Spatial visualization of the neighborhoods highlighted how outside of dense AML area 1 various types of neighborhoods could be found adjacent to each other, without a specific pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). The dense AML area 1 was split in two regions based on MK presence. Even though the MK-rich area was closer to the distal part of the bone, and the area closest to the growth plate was generally devoid of MKs, the MK-rich and -devoid areas were not simply adjacent, because MK-containing areas were most often surrounded by MK-depleted areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). Both inside and outside AML dense area 1 MK-rich and CTL-rich areas were irregularly shaped, with more jagged contours than AML dense areas, indicating that while regional variations in tissue composition could be identified, these regions had irregular and intertwined shapes.</p><p id="P25">In conclusion, our pipeline adapts spatial statistics to a 3D framework to enable the quantitative evaluation of clustering, the automatic identification of regions of high density of specific cell types, and the statistical assessment of dependencies between cell types to map unique cellular neighborhoods characterized by unique combinations of densities of multiple cell types. It allowed to identify that only very large BM areas densely infiltrated by AML cells are devoid of CTLs, and that these areas can be further subdivided according to the density of MKs. Moreover, the transition between area types tends to be gradual, with areas exhibiting rough, jagged borders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">In this study we have described a novel, efficient and effective pipeline, PACESS, for extracting meaning and drawing inferences from large 3D BM tissue images. These images are relatively affordable to generate, but very challenging to analyze efficiently because of their size and complexity. It has been especially challenging to understand and quantitatively evaluate the relative spatial organization of cell types. This type of analyses, however, holds the promise to allow a much deeper understanding of the cellular principles regulating hematopoiesis, with important implications for the development of better therapeutic and preventative strategies for hematological disorders.</p><p id="P27">In terms of tissue preparation for image acquisition, the choice of clearing and mounting solutions was critical to maximize tissue integrity including over time. While other published solutions led to tissue darkening and loss of fluorescent signal within a few days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, our samples could be re-imaged multiple times including weeks apart. Fixation was the other critical parameter. Here a short, two hours only, fixation step proved to be the optimal solution to facilitate tissue cuffing while achieving the highest signal to noise ratio.</p><p id="P28">The image presented here is a 3D tìlescan composite of 15,776 images, resulting in a &gt;4x10<sup>9</sup> pixels and 15 Gb large file, and could not be opened using gold standard open access image analysis software such as ImageJ. Our image analysis workflow builds on established techniques from machine learning and geospatial statistics and has several advantages over current approaches. From the perspective of data-extractìon, the workflow is reliable and scalable, and importantly solves the challenge of efficiently labelling cell types in 3D by only necessitating labelling in 2D followed by automated methods to generate 3D understanding. The spatial statistics workflow allows identifying areas where any cell type of interest is denser than average and highlights tissue regions with unique cellular composition.</p><p id="P29">While AI-based extraction methods have been applied in other contexts, murine bone marrow tissue provides distinct challenges because hematopoietic cell types are tightly packed together in an amorphous structure where no clear patterns have been identified. For 2D extraction, the YOLO neural network model was ideal because it proved to be highly effective while minimizing time (approximately 40 minutes for images of similar size to the one presented here) and computational power required. As images are provided to the model in their raw form, avoiding extensive image processing allows further time savings. While we maximized the efficiency of data-extractìon by running the model on a high-performance computing cluster, we were able to run the model on cloud-based computing resources, including free ones, such as Google co-lab, without the need for additional computational resources. These characteristics provide the opportunity to analyze both larger samples, images acquired at higher resolution, and images containing a higher number of cell types.</p><p id="P30">A known drawback of AI-based approaches is the need to generate manually annotated training data. Important for the classification of hematopoietic cells, the model was robust in identifying cells with irregular/variable morphology such as megakaryocytes, and was reliable in cases where a cell type was very abundant, resulting in highly compacted, adjacent cells, such as AML cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. While we demonstrate the practical application of the model to three cell types, 2D neural networks such as YOLO are scalable, and can be further trained, shared and updated to include further cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, while our method to create 3D meaning is efficient regardless of the number of cell types. The effort required to train and optimize a neural network is however outweighed by the high returns achieved when applying the network to several images. Moreover, pre-trained models can be updated with less extensive datasets through a process called transfer learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Such ‘pre-trained’ models become akin to the availability of deposited gene signatures greatly increasing the accessibility and productivity of bioinformatics analyses of genomics data. The dataset presented here is already a pretrained model and can constitute the starting point for identifying other cell types in the BM but also in virtually any tissue. Of note, as 3D image analysis software is still unwieldy, grouping of the neural network 2D results into 3D predictions is a simple solution to the widespread challenge of annotating and analyzing 3D datasets.</p><p id="P31">Another important solution was utilized to build our pipeline of spatial statistics analysis. In previous studies, researchers have challenged the null hypothesis that the distribution of each individual cell population is uniform-at-random throughout the space through the use of a simulation method called random dots. In a spatial analysis context, however, the null hypothesis must be conditioned to take values only within the observable, imaged, space. Although the random dots method is intuitive, there is no guarantee that the null hypothesis is physiologically viable as we typically cannot observe all features within the tissue with current technology, which introduces a risk of bias in the findings by increasing the likelihood of rejection. We circumvent this shortcoming in our spatial statistical pipeline, avoiding the use of simulated data, and instead address the question of how cells within the bone marrow are related by other approaches, including direct comparisons between multiple different cell populations.</p><p id="P32">Our spatial statistics approach provides a reproducible method for quantifying properties of individual cell types, as well as interactions between them. Simple measures evaluate the extent of spatial clustering of individual cell types, while geographically aware clustering methods then identify regions of high density. Permutation tests provide statistical measures for assessing the relatedness of cell densities in reasons of interest, and logistic regression quantifies the extent to which the relative abundance of cell types are contingent on others. Importantly, while we demonstrate our spatial analysis workflow with three cell types, this could be scalable to include any number of cell types.</p><p id="P33">While interest in leukaemia and T cells interactions has been growing, stemming from immunotherapy developments, megakaryocytes are not normally studied together with the other two cell types, and our image analysis highlighted some unexpected spatial relationships between the three. Consistent with previous reports of AML cells growing in localized patches within the bone marrow tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, several clusters of AML cells were identified. All larger clusters were adjacent to endosteum, again consistent with previous reports that the AML model we analyzed tends to grow from endosteal regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The fact that no cell type returned a negative Moran’s I value is consistent with the current working hypothesis that hematopoietic cells are randomly distributed across BM space, with no ordered topology. Interestingly, while several reports describe severe loss of all hematopoietic cell types as a consequence of AML growth, our analysis highlighted that heavily infiltrated AML areas may not be homogeneous, as the BM area containing the largest AML cells cluster we observed could be split into two subregions, one devoid of both CTLs and MKs, the other devoid of CTLs only. This observation opens the questions whether there may be major differences in the rate of loss of different healthy hematopoietic cell types in the BM as AML grows, and whether areas more greatly devoid of healthy cells represent areas where AML cells have been present for longer.</p><p id="P34">In summary, the ultimate goal of quantitative 3D imaging is to informatively summarize, in a numerical form, the vast amount of spatial and cellular information present within an image. This is particularly useful for seffings where the principles regulating cell distribution are not clear, such as in BM tissue. The work presented here provides a framework for the data extraction and analysis of complex 3D BM tissue images. Importantly, this pipeline enables analysis of images which would have proved too challenging to standard methodologies because of their size or complexity. The PACESS analytical workflow combines cell labelling and spatial statistical analysis to aid in the interpretation of spatial cellular data, which can provide a comprehensive insight of the relationships which exist within cell types in the BM. It promises to uncover the principles regulating the cellular organization of the cells responsible for the lifelong production of blood cells and their deregulation when hematological disease occurs.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Experimental Model</title><sec id="S10"><title>Mice</title><p id="P35">All animal work was in accordance with the animal ethics committee (AWERB) at Imperial College London, UK and UK Home Office regulation (ASPA, 1986).

Each cube was changed into a dummy variable as the response variable based on whether it was in the cluster or not. The explanatory variables were binary variables, also determined by the presence or absence of the cell type. The generalized linear model was performed by ‘glm’ function in R (version 4.4.0).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figure</label><media xlink:href="EMS198704-supplement-Supplemental_Figure.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d29aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank staff of the core facilities at Imperial college London (CBS facility, FILM) and the Crick Institute (BRF facility) for their valuable help.

id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Motivation</title></caption><p>The organization of diverse hematopoietic cells within bone marrow tissue remains unclear. Recently developed tissue clearing methods enable the generation of large, 3D, single cell resolution microscopy images datasets, but the bottleneck in their analysis lies in both the identification and classification of cells, and in statistical analyses to probe their spatial relationships. We present a workflow (PACESS) that takes advantage of a convoluted neural network to identify and classify cells in 2D coupled with an automated method that extrapolates to 3D, followed by a combination of spatial statistics to classify tissue regions based on each cell type’s density, and logistic regression to test whether the relative abundance of cell types may be explained by reciprocal dependencies. Finally, we provide a combined measurement of the abundance of all cell types in a 3D map, highlighting regional variations found within the tissue.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>2D data extraction using deep neural network</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Tile scan of a single z position (z=27 out of 32) of a clarified 250μm thick section of tibia from AML infiltrated mouse.

Discretisation of space allows recording cell densities. Moran’s I measures the spatial autocorrelation of each cell type. In the data, the neighbours of a cube (red) are those immediately adjacent (yellow). Moran’s I uses that local geographic information to calculate a global measure of spatial autocorrelation. DBSCAN is used to identify areas of high cellular density. The centre cube (red) and its neighbours (yellow) are considered a local high-density region if, taken together, they contain more cells than 7 (corresponding to the number of cubes) times the third percentile per cube for that population. Adjacent local high-density regions are grouped to form a contiguous cluster. <bold>(B)</bold> Quantitative 3D visualization displays the number of AML cells, CTLs and MKs at each location, with colour scales indicating abundance. Moran’s I values are reported for each cell type. <bold>(C)</bold> 3D projection visualization shows AML clusters identified by DBSCAN.
