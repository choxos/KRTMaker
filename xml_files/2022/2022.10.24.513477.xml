Given the elevated ATP levels seen in PDAC, the purinergic axis represents an attractive therapeutic target. Mediated in part by highly druggable extracellular proteins, it plays essential roles in fibrosis, inflammation response and immune function. We have analysed the PDAC purinome using publicly available databases to discern which members may impact patient survival. We identified <italic>P2RY2</italic> to be the purinergic gene with the strongest association to hypoxia, the highest cancer cell specific expression and the strongest impact on overall survival. Invasion assays using a 3D spheroid model revealed P2Y<sub>2</sub> to be critical in facilitating invasion driven by extracellular ATP. Using genetic modification or pharmacological strategies we identify the mechanism of this ATP-driven invasion to require direct protein-protein interactions between P2Y<sub>2</sub> and αV integrins. Using DNA-PAINT super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we found that P2Y<sub>2</sub> regulates the amount and distribution of integrin αV in the plasma membrane. This work highlights a novel GPCR-integrin interaction in cancer invasion and its potential for therapeutic targeting.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which accounts for 90% of diagnosed pancreatic cancer cases, has the lowest survival rate of all common solid malignancies. Surgery is the only potentially curative treatment, but unfortunately more than 80% of patients present with unresectable tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kocher, 2022</xref>). Consequently, most patients survive less than 6 months after diagnosis, resulting in a 5-year survival rate of less than 5% when accounting for all disease stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bengtsson, Andersson and Ansari, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kocher, 2022</xref>). Despite continued efforts, this statistic has improved minimally in the past 50 years. Due to increasing incidence, late detection and lack of effective therapies, pancreatic cancer is predicted to be the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths by 2040 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Rahib <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Failure to improve clinical management significantly is mainly a result of chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Neuzillet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), thus it is of vital importance to find new therapeutics that can improve patient survival. PDAC is characterised by its desmoplastic stroma, with dense fibrosis leading to impaired vascularisation and high levels of hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Koong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Di Maggio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Lack of oxygen leads to cellular stress and death, resulting in the release of purines such as ATP and adenosine into the tumour microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Forrester and Williams, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Pellegatti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). PDAC has 200-fold more extracellular ATP than normal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), suggesting that purinergic signalling could represent an effective therapeutic target against PDAC.</p><p id="P5">The proteins underpinning purinergic signalling (the purinome), comprise several highly druggable membrane proteins involved in the regulation of extracellular purines, mainly ATP and adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Burnstock and Novak, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boison and Yegutkin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). Extracellular ATP is known to promote inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kurashima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Ko <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) and cell movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Martinez-Ramirez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Contrastingly, adenosine is anti-inflammatory and promotes immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). There are ongoing clinical trials in several cancers, including PDAC, for drugs targeting the ectonucleotidase CD73 (NCT03454451, NCT03454451) and adenosine receptor 2A (NCT03454451) in combination with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors and/or chemotherapy. However, a Phase II multi-cancer study evaluating an anti-CD73 and anti-PD-L1 combination was withdrawn due to minimal overall clinical activity (NCT04262388). This highlights the fact that further mechanistic understanding of purinergic signalling in PDAC is required to exploit its full therapeutic potential.</p><p id="P6">Here we combine bioinformatic, genetic and drug-based approaches to identify a novel mechanism mediating ATP-driven invasion, uncovering a new therapeutic target in PDAC. Beginning with an in-depth <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of the purinome of PDAC, using publicly available patient and cell line databases, we build on bioinformatic data associating the purinergic receptor P2Y<sub>2</sub> with PDAC. After validating expression of P2Y<sub>2</sub> in human PDAC cancers, we focused on identifying the function of the receptor in cancer cells. <italic>In vitro</italic> data underlined the importance of P2Y<sub>2</sub> as a strong invasive driver, using a 3D physio-mimetic model of invasion. Finally, using a super-resolution imaging technique, DNA-PAINT, we characterise the behaviour of P2Y<sub>2</sub> in the membrane at the single protein level, demonstrating the nanoscale distribution and interaction of this receptor with RGD-binding integrins in promoting pancreatic cancer invasion.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The PDAC purinome associates with patient survival, hypoxia score and cell phenotype</title><p id="P7">The purinome encompasses 23 surface proteins, including pannexin 1, P2X ion channels, ectonucleotidases, and the P2Y and adenosine GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Di Virgilio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Interrogating public databases, we determined which purinergic signalling genes significantly impact pancreatic cancer survival. First, we examined the pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) database from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n=177 patients) analysing overall survival hazard ratios based on purinergic signalling gene expression (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Expression of five purinergic genes correlated with decreased patient survival, with high <italic>P2RY2</italic> expression being associated with the highest hazard ratio (2.99, 95%, CI: 1.69 - 5.31, log-rank <italic>p</italic> = 8.5x10<sup>-5</sup>). We then examined the mutational profile and mRNA expression level of purinergic genes in patients. Using cBioPortal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), we generated OncoPrints of purinergic signalling genes from PAAD TCGA samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig. 1A</xref>), observing few genetic alterations in 0-3% of tumours and a heterogeneous percentage of tumours with high mRNA expression (z-score &gt; 1) for each purinergic gene.</p><p id="P8">Since purinergic signalling has been strongly associated with hypoxia, the Winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Winter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), Ragnum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Ragnum <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) and Buffa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Buffa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) hypoxia scores were used to examine the correlation between the expression of purinergic genes and HIF-1α in the PAAD TCGA database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig. 1B</xref>). Samples were divided into low (n=88) or high (n=89) hypoxia score, using the median hypoxia score to perform a differential expression analysis. CD73 (<italic>NT5E</italic>), adenosine A2B receptor (<italic>ADORA2B</italic>) and P2Y<sub>2</sub> (<italic>P2RY2</italic>) mRNA expression associated strongly with the high hypoxia score group for all three hypoxia scores (log<sub>2</sub> ratio &gt;0.5, FDR &lt;0.001). P2Y<sub>2</sub> had the highest log<sub>2</sub> ratio in all hypoxia signatures compared to other purinergic genes. With a more extensive gene signature, the Winter hypoxia score (99 genes) allowed for a more comprehensive relative hypoxia ranking of tumour samples, compared to Ragnum (32 genes) and Buffa (52 genes) signatures. Hence, we used cBioPortal to generate a transcriptomic heatmap of purinergic genes, ranked using the Winter hypoxia score and overlaid with overall survival data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>). We observed a direct correlation between Winter hypoxia score and decreased overall survival for high hypoxia score-related purinergic genes.</p><p id="P9">We hypothesised that genes related to high hypoxia scores would be expressed preferentially in the tumour core. Mining published RNA-seq data from 60 paired PDAC samples of stroma and tumour microdissections (GSE93326) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Maurer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) and performing differential expression analysis, we observed that most genes related to high Winter hypoxia scores (<italic>P2RY2</italic>, <italic>ADORA2B</italic> and <italic>NT5E</italic>) were expressed in the tumour epithelial tissue (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), except for <italic>PANX1</italic>, encoding for pannexin 1, which is involved in cellular ATP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bao, Locovei and Dahl, 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To elucidate the cell type-specific purinergic expression landscape, we used published data from TCGA PAAD compartment deconvolution, using DECODER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) to plot purinergic gene weights for each cell type compartment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The findings recapitulated the cell specificity data obtained from tumour microdissection analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Maurer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Expression of purinergic genes in cancer cells was confirmed by plotting Z-scores of mRNA expression of PDAC cell lines from the cancer cell line encyclopaedia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ghandi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) (CCLE; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup.

Moreover, expression of purinergic genes in normal tissue from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database compared to cancer tissue (PAAD TCGA) also mimicked the results found with DECODER (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig. 1D</xref>). <italic>P2RY2</italic>, encoding P2Y<sub>2</sub> - a GPCR activated by ATP and UTP, was shown to be the purinergic gene most highly associated with cancer cell-specific expression in all our independent analyses (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup.

The top four enriched gene sets from the Gene Ontology ‘Molecular function’ functional database were associated with cell adhesion molecule binding, the cytoskeleton, protease binding and extracellular matrix binding (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). To initially evaluate the validity of the GSEA results <italic>in vitro</italic>, we used the PDAC cell line AsPC-1, transduced with Lifeact, which fluorescently labels filamentous actin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Riedl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), and monitored cell morphology using the Incucyte live-cell analysis system.

PDAC cell lines were combined in a ratio of 1:2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kadaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), using an immortalised stellate cell line, PS-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Froeling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) to form spheres (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), recapitulating the ratios of the two biggest cellular components in PDAC. Stellate cells also aid in sphere formation and cancer cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Murray <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). Spheres were embedded in a Collagen type I and Matrigel mix and cultured for 48 hours until imaging and fixing (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Extracellular ATP concentration in tumours is in the hundred micromolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Pellegatti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).

To determine whether integrin association was necessary for ATP-driven invasion, we treated spheres with 10 μM cyclic RGDfV peptide (cRGDfV), which binds predominantly to αVβ3 to block integrin binding to RGD motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kapp <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), such as that in P2Y<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ibuka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). cRGDfV treatment reduced ATP-driven motility significantly, both in 3D spheroid invasion assays (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B, C</xref>) and in 2D Incucyte migration assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup.

To ensure that this behaviour was not restricted to AsPC-1 cells, experiments were corroborated in the BxPC-3 cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup.

P2Y<sub>2</sub> involvement in this phenomenon was confirmed by generating a P2Y<sub>2</sub> CRISPR-Cas9 AsPC-1 cell line (P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>CRISPR</sup>), which displayed a significant decrease in invasion compared to a control guide RNA CRISPR cell line (CTR<sup>CRISPR</sup>) in both ATP-treated (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0005) and non-treated (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) conditions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F, E</xref>). These findings demonstrate that P2Y<sub>2</sub> is essential for ATP-driven cancer cell invasion.</p><p id="P16">To determine the importance of the RGD motif of P2Y<sub>2</sub> in ATP-driven invasion, we obtained a mutant P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>D97E</sup> construct, where the RGD motif was replaced by RGE (P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup>), which has less affinity for αV integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Erb <italic>et al.,</italic> 2001</xref>).

DNA-PAINT is a single-molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) method based on the transient binding between two short single-stranded DNAs - the ‘imager’ and ‘docking’ strands. The imager strand is fluorescently labelled and freely diffusing in solution, whilst the docking strand is chemically coupled to antibodies targeting the protein of interest. For DNA-PAINT imaging of P2Y<sub>2</sub> and integrin aV, proteins were labelled with primary antibodies chemically coupled to orthogonal docking sequences featuring a repetitive (ACC)n or (TCC)n motif, respectively (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The benefit of such sequences is to increase the frequency of binding events, which in turn allows the use of relatively low imager strand concentrations without compromising overall imaging times, whilst achieving high signal-to-noise ratio and single-molecule localisation precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Strauss and Jungmann, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The repetitive binding of imager and docking DNA strands in DNA-PAINT causes the same protein to be detected multiple times with nearly identical coordinates, originating a cluster of single molecule localisation around the true position of the protein. In contrast to other SMLM approaches, it is possible to take advantage of the DNA-binding kinetics to stoichiometrically calculate the number of proteins detected in each cluster of single molecule localisations, via an approach known as qPAINT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Schnitzbauer <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). As exemplified in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> (and detailed in the methods section), qPAINT relies on the first order binding kinetics between individual imager and docking strands to determine the number copies of a protein that reside within a cluster of single-molecule localisations. The qPAINT index histograms obtained from P2Y<sub>2</sub> and αV DNA-PAINT data sets were fitted with a multi-peak Gaussian function, identifying peaks located at multiples of a qPAINT index value of <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,1</sub> 0.011 Hz and 0.009 for the P2Y<sub>2</sub> and αV docking-imager pairs, respectively (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These values were thus used to quantify the exact number of P2Y<sub>2</sub> and αV proteins in all the clusters of single-molecule localisation in the DNA-PAINT data sets. By combining qPAINT with spatial statistics, we recovered a good estimation of the ground truth position of all the proteins in the DNA-PAINT data and quantified protein clustering.</p><p id="P19">We have previously analysed GPCR oligomerisation quantitively using DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy of P2Y<sub>2</sub> in AsPC-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Joseph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>), where we observed a decrease in P2Y<sub>2</sub> oligomerisation upon AR-C treatment.

We imaged AsPC-1 P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>CRISPR</sup> cells transfected with P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> or P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup> in the absence or presence of 100 μM ATP for 1 hour (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). We observed a 42% decrease in the median density of P2Y<sub>2</sub> proteins at the membrane when P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> cells were treated with ATP, compared to control (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). In contrast, although a slight decrease in the density of P2Y<sub>2</sub> proteins on P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE </sup>cells was observed following ATP treatment, it did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.1570). The density of P2Y<sub>2</sub> proteins and protein clusters in both P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> and P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE </sup>controls were equivalent (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E, F</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.9999), indicating similar expression of the receptor at the surface in both control conditions. Interestingly, the density of P2Y<sub>2</sub> clusters decreased significantly in both conditions when treating with ATP (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>; 43% decrease, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 for P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> and 48% decrease, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002 for P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup>). We repeated these studies with AsPC-1 cells treated with ATP +/- cRGDfV, only observing a reduction of P2Y<sub>2</sub> at the membrane with ATP alone (68% decrease, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.0001), while co-treatment with cRGDfV prevented this change (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.9999; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup.

These findings highlight that the RGD motif is required for αV integrin to control P2Y<sub>2</sub> levels at the membrane.</p><p id="P20">Moreover, we observed an increase in the density of αV molecules and αV molecules at the membrane when stimulating P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> with ATP (165 αV molecules/ROI, IQR = 162.75; 6.5 αV clusters/ROI, IQR = 8.75) compared to P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> without stimulation (58 αV molecules/ROI, IQR = 41; 2.5 αV clusters/ROI, IQR = 2; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0003; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G, H</xref>). In absence of stimulation, P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup> transfected cells exhibited more αV molecules and clusters at the membrane (182 αV molecules/ROI, IQR = 262.75; 9 αV clusters/ROI IQR = 14) compared to P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> cells (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0003, <italic>p</italic>=0.0024, respectively). However, treating P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup> cells with ATP did not result in significant changes in αV molecules and clusters (112.5 αV molecules/ROI, IQR = 78.75; 3 clusters/ROI, IQR = 3). When the number of clusters was normalised with the number of αV molecules, to obtain the percentage of αV in clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig. 4A</xref>), there was no significant difference between conditions (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.9999), indicating that the increase in the number of αV clusters was due to an increase in the number of αV proteins at the membrane. Taken together, these data indicate an RGD motif-dependent function of activated P2Y<sub>2</sub> in localising integrin αV to the membrane.</p><p id="P21">By analysing nearest neighbour distance (NND) between proteins, we detected a higher percentage of integrin αV proteins in &lt;20 nm proximity to P2Y<sub>2</sub> in P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> cells following ATP stimulation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>; 62 % increase, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup> cells stimulated with ATP showed a 71% decrease (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) in αV molecules in close proximity to P2Y<sub>2</sub> in comparison to unstimulated cells. Analysing the percentage of αV proteins with NND in the range of 20-100 nm, we saw a similar pattern (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). ATP-stimulated P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> and unstimulated P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup> cells showed an increased percentage of αV proteins spaced at this range compared to untreated P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> cells (136% increase with <italic>p</italic> = 0.0024 and 177% increase with <italic>p</italic> = 0.0004). No significant changes were observed in NND of &lt;20 nm between αV proteins in any of the conditions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>), and the same was true for P2Y<sub>2</sub> with respect to other P2Y<sub>2</sub> proteins (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref>). In summary, our SMLM studies demonstrate a reciprocal interaction between αV integrin and P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors, where P2Y<sub>2</sub> can alter integrin localisation to the plasma membrane while αV integrins influence activated P2Y<sub>2</sub> internalisation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">Improved biological mechanistic understanding of PDAC is vital to identify effective therapeutic approaches to improve patient survival. Purinergic signalling includes many druggable targets that have been related to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Synnestvedt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Fong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>), and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), but have been relatively underexplored in PDAC. In this study, we used publicly available databases to identify purinergic signalling genes that could be promising targets for PDAC, determining P2Y<sub>2</sub> as a driver of pancreatic cancer cell invasion. Extracellular ATP increased invasion in a 3D spheroid model of PDAC, which was blocked by targeting P2Y<sub>2</sub> genetically and pharmacologically. Mechanistically, we identified that the RGD motif in the first extracellular loop of P2Y<sub>2</sub> is required for ATP-driven cancer invasion. Importantly, quantitative DNA-PAINT super-resolution fluorescence microscopy revealed a role of this RGD motif in orchestrating the number of P2Y<sub>2</sub> and αV integrin proteins at the plasma the membrane, upon ATP stimulation.</p><p id="P23">Purinergic signalling has been associated classically with hypoxia and immune function in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Di Virgilio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). While expression of most purinergic genes was associated predominantly with immune cells and low hypoxia scores (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, E</xref>), expression of genes correlated with worse survival and hypoxia (<italic>NT5E</italic>, <italic>ADORA2B</italic> and <italic>P2RY2</italic>) was associated with tumour cells. The role of CD73 in PDAC has been examined in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>) (NCT03454451, NCT03454451). In contrast, adenosine A2B receptor has not been well studied and this is the first report of its correlation with decreased overall survival in PDAC. From our analyses, P2Y<sub>2</sub> was associated with the worst patient overall survival, highest patient hypoxia scores and strongest correlation to cancer cell expression. These observations were supported by published immunohistochemical staining showing that P2Y<sub>2</sub> localised predominantly in cancer cells in human PDAC and that P2Y<sub>2</sub> activation led to HIF-1α expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>). Hence, we decided here to explore P2Y<sub>2</sub> in greater depth.</p><p id="P24">P2Y<sub>2</sub> has been associated with cancer cell growth and glycolysis in PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Ko <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). Surprisingly, our GSEA results in two different cohorts suggested a possible additional function in invasion. Increased glycolysis and cytoskeletal rearrangements have been linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>), and both events could occur downstream of P2Y<sub>2</sub> activation. P2Y<sub>2</sub> has been implicated in invasive phenotypes in prostate, breast and ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Jin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Martinez-Ramirez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Moreover, many genes sets associated with P2Y<sub>2</sub> expression were related to integrin signalling. The RGD motif in the first extracellular loop of P2Y<sub>2</sub> results in a direct interaction of P2Y<sub>2</sub> with RGD-binding integrins, particularly integrins αVβ3 and αVβ5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Erb <italic>et al.,</italic> 2001</xref>). This can exert phenotypic effects – for example, binding of P2Y<sub>2</sub> to integrins via its RGD motif is necessary for tubule formation in epithelial intestinal cell line 3D models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ibuka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). We focus here on the importance of the RGD motif of P2Y<sub>2</sub> in a cancer context. Treating 3D PDAC spheroids with ATP resulted in increased invasion (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), which was blocked by the selective P2Y<sub>2</sub> antagonist AR-C and by the selective αVβ3 cyclic RGD-mimetic peptide inhibitor cRGDfV. Likewise, spheres containing ASPC-1 P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>CRISPR</sup> or PANC-1 cells transfected with mutant P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup>, which decreases the affinity of P2Y<sub>2</sub> for integrins, did not show increased invasion upon ATP stimulation. Altogether, these results support P2Y<sub>2</sub> involvement in PDAC cell invasion and show the RGD motif is essential for this function. Despite efforts, there are currently no clinically efficacious P2Y<sub>2</sub> antagonists, with poor oral bioavailability and low selectivity being major issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Neumann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that P2Y<sub>2</sub> can also be targeted by blocking its interaction with RGD-binding integrins, due to its dependence on integrins for its pro-invasive function.</p><p id="P25">GPCR-integrin crosstalk is involved in many biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Teoh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Only one study has directly examined the spatial distribution of integrins and GPCRs, however this relied on IF analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Erb <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), where only changes in the micron scale will be perceived, hence losing information of the nanoscale distances and individual protein interactions. In this work, we present a method to image integrin and GPCR dynamics using the recent quantitative DNA-PAINT super-resolution fluorescence microscopy technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Schnitzbauer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), which enabled us to look at and quantify the organisation of P2Y<sub>2</sub> and integrin αV at the single protein level. We noted that upon ATP stimulation, the number of P2Y<sub>2</sub> proteins at the plasma membrane decreased significantly after one hour, implying receptor internalisation. This phenomenon has been observed, were staining of P2Y<sub>2</sub> at the membrane was reduced significantly after one hour of UTP stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Tulapurkar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Of note, cytoskeletal rearrangements, which we have also observed upon ATP stimulation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), were required for P2Y<sub>2</sub> clathrin-mediated internalisation and authors noted that P2Y<sub>2</sub> was most likely in a complex with integrins and extracellular matrix-binding proteins. Cells expressing RGE mutant P2Y<sub>2</sub> or treated with cRGDfV, did not show significant changes in P2Y<sub>2</sub> levels at the membrane upon ATP treatment. These results implicate the RGD motif in P2Y<sub>2</sub> in agonist-dependent receptor internalisation.</p><p id="P26">P2Y<sub>2</sub> affecting cell surface redistribution of αV integrin has been reported, with αV integrin clusters observed after 5 min stimulation with UTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chorna <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). We observed an increased number of αV integrin molecules and clusters one hour after ATP stimulation, although this increase in clusters was mainly due to the increase in total number of αV integrins at the membrane. The distance between αV integrin and P2Y<sub>2</sub> decreased (NND &lt; 20 nm) with ATP stimulation, indicating possible interaction. In contrast, with mutant P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup>, no significant changes in the number of P2Y<sub>2</sub> or αV integrin proteins at the membrane were observed when stimulating with ATP. In fact, the number of αV integrins at the surface increased compared to wild-type. The same phenomenon was observed when treating normal AsPC-1 cells with cRGDfV and ATP.

Firstly, 30 μL of 250 mM DDT was added to 13 μL of 1 mM thiolated DNA sequences 5′-Thiol-AAACCACCACCACCA-3′ (Docking 1), and 5-Thiol-TTTCCTCCTCCTCCT-3’ (Docking 2) (Eurofins). The reduction reaction occurred under shaking conditions for 2 hours. 30 min after the reduction of the thiol-DNA started, 175 μL of 0.8 mg/mL antibody solutions were incubated with 0.9 μL of 23.5 mM maleimide-PEG2-succinimidyl ester cross-linker solution (Sigma-Aldrich) on a shaker for 90 min at 4 °C in the dark. Prior DNA-antibody conjugation, both sets of reactions were purified using Microspin Illustra G-25 columns (GE Healthcare) and Zeba spin desalting columns (7K MWCO, Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively, to remove excess reactants. Next, coupling of anti-P2Y<sub>2</sub> with with DNA docking 1 and anti-αV with DNA Docking 2 was performed by mixing the respective flow-through of the columns and incubate them overnight, in the dark, at 4°C under shaking. Excess DNA was removed via Amicon spin filtration (100K, Merck) and antibody-DNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop One spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and adjusted to 10 μM with PBS. Likewise, spectrophotometric analysis was performed to quantify the DNA-antibody coupling ratio and found to be ~1.2 in average for both the oligo-coupled primary antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Cell fixation and immunofluorescence staining for DNA-PAINT imaging</title><p id="P41">Cells were seeded at 30,000 cells per channel on a six-channel glass bottomed microscopy chamber (μ-SlideVI<sup>0.5</sup>, Ibidi) pre-coated with rat tail collagen type I (Corning). The chamber was incubated at 37 °C for 8 hours before treatments. Cells were treated with 100 μM of ATP (or the equivalent volume of PBS as control) in medium for 1 hour and were fixed and permeabilised as described in the ‘Cell fixation and immunofluorescent staining’ section. Following permeabilisation, samples were treated with 50 mM ammonium chloride solution (Avantor) for 5–10 min to quench auto-fluorescence and cells were washed 3× in PBS. Blocking was completed via incubation with 5% BSA (Merck) solution for 1 hour followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with 1:100 dilutions of DNA labelled anti-P2Y<sub>2</sub>, and DNA labelled anti-αV antibody in blocking solution. The next day, samples were washed 3× in PBS and 150 nm gold nanoparticles (Sigma-Aldrich) were added for 15 min to act as fiducial markers for drift correction, excess of nanoparticles was removed by 3× washes with PBS.

Solutions were incubated for 1 h in the dark before use. Stock solutions of PCA, PCD and Trolox were prepared as follows: 40× PCA (protocatechuic acid) stock was made from 154 mg of PCA (Sigma-Aldrich) in 10 mL of Ultrapure Distilled water (Invitrogen) adjusted to pH 9.0 with NaOH (Avantor, Radnor Township, PA, USA). 100x PCD (protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase) solution was made by adding 2.2 mg of PCD (Sigma-Aldrich) to 3.4 mL of 50% glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich) with 50 mM KCl (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM EDTA (Invitrogen), and 100 mM Tris buffer (Avantor). 100x Trolox solution was made by dissolving 100 mg of Trolox (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.43 mL methanol (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.345 mL 1 M NaOH, and 3.2 mL of Ultrapure Distilled water (Invitrogen, Waltham).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Exchange-PAINT Imaging Experiments</title><p id="P43">Exchange DNA-PAINT imaging was performed on a custom built total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope based on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-2 microscope (Nikon Instruments) equipped with a 100× oil immersion TIRF objective (Apo TIRF, NA 1.49) and a Perfect Focus System. Samples were imaged under flat-top TIRF illumination with a 647 nm laser (Coherent OBIS LX, 120 mW), that was magnified with custom-built telescopes, before passing through a beam shaper device (piShaper 6_6_VIS, AdlOptica) to transform the Gaussian profile of the beam into a collimated flat-top profile. The beam was focused into the back focal plane of the microscope objective using a suitable lens (AC508-300-A-ML, Thorlabs), passed through a clean-up filter (FF01-390/482/563/640-25, Semrock) and coupled into the objective using a beam splitter (Di03-R405/488/561/635-t1-25×36, Semrock). Laser polarization was adjusted to circular after the objective. Fluorescence light was spectrally filtered with an emission filter (FF01-446/523/600/677-25, Semrock) and imaged on a sCMOS camera (ORCA-Flash4.0 V3 Digital, Hamamatsu) without further magnification, resulting in a final pixel size of 130 nm in the focal plane, after 2×2 binning. For fluid exchange each individual chamber of the ibidi μ-SlideVI<sup>0.5</sup> were fitted with elbow Leur connector male adaptors (Ibidi) and 0.5 mm silicon tubing (Ibidi). Each imaging acquisition step was performed by adding the corresponding imager strand buffer solution to the sample. Prior to imager exchange, the chamber was washed for 10 min with 1x PBS buffer with 500 mM NaCl. Before the next imager strand buffer solution was added, we monitored with the camera to ensure complete removal of the first imager strand. Sequential imaging and washing steps were repeated for every cell imaged. For each imaging step, 15,000 frames were acquired with 100 ms integration time and a laser power density at the sample of 0.5 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Super resolution DNA-PAINT image reconstruction</title><p id="P44">Both P2Y<sub>2</sub> and αV Images were processed and reconstructed using the Picasso (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Schnitzbauer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) software (Version 0.3.3). The Picasso ‘Localize’ module was used to identify and localise the x,y molecular coordinates of single molecule events from the raw fluorescent DNA-PAINT images. Drift correction and multi-colour data alignment was performed via the Picasso ‘Render’ module, using a combination of fiducial markers and multiple rounds of image sub-stack cross correlation analysis. Localisations with uncertainties greater than 13 nm were removed and no merging was performed for molecules re-appearing in subsequent frames. Super-resolution image rendering was performed by plotting each localization as a Gaussian function with standard deviation equal to its localization precision.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Protein quantification via qPAINT analysis</title><p id="P45">To convert the list of <italic>x,y</italic> localisations into a list of <italic>x,y</italic> protein coordinates the data was further processed using a combination of DBSCAN cluster analysis, qPAINT analysis and <italic>k-</italic>means clustering.</p><p id="P46">First, 21 randomly selected, non-overlapping, 4×4 μm<sup>2</sup> regions on interest (ROIs) for each type of cell and cell treatment were analysed with a density-based clustering algorithm, known as DBSCAN. To avoid suboptimal clustering results; ROIs were selected such that they do not intersect with cell boundaries and the regions were the same for P2Y<sub>2</sub> and αV images. Single molecule localisations within each ROIs were grouped into clusters using the DBSCAN modality from PALMsiever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pengo, Holden and Manley, 2015</xref>) in MATLAB (2021a)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pengo, Holden and Manley, 2015</xref>). This clustering algorithm determines clusters based upon two parameters. The first parameter is the minimum number of points (‘minPts’) within a given circle. For minPts we chose a parameter in accordance to the binding frequency of the imager strand and acquisition frame number; in our case this was set to 10 localisations for all the experiments. The second parameter is the radius (epsilon or ‘eps’) of the circle of the cluster of single molecule localisations. This is determined by the localisation precision of the super-resolved images and, according to the nearest neighbour based analysis was ca. to 10 nm for all the images.</p><p id="P47">For qPAINT analysis we used a custom-written MATLAB (2021a) code. Briefly, localisations corresponding to the same cluster were grouped and their time stamps were used to compile the sequence of dark times per cluster. All the dark times per cluster were pooled and used to obtain a normalised cumulative histogram of the dark times which was then fitted with the exponential function 1 – exp(t/τ<sub>d</sub>) to estimate the mean dark time, τ<sub>d</sub>, per cluster. The qPAINT index (<italic>q</italic><sub>i</sub>) of each cluster was then calculated as the inverse of the mean dark time, 1/τ<sub>d</sub>.</p><p id="P48">Calibration was then performed via compilation of all qPAINT indexes obtained from the DNA-PAINT data acquired for each protein type into a single histogram. Only qPAINT indices corresponding to small clusters (i.e., cluster with a maximum point distance of 150 nm) were considered. This histogram was fitted with a multi-peak Gaussian function to determine the qPAINT index for a cluster of single molecule localisations corresponding to one protein (<italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>1</sub>).</p><p id="P49">The calibration value obtained with this method was used to estimate the number of P2Y<sub>2</sub> and αV proteins in all the single molecule localisations clusters identified by DBSCAN, as this corresponds to the ratio between <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>1</sub> and the qPAINT index of each cluster. Finally, <italic>k</italic>-means clustering was used to recover a likely distribution of the proteins’ positions in each cluster of single molecule localisations, where <italic>k</italic> is equal to the number of proteins in that cluster. This information allowed us to quantify the protein density and level of protein clustering.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Nearest neighbour analysis</title><p id="P50">Nearest neighbour distances (NND) for P2Y<sub>2</sub> - P2Y<sub>2</sub> and αV-αV were calculated using the recovered P2Y<sub>2</sub> and αV-protein maps as described above via a custom-written MATLAB (2021a) script. For colocalization analysis, the NND for each protein of one dataset with respect to the reference dataset was calculated (i.e., P2Y<sub>2</sub> - αV) using a similar MATLAB script. To evaluate the significance of the NND distributions, we randomized the positions of P2Y<sub>2</sub> and αV for the comparison of P2Y<sub>2</sub> - P2Y<sub>2</sub> and αV-αV NND distributions, respectively, and the positions of one of the two proteins for the comparison of the NND between P2Y<sub>2</sub> - αV protein distributions. The resulting histogram of the nearest neighbour distances for both the experimental data sets and the randomly distributed data was normalized using the total number of NND calculated per ROI to calculate the percentage of the populate with distances smaller than a set threshold value.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P51">For the statistical analysis of number and colocalization of DNA-PAINT images, a minimum of five 4×4 μm<sup>2</sup> regions obtained from AsPC-1 cells were analysed per condition.
