It uses refractive lenses to magnify objects of interest and relies on fluorescent labels that induce a highly sensitive contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Ellinger, 1940</xref>). Fluorescence can be detected in single-molecule amounts, making it an ideal contrast mechanism to image the distribution of proteins on the nanoscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Shashkova and Leake, 2017</xref>). In super-resolution microscopy (SRM), selectively detecting subsets of fluorophores in a diffraction-limited volume allows up to single-digit isotropic spatial resolution in cells and tissue, revealing precise subcellular protein distributions on the nanoscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Baddeley and Bewersdorf, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gwosch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Liu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The physical magnification of a fixed biological sample itself is also possible in a technique known as Expansion Microscopy (ExM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Here a sample is labeled with fluorescent molecules, crosslinked to a polyanionic hydrogel, mechanically homogenized, and swelled 4-fold or more linearly in low ionic strength solutions. To capture nanoscale information, expanded samples are usually imaged on a fluorescence microscope and the total image magnification is the product between both physical and optical magnifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Wassie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gallagher and Zhao, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Using high-end confocal imaging systems, the apparent lateral spatial resolution achieved with ExM techniques usually ranges from ~15 nm to ~70 nm, depending on expansion factor, sampling, and labeling density.</p><p id="P4">In our previous work, we demonstrated that by expanding biological specimens ~20-fold linearly while simultaneously retaining the protein content, bulk- (pan-) staining of reactive amino acids resolves local protein densities and reveals ultrastructural context by standard confocal fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">M’Saad and Bewersdorf, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">M’Saad et al. 2022</xref>). We call this method pan-Expansion Microscopy (pan-ExM). Analogous to electron microscopy (EM), subcellular compartments can now be imaged in their entirety, without the need for specific labels and with a lateral spatial resolution of ~15 nm. Our pan-staining concept has been since adapted by many labs to examine contextual spatial information in a multitude of biological systems, and at different expansion levels, demonstrating the wide utility of this contrasting approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Nijenhuis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Sim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Klimas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Damstra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Laporte et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Shaib et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hinterndorfer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rashpa and Brochet, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Pacheco et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Suen et al. 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P5">While fluorescence microscopy was our default approach to visualize biological material at high spatial resolution, we asked whether cells (~50 μm) and their microstructures (~5 μm) can be discerned with the human eye alone without relying on additional optical manipulation. Such development would represent a new way of studying biological microstructures, circumventing the need for an intermediary apparatus.</p><p id="P6">In fact, if a typical HeLa cell of typical ~40 μm width is expanded 20-fold linearly, its width grows to 0.8 mm. Since the human eye has a resolution of 35-60 arcseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Anderson et al., 1991</xref>), it could in principle, at a distance of ~30 cm, resolve objects at the ~50 μm scale, corresponding to fine microstructures of a 20-fold linearly expanded HeLa cell. However, accompanying this expansion, the protein content of a single cell (~1.1 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Milo and Phillips, 2015</xref>) will be diluted 20<sup>3</sup>=8,000-fold to ~140 nM. This poses a severe hurdle since the limited contrast sensitivity of the human eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kimpe &amp; Tuytschaever, 2006</xref>) requires even under ideal conditions at least a 410-fold higher concentration (58 μM) of a highly absorptive dye (molar absorption coefficient of 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>) to detect a 50-μm wide and thick object (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We therefore reasoned that combining physical magnification of cells with amplification of the pan stain could result in a visible cellular contrast, with microstructures ultimately resolvable by the unaided eye. We speculated that if we pan-stained expanded cells with peroxidases or photoinitiators and amplified the underlying chromogenic substrate signal 10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>6</sup>-fold, the resulting ~0.14-140 mM pigment concentration would be easily detected by the human eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Earlier studies determined that horseradish peroxidase (HRP) amplification coupled with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Adams, 1991</xref>) and photopolymerization-based signal amplification (PBA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>) can yield amplification degrees of equivalent orders of magnitude, strengthening the feasibility of our approach.</p><p id="P8">Here, we introduce Unclearing Microscopy, a method where biological samples are expanded, pan-stained, and their pan stain amplified (uncleared) to yield a chromogenic product visible by the unaided eye. We further show imaging of uncleared cells and tissue samples with transmitted light microscopy, demonstrating that ultrastructural cell and tissue features such as mitochondria cristae and neuronal synapses can be revealed without complex super-resolution instrumentation or electron microscopy, using magnification optics alone.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Unclearing by chromogen deposition</title><p id="P9"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref> outlines the basic workflow of Unclearing Microscopy. Cells are first expanded ~20-fold with pan-ExM, pan-stained with amine-reactive NHS-ester ligands conjugated to biotin (NHS-PEG4-Biotin), and incubated with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (ST-HRP). The hydrogel sample is then sectioned to a thickness of ~1 mm and uncleared with chromogenic substrates 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) or metallic silver. The sample is finally washed with water and visualized directly.</p><p id="P10"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c-i</xref> confirms the validity of our concept. Taken with a standard cell phone camera under typical room light conditions, uncleared gels reveal individual mammalian cells and their microstructures. We found that metallic silver and DAB substrates yielded strong black and brown chromogenic contrast, respectively. We can easily discern cellular boundaries, cell contact sites, the cell cytosol, and the nucleus by eye. Similarly, when applying the same principle to 5xFAD mouse brain and mouse kidney tissue sections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), unclearing reveals individual tubules in the renal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j-k</xref>) and the different layers of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1l-m</xref>) by the unaided eye.</p><p id="P11">Imaging our uncleared samples with conventional phase contrast microscopy, revealed ultrastructural features at higher magnification and contrast that in the past could only be seen by super-resolution fluorescence or electron microscopy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1n</xref> shows whole HeLa cells uncleared with DAB. Mitochondria cristae, the nuclear envelope, and nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) can also be discerned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1o-s</xref>). These images resemble those acquired with fluorescently pan-stained cells in pan-ExM but have the benefits of (1) no reliance on photon emitters which are susceptible to bleaching and (2) minimal degradation of staining over time. The fact that we can resolve mitochondria cristae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1o-p</xref>) which are only ~70 nm apart in unexpanded cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Stephan et al., 2019</xref>), suggests that blurring of features from signal amplification is minimal on that scale.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Unclearing by photopolymerization</title><p id="P12">Next, we investigated whether amplifying the pan-stain using <italic>in situ</italic> polymerization of a highly crosslinked photopolymer could also render cells visible by eye and perhaps even confer a certain structural sturdiness to the enlarged cells in question. Such a technique would represent an orthogonal method of tissue unclearing, widening its applicability in biological studies.</p><p id="P13">To unclear biological samples using <italic>in situ</italic> polymerization, we used a strategy called photopolymerization-based signal amplification (PBA). PBA is commonly used to amplify signals from antibody-antigen interactions in immunoassays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hoang et al., 2021</xref>). In these assays, antigens bind to immobilized antibodies and are then mixed with photoinitiator-conjugated capture antibodies. These also bind the antigens and when irradiated with light, in the presence of hydrogel monomers and catalysts, initiate free-radical polymerization. PBA is thereby spatially confined to the photoinitiator location and yields a polymer film of ~10-250 nm thickness, depending on hydrogel monomer composition and photoinitiator density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Most PBA methods use eosin as a photoinitiator because it is a high triplet yield fluorophore that can partially regenerate in oxygen (Avens and Bowman, 2009). Coupled with tertiary amine methyl diethanolamine (MDEA) and under 530-nm green light irradiation, eosin and MDEA undergo energy transfer and initiate free-radical polymerization in the presence of common hydrogel monomers and crosslinkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>; Avens and Bowman, 2009).</p><p id="P15">PBA has also been demonstrated to amplify fluorescence signals in several immunofluorescence assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Avens et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">2011b</xref>). For example, one study used eosin light-initiated polyethylene (glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) polymer films to entrap fluorescent nanoparticles onto microtubules, resulting in up to ~10<sup>3</sup>-fold amplification of fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Avens et al., 2011b</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Here, we investigated whether expanded cells pan-stained with eosin can be used to synthesize a densely crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel <italic>in situ</italic>. The photopolymer would be ideally capable of entrapping small chromogenic dyes, amplifying the pan-stain accordingly.</p><p id="P17">Since the cell protein content is significantly diluted following sample expansion (~140 nM), we first tested if eosin surface densities of equivalent concentrations can still initiate photopolymerization. In a solution of 38% (w/v) acrylamide (AAm), 35 mM N-vinylpyrrolidone (VP), 2% (w/w) methylene bisacrylamide (BIS), and 210 mM MDEA, we added eosin in concentrations of 0.03 μM to 12 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The aforementioned eosin concentrations correspond to that of proteins in a 20-fold expanded cell had they originally been separated by 5 nm to 40 nm respectively. Irradiating these solutions with 530-nm light with intensities between 12 and 55 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, we confirmed that even at 0.03 μM eosin concentration, a photopolymer can still form, with increased thickness when the gelation solution is purged with nitrogen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). This finding is consistent with a previous report which determined that the eosin threshold concentration for PEGDA and acrylamide photopolymers is 0.03 μM for 5% conversion in 20 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Avens et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Next, we investigated if the resulting photopolymer can be stained with chromogenic dyes. It has been previously shown that Evans Blue (EB) can efficiently stain PEGDA gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lilly et al., 2014</xref>). We questioned whether EB could also stain polyacrylamide (pAAm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>) and whether it does so without also staining the underlying expansion poly(acrylamide/sodium acrylate) hydrogel (pAAm/SA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). We found that indeed EB stains pAAm gels and not pAAm/SA gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-e</xref>), even when the BIS crosslinker concentration is varied from 0.1% to 2% (w/w) to account for crosslinking density. We hypothesize that this is because EB is sulfonated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>) and thus repelled by carboxylic groups in pAAm/SA gels. This finding is also true for the sulfonated textile dye Direct Red 81 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). However, we chose to use EB in our subsequent experimentation because of its superior visible contrast.</p><p id="P19">Ensuingly, we developed a workflow for unclearing biological samples by PBA. In brief, samples are expanded according to the pan-ExM protocol, pan-stained with amine-reactive eosin-5-isothiocyanate, sectioned to ~1 mm thickness, incubated in a hydrogel monomer solution containing MDEA and high concentration of BIS crosslinker, photo-irradiated with 530-nm light, washed with water, optionally stained with EB, and visualized directly.</p><p id="P20">Using this protocol, we observed uncleared cells with the unaided eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i-j</xref>). Even without chromogenic EB staining, photopolymers are still visible against a dark background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). This is likely caused by the significant polymer refractive index variations between the photopolymer and the expansion hydrogel (n~1.33). Like samples uncleared with chromogen deposition, we can distinguish between the cytosol and cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i-j</xref>), delineate cell boundaries, and classify cells by their shapes and interactions.</p><p id="P21">Additionally, we can physically excise individual cells with tweezers and manipulate them mechanically. This is due to the mechanical sturdiness of the underlying photopolymer compared to the more delicate expansion hydrogel.</p><p id="P22">Moreover, PBA uncleared samples are compatible with phase contrast microscopy. We can observe the fine ultrastructures of mitochondria cristae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2k</xref>), filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2l</xref>) as well as nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2m</xref>). Co-staining with NHS ester fluorescent dyes and overlaying phase contrast with fluorescence confocal images shows that these structures fully overlap, with confocal fluorescence imaging offering better optical sectioning.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>OI-DIC reveals EM-like 3D ultrastructural features in uncleared brain tissue</title><p id="P23">PBA unclearing is also applicable to mouse brain tissue sections. With conventional phase contrast imaging, we were able to resolve the fine structure of cortical neuron bodies as well as putative axons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). However, we were unable to resolve synaptic densities and distinguish between neighboring neurites as we have demonstrated with pan-ExM-t, a fluorescence ultrastructural imaging method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">M’Saad et al. 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P24">To this end, we decided to image ~1 mm-thick expanded and uncleared brain tissue sections with an Orientation-Independent Differential Interference Contrast (OI-DIC) microscope, a quantitative phase contrast transmitted light imaging modality with 3D optical sectioning capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Shribak and Inoué, 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P25"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> demonstrates the compatibility of OI-DIC with PBA uncleared tissue. Hallmark ultrastructural features in cortical mouse brain tissue, including the fine structure of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3u-v</xref>), putative ER tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3s</xref>), spine apparatuses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3r</xref>), and putative synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-m</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3w-aa</xref>) are now visible with transmitted light.</p><p id="P26">Similar to pan-ExM-t, synaptic compartments can be identified by their characteristic synaptic densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c-m</xref>), with dense projections (DPs) demarcating the presynaptic compartment and a macular postsynaptic density (PSD) representing the postsynaptic compartment. This characteristic pattern is almost identical to that visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy of pan-ExM-t samples and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of brain tissue stained with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3n-q</xref>). Further, we found that the expansion-corrected DP-PSD distance in one experiment is 92.2 ± 12.7 nm (mean ± s.d, n = 63 measurements; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3r</xref>), consistent with that obtained in pan-ExM-t samples of the same experiment (81.6 ± 13.6 nm; mean ± s.d, n = 91 measurements) and in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Valtschanoff and Weinberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Acuna et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hao et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Importantly, OI-DIC permits effective optical sectioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3w-aa</xref>) of PBA-uncleared specimen, paving the way to an era where neural circuit reconstruction with transmitted light comes within the realm of possibility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">It is indisputable that tissue <italic>clearing</italic> represents a revolution in the field of microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Richardson and Lichtman, 2016</xref>). When biological tissue is cleared (i.e. transparentized and depigmented), limitations imposed by light scattering molecules (e.g, lipids, lipofuscin etc.) are removed, allowing for volumetric imaging of thick specimens on conventional light microscopes. While sample clearing has long been considered a desirable outcome of Expansion Microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>) and is in fact an inherent property of this method, we show in this work that the opposite - <italic>unclearing</italic> (opaquing) - provides an equally exciting opportunity: unclearing structures of interest in a targeted manner generates contrast that reveals them in expanded biological samples without the need for complex instrumentation.</p><p id="P29">In fact, the data presented demonstrates that by sufficient sample enlargement and signal amplification, cellular microstructures can be revealed without the need for <italic>any</italic> optical instrumentation. While the demonstrated resolution is too small to reveal nanoscopic details with the unaided eye, larger linear expansion factors of 100-fold to 1000-fold in the future will render cellular organelles like mitochondria (~500 nm) large enough to see without supplementary optical magnification (e.g., ~100 μm after 200-fold linear expansion). While enticing, it is important to be cognizant of reaction kinetics when experimenting with larger expansion factors. For example, in the case of the SN2 nucleophilic substitution reaction of NHS ester with primary amines, the recommended minimum concentration of primary amines before NHS ester hydrolysis becomes dominant is 10 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Smith, 2006</xref>). Intermediate amplification steps with streptavidin and biotin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chu et al., 2013</xref>) at expansion levels of 20-fold can help mediate this problem. In fact, the high affinity (KD ~10<sup>-15</sup> M) of biotin for streptavidin indicates that the latter can be detected at femto- and picomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Delgadillo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Moreover, our data demonstrates a conceptually new way of resolving ultrastructural details. Simple, laser-free optical systems such as widely available phase contrast microscopes or more advanced OI-DIC instruments can now reveal structures at the nanoscale in cells and tissues. We have shown here transmitted light images of nucleoli, mitochondria, filopodia, NPCs, ER tubules, synaptic densities, and spine apparatuses at sub-70 nm resolution. We have demonstrated unclearing by two methods: deposition of chromogens and targeted photopolymerization. However, other amplification strategies such as nucleic acid-based ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Saka et al., 2019</xref>) should be equally feasible. We have shown ultrastructural cell and tissue imaging by amplifying the pan-stain, but our approach can also be adapted to imaging specific molecules using antibody labels conjugated to HRP or eosin. To extend Unclearing Microscopy to multiplexing in the future, we envision using differently colored chromogens (e.g., red and blue), different catalytic agents (e.g., alkaline phosphatase (AP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Stack et al., 2014</xref>)), and different water-soluble photoinitiators (e.g., phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) which is activated with UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Tomal and Ortyl, 2020</xref>)).</p><p id="P31">In contrast to established sub-diffraction optical microscopy techniques like STED and single-molecule localization microscopy, Unclearing Microscopy does not rely on switching fluorescent molecules between different states. Hence, Unclearing Microscopy does not require complex instrumentation or image processing to reveal nanoscopic features in a sample. While this has already been the case for conventional Expansion Microscopy, Unclearing Microscopy completely decouples super-resolution optical microscopy from fluorescence as the means of contrast.</p><p id="P32">This unprecedented strength enables a wide range of future applications of Unclearing Microscopy. In contrast to fluorescence-based methods, Unclearing Microscopy is not constrained by rate-limited fluorescence photon flux but can draw from essentially unlimited photon rates enabling, in principle, the acquisition of large fields of view (FOV) in less than a millisecond, only limited by available data acquisition rates. Photobleaching, an omnipresent constraint in fluorescence microscopy, is equally negligible allowing for essentially unlimited signal-to-noise ratio imaging of large 3D volumes. We envision Unclearing Microscopy having a large impact in applications requiring examination of tissue ultrastructure in large volumes. For example, combined with instantaneous large-FOV 3D data acquisition offered by next-generation OI-DIC microscopes, PBA-based unclearing may pave the way to moonshot light-based brain connectomics projects since, in principle, it solves the limitations of data acquisition speed and two-dimensionality that EM methods suffer from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lichtman et al., 2014</xref>). Perhaps reflected light confocal microscopy will become prevalent again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boyde, 1985</xref>).</p><p id="P33">In clinical applications, we see unclearing by chromogenic deposition and direct visualization of the sample potentially replacing microscopic evaluation of H&amp;E-stained clinical samples in the future.

This simple method combines the two orthogonal differential images in a way that maintains the strong edge emphasis, yet enforces isotropy (i.e. rotation invariance).
