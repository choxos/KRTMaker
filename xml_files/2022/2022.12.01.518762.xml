However, it is not fully understood what information is provided by these movements. The Peter’s elephantnose fish, <italic>Gnathonemus petersii</italic> sense their environment through active electrolocation during which they use epidermal electroreceptors to perceive object-induced distortions of a self-produced electric field. The analysis of electric images projected on their skin enables them to discriminate between three-dimensional objects. While we know the electric image parameters used to encode numerous object properties, we don’t understand how these images encode object shape. We hypothesise that ‘movement-induced modulations’ (MIMs) evoked by body movements might be involved in shape discrimination during active electrolocation. To test this, we trained fish to complete a shape discrimination task in a two-alternative forced-choice setup, and then manipulated the space available to individuals for scanning movements to see if this led to a change in their discrimination performance. We found that if enough space was available, fish were very good at discriminating objects of different shapes. However, performance decreased strongly when the space was reduced so that scanning movements were impaired. Our study demonstrates the importance of body movements for gaining complex environmental information such as object shape through active electrolocation. Movement can enhance perception by allowing the extraction of certain kinds of information. Similar observations have been made in other animals using different senses, suggesting that the core principles of sensory-motor integration might be valid for various sensory modalities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Active electrolocation</kwd><kwd>Active sensing</kwd><kwd>Body movements</kwd><kwd><italic>Gnathonemus petersii</italic></kwd><kwd>Object recognition</kwd><kwd>Shape discrimination</kwd><kwd>Sensory-motor integration</kwd><kwd>Weakly electric fish</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Weakly electric fish, such as <italic>Gnathonemus petersii (G. petersii)</italic>, possess an active electric sense that they use to detect objects in their environment, termed active electrolocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Lissmann, 1951</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lissmann &amp; Machin, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Heiligenberg, 1973</xref>). These fish generate electric organ discharges (EODs) from their electric organ. Each EOD produces a three-dimensional electric field around the fish. Objects within this field close to the fish’s skin (on the centimetre range) will distort it, and specialised electroreceptors on the skin will detect these changes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">von der Emde, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">von der Emde &amp; Zeymer, 2020</xref>). The area of change on the skin is referred to as ‘the electric image’ of the object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Caputi &amp; Budelli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">von der Emde, 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The active electric sense is well-suited to object recognition, as it provides fine scale spatial information of objects less than about half a fish length away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">von der Emde <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">2017b</xref>). Individuals can determine object properties by examining different image parameters within an electric image, such as amplitude distribution within the image, local waveform distortion, image size, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">von der Emde, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">von der Emde &amp; Fetz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">von der Emde &amp; Zeymer, 2020</xref>). Thus, by analysing single electric images (‘snapshots’), it is possible for the fish to get information about an object’s size, material composition, distance, and electric colour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">von der Emde <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">von der Emde &amp; Fetz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Gottwald <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">2018</xref>).</p><p id="P4">However, no parameter or collection of parameters in a single electric image can explain three-dimensional object shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">von der Emde, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>., 2016b</xref>). Shape is a complex cue to extract from the environment, since it is made up of a collection of features that all contribute towards an object’s overall shape (e.g. object height, presence or absence of corners, the number, length, and orientation of sides; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">von der Emde &amp; Fetz, 2007</xref>). Moreover, the perception of shape during electrolocation is, like in other senses, view-point dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Fujita &amp; Kashimori, 2019</xref>). In addition, the shape of an object at a given viewpoint cannot be taken as the shape of the corresponding electric image. There is no such mechanism within the electrosensory system to focus the electric image and the asymmetric nature of the electric field generated around the fish means that the electric image generated will always be distorted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Caputi &amp; Budelli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">von der Emde, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Engelmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Pusch <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). As such, there is no clear geometric relationship between the actual shape of an object and single electric images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Caputi &amp; Budelli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">von der Emde, 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Nevertheless, we know that <italic>G. petersii</italic> can recognise three-dimensional shapes and accurately discriminate between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">von der Emde &amp; Schwarz 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">von der Emde, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">von der Emde &amp; Fetz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">von der Emde <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">2016b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Skeels, 2022</xref>). They seem to use features within an object to recognise and generalise its shape, even when the object is rotated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">von der Emde &amp; Fetz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">von der Emde <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Skeels <italic>et al</italic>., in prep</xref>). In the wild, it would be advantageous for <italic>G. petersii</italic> to determine an object’s shape accurately, so they can identify the object and determine the most appropriate response to it, e.g. an escape response away from a predator or an orientating movement during landmark detection.</p><p id="P6">Instead of using static electric images to determine the shape of an object, <italic>G. petersii</italic> might use the temporal series of electric images (electric flow) generated by engaging in movements around the object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Caputi &amp; Budelli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">von der Emde, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hofmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2013b</xref>). These movements will change the spatiotemporal dynamics of the electric field, and by analysing the changes in the electric field over successive electric images, they might be able to extract the necessary information required for shape recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Fujita &amp; Kashimori, 2019</xref>). We already know this kind of information can provide these fish with a cue for continuous distance estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hofmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>. (2016b)</xref> proposed that movement-induced modulations (MIMs) might act a cue for shape. MIMs refers to the ‘[temporal] changes in the electrical images that occur as a fish swims past an object’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>., 2016b</xref>). They theorised that the magnitude and nature of these modulations would be dependent on the object’s shape and could provide a suitable cue for three-dimensional shape detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>., 2016b</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>. (2016b</xref>) found evidence to suggest a possible role of MIMs in shape recognition and discrimination, their limited sample size and inability to discount non-movement cues prevented them from drawing firm conclusions.</p><p id="P7">Our study aimed to test the role of MIMs in shape recognition by manipulating the motor component of fish behaviour. To do this, we trained fish in a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) setup to discriminate between two objects differing only in shape. Once the fish learned the task, we varied the space available for them to undertake scanning movements next to the objects-assuming that this negatively altered the amount of MIMs occurring- and tested whether this led to a change in discrimination performance. If MIMs were involved in shape discrimination, we would expect an individual’s discrimination performance to decline as swimming space –and thus MIMs- were restricted. Our study is therefore essential for determining the significance of body movements for three-dimensional shape recognition during active electrolocation in these fish.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2" sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p id="P8">We trained six <italic>G. petersii</italic> of unknown sex and age to complete a shape discrimination task in a 2AFC setup. We sourced our fish from a licenced fish dealer (The Goldfish Bowl, Oxford, UK). They had a total length of ca. 13.1-16.2 cm (including their chin appendage-Schnauzenorgan). Each fish was housed in a standard two-foot tank (approx. l x w x h: 60.2 x 35.2 x 31.5 cm) which also served as their experimental space. Reverse osmosis water was treated with a remineralisation formula to ensure fish well-being and stabilisation of the aquarium systems (Tropic Marin, Tropical Marine Centre, UK). Water conductivity was 415 ± 35 μS/cm, water temperature was 25.5 ± 0.5 °C, and pH 7.3± 0.3. We set the lights to a 12:12h light-dark cycle. Experiments were conducted during the light portion (20-30 lux). Fish were fed bloodworms (Gamma, Tropical Marine Centre, UK). Fish were only fed during training trials when participating in the study. Outside experiments, fish were given bloodworms twice a day, six times a week. We also supplemented their diet with brine shrimp (twice weekly) and additional vitamins (once a week). We provided plenty of enrichment (e.g. caves, tunnels, and plastic ornaments) to keep them engaged.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Ethical note</title><p id="P9">This study was approved by the Department of Biology’s ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the University of Oxford’s animal ethics guidelines. No specific licences were required as the work undertaken was non-invasive. We took steps to ensure the well-being of our animals (see above) and limited the number of individuals kept in line with guidance provided by ASAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Animal Behaviour, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Experimental setup</title><p id="P10">Each tank was made up of four different compartments: the waiting area (l x w: 14.0 x 35.2 cm) where the fish began trials, the sensing area (26.2 x 35.2 cm) where the fish decided which object to choose, and the two experimental areas, A and B (each being 18.0 x 17.1 cm) which contained either the positive or negative object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Outside of experiments, the fish could access all areas of their tank, but these now contained normal enrichment rather than experimental apparatus.</p><p id="P11">The partitions, barriers, and doors all had nylon mesh windows (mesh size: 0.71 mm per square) which meant that water could flow through them, ensuring that they did not form barriers for active electrolocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>., 2016b</xref>). Barriers were placed in the sensing area to limit the amount of space that the fish could occupy and use for scanning movements during active electrolocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Two barriers were placed either side of the opening to A, and the same for B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The overall size of each barrier was: h x w x d: 18.4 x 14.4 x 0.2 cm, and the mesh window was 14.8 x 7.9 cm. For training, the distance between each barrier pair was always 15.9 cm (D1), providing the maximal possible space. For testing, the distance was varied to one of four distances (<italic>see</italic> <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">testing regime</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Pre-training</title><p id="P12">These sessions ensured the fish (N=6) were familiar with the setup before training fully commenced. They learned to swim out of the waiting area and into the sensing area when the slider door was opened. A clear tunnel (overall h x w x d: 28.9 x 10.9 x 7.7 cm) was placed at the entrance of this door to ensure the fish did not leave the waiting area at too much of an angle in case this had a bearing on choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). They then learned to swim through the channels made by the barriers, open the doors leading to A and B, enter A/B to get a reward, and then return to the waiting area. They were also given time to acclimatise to the object platforms.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Experimental Objects</title><p id="P13">The fish were split equally into two training groups. All fish were trained with the same positive object (S+) but each group was provided with a different negative object (S-). We did this to see if object pairing had an impact on performance. S+ was a sausage-shaped object (h x w x d: ca. 1.5 x 6.3 x 1.5 cm). S-was either a cube (side length 2.42 cm) or sphere (Ø 3 cm). The sausage-shaped object was presented with its longest side facing the door and the cube was presented with one of its sides facing the door (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). All objects were made from the same material (aluminium) and of similar volumes, meaning that these properties should not have impacted choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">von der Emde &amp; Fetz, 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Each object was positioned on a platform (overall height ca. 10.8 cm). Objects were placed ca. 1.6 cm from the openings to A and B if fish were trained without the doors and ca. 1.9-2.5 cm away if trained with the doors (we had to account for door depth and water flow pushing doors out slightly here). Individuals moved the doors using their Schnauzenorgan. We trained and tested two individuals with the doors removed to check that the doors themselves did not influence performance (fish five and six).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Training regime</title><p id="P15">They were trained to swim into the area with S+ (which was associated with a food reward-bloodworm) and to avoid the area with S- (which was associated with a mild punishment-a gentle tap of the glass followed by being shooed back to the waiting area). This combination of sound and movement was aversive to the fish but not enough to inflict stress.</p><p id="P16">The position of S+ was randomised to prevent choice being determined by object location. Generally, each fish completed 24 trials in a session. One session was conducted with each fish per day. A total of 3214 training trials were conducted across all fish during the training phase (fish one=312, fish two=480, fish three=264, fish four=655, fish five=629, and fish six=874 trials).

Test trials were introduced every third trial. During these trials, the distance between the barriers was changed. The barriers could be placed at four possible positions: 15.9 (D1), 12.7 (D2), 9.5 (D3), or 6.3 cm apart (D4). Fish were neither rewarded nor punished to prevent further learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">von der Emde &amp; Fetz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>., 2016b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">2017a</xref>). However, testing was interspliced with training trials (two for every test trial) to maintain discrimination performance and keep motivation high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">von der Emde &amp; Fetz, 2007</xref>). On average, we conducted 30 test trials at each distance for every individual studied. In total, we conducted 1460 training trials (fish one=240, fish two=240, fish three=240, fish four=240, fish five=248, and fish six=252 trials) and 720 test trials (fish one=118, fish two=118, fish three=120, fish four=117, fish five=123, and fish six=124 trials) in the testing phase alone.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Posthoc analyses</title><sec id="S10"><title>Latency of response during test probes</title><p id="P18">Latency was defined as the time it took an individual to choose an object (measured from when the slider door was opened to when the fish had made their choice by entering either A or B completely).

Lastly, trial outcome did not have a significant influence on side switching (GLMM: <italic>Z</italic>716=0.725, <italic>P</italic>=0.4686; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">We investigated the role of egocentric movement in shape discrimination in <italic>G. petersii</italic>. We were interested in determining whether movement-induced modulations (MIMs) could be a useful method for extracting shape information. To determine this, we trained fish to complete a shape discrimination task in a 2AFC setup. We manipulated the space available for scanning movements to determine whether this had an impact on their ability to distinguish the objects correctly.</p><sec id="S22"><title>Shape discrimination performance</title><p id="P29">We found that barrier distance had a significant effect on an individual’s ability to discriminate between the two objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">A2; Table A1</xref>). Individuals found it more difficult to discriminate the objects as the barrier distance narrowed and space around the object became more limited-regardless of the objects they were trained and tested with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">A2; Table A1</xref>). This supports our hypothesis that <italic>G. petersii</italic> use movement to facilitate the extraction of shape information from the environment.</p><p id="P30">We found that the biggest drops in discrimination performance tended to occur at the shortest barrier distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">A2; Table A1</xref>). These drops likely represent a threshold being reached, where the amount of space available was not enough to reliably scan the objects with the active electric sense, and so lacking information on the objects’ shape, mistakes became more frequent.</p><p id="P31">The hypothesis that the barriers shaped the movement of the fish is further supported by our observations at the shorter distances. We found individuals tended to change their movements when beside the objects, and this was seen across all fish, regardless of whether or not they were trained with the doors, suggesting the changes were not due to the presence or absence of doors but the barriers themselves (<italic>see</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">appendix-Notable behaviours during testing phase</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Given that we did not block out any senses due to the impact on behaviour, how can we be sure that our fish are primarily using their active electric sense for shape discrimination and not another sense? In principle, an individual could get shape information about the two objects using vision (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>., 2016a</xref>). Since the two objects would have looked very different when observed from straight ahead, a reduction in space between the barriers should not have impaired visual discrimination. Movement in front of the objects would not have provided additional information and thus not helped visual discrimination. For electrical discrimination, however, movement might have been necessary. Since the objects had the same volume, they would have elicited quite similar electric images when a fish swam straight ahead towards them without left and right movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Fujita &amp; Kashimori, 2019</xref>). Only when the fish was moving in front of the objects would the electric image have changed significantly, according to the angle between the fish and the object and would have also moved on the skin of the fish until the objects had been electrolocated from the sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hofmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">2013b</xref>). These temporal changes of electric images and their movement on the skin of the fish might have been necessary to get enough information about an object’s shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hofmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Fujita &amp; Kashimori, 2019</xref>). So, if we impair movement of an individual, they might only get straight ahead electric images, which do not change temporally and do not move on the skin (or move less), and therefore may not provide enough information to discriminate between the two objects. Given our findings that discrimination performance declined with barrier distance, and the dominance of the active electric sense for object recognition at the distances we tested at (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>., 2017a</xref>), we can be confident that these fish were primarily relying on their active electric sense when completing our shape recognition task.</p><p id="P33">In summary, we found that shape discrimination performance worsened as barrier distance declined, suggesting that individuals extracted shape information through movement, presumably from analysing successive electric images as the fish moved alongside the object, i.e. via MIMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">von der Emde <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Fechler &amp; von der Emde, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hofmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Fujita &amp; Kashimori, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Posthoc analyses</title><sec id="S24"><title>Latency of response during test probes</title><p id="P34">We examined response times as an indicator of the level of certainty an individual experienced during trials under a set number of conditions. Latency increased as barrier distance decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), suggesting that individuals were more uncertain during trials at shorter distances, and so needed more time examining the objects before they could make a choice. This is likely because a discrimination threshold with MIMs was reached. This would have occurred when the space was restricted to such a degree that an individual was unable to scan the objects effectively with their active electric sense, meaning that extra scans were required to resolve any ambiguities that existed between the two objects. In other words, when the barriers were at their most restrictive, the fish were less successful at scanning the objects, so they tried harder (see below) and for a longer time.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Side switching behaviour during test probes</title><p id="P35">We measured switching behaviours as another proxy of certainty. We expected individuals to perform fewer side switches (and take less time) when they were more certain of S+ but exhibit more side switches (and take more time) when they were less certain. Fish completed more side switches when the distance between the barriers narrowed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that the fish were primarily relying on MIMs to complete the shape recognition task, and that side switching was employed to add value in trials, for example to help resolve ambiguities between the two objects in situations of greater uncertainty through additional scans. This is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">von der Emde and Fetz (2007)</xref> who found that individuals who inspected both objects had a greater amount of success in picking S+ than those that examined just one object. As such, side switching likely played an important role in our study by minimising the chance of the wrong object being chosen.</p><p id="P36">Side switching may also have been a consequence of individuals resorting to using other cues (e.g. vision) if MIMs were compromised. Fish using these other cues would have likely needed more time and visits with the objects before having enough information to make an informed choice, and even that would not have guaranteed success, as these cues would not have been optimised for fine scale object recognition-like vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Landsberger <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kreysing <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Pusch <italic>et al</italic>., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Francke <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S26" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P37">Here, we show that movement is key to enabling <italic>G. petersii</italic> to recognise and successfully discriminate between objects differing in their shape. We found that performance worsened as the barrier distance was decreased. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that our fish were predominately relying on their active electric sense for shape discrimination, and that movement-induced modulations (MIMs) of a series of electric images moving over the fish’s skin generated by swimming was likely the cue being used. Our study therefore contributes to the growing body of evidence that movement is essential for shaping sensory input in a wide range of taxa (see reviews: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Land, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Caputi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Nelson &amp; MacIver, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Mitchinson <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Prescott <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hofmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Engelmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Animals use movement in similar ways to enhance their perception of the environment regardless of their taxonomic group (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Prescott <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) or preferred sensory modality (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hofmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2013b</xref>). This indicates the fundamental importance of sensory-motor coupling to understanding animal behaviour generally. We suggest future studies might benefit from taking a comparative approach in order to interpret and understand these movements better.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Appendix</label><media xlink:href="EMS157994-supplement-Appendix.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d32aAdKbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Oliver Padget for their statistical advice, Adélaïde Sibeaux for their helpful comments on this manuscript, as well as David Skeels and Toby Skeels-Jungius for proofreading.
