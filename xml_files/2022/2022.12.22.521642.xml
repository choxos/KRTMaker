Therefore, it should be possible to exploit lectins to target SARS-CoV-2 and inhibit cellular entry by binding glycans on the Spike protein. <italic>Burkholderia oklahomensis</italic> agglutinin (BOA) is an antiviral lectin that interacts with viral glycoproteins via N-linked high mannose glycans. Here, we show that BOA binds to the Spike protein and is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry at nanomolar concentrations. Using a variety of biophysical tools, we demonstrate that the interaction is avidity driven and that BOA crosslinks the Spike protein into soluble aggregates. Furthermore, using virus neutralization assays, we demonstrate that BOA effectively inhibits all tested variants of concern as well as SARS-CoV 2003, establishing that glycan-targeting molecules have the potential to be pan-coronavirus inhibitors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has claimed over 6 million lives to date (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></italic>). In the race for pharmacological interventions, the Spike protein on SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has become the predominant target for vaccine development and early monoclonal antibody therapeutics (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></italic>). The Spike protein forms a trimer, approximately 25 of which protrude from the outer surface of the virion in a semi-stabilized prefusion state (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></italic>). Upon engagement with the cellular receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), Spike undergoes a substantial conformational change, triggering fusion between the virus and host cell membranes. This process is initiated by and requires the transition of the receptor binding domain (RBD) from a buried “down” state, to an exposed, active “up” state. Although antibodies are effective weapons in the fight against COVID-19, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are rapidly evolving in the race between virus and host, rendering many antibodies ineffective (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></italic>).</p><p id="P3">Like other viral envelope proteins, Spike is heavily glycosylated, and this glycan shield cloaks the protein, effectively hiding 44% of its solvent accessible surface area from recognition by the host immune system (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></italic>). Spike sugars are predominately N-linked and have been mapped to 22 different asparagine (Asn) residues (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></italic>). They range in glycotype from high mannose to complex glycans, varying for each glycosylation site (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></italic>). Although most glycans appear to hide the protein surface, there is growing evidence that some possess additional structural roles (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></italic>). In particular, virions produced from CRISPR engineered cells with perturbed glycan processing machinery and altered glycosylation patterns exhibit reduced infectivity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></italic>). Furthermore, an all atom molecular dynamics simulation of glycosylated Spike suggested that the N165 and N234 glycans regulate the up/down RBD conformational switch (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></italic>), while the N343 glycan acts as a gate to permit the up/down placement of the RBD (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></italic>). Subsequent biophysical and structural studies, in which the glycosylation capacity of specific residues was ablated by selective mutation, confirmed a pivotal role for the N165 and N234 glycans in RBD positioning and ACE2 binding (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></italic>). Therefore, targeting and exploiting glycans on Spike constitutes an attractive strategy for developing SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.</p><p id="P4">Glycans are recognized and bound by lectins, a class of proteins that is present in all domains of life, ranging from bacteria and fungi to plants and animals (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></italic>). Importantly, most lectins possess exquisite configurational and conformational specificity towards particular glycans. Functionally, lectins play key roles in a wide variety of biological processes, including host pathogen interactions, cell-cell signaling, and immune modulation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></italic>). Among the antiviral lectins, activities against a wide range of viruses have been reported, including HIV, Ebola virus, SARS-CoV 2003, and MERS-CoV (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></italic>). As potential therapeutics, however, their uses have not been fully realized (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></italic>).</p><p id="P5">Structurally, lectins adopt a diverse set of architectures (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></italic>). They can bind glycans mono- or multivalently at single or multiple sites. The anti-HIV activities of lectins are associated with binding to the high-mannose glycans on gp120, the major HIV envelope glycoprotein that is critical for entry of the virus into the host cell. Among the HIV-inactivating lectins, the <italic>Oscillatoria agardhii</italic> agglutinin (OAA) family exhibits an unprecedented beta barrel topology, in single domain or multi-domain arrangements (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></italic>). Each beta barrel contains two glycan binding sites, targeting the core 3α,6α-mannopentaose of N-linked high mannose glycans on the HIV envelope protein and inhibiting HIV infection at nanomolar concentration (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></italic>). For example, the OAA family member <italic>Burkholderia oklahomensis</italic> agglutinin (BOA) has a dual beta barrel topology and an effective EC<sub>50</sub> concentration against HIV of 12 ± 2 nM (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></italic>). Since binding of 3α,6α-mannopentaose by individual BOA binding sites occurs with K<sub>d</sub> values between 20-60 μM, as measured by NMR, the high apparent inhibitory activity of BOA is avidity driven, through multiple interactions with gp120 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></italic>).</p><p id="P6">Here, we demonstrate that BOA interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and inhibits cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations less than 50 nM.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Lectins as inhibitors of viral entry</title><p id="P7">Three different lectins, griffithsin (GRFT), OAA, and BOA, were evaluated for their ability to inhibit infection of Vero E6 cells by the Munich SARS-CoV-2 authentic virus isolate. All three lectins have been reported to inhibit HIV-1 infection, although GRFT and OAA/BOA differ significantly in structure and glycan binding specificities (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></italic>). No inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was observed for GRFT (at 80 nM), partial inhibition was seen for OAA (at 75 nM), and complete inhibition was achieved using BOA (at 115 nM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Since BOA was the most potent lectin tested, we evaluated its activity in three different virus neutralization systems. First, using plaque assays, we found that BOA blocked the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 Munich isolate in Vero E6 cells with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 9 ± 2 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Second, using replication-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 pseudotyped with Spike from the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate containing the D614G substitution, BOA reduced infection of Vero E6 cells, as measured by luciferase activity, with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.6 ± 0.3 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Note, the D614G substitution increases the Spike protein density on virions resulting in improved transduction (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></italic>). Finally, infection of HEK293F cells expressing human ACE2 (hACE2) with replication-incompetent GP-expressing HIV-1 pseudotyped with Wuhan-Hu-1 D614G Spike, generated an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 48 ±16 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). All three assays demonstrate that BOA inhibits SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry at nanomolar concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Biophysical Characterization of Lectin Spike interactions</title><p id="P9">To explore whether BOA and OAA binding to Spike was responsible for inhibition of infection, <italic>in vitro</italic> binding was evaluated using purified Spike, OAA, and BOA proteins. Mixing equimolar amounts of lectin and Spike proteins, at micromolar concentrations, resulted in co-precipitation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) generated data consistent with this observation. Specifically, Spike protein alone eluted at a volume of 13 mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), consistent with its molecular mass of ~500 kDa and previous reports (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></italic>). In the presence of OAA or BOA, each at either 5:1 or 10:1 molar excess, additional elution peaks were observed, at ~8 mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), the exclusion limit of the column, suggesting that large molecular mass complexes are formed. Visualization of the material in the peak fractions by negative stain electron microscopy revealed large amorphous aggregates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Building on these observations, we characterized the concentration dependence of OAA- and BOA-induced aggregation of Spike protein by dynamic light scattering (DLS). At concentrations as low as 60 nM BOA or 125 nM OAA, a significant increase in the hydrodynamic radius of the Spike protein complex was observed. This increase in hydrodynamic radius continued with increasing lectin concentration until the detector limit was reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, we used SeTau-405 fluorescently labeled BOA in fluorescence titration experiments with Spike. In agreement with the above results, saturable binding was observed with a half-saturation point between 30-60 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). This value is the same order of magnitude as the measured inhibitory concentrations BOA in infectivity assays.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Mechanism of Inhibition</title><p id="P10">The high mannose glycan on N234 of the Spike protein has been implicated in regulating the position of the RBD (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></italic>). We therefore considered the possibility that BOA binding to this particular glycan plays a role in its inhibition of viral entry. To test this idea, we generated pseudoviruses expressing Spike protein variants N234A and as a control N165A. While the N165A variant infected Vero E6 cells, the N234A variant was noninfectious (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>), confirming that the identity of N234 and/or the glycan at this position is important for viral entry. As N165 is a complex glycan and thus not targeted by BOA, deletion of this glycan by the N165A mutation had minimal impact on BOA’s ability to inhibit viral entry, resulting in an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 10 ± 2 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5D</xref>). Given that the N234A pseudovirus was not infectious, N234A Spike and BOA interactions were assessed <italic>in vitro</italic> using size exclusion chromatography. Similar to what was observed with WT Spike protein, BOA and N234A Spike eluted at ~8 mL, the exclusion limit of the column, consistent with the formation of soluble aggregates. To corroborate our experimental observations, we computationally evaluated the solvent accessibility of the glycans on the Spike protein structure using different size probes, ranging in radius from 1.4 Å, comparable to a water molecule, to 20 Å, comparable to the size of BOA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). The data indicate that the N234 glycan is buried in the WT Spike structure and that BOA interacts with the N234A Spike variant through multiple glycans. It is likely that N234 glycan is inaccessible to BOA and does not play an important role in BOA-mediated inhibition.</p><p id="P11">The role of multivalency in the interaction between BOA and Spike was tested by removing three of the four glycan binding sites on BOA. Key arginine, glutamic acid, and tryptophan residues were substituted by alanine. The resulting BOAd3WRE1 variant (W18A:R101A:E64A:W218A:R170AE197A:W152A:R261A:E236A) is a monovalent version of BOA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) that retains the wild-type (WT) BOA fold and is capable of sugar binding, as evidenced by NMR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). DLS measurements revealed that the BOAd3WRE1 variant fails to aggregate Spike at nanomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly, SEC of Spike in the presence of BOAd3WRE1 shows that the elution volume of the complex is only slightly changed from that of Spike alone, indicating that no large soluble aggregates are formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In agreement with the above <italic>in vitro</italic> data, BOAd3WRE1 failed to interfere with infectivity of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 or pseudovirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D and E</xref>), demonstrating the importance of multivalency in the interaction between OAA and Spike for antiviral activity.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Effectiveness Against Variants of Concern</title><p id="P12">As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, mutations that facilitate transmission and/or immune escape are classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as variants of concern (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></italic>). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). For all variants of concern, decreased recognition by several antibodies has been reported and symptomatic infections in fully vaccinated individuals with these variants have been observed (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></italic>). Numerous mutations in the virus, including to the Spike gene, have been mapped, especially for regions in the protein under selective pressure, such as position 484 in the RBD or position 681 in the furin cleavage site of the Spike protein (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></italic>). In contrast, all 22 sites of Asn-linked glycans have remained invariant since the original SARS-CoV-2 isolates in 2019 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that Spike retains its original glycan shield. Therefore, BOA should be able to interact with these sugars and retain its ability to inhibit cellular entry of these viral variants. This was tested for the Munich isolate, Delta, and Omicron variants, and only negligible changes in EC<sub>50</sub> were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). BOA-mediated inhibition was also tested using replication-defective lentiviruses that were pseudotyped with the Spike protein from several variants of concern. Our data show that BOA inhibits Alpha, Beta, Gamma,Delta, and Omicron variants of concern with EC<sub>50</sub> values similar to that of the ancestral virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>BOA is a potential Pan-CoV inhibitor</title><p id="P13">Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 2003 are closely related coronavirus with similar Spike protein structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), exhibiting 70% amino acid sequence identity, we evaluated whether BOA can also inhibit SARS-CoV 2003. Importantly, both Spike proteins possess 22 sites of N-linked glycosylation, with 28% and 32% oligomannose content found in the Spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 2003, respectively (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></italic>). Gratifyingly, BOA inhibits infection by SAR-CoV 2003 with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 26 ± 0.3 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), the same order of magnitude as seen for the SARS-CoV-2 variants (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C, D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">The ability of three lectins (BOA, OAA, and GRFT) to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was evaluated employing different assays. While GRFT exhibited no activity in all assays, both BOA and OAA possess potent inhibitory activity. BOA and OAA belong to the same structural family and bind to identical sugar substructures of high mannose glycans (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></italic>), whereas GRFT is structurally very different and binds to the terminal sugars in the D2 and D3 arms of high mannose glycans (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></italic>). Unfortunately, conflicting reports on GRFT’s activity towards SARS-CoV-2 infection exist, describing very different EC<sub>50</sub> values of 6 nM (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></italic>) or 300 nM (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></italic>). Since we did not observe any inhibition at 80 nM GRFT concentration, our results are in line with the data reported by the Jiang lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Whether the observed disparities are due to different cellular glycan processing, variations in viral isolates, or specific details in the assays remains to be evaluated.</p><p id="P15">The key structural difference between OAA and BOA lies in the number of beta barrel domains and the number of glycan binding sites: BOA contains two domains and therefore four glycan binding sites, while OAA has a single beta-barrel with two binding sites. Since anti-viral activity appears to be related to glycan binding, BOA, with twice the glycan binding sites compared to OAA, is a more potent inhibitor. Likewise, removing three of the four sites on BOA obliterates activity, confirming that multi-site interactions are essential. Considering our biophysical assays that report the formation of soluble aggregates at nanomolar concentrations, the multi-site interaction between BOA and the Spike protein most likely accounts for the anti-viral activity of the lectin.</p><p id="P16">Since one or more glycans on the Spike protein are likely targeted by BOA and given the reported importance of the N234 glycan for the conformation of the Spike RBD that engages the cellular receptor ACE2, we aimed to test whether the N234A Spike glycan deletion variant could be inhibited by BOA. However, because pseudovirus carrying the N234A Spike modification was noninfectious, a specific role for the glycan in BOA-mediated viral inhibition could not be ascertained. Instead, the inability of N234A virus to infect cells suggests that N234 and/or its glycan is essential for viral entry. The latter possibility is supported by the <italic>in silico</italic> and biophysical observations made by Casilano and colleagues (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></italic>), identifying the 234 glycan as essential for Spike function. Since N234A Spike protein and BOA still interact <italic>in vitro</italic>, as seen by our SEC results, glycans other than the one attached at 234 must play a role in the interaction.</p><p id="P17">What picture emerges from our observations? Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggest that BOA binds sugars on multiple Spike proteins, possibly crosslinking different Spike proteins on a single virion or crosslinking Spike proteins on different virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Such a mechanism is compatible with results obtained for the 2G12 antibody, which binds to glycans at positions 709, 717, and 801 of the Spike protein but fails to inhibit viral infection (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></italic>). Because 2G12 is a monovalent glycan-binding antibody (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></italic>), it is not able to crosslink the Spike protein, in contrast to BOA and OAA that can bind in a multi-site mode. Therefore, we posit that BOA inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with simultaneous binding to multiple Spike proteins. This mechanistic model is further supported by our finding that a monovalent BOA variant binds the Spike protein but does not form soluble aggregates <italic>in vitro</italic> and fails to inhibit viral entry.</p><p id="P18">SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern possess minimal changes with respect glycosylation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></italic>). For this reason and because BOA inhibition of viral entry is mediated through interactions with glycans on the Spike protein, BOA is a potent inhibitor against variants of concern. Our finding that BOA also inhibits an evolutionarily similar virus, SARS-CoV 2003, demonstrates that the inhibitory activity of BOA is minimally dependent on protein sequence. Since BOA inhibits viral entry of all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as SARS-CoV 2003, our findings may open the way to develop and exploit multivalent glycan binders in the quest to generate pan-coronavirus inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P19">The potent inhibitory activity of the BOA lectin towards SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated and characterized.
