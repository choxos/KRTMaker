We investigated links between blood DNA methylation and child height in four LMIC cohorts (n=1927) and identified a robust association at three CpGs in the suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (<italic>SOCS3</italic>) gene which replicated in a high-income country cohort (n=879). <italic>SOCS3</italic> methylation (<italic>SOCS3m</italic>) – height associations were independent of genetic effects. Mendelian randomization analysis confirmed a causal effect of <italic>SOCS3m</italic> on height. In longitudinal analysis in a LMIC cohort, <italic>SOCS3m</italic> explained a maximum 9.5% of height variance in mid-childhood while the variance explained by height polygenic risk score increased from birth to 21 years (2% to 18%). Children’s <italic>SOCS3m</italic> was associated with prenatal maternal folate and socio-economic status. <italic>In-vitro</italic> characterization confirmed a regulatory effect of <italic>SOCS3m</italic> on gene expression.

It is strongly influenced by growth in childhood and short stature is associated with an increased risk of various diseases in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Multiple studies have investigated the genetic basis of height and a large number of height-associated variants have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of 5.4 million adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, we identified 12,111 SNPs across different ancestries that together accounted for 90-100% of genetic heritability related to height. However, these SNPs explained 40% of adult phenotypic height variance in Europeans and only 10-20% in non-Europeans, suggesting that non-genetic factors may contribute to substantially more height variation in non-Europeans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Evidence from longitudinal studies suggests that the relative genetic contribution increases with age, while environmental exposures show greater impact during early childhood and have long-term consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, the biological mechanisms mediating environmental effects on height during early stages of growth are poorly understood.</p><p id="P3">Numerous environmental factors are known to influence an individual’s growth during childhood, including nutrition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, infection load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, socio-economic status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and prenatal maternal nutritional status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. For example, children exposed to poor nutritional conditions and high infectious environments are at a higher risk of stunting and manifest associated developmental delays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2021 estimates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> indicate that a large proportion of stunted children reside in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), particularly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa where undernutrition and associated comorbidities are more prevalent compared to high-income countries (HIC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. This offers a potential explanation for the disparity in height variation attributed to non-genetic factors between LMIC and high-income countries.</p><p id="P4">Environmental factors can influence a phenotype through their impact on epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation (DNAm) and histone modifications, both of which can influence gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. DNAm has been linked to environmental exposures including nutrition, environmental pollutants and various prenatal risk factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Earlier studies on the epigenetic basis of adult height heritability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> suggest modulation of DNAm patterns at height-associated genes as a candidate mechanism for mediating environmental effects on height. However, there are no genome-wide epigenetic investigations on height in childhood. Such studies may reveal biological mechanisms underlying height and stunting, especially in children from LMIC where environmental effects during growth are greater.</p><p id="P5">In this study we performed a discovery epigenome-wide association analysis (EWAS) to identify CpGs where DNAm is associated with height in children from an LMIC cohort (India) and tested for replication in three independent LMIC cohorts from India and The Gambia and one HIC cohort from the United Kingdom (UK). Our aim was to (i) identify CpGs associated with child height; (ii) explore genetic and epigenetic contributions to child height variation over time; and (iii) probe the influence of early-life exposures on the establishment of DNAm at height-associated loci. We additionally probed causal pathways within a Mendelian randomisation framework and performed <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments in cell lines to understand the effect of methylation on gene expression at height-associated CpGs. To our knowledge, our study is the first to report genome-wide DNA methylation associations with height in children from LMIC.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Study participants, baseline characteristics and study design</title><p id="P6">We investigated associations between DNAm and child height in LMIC populations using data from four independent cohorts, two Indian and two Gambian.
