In rodents, the majority of visual signaling in the dorsal stream is transmitted to frontal motor cortices via extrastriate visual areas surrounding V1, but exactly where and to what extent V1 feeds into motor-projecting visual regions is not well known. To address this we employed a dual labeling strategy in male and female mice in which efferent projections from V1 were labeled anterogradely, and motor-projecting neurons in higher visual areas were labeled with retrogradely traveling adeno-associated virus (rAAV-retro) injected in M2. In flattened sections of dorsal cortex, the most pronounced colocalization V1 output and M2 input occurred in extrastriate areas AM, PM, RL and AL. Coronal sections further showed that neurons in both superficial and deep layers in these regions project to M2, but high resolution volumetric reconstructions revealed that the vast majority of putative synaptic contacts from V1 onto M2-projecting neurons occurred in layer 2/3. These findings support the existence of a dorsal processing stream in the mouse visual system, where visual signals reach motor cortex largely via feedforward projections in anteriorly and medially located extrastriate areas.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cortical connectivity</kwd><kwd>anatomical tracing</kwd><kwd>visual cortex</kwd><kwd>extrastriate cortex</kwd><kwd>frontal cortex</kwd><kwd>motor cortex</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">A common feature of visual cortical organization across mammals is that visual signals from the eye enter primary visual cortex (V1) via the thalamus, then travel to higher visual areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Benevento &amp; Standage, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Frost &amp; Caviness, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kaas, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Rosa &amp; Krubitzer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Salin &amp; Bullier, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Simmons et al., 1982</xref>) which process progressively distinct components of visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Froudarakis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Maunsell &amp; Newsome, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Nassi &amp; Callaway, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Niell, 2015</xref>).

The notion of a dorsal stream in rodents has been further supported by work demonstrating causal contributions of higher visual cortical projections to fine-grained visuomotor control in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>), and has prompted investigations into the role of dorsal stream pathways in the production and perception of naturalistic actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Tombaz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Viaro et al., 2021</xref>) and spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">McNaughton et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Although in mice it has been established that several of the ∼10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Froudarakis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wang &amp; Burkhalter, 2007</xref>) higher-visual, or extrastriate, areas send direct projections to frontal and midline motor cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Zingg et al., 2014</xref>), several pieces of the puzzle remain missing regarding the anatomical chain by which cortical signaling propagates from V1 to motor areas. For example, it is not known whether the output from V1 is uniformly distributed across frontally-projecting extrastriate cortex, if there are regional preferences among these areas or if there is a laminar profile characteristic of such projections.</p><p id="P4">We sought to address these questions using a dual pathway tracing approach in which efferent fibers from V1 were labeled using the anterograde tracer 10 KD biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), and motor-projecting extrastriate neurons were labeled via retrogradely traveling, recombinant AAV2/1-retro (rAAV-retro) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>) in secondary motor cortex (M2).

We visualized the areal overlap of retrograde and anterograde labeling in whole-hemisphere flattened sections of cortex, which revealed a characteristic arrowhead shape of M2-projecting neurons along the anterior perimeter of V1, which overlapped with V1 output fibers in the anteromedial (AM), posteromedial (PM), rostrolateral (RL) and anterolateral (AL) extrastriate areas. In coronal sections, retrograde labeling from M2 appeared columnar in anterior extrastriate areas, spanning superficial and deep layers, and became progressively more superficial at farther posterior locations. Morphological 3D reconstructions revealed substantial putative connectivity between V1 axons and M2-projecting neurons in layers 2/3. Together, our results show that V1 output bound for motor cortex is broadcast non-uniformly across extrastriate regions, and is relayed via feedforward projections largely in layer 2/3.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P5">Eight female C57BL/6JBomTac mice (23-25g, Taconic) and one male C57BL/6JBomTac mouse (33 g) were used in the project.

At its anterior extent, retrograde M2 labeling formed a column at the border of the medial PPC (mPPC) and agranular retrosplenial cortex (RSA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> coronal section), then, progressing posteriorly, split into medial and lateral branches that overlapped with mPPC and AM medially, and lateral PPC (lPPC) and RL laterally. Retrograde labeling from M2 was strong in superficial and deep layers in all PPC sub-regions as well as AM and RL as far posterior as Bregma (B) level -3.15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figs. 2-1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">2-2</xref>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> coronal sections; Bregma location based on (Paxinos, 2012)). Further posteriorly, strong retrograde labeling was observed mostly in superficial layers 1-3 (≥ B -3.15) in PM. Laterally, a similar pattern was observed in AL and V1, with the exception that layer 5 was almost devoid of neuronal labeling and layer 6 only showed sparse neuronal labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> sections; magnified insets, left). Retrograde labeling tapered off completely in all layers at the farthest posterior locations, with no M2-projecting neurons remaining in areas LM or LI, or at the posterior extent of V1 (≥ B -4.23; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, right). Thus, of the six identifiable extrastriate areas in this tissue series, regions RL, AM, PM, and AL, in addition to the anterior-most portion of V1, were potential nodes at which visual signals were conveyed to secondary motor cortex.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Neuronal reconstructions and localization of putative synaptic contacts</title><p id="P21">The colocalization of V1 fibers and M2-projecting neurons in specific extrastriate areas suggested they could serve as nodes for the propagation of visual information to the motor system, but overlap <italic>per se</italic> does not mean that synaptic connections are in fact present.

We note that the resulting reconstructed cells were biased in that they were chosen from areas that appeared to have colocalized labeling. Neurons were selected for reconstruction based on three criteria: (i) the presence of a clear and completely filled neuronal soma associated with (ii) filled, long spiny dendrites, and (iii) a sufficiently densely labeled axonal plexus from V1 overlapping the dendrites, where connectivity was expected to occur (see examples in magnified insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Putative synapses were identified using close spatial proximity (&lt; 0.25μm) between axonal varicosities and dendritic spines as a proxy for synaptic contacts ((Methods); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Koganezawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Wouterlood et al., 2008</xref>)), and group data were generated for areas AM (n = 8 neurons from 3 mice), AL (7 neurons, 2 mice), PM (7 neurons, 3 mice).</p><p id="P22">Area AM, which had high density retrograde labeling from M2, had the lowest mean number of putative V1 synapses per neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>, top; mean = 38.8 ± 13.7 SEM; median = 25; range of 7 to 136 per neuron; all reconstructed AM neurons shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3-1</xref>).

Co-labeling in these regions was confirmed in coronal sections, which revealed a columnar-like organization of M2-projecting neurons across deep and superficial layers in AM and RL which receded into mainly superficial layers posteriorly in PM, AL and in V1. A higher resolution analysis of reconstructed neurons further showed that the majority of identifiable putative synaptic connections between V1 and M2-projecting neurons occurred in layer 2/3.</p><p id="P24">Though our observations were consistent across animals, there are methodological limitations in the study which could influence the patterns of connectivity we observed. In visual cortex, for example, the posterior location of the injection produced strong labeling in LM, LI and AL, whereas weak labeling was observed in area A, and the medial-lateral location of the injections likely shaped the spatial distribution of labeling within extrastriate areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Figs. 1-1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">2-1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">2-2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hovde et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wang &amp; Burkhalter, 2007</xref>). The retrograde labeling from M2 was also restricted by the use of single injections, which were targeted to the posterior sector due to its known connectivity with visual regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Reep et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Zingg et al., 2014</xref>), though this could have biased the distribution of labeling toward medial extrastriate and PPC subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Olsen et al., 2019</xref>). The injections themselves in V1 and M2 were also densest in intermediate layers (mainly layers 2-5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figs. 2-1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">2-2</xref>), which would favor labeling in matching layers in either up-or down-stream regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Callaway, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Felleman &amp; Van Essen, 1991</xref>). Thus, although we directly observed robust feedforward projections from V1 to extrastriate layers 2/3, projections from V1 to the tips of apical dendrites of layer 5 neurons in layer 1 may have been underrepresented. Because of these constraints, the present study was intended to provide a description of the patterns of coincident anterograde and retrograde labeling, rather than a quantitative account of projection densities or the directionality of connections between visual and motor areas.</p><p id="P25">Nevertheless, the conjoint use of anterograde and retrograde labeling afforded a direct snapshot of the anatomical organization of primary visual outputs onto motor cortical inputs, which occurred in the same extrastriate regions hypothesized to comprise the dorsal visual processing stream in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Intratelencephalic (IT)-to-IT projections, which originate mainly in layers 2/3 and layer 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Douglas &amp; Martin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Harris &amp; Shepherd, 2015</xref>), were labeled strongly in our preparations, and the presence of M2-projecting neurons in layers 2/3 and layer 5 suggests that extrastriate and M2 regions participate in mutual feed-forward and feed-back projection pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Callaway, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Douglas &amp; Martin, 2004</xref>), putting them at nearby stages in the cortical processing hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Felleman &amp; Van Essen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hilgetag et al., 1996</xref>). Indeed, previous work using dual anterograde tracers showed that regions RL and AM are reciprocally connected with M2, and that all three regions shared directional preferences for visual stimuli and eye movements, suggesting that they comprise an extended sensory-motor network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>). The frontally projecting neurons we observed in superficial V1 could also participate in mutual feedback loops with frontal motor areas. Based on existing work, such anatomical loops appear to support visual attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) as well as predicting expected changes in visual flow due to self-generated movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Leinweber et al., 2017</xref>), though for now the exact contributions of these projections are yet to be demonstrated.</p><p id="P27">Although our results provide support for the existence of specialized visual processing streams in rodents, the degree of correspondence with monkeys and carnivores is limited due to considerable differences in brain size, interconnectivity and the relative simplicity of cortical hierarchies in rodents compared to mammals with more differentiated cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Coogan &amp; Burkhalter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Felleman &amp; Van Essen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Krubitzer &amp; Seelke, 2012</xref>; Kaas, 1991). For example, whereas visual cortex in primates projects only to nearby higher visual areas and area MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Felleman &amp; Van Essen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hilgetag et al., 2000</xref>), V1 in rodents projects to a host of non-visual regions including somatosensory, cingulate, retrosplenial and postrhinal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Burwell &amp; Amaral, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Miller &amp; Vogt, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">van Groen &amp; Wyss, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Vogt &amp; Miller, 1983</xref>), suggesting a wider and more direct intermixing of visual signals across sensory and cognitive modalities. Thus, visuomotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Rozzi et al., 2008</xref>) and spatial functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chafee &amp; Crowe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Crowe et al., 2005</xref>), as well as the reference frames in which they are encoded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">X.

Here, we characterized such pathways by injecting anterograde tracers in primary visual cortex (V1) and retrogradely traveling virus in motor cortex (M2), and visualizing where the projections overlapped. We found preferential colocalization of V1 output and M2-projecting neurons in anteriorly- and medially-located higher visual areas. 3D volumetric reconstructions further showed high rates of putative synaptic connections mainly in superficial layers. Thus, visual signals in the mouse dorsal visual stream reach motor areas at least in part via superficial, feedforward connections in a subset of extrastriate areas.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Projections from V1 (cyan) and M2-projecting neurons (magenta) viewed in a representative tangential section through superficial layers in flattened dorsal cortex.</title><p>Top, A tangential section through layer 2/3 shows the BDA injection site in V1 (marked with asterisk; see also inset at top left) and projections to extrastriate areas at the periphery of V1. Projection neurons targeting M2 are shown in magenta (injection schematic shown in inset), and colocalized with V1 efferent fibers in areas AL, RL, AM and PM. The outlines of V1 and the S1 barrel fields were traced using myeloarchitectonic patterns and M2AChR staining from a neighboring section in layer 4 (Methods). Note, a shorter exposure time was applied when scanning the injection site than for projections to avoid signal saturation (Methods).

Approximate bregma coordinates (B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Paxinos and Franklin, 2012</xref>) are noted on each section; scale bar = 500μm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS158363-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Anatomical reconstructions and proximity analysis of V1 axons and M2-projecting neurons in extrastriate areas AM, AL and PM. A</title><p>Representative reconstruction of a single M2-projecing pyramidal neuron from area AL (magenta) receiving synaptic input from V1 axons (cyan); putative synaptic contacts are shown as blue circles and pre-synaptic varicosities are visualized as green enlargements on the V1 axons. They are not visible at points of putative contact due to the overlapping blue circles. Black scale bar = 20 μm. <bold>B</bold>. Top row, inset, a low magnification scan of a coronal tissue section highlighting the portion of area AM where the reconstruction was performed. Top row, lower left, a higher magnification field of view of area AM shown above. Top row, middle, reconstruction of the neuron in the stippled box to the left, with the same labeling convention as the example in <bold>A</bold>. Top row, right, mean (solid line) and distribution of putative synapses for all reconstructed neurons in area AM. Middle row, same as top, but for area AL. Bottom row, same upper rows, but for area PM. Black scale bar = 20 μm. White scale bars = 50 μm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS158363-f003"/></fig></floats-group></article>
