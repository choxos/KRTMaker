PD is a complex disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to motor symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Sleep and circadian disruption can be observed years before the onset of motor symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, raising the possibility that circadian rhythm disruption precedes and contributes to PD development. Studies using animal models of PD showed that circadian disruption could exacerbate neurodegeneration and motor symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. However, it remains elusive whether circadian disturbances causally drive neurodegeneration or they are caused by neurodegeneration, partly because PD pathology includes dysfunction of the brain regions regulating sleep, resulting in disrupted sleep-wake cycles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Dissecting mechanistic links between circadian clock disruption and neurodegeneration—two intertwined and potentially synergistic processes—is critical for developing reliable diagnostic tools and treatment strategies for PD.</p><p id="P3"><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is a genetically tractable model system for studying neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.

The adult fly midbrain contains approximately eight clusters of DA neurons projecting to various brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Functional impairments or loss of DA neurons in the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) and protocerebral anterior lateral 1 (PPL1) clusters have been consistently observed in PD models, in addition to the losses in other clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The PAM cluster comprises ∼130 neurons per hemisphere, accounting for approximately 80% of fly brain DA neurons. PAM neurons are highly heterogeneous in their projection patterns and functions and play critical roles in behavioral processes such as olfactory associative learning, foraging, sleep, and locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.

The core feedback loop of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian clock consists of CLOCK/CYCLE (CLK/CYC) heterodimers that activate transcription of the <italic>period</italic> (<italic>per</italic>) and <italic>timeless</italic> (<italic>tim</italic>) genes and PER and TIM proteins that feedback-inhibit CLK/CYC activity. CLK/CYC also activates the transcription of genes encoding VRILLE (VRI) and PDP-1, negatively and positively regulating <italic>Clk</italic>, forming a stabilizing loop interlocked with the core loop <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Circadian clocks are present in approximately 150 pacemaker neurons and 1800 glia in the fly brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Pacemaker neurons are classified into functionally and anatomically diverse subgroups: small and large lateral ventral neurons (s- and l-LNvs), lateral dorsal neurons (LNds), lateral posterior neurons, and three groups of dorsal neurons (DN1s, DN2s, and DN3s). The s- and l-LNvs express the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF), essential for synchronizing rhythmicity across the pacemaker circuit. The PDF-positive s-LNvs (the M-cells) drive morning peak of activity under light-dark cycles (LD) and control free-running 24-h period locomotor rhythms in constant darkness (DD). The robustness and flexibility of the locomotor behavior adapting to environmental conditions require the communication between M-cells and the second set of pacemaker subtypes, the E-cells, comprising the PDF-negative fifth s-LNv, half of the LNds, and some of the DN1s (Reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>). The pacemaker circuit controls circadian locomotor output and regulates brain-wide rhythmic physiology by conveying time-of-day information to areas in the brain such as the mushroom body (MB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Misalignment between environmental cycles and endogenous circadian rhythms increases the risk for physical and psychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Genetic and environmental disruption of circadian rhythms in flies leads to adverse health consequences, including increased mortality in response to oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and lifespan reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, suggesting that the mechanisms underpinning the link between circadian disruption and diseases can be studied in flies. <italic>Clk</italic> loss of function in the s-LNv pacemaker neurons causes loss of DA neurons in the PPL1 cluster, resulting in age-dependent locomotor decline; intriguingly, this process is PDF-dependent and circadian-clock-independent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, questions remain regarding whether and how the circadian system regulates the (patho-)physiology of DA neurons.</p><p id="P6">Here, we used <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model to ask whether circadian clocks causally impact degenerative processes in PD. We found that DA neurons in the PAM cluster exhibit diurnal and circadian rhythms in vulnerability to oxidative stress. Loss of circadian clock genes results in age-dependent PAM neuron loss and exacerbates oxidative stress-induced PAM neuron loss. We identified PAM-α1 neurons as the selectively and rhythmically susceptible DA neuron subtype and found that circadian pacemaker circuit is presynaptic to this subgroup. Oxidative stress-induced loss of PAM-<italic>α</italic>1 neurons leads to changes in sleep, reminiscent of PD non-motor symptoms. These findings establish a direct role of circadian clocks in controlling the timing and magnitude of the vulnerability of DA neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Circadian vulnerability of DA neurons to oxidative insults</title><p id="P7">We previously demonstrated that flies exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or paraquat for 24 h display selective loss of DA neurons in the PAM cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. To evaluate dopaminergic neurodegeneration from a circadian perspective, we developed a short-term H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment protocol that can be performed at six timepoints across the day. 7-day-old <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> flies were treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at various concentrations (5% to 20%) and durations (3 h to 6 h), and survival of PAM neurons was assessed 7 days post-treatment by immunostaining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). From the conditions that induced PAM neuron loss, we chose 5% and 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment for 4 h in subsequent experiments because this duration is suitable for performing assays in a circadian fashion and the effect does not saturate. Loss of TH-positive neurons was observed only in the PAM cluster among all DA neuron clusters following the short H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in flies expressing red nuclear fluorescent protein RedStinger with the PAM neuron-specific <italic>R58E02</italic> GAL4 driver resulted in the reduction of RedStinger-positive cells, suggesting that oxidative insults cause loss of neurons and not merely the reduction in TH expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Therefore, we focused on this group of DA neurons in subsequent studies.</p><p id="P8">To test whether the vulnerability of PAM neurons to oxidative stress is rhythmic, we next performed the short H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in a circadian fashion. 7-day-old <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> flies entrained to LD (12h:12h light-dark cycles) were exposed to 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 4 h, following a 5-h food and water deprivation. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure was initiated at a different Zeitgeber Time (ZT) across the day, and DA neurons were analyzed 7 days post-treatment. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Whereas the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment at any time caused significant PAM neuron loss compared to the water-only control, the treatment at ZT20 (8 h after lights-off) resulted in a more significant loss of PAM neurons than the other timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). The highest sensitivity at ZT20 was replicated in the assay with the 4-h 5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, validating its specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). We performed the same experiment in constant darkness (DD) to determine the role of endogenous clocks and LD cycles. Newly hatched flies were entrained for three days in LD and then placed in DD for the remainder of the experiment and treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on the fourth day in DD (DD4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The treatment at CT4 (4 h after subjective lights-on) with 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) or 5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>) caused a more significant PAM neuron loss than the other timepoints. These results suggest intrinsic rhythmicity in the vulnerability of PAM neurons to oxidative stress modulated by light.</p><p id="P9">To determine whether circadian clocks control the intrinsic rhythms of PAM neuron vulnerability, we next used <italic>per</italic> null (<italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic>, also known as <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic>) mutant flies devoid of molecular clocks. We first quantified PAM neuron counts in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> with anti-TH staining and by expressing RedStinger without oxidative stress from days 1 to 14 of age. We found that <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> flies were born with fewer PAM neurons and displayed a marked, age-dependent loss of PAM neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). The <italic>tim</italic> null (<italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic>) mutants similarly displayed a reduced number of PAM neurons on day 1 and a progressive loss thereafter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). Both <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> and <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic> arrhythmic mutants displayed locomotor deficits, as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). These findings suggest that disruption of circadian clocks interferes with the development of DA neurons in the PAM cluster and accelerates their age-dependent degeneration.</p><p id="P10">Because a previous study reported that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure elicits a higher rate of mortality in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> than in wild-type flies<sup>29</sup>, we also examined the effect of various concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on PAM neuron survival in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> flies at a single timepoint; 2.5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which did not affect PAM neurons in <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> and <italic>Canton-S</italic> (<italic>CS</italic>), robustly induced PAM neurodegeneration in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). This finding suggests that loss of <italic>per</italic> enhances the vulnerability of PAM neurons to oxidative stress-induced degeneration. We next performed the circadian oxidative treatment with 5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in LD and DD on <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> flies. The <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> flies treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at any timepoint showed a significant loss of PAM neurons than the control group treated with water only. In LD, the treatment at ZT12 resulted in a more significant loss of PAM neurons than the other timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). In contrast, the difference among timepoints was abolished in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). These findings suggest that the circadian clock gene <italic>per</italic> controls the magnitude and temporal variations of PAM neuron sensitivity to oxidative stress. In the absence of functional clocks, light can impose diurnal rhythms of PAM neuron vulnerability.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The circadian neural circuit controls the rhythmic vulnerability of PAM neurons</title><p id="P11">Because PAM neurons are not clock-containing cells, the rhythmic vulnerability of PAM neurons is non-cell-autonomously controlled by clocks located elsewhere. Several mechanisms might drive rhythms in non-clock-containing neurons, including the rhythmic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> uptake by feeding/drinking rhythms, systemic rhythmic changes in the brain environment, and the rhythmic modulation of the physiology of PAM neurons by circadian pacemaker neurons.</p><p id="P12">To test whether the differential loss of PAM neurons is caused by ingesting more H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution at one time than the others, we performed a feeding assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Flies were fed with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or water mixed with blue food dye, which sticks to the gut and is not eliminated or digested. Then, spectrophotometry was performed on homogenized fly bodies to measure the amount of dye ingested. In LD and DD, flies displayed rhythmic feeding patterns when fed with the control solution (water and dye), congruent with a previous study demonstrating the circadian regulation of feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In contrast, the feeding pattern of the 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-containing solution was not rhythmic. Its uptake was significantly lower than the control solution across all timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). This finding is consistent with the finding that 2.5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> caused a more significant neuronal loss than the higher concentration in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), probably because flies ingest more H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solutions at lower concentrations. Therefore, daily variations in the feeding pattern do not account for the circadian vulnerability of PAM neurons. We also found that flies drink three to five times more in DD than in LD, which explains the more pronounced loss of PAM neurons following the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in DD than in LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S1C and D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The circadian H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> feeding assay requires flies to be starved before and during H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure. We next tested whether the starvation and dehydration associated with the assay led to the rhythmic PAM neurodegeneration. To this end, flies were removed from food and water for 9 h, 5 h before and 4 h after ZT20. 7 days later, PAM neurons were examined by anti-TH immune staining. The control group was given access to water for 4 h after a 5-h starvation/water deprivation period. The results showed no changes in PAM neuron count between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This finding suggests that the loss of PAM neurons and their rhythmicity are not caused by starvation or dehydration before or during the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment.</p><p id="P14">Endogenous oxidative stress levels vary daily in flies and mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We wondered whether the rhythms in endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the fly brain and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> administered at specific times would accumulate to trigger a rhythmic neuronal loss in the PAM cluster. To test this possibility, we used MitoSOX (a ROS-sensitive fluorescent dye targeted to mitochondria) to monitor mitochondrial ROS levels across the day in PAM neurons labeled with <italic>R58E02&gt;UAS-EGFP</italic> in <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> flies. In 7-day-old flies, MitoSOX fluorescence intensity in PAM neurons in LD showed daily variations and peaked at ZT20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), the time when PAM neurons are the most vulnerable to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). This finding suggests that oscillating levels of endogenous ROS combined with the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment might account for the differential loss of PAM neurons in LD. In contrast, no significant differences in MitoSOX levels were observed between timepoints in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Therefore, another mechanism under the control of circadian clocks gates the vulnerability of PAM neurons in DD.</p><p id="P15">To test whether PER-expressing clock neurons directly or indirectly modulate PAM neuron vulnerability, we re-expressed the PER protein in clock neurons in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> mutants and examined PAM neurons. Genetic rescue of <italic>per</italic> with the pan-clock neuron driver <italic>Clk1982-GAL4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> significantly increased the number of PAM neurons at day 14 compared to <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. Thus, the pan clock-neuron <italic>per</italic> rescue prevented the accelerated age-dependent loss of PAM neurons caused by loss of <italic>per</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). <italic>Clk1982&gt;per</italic> also reversed the exacerbated loss of PAM neurons following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> to the level of <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). These results suggest that loss of PER in clock neurons is responsible for the enhanced PAM neuron loss in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> mutants, at least in part.</p><p id="P16">To test if any subclass of clock neurons is essential for the role of PER in regulating PAM neuron survival, we next performed <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> genetic rescue using <italic>Pdf-GAL4</italic>, expressed in the s- and l-LNvs except the fifth s-LNv <sup>34</sup>, and <italic>DvPdf-GAL4</italic>, which targets all LNvs, three CRY-negative LNds, and one CRY/ITP double-positive LNd<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

In contrast, the <italic>trans</italic>-Tango assay with <italic>Pdf-GAL4</italic> did not result in any positive signal within the PAM cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), suggesting that the s- and l-LNv neurons are not presynaptic to PAM neurons. These findings taken together suggest that all or some <italic>DvPdf</italic>-positive but <italic>Pdf</italic>-negative cells (i.e., the three CRY-negative LNds, one CRY/ITP double-positive LNd, and the fifth LNv) are presynaptic to PAM neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Identification of the vulnerable subpopulation of PAM neurons</title><p id="P18">PAM neurons are highly heterogeneous, encompassing 14 subclasses of morphologically and functionally diverse neurons projecting to different subdomains of the MB and other brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Because the number of neurons lost following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment was relatively consistent between experiments within the same genotype, we wondered if the vulnerable neurons belong to a specific subset(s) of PAM neurons. To test this possibility, we first used classical GAL4 drivers to label most or some PAM neurons with GFP to roughly locate the subclass vulnerable to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> administered at ZT20. Most (8 of 13) PAM neurons that degenerated after the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> insult belonged to the group expressing <italic>R58E02-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To identify the vulnerable PAM subgroup within the <italic>R58E02</italic>-positive cells, we tested split-GAL4s.

Neuronal loss was observed within the clusters labeled by the MB315C and MB299B drivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B and C</xref>). PAM neuron subsets labeled by MB315C innervate the γ-lobe, and those expressing MB299B innervate the α-lobe of the MB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested one more split-GAL4 driver (MB441B) that does not contain the <italic>R58E02</italic>-driven component but is expressed in the PAM neuron subset projecting to the MB γ-lobe. As expected, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment caused a loss of neurons within the subpopulation labeled by MB441B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B and C</xref>). These results suggest that PAM neurons innervating the MB γ3, γ5, and α1 subdomains (PAM γ3, γ5, and α1 subgroups, respectively) are subpopulations vulnerable to neurodegeneration after oxidative insults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Of these, the PAM α1 subgroup labeled by MB299B was the most vulnerable, as more than 50% degenerated after the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B-D</xref>).</p><p id="P20">We next determined whether these PAM subpopulations were rhythmically vulnerable to oxidative stress, focusing on the most vulnerable MB299B-labeled neurons (PAM-α1). We treated 7-day-old flies expressing GFP with the MB299B split-GAL4 at ZT8 and ZT20 with 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and the GFP-positive cell count was scored 7 days later. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment at ZT8 caused the loss of around three to four neurons, whereas, on average, 7 neurons were lost from the treatment at ZT20. Thus, PAM-α1 indeed showed the rhythmicity in vulnerability to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E and F</xref>).

Because PDF-positive s-LNvs can synchronize the LNds through PDF/PDFR signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, these results suggest that the presence of PER within the PDF-positive s-LNvs is sufficient to convey a protective signal to the MB299B neurons via LNds.</p><p id="P31">Arrhythmic <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> and <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic> mutants display age-dependent loss of PAM neurons.
