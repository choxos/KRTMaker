Nonetheless, these vaccines, including mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2, retained their ability to protect against severe disease and death, suggesting that other aspects of immunity control infection in the lung. Although vaccine-elicited antibodies can bind Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) and mediate effector functions against SARS-CoV-2 variants, and this property correlates with improved clinical COVID-19 outcome, a causal relationship between Fc effector functions and vaccine-mediated protection against infection has not been established. Here, using passive and active immunization approaches in wild-type and Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR) KO mice, we determined the requirement for Fc effector functions to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The antiviral activity of passively transferred immune serum was lost against multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains in mice lacking expression of activating FcγRs, especially murine FcγR III (CD16), or depleted of alveolar macrophages. After immunization with the preclinical mRNA-1273 vaccine, protection against Omicron BA.5 infection in the respiratory tract also was lost in mice lacking FcγR III. Our passive and active immunization studies in mice suggest that Fc-FcγR engagement and alveolar macrophages are required for vaccine-induced antibody-mediated protection against infection by antigenically changed SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron strains.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019, 638 million infections and 6.6 million deaths have been reported (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19.who.int/">https://covid19.who.int/</ext-link>). As part of the global response to COVID-19, vaccines using multiple different platforms (mRNA, adenoviral-vectored, subunit-based, and inactivated virion) were generated and deployed resulting in reductions in symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. These SARS-CoV-2 vaccines all targeted the viral spike protein derived from strains that circulated in early 2020. However, the continuing evolution of SARS-CoV-2, with increasing numbers of amino acid changes in the spike protein amidst successive waves of infection, has jeopardized the immunity generated by these vaccines and the control of virus infection and transmission <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can induce neutralizing antibodies that inhibit infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Correlates of vaccine protection initially focused on the neutralizing activity of elicited anti-spike antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Emerging variants of concern, which have amino acid substitutions in regions targeted by neutralizing antibodies including the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N terminal domain (NTD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, have jeopardized vaccine-mediated protection against infection and prompted the development of bivalent vaccine boosters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Indeed, a substantial decrease in the neutralizing activity of serum antibodies elicited by vaccines against the ancestral Wuhan-1 virus has been observed against emerging variants, which has correlated with symptomatic breakthrough infections, especially with Omicron lineage viruses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The large number (&gt;30) of substitutions in the spike protein in Omicron lineage strains, which abrogates or reduces binding of the majority of highly neutralizing vaccine-derived and therapeutic antibodies, has been termed an antigenic shift <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Despite the loss in serum neutralizing activity against variants such as those in Omicron lineage, most individuals remain protected against severe disease and death. The basis for this protection has not been fully determined but could be due to beneficial effects of non-neutralizing antibodies, cross-reactive T cell responses, or anamnestic memory B cell responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Fc effector function activity of non-neutralizing, cross-reactive, anti-spike antibodies is one hypothesized mechanism for protection against antigenically-shifted SARS-CoV-2 variants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, the ability of antibodies to bind Fc-gamma receptors (FcγR) and mediate effector functions correlated with increased survival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Interactions of the conserved Fc region of IgG antibodies with FcγR or complement can promote clearance of virally-infected cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), or complement-dependent deposition and phagocytosis or lysis. Indeed, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that lose their ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants yet still bind the spike protein avidly enough to trigger Fc effector functions retain protective activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Analogously, non-neutralizing antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been linked to protection against variant Omicron strains by virtue of their ability to engage FcγRs and promote clearance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the depletion of RBD-specific antibodies from serum of mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals did not appreciably impact Fc-mediated effector function activity in cell culture <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, suggesting that antibodies recognizing conserved, non-neutralizing epitopes may contribute to protection against variant strains.</p><p id="P5">Although serum-derived anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-mediated Fc effector functions can activate complement deposition, immune cell phagocytosis, and target cell killing <italic>in vitro</italic>, their contribution to protection <italic>in vivo</italic> remains uncertain. Existing data on the role of Fc-FcγR interactions in the context of vaccine-mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2 is largely correlative. To address this gap, we evaluated the impact of Fc effector functions in the context of passive transfer of vaccine-elicited antibodies or active immunization with mRNA-1273 vaccine using wild-type, C1q KO, and FcγR KO C57BL/6 mice and challenge with SARS-CoV-2 viruses. In passive serum transfer experiments, we found that activating FcγRs but not C1q were required to control SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lower respiratory tract, and protection was lost in mice depleted of alveolar macrophages but not neutrophils and monocytes. Experiments with mice lacking individual FcγRs showed the protective effect of passively transferred serum antibody on viral load reduction required expression of FcγR III. To determine the impact of FcγRs in the context of active immunization, wild-type, FcγR I KO, FcγR III KO, and FcγR I/III/IV KO mice were administered a two-dose primary vaccination series with mRNA-1273, evaluated for immunogenicity, and then challenged with the antigenically shifted Omicron BA.5 strain. Although the levels of anti-RBD antibody, neutralizing antibody, and spike-specific T cells were similar in all tested strains of mice, protection against infection in the nasal turbinates and lungs was lost in FcγR III KO and FcγR I/III/IV KO mice. Overall, our results in mice suggest that Fc-FcγR interactions contribute to antiviral protection <italic>in vivo</italic> in the context of both passive and active immunization with legacy vaccines, particularly when neutralizing antibody levels are low against antigenically distant SARS-CoV-2 variant strains.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Immunoglobulin subclass and FcγR binding of vaccine-induced immune serum</title><p id="P6">To begin to evaluate the contribution of Fc effector functions to antibody protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, we profiled vaccine-induced antibodies from sera pooled from immunized C57BL/6 mice using a systems serology assay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. We measured the binding of polyclonal antibodies to several spike proteins (Wuhan-1, B.1.617.2, BA.1, and BA.4/5) and determined their IgG subclass specificity (IgG1, IgG2a, or IgG2c) and ability to interact with specific FcγRs (FcγR IIb, FcγR III, or FcγR IV). We used naïve sera and binding to influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein as negative controls (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a-f</xref>). Immune sera contained higher levels of IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG2c antibodies against Wuhan-1, B.1.617.2, BA.1, and BA.4/.5 but not HA compared to naïve sera (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a-c</xref>). Anti-spike antibody binding to inhibitory (FcγR IIb) and activating (FcγR III and FcγR IV) was higher in immune sera compared to naïve sera for all SARS-CoV-2 spike variants (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d-f</xref>). We also assessed the effector function activity of immune serum using assays that measure spike-specific antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis in murine monocytes (ADCP) and neutrophils (ADNP) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1g-h</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig 1</xref>). Compared to naïve sera, vaccine-elicited immune sera promoted greater ADCP and ADNP activity against the Wuhan-1 and BA.4/.5 spike proteins. In comparison, immune sera did not enhance antibody-dependent natural killer cell activation (CD107a expression, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1i</xref>). Immune sera also promoted antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD) on beads coated with spike proteins compared to HA protein (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1j</xref>). Overall, these studies indicated that our pooled vaccine sera have a diversity of antibodies against spike proteins that enables binding to FcγRs, and most Fc-mediated effector functions in cell culture.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Protection in the lungs conferred by passive sera transfer requires Fc-FcγR engagement</title><p id="P7">To assess the impact of Fc effector functions <italic>in vivo</italic> in the context of polyclonal immune anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, pooled naïve or vaccine-elicited immune sera was transferred passively to 12-week-old male wild-type, FcγR I/III/IV KO (common γ chain KO), or C1q KO C57BL/6 mice; FcγR I/III/IV KO mice lack the common γ chain present in all activating murine FcγRs, whereas C1q KO mice lack C1q, a protein required for initiation of the antibody-dependent complement activation pathway. One day after transfer, mice were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 MA-10 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, and 4 days post-infection (dpi), nasal wash, nasal turbinates, and lungs were harvested (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>). We used the mouse-adapted MA-10 strain for these initial studies because it spreads to the lungs of conventional C57BL/6 mice without a need for ectopic human ACE2 expression. Pooled vaccine-induced immune sera neutralized MA-10 at a 1/3,300 dilution titer, and one day after transfer, serum from recipient mice neutralized MA-10 with a titer of 1/36 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>). In the nasal washes and nasal turbinates of the upper airway of wild-type, FcγR I/III/IV KO, and C1q KO mice, we observed no significant differences in levels of viral RNA or infectious virus among the three groups receiving naive or immune serum. Although there was a trend towards less viral infection in the nasal turbinates of animals receiving immune compared to naïve sera, the comparisons did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c-e</xref>); these results are consistent with the lower accumulation of IgG in the upper respiratory tract after passive transfer by a systemic route <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Results from lung tissues, however, showed a different pattern, with a loss of protection against infection by immune sera (viral RNA levels and infectious virus) in FcγR I/III/IV KO but not in C1q KO mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2f-g</xref>). Thus, FcγR expression in the lower respiratory tract appears important for control of infection after passive antibody transfer.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Antibody protection in the lungs requires FcγR III engagement</title><p id="P8">Because MA-10 is not matched to the vaccine antigen, in the context of passive transfer, we might underestimate the protection against infection afforded by serum neutralizing antibody. To address this issue and also identify which FcγR contributed to the protective phenotype, we passively transferred naïve or immune sera to 12-week-old male wild-type, FcγR I KO, FcγR II KO, FcγR III KO, and FcγR I/III/IV KO congenic C57BL/6 male mice before inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 N501Y/D614G (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>), a more closely matched virus; because this suite of FcγR-deficient C57BL/6 mice lacks human ACE2 expression, we used a virus with a mouse-adapting N501Y mutation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Pooled vaccine-elicited immune sera neutralized WA1/2020 N501Y/D614G more efficiently than MA-10 at a 1/16,750 serum dilution, and one day after transfer, serum from recipient mice neutralized WA1/2020 N501Y/D614G with a titer of 1/750 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>), which exceeds a ~1/50 presumptive correlate of protection in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. As seen with MA-10 infection, in the nasal washes and nasal turbinates of the upper respiratory tract, we did not observe serum antibody protection in wild-type C57BL/6 mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c-e</xref>); thus, we focused analysis on the lung. Indeed, passive transfer of immune sera protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs of wild-type C57BL/6 mice as measured by viral RNA and infectious virus levels (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3f-g</xref>). Similar levels of protection were observed in FcγR I KO and FcγR II KO. However, protection against SARS-CoV-2 lung infection was diminished or lost in FcγR III and FcγR I/III/IV KO mice. These data suggest that even in the context of passive transfer of immune sera with neutralizing activity, protection against lower respiratory tract infection by SARS-CoV-2 is mediated at least in part by Fc interactions with activating FcγRs, particularly FcγR III.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Vaccine-elicited immunity requires Fc-FcγR engagement to confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection</title><p id="P9">We next evaluated the dependence on Fc-FcγR engagement on protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of vaccine-elicited immunity, which induces both cellular and humoral responses. We immunized groups of nine-week-old male wild-type, FcγR I KO, FcγR III KO, and FcγR I/III/IV KO C57BL/6 mice twice over four weeks with 0.25 μg of control or preclinical mRNA-1273 vaccine (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>); we did not immunize FcγR II KO mice, since the virological phenotypes in the context of passive antibody transfer were present in mice lacking activating FcγRs but not FcγR II (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The 0.25 μg dose of mRNA vaccine was used because the B and T cell responses generated in C57BL/6 mice with this dose approximate those observed in humans receiving 100 μg doses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. One potential limitation of this experiment is that a loss of activating FcγRs could affect vaccine-induced immune responses, which might confound interpretation of challenge studies. To evaluate this first, twenty-four days following boosting, serum was obtained to measure binding and neutralizing antibody against WA1/2020 N501Y/D614G and BA.5. As expected, higher levels of serum IgG were detected against Wuhan-1 than BA.5 receptor binding domain (RBD) protein (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b-c</xref>), consistent with the antigenic shift of Omicron lineage strains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, no statistical differences in binding titers were observed between the groups of vaccinated wild-type and FcγR KO mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b-c</xref>). Similarly, lower neutralization titers were detected against BA.5 than WA1/2020 N501Y/D614G, with no substantive differences observed between groups of vaccinated wild-type and FcγR KO (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4d-e</xref>). Thus, mRNA-1273 vaccination induced relatively similar humoral immune responses in mice that were sufficient or deficient in FcγR expression. We also measured spike-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in vaccinated mice using previously defined immunodominant peptides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. As expected, antigen-specific T cell responses were greater in animals give the mRNA-1273 vaccine compared to the control mRNA vaccine. However, IFN-γ and TNF-α responses in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after peptide restimulation were equivalent in FcγR KO and wild-type mice after mRNA-1273 vaccination (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig 2</xref>). These experiments establish that FcγR KO and wild-type mice have similar serum antibody and T cell responses after mRNA vaccination.</p><p id="P10">To assess whether mice expressing FcγRs were differentially protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection by vaccine-induced immunity, animals were challenged by intranasal route with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of BA.5, and infectious virus in the nasal turbinates and lungs was measured at 3 dpi (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>). For these experiments, we used BA.5 as the challenge virus because: (i) it encodes a mouse-adapting mutation (N501Y) that facilitates replication in mice lacking human ACE2 expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>; (ii) it allowed us to assess protection against infection under conditions when high levels of neutralizing antibody are absent (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4e</xref>); and (iii) BA.5, and other Omicron variants are circulating, so use of this strain could provide insight as to how legacy vaccines directed against ancestral spikes protect against severe BA.5 disease in humans. Notably, we observed protection against BA.5 infection in the upper and lower respiratory tract of wild-type and FcγR I KO mice but not in FcγR III KO or FcγR I/III/IV KO mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4f-g</xref>). Thus, protection elicited by mRNA-1273 vaccine-induced immunity against the antigenically shifted BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 requires Fc-FcγR engagement, and FcγR III interactions in particular contribute to this phenotype in mice.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Alveolar macrophages are required for antibody protection against BA.5 infection after passive immunization</title><p id="P11">We next addressed which FcγR III-expressing immune cells in the lung were important for mediating antibody protection in the context of passive transfer of immune sera and BA.5 challenge (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Mice that received vaccine-elicited immune sera had detectable amounts of anti-BA.5 spike IgG but low levels of neutralizing activity (~1/10 titer), as expected (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig 3</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis of CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells in the lungs of wild-type C57BL/6 mice showed that murine monocytes, neutrophils, interstitial macrophages, and alveolar macrophages express FcγR III (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

The increased binding of immune antibodies to spike proteins was associated with several Fc effector functions including ADCP, ADNP, and ADCD. When immune serum was passively transferred to mice, protection against infection by SARS-CoV-2 strains MA-10 or WA1/2020 N501Y/D614G in the lungs required FcγR expression, particularly FcγR III, even though serum antibody neutralizing activity was present after transfer. These data showing a requirement for Fc effector functions for optimal antibody-mediated control of virus infection in the lung are consistent with studies in mice and hamsters with neutralizing mAbs that bind epitopes in the RBD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Moreover, Fc-engineered anti-SARS-CoV-2 non-neutralizing and neutralizing mAbs binding the NTD and RBD regions confer greater protection in mice and hamsters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. In the context of passive antibody transfer, we observed less impact in the upper respiratory tract tissues, which could reflect the diminished ability of IgG antibodies in sera to accumulate in airway spaces <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, we observed FcγR-dependent reductions in viral load in the nasal turbinates after active mRNA vaccination, which could be due to higher levels of systemic anti-spike IgG/IgA or production of antibody by tissue-resident B cells. Persistent SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in oral mucosal fluid and upper respiratory tract specimens have been reported following mRNA vaccination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">In wild-type and FcγR KO mice immunized with mRNA-1273, we observed similar levels of neutralizing and RBD or spike-specific antibodies, and vaccine-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Although these results contrast with the idea that FcγRs have key roles in regulating adaptive immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, they are consistent with studies showing a lack of impairment of adaptive immune responses in FcγR KO mice to bacterial infection or IgG complexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Indeed, in control mRNA vaccinated animals, SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were similar in wild-type and FcγR KO mice. Thus, we attribute the diminished control of infection of the antigenically-shifted BA.5 strain in the turbinates and lungs of mRNA-1273 vaccinated FcγR KO mice to the loss of Fc-FcγR interactions that mediate antibody effector functions. Notwithstanding these results, antigen-matched bivalent mRNA vaccines targeting BA.1 and BA.5 spike proteins can induce higher levels of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron strains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, which might result in less reliance on Fc effector functions for protection against infection. We also performed cellular depletions to investigate the cell type responsible for the protection conferred by passively transferred antibody. Although several myeloid cells (monocytes, neutrophils, interstitial macrophages, and alveolar macrophages) in the lung express multiple FcγRs including FcγR III, depletion of alveolar macrophages compromised protection against infection. This effect was antibody-dependent since in the absence of immune sera, clodronate-dependent depletion of alveolar macrophages did not affect the viral burden in the lungs. These results are consistent with studies of influenza virus in mice, which showed that protective immunity conferred by non-neutralizing antibodies required alveolar macrophages and other lung phagocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="S9"><title>Limitations of study</title><p id="P15">We note several limitations in our study. (i) The conclusions showing an antiviral role for Fc effector functions of antibodies and FcγR III are based on experiments in mice. We used mice because of the availability of animals deficient in specific FcγRs, the reagents to achieve immune cell depletions, and the ability to perform both passive and active immunization, and BA.5 challenge. However, our results may not directly correlate with results in humans because of species-dependent differences in FcγR subtypes, functions, and expression on specific immune cells in the lung (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Future studies with human FcγR transgenic mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> lacking individual human FcγRs may help to bridge this gap. (ii) While we evaluated anti-spike antibody function in FcγR I KO, FcγR II KO, FcγR III KO, and FcγR I/III/IV KO mice, we did not directly assess a role for FcγR IV, as we did not have these KO mice. Passive and active immunization studies in FcγR IV KO mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> are warranted. (iii) Although our studies in mice indicate an importance of alveolar macrophages and FcγR III interactions with antibody, we did not identify a specific cellular mechanism of action. While our serum profiling analysis is consistent with an antibody- and Fc-dependent phagocytic mechanism, it remains unclear if this occurs with opsonized virus or infected cells. (iv) We challenged mice with an antigenically-shifted BA.5 isolate. Future infection experiments using BQ.1.1, BF.7, or other emerging strains may be informative for determining the breadth of this mechanism of protection. (v) Although challenge of wild-type and FcγR KO C57BL/6 mice with BA.5 allowed us to evaluate the effects on viral burden in the setting of low levels of transferred or induced serum antibody neutralization, clinical disease and pathology do not develop because Omicron strains are less virulent in C57BL/6 and other strains of mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Testing of vaccinated wild-type and FcγR KO mice with antigenically-shifted yet more pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 strains [for mice] might enable assessment of the contribution of polyclonal antibodies and Fc effector functions to protection against lung inflammation. It will be important to determine whether vaccine-elicited antibodies engage FcγRs (<italic>e.g</italic>., FcγR I and FcγR III) on specific myeloid cells and promote inflammation, as infection-induced antibodies from patients enhanced SARS-CoV-2 uptake by monocytes and macrophages, and triggered inflammasome activation, pyroptotic cell death, and COVID-19 pathogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. However, these studies also showed that immune plasma from mRNA vaccine recipients did not promote antibody-dependent monocyte infection and inflammation.</p><p id="P16">In summary, our experiments in mice provide insight and help to explain human studies that correlate Fc-FcγR interactions with clinical outcome against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants of concern. We demonstrate the importance of particular murine FcγRs in mediating antibody protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify alveolar macrophages as a key contributing cell type in the context of passive immunization. Our results also provide an explanation as to how Fc-FcγR interactions might contribute to monovalent vaccine-mediated protection against severe infection by SARS-CoV-2 variants even in the setting when serum neutralizing antibody activity is lost <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. They also suggest that targeting Fc effector functions in the context of vaccine design could be a strategy to generate more broadly protective immune responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.
