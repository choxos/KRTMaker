In support of this signal suppression hypothesis, ERP studies have demonstrated that salient stimuli that do not capture attention elicit a distractor positivity (P<sub>D),</sub> a putative neural index of suppression. At the same time, it is becoming increasingly clear that regularities across preceding search episodes have a large influence on attentional selection. Yet to date, studies in support of the signal suppression hypothesis have largely ignored the role of selection history on the processing of distractors. The current study addressed this issue by examining how electrophysiological markers of attentional selection (N2pc) and suppression (P<sub>D</sub>) elicited by targets and distractors respectively were modulated when the search target randomly varied instead of being fixed across trials. Results showed that while target selection was unaffected by this manipulation, both in terms of manual response times, as well as in terms of the N2pc component, the P<sub>D</sub> component was reliably attenuated when the target features varied randomly across trials. This result demonstrates that the distractor P<sub>D</sub>, which is typically considered the marker of selective distractor processing cannot unequivocally be attributed to suppression only, as it also, at least in part, reflects the upweighting of target features.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The understanding that attentional selection is not only determined by the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes, but is also strongly influenced by previous selection episodes has revived the attentional capture debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Luck, Gaspelin, Folk, Remington, &amp; Theeuwes, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">van Moorselaar &amp; Slagter, 2020</xref>). This debate is centred around the perplexing puzzle that on the one hand salient, yet irrelevant stimuli often appear to involuntarily capture attention, while at the same time such involuntary capture would make simple everyday tasks nearly impossible. Recent research demonstrating that learning about regularities in the environment does not only prioritize target properties, such as the location and features of the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chun &amp; Jiang, 1998</xref>), but can also result in the suppression of task irrelevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ferrante et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Leber, Gwinn, Hong, &amp; O’Toole, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Sauter, Liesefeld, &amp; Müller, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">van Moorselaar &amp; Theeuwes, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Wang &amp; Theeuwes, 2018</xref>), may provide a missing piece to this puzzle.</p><p id="P3">As an initial resolution, the signal suppression hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gaspelin &amp; Luck, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sawaki &amp; Luck, 2010</xref>) was put forward, which elegantly incorporates the seemingly conflicting sides of the attentional capture debate. Specifically, the signal suppression hypothesis posits that while salient stimuli all generate a bottom-up “attend-to-me” signal and hence compete for attention, this signal can be proactively suppressed if the attentional system is appropriately configured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Luck et al., 2021</xref>). This idea is supported by empirical findings that salient stimuli automatically capture attention when the target is defined as a unique element in the display and therefore there is no clear search goal (e.g., the target is defined as the unique shape in the search display; singleton detection mode). By contrast, when the target is a specific shape embedded in a display of heterogeneous shapes and observers hence engage in what is called feature search mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bacon &amp; Egeth, 1994</xref>), allowing them to impose top-down control, which not only eliminates attentional capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Folk, Remington, &amp; Johnston, 1992</xref>), but under certain conditions can even result in below baseline suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gaspelin &amp; Luck, 2019</xref>). While support for this hybrid model of attentional capture has accumulated through converging evidence of psychophysics (e.g.,)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adam, Patel, Rangan, &amp; Serences, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gaspelin, Leonard, &amp; Luck, 2015</xref>), and eye movement studies (e.g.,)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gaspelin, Gaspar, &amp; Luck, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gaspelin, Leonard, &amp; Luck, 2017</xref>), some influential studies relied on electrophysiological indices related to attentional selection (the N2pc) and suppression (the P<sub>D</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Eimer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Luck &amp; Hillyard, 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">1994b</xref>) and suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hickey, Di Lollo, &amp; McDonald, 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Although the N2pc, which is a negative going deflection occurring around 200-300 msec after stimulus presentation that is larger over the hemisphere contralateral to the attended location, is unequivocally considered as an index of covert attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Luck, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Woodman &amp; Luck, 2003</xref>), the Pd is less well characterized. Nevertheless, the P<sub>D,</sub> which is much like the inverse of the N2pc, as it presents itself as a larger contralateral positive deflection to a to-be-ignored rather than a task-relevant stimulus, is commonly presented as a putative neural index of suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gaspelin &amp; Luck, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hickey et al., 2009</xref>) and has become a tool to study whether salient distractors can be suppressed proactively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Drisdelle &amp; Eimer, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Stilwell, Egeth, &amp; Gaspelin, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">van Moorselaar, Daneshtalab, &amp; Slagter, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">van Moorselaar, Lampers, Cordesius, &amp; Slagter, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">van Moorselaar &amp; Slagter, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Wang, van Driel, Ort, &amp; Theeuwes, 2019</xref>). Indeed, various strands of evidence link the P<sub>D</sub> to a suppressive mechanism; the Pd often appears exclusively in response to distractors in the absence of a N2pc (e.g.,)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gaspar &amp; McDonald, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Jannati, Gaspar, &amp; McDonald, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sawaki &amp; Luck, 2010</xref>), it has a larger amplitude on a subset of trials with the fastest responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McDonald, Green, Jannati, &amp; Di Lollo, 2013</xref>) and is no longer found when observers fail to avoid an eye-movement towards the distractor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Weaver, van Zoest, &amp; Hickey, 2017</xref>). However, arguably the most convincing evidence thus far linking the P<sub>D</sub> to suppression comes from a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gaspelin and Luck (2018a)</xref> that observed a correlation between the magnitude of below baseline behavioural suppression and the magnitude of the P<sub>D</sub> component (see also)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Feldmann-Wüstefeld, Brandhofer, &amp; Schubö, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gaspar &amp; McDonald, 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P5">There is thus good reason to believe that in many situations the P<sub>D</sub> can be linked to a suppressive mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">van Moorselaar &amp; Slagter, 2020</xref>). At the same time it should be noted that studies examining below baseline suppression through feature search by means of the P<sub>D</sub>, thus far have largely ignored the potential modulation by regularities across search displays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Theeuwes, Bogaerts, &amp; van Moorselaar, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">van Moorselaar &amp; Slagter, 2020</xref>). In this respect, it is noteworthy that in the work by Gaspelin and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gaspelin &amp; Luck, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Stilwell et al., 2022</xref>) examining proactive distractor suppression via the P<sub>D</sub> not only the distractor feature (i.e., its colour) but also the target features (i.e., both its colour and shape) were fixed across trials. In other words, the experimental designs used by Gaspelin and colleagues strongly induced, be it via implicit learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Theeuwes et al., 2022</xref>) or an explicit top-down process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Wolfe, 1994</xref>), predictions regarding both targets and distractors. It is therefore unclear to what extent the observed electrophysiological markers of distractor processing reflect pure distractor-feature suppression, as typically assumed, or alternatively, at least partly, also reflect target-feature upweighting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chang &amp; Egeth, 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P6">While the P<sub>D</sub> is exclusively elicited by to-be-ignored items, which seems to favour an interpretation in terms of suppression, there is reason to believe that it may in part also reflect upweighting of target features. As also acknowledged by updated versions of the signal suppression hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Luck et al., 2021</xref>), distractor inhibition, often results not only from proactive suppression of static and hence predictable distractor features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Vatterott &amp; Vecera, 2012</xref>), but in part also reflects upweighting of predictable target features. For example, by modifying the capture-probe technique, a technique used to read out attentional processing across search displays, such that it could independently dissociate between distractor suppression and target feature upweighting, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chang and Egeth (2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">2021</xref>) demonstrated that both distractor suppression and target feature upweighting contributed to distractor inhibition. Moreover, based on a more systematic manipulation of colour similarity between the target and neutral filler items in the display, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Oxner and colleagues (2022)</xref> even concluded that apparent proactive distractor suppression could be entirely explained by global target feature enhancement. While future work is necessary to further understand the interplay between suppressive and upweighting mechanisms in the context of distractor suppression, to the very least these findings illustrate the importance of disambiguating target and distractor effects in P<sub>D</sub> research. Given that in recent years the P<sub>D</sub> and its modulation has been widely used by both sides of the attentional capture debate, it is critical to establish to what extent it represents pure distractor processing independent from learned expectations regarding task relevant features, which to the best of our knowledge has not yet been done experimentally.</p><p id="P7">To examine the extent to which, if at all, the P<sub>D</sub> component also reflects upweighting of target features, we adopted the paradigm used by Gaspelin and colleagues that reliably produces below baseline suppression and a robust distractor P<sub>D</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gaspelin &amp; Luck, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Stilwell et al., 2022</xref>), but varied whether or not target features were static across trials. Specifically, while in half of the experiment both the target and the distractor feature were fixed across trials (as in previous studies), in the other half of the experiment, target features (i.e., shape and colour) varied randomly across trials (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This design allowed us to establish whether the P<sub>D</sub> as observed in previous studies reflects pure distractor suppression, or alternatively, at least partly, is driven by upweighting of static target features. Critically, if the P<sub>D</sub> purely reflects distractor suppression, under the current conditions the P<sub>D</sub> component should not be modulated by cross-trial variation of the target features.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Open practice statement</title><p id="P8">Experiment and analyses were based on the <italic>OSF Preregistration template</italic> at Open Science Framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/9827w/">https://osf.io/9827w/</ext-link>).

Participants were positioned 60 cm away from the screen using a desk mounted chinrest. The eyes were tracked on- and offline using an Eyelink 1000 (SR research) eye tracker tracking the left eye with a 1000 Hz sampling frequency (one subject had a sampling frequency of 2000 Hz) and participants heard a beep each time fixation was broken by more than 2° of visual angle. At the start of the experiment the eyes were calibrated via a five dots calibration procedure until spatial error for each dot position was smaller than 1 degree of visual angle. Drift correction was applied every 80 trials (i.e., at the start and halfway a block), when deemed necessary the calibration procedure was repeated. EEG data were recorded at a sampling rate of 512 Hz with default settings using a 64-electrode cap with electrodes placed according to the 10-10 system (Biosemi ActiveTwo system; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="biosemi.com">biosemi.com</ext-link>). Vertical and horizontal EOG (VEOG/HEOG) were recorded via external electrodes placed ∼2 cm above and below the eye, and ∼1 cm lateral to the external canthi, respectively.</p><p id="P11">The paradigm was modeled after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Stilwell et al. (2022)</xref>. Each trial started with a randomly jittered black display (100 – 400 ms) followed by a randomly jittered fixation display (750 – 1000 ms). This display contained either a circular or a diamond shape with an embedded cross hair, a combination that has been shown to improve stable fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Thaler, Schütz, Goodale, &amp; Gegenfurtner, 2013</xref>). Critically, the shape of the fixation marker signaled the target shape in the subsequent search display. Each search display contained eight shapes in a circular configuration (radius 3°) around the fixation marker, each with a black line tilted left or right (14° around the vertical plane) in their center. Individual shapes were selected from a stimulus pool of triangles (radius 0.7°), hexagons (1.2° by 1.2°), ovals (1.5° by 0.9°), crosses (1.2° by 1.2°), diamonds (1.3° by 1.3°) and circles (radius 0.6°). Selection was such that each display contained the target shape (i.e., diamond or circle) and seven shapes randomly selected from the remaining shapes in the stimulus pool with replacement, with the restriction that each individual non-target shape appeared two times at the most to ensure high display heterogeneity.</p><p id="P12">Individual shapes were either red (RGB: 253, 34, 34), green (RGB: 90, 174, 20) or grey (RGB: 146, 147, 153). In the fixed-feature condition both the shape (circle or diamond; counterbalanced across participants) and the colour of the target (red or green; counterbalanced across participants) were held constant. By contrast, in the mixed-feature condition both the target shape and target colour varied randomly across trials (counterbalanced across trials in a block) such that in half of the displays the target colour was grey, whereas in the other half the target colour matched the target colour in the fixed-feature condition. Whereas in 25% of trials all stimuli in the search display had the same colour (i.e., singleton absent displays), in the remaining trials (i.e., singleton present displays) one of the non-target shapes was rendered in a unique colour (red or green; counterbalanced across participants) that was held constant throughout the experiment. These singleton absent and present displays were not randomly intermixed, but instead singleton absent displays were grouped together at the start or at the end of an experimental block (alternating between blocks) such that any singleton presence benefit could not be attributed to a surprise induced by infrequent distractor absent displays. Across all display configurations targets and singleton distractors appeared with equal probability selectively at positions along the vertical and horizontal axis.</p><p id="P13">At the beginning of each session, it was made explicit that the distractor singleton was irrelevant to the task at hand and should thus be ignored. Participants were instructed to keep their eyes at fixation and covertly search for the shape that matched the fixation shape on the current trial and indicate the orientation of the line segment within this target shape via button press (i.e., ‘z’ or ‘/’ button) as quickly as possible while keeping the number of errors to a minimum. In case of an incorrect response or missing response a 200 Hz tone lasting 300 ms was played, which was accompanied by the text “too slow!” in case participants did not respond within 2000 ms.</p><p id="P14">The experiment consisted of 12 experimental blocks of 160 trials (6 consecutive blocks for each condition; order counterbalanced across participants) preceded by sequences of 32 training trials in the mixed-feature condition, which repeated until mean accuracy was above 70%.

Continuous EEG was subsequently epoched from -700 – 1100 ms relative to search display onset (to avoid filter artefacts during automatic artefact rejection; see below). Prior to trial rejection, malfunctioning electrodes as identified during recording (<italic>M</italic> = 0.6, range = 0-2) were temporarily removed. As a first artifact removal step, ICA as implemented in MNE (method = ‘picard’) was performed on 1 Hz filtered epochs to remove eye-blink components selectively from the 0.1 Hz filtered data. Next noise contaminated epochs within a -200 – 600 ms were identified using an adapted version of an automatic trial-rejection procedure. To specifically capture muscle activity, the EEG signal was filtered using a 110 – 140 Hz band-pass filter and subsequently transformed into Z-scores. A subject specific Z-score threshold was then set based on within-subject variance of Z-scores (Vries et al., 2017). Moreover, to reduce the number of false alarms, rather than immediate removal of epochs exceeding the Z-score threshold, per marked epoch the five electrodes that contributed most to accumulated Z-score within the time period containing the marked artefact were identified. Then in an iterative procedure, the worst five electrodes per marked epoch were interpolated using spherical splines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Perrin et al., 1989</xref>) one by one, checking after each interpolation whether that epoch still exceeded the determined Z-score threshold. Epochs were selectively dropped when after this iterative interpolation procedure, the Z-score threshold was still exceeded.

This raises the question to what extent the Pd in fixed-feature conditions as typically observed reflects sensitivity to target regularities across longer time scales above and beyond intertrial priming effects. Although our experiment was not designed to specifically target this question, in an exploratory analysis we aimed to address this by examining the effects of feature repetition in the mixed-feature condition. While behaviorally there was little to no difference between different forms of intertrial feature priming on the singleton presence benefit, in terms of the Pd the effect of intertrial color repetitions appeared most pronounced. For this purpose, we focused on the comparison of trials with and without repetition of the target color in the mixed-features condition. As visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, the observed pattern of results was reminiscent of the main pattern of results comparing fixed- and mixed-feature conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), with no modulation of the N2pc, but an apparent attenuation of the Pd when the target color did not repeat from <italic>one trial to the next.

Specifically, we aimed to examine the extent to which the P<sub>D</sub> is driven by task-relevant regularities in designs typically used to study proactive distractor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chang &amp; Egeth, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gaspelin &amp; Luck, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Stilwell et al., 2022</xref>). To this end, we modified a heterogenous shape version of the additional singleton paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Theeuwes, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">1992</xref>), which has been shown to reliably produce both behavioral and electrophysiological signatures of distractor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gaspelin &amp; Luck, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Stilwell et al., 2022</xref>), such that target features were static in one half of the experiment (i.e., fixed-features condition), while they varied randomly in the other half of the experiment (i.e., mixed-features condition). This design made it possible to examine how processing of a fixed distractor color in a display of heterogenous shapes is shaped by expectations regarding the upcoming target features. We found that target selection was equally effective in both conditions, both in terms of manual response times, as well as in terms of the N2pc components. In contrast, while both conditions resulted in a singleton-presence benefits, the P<sub>D</sub> elicited by lateralized distractors was reliably attenuated when the target features varied randomly across trials. This result demonstrates that the P<sub>D</sub> elicited by distractors cannot unequivocally be attributed to a suppressive process, as it can also, at least when the experimental design allows, reflect upweighting of target features.</p><p id="P27">The present findings have important implications for the attentional capture debate, and specifically for studies that examine proactive distractor suppression via the P<sub>D</sub> component. As noted in the introduction, below baseline suppression, a defining marker of proactive suppression, to date has been selective to experimental designs using heterogeneous shapes in which not only the distractor color, but also the defining target features (i.e., shape and color) are fixed across trials. Although it is notoriously difficult to empirically distinguish between feature specific upweighting and suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gaspelin &amp; Luck, 2018b</xref>), the consensus, as also acknowledged by recent formulations of the signal suppression hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Luck et al., 2021</xref>), is that under such conditions both upweighting and suppression concurrently guide attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chang &amp; Egeth, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hamblin-Frohman, Chang, Egeth, &amp; Becker, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Vatterott &amp; Vecera, 2012</xref>). Here, for the first time we demonstrate an electrophysiological correlate of this interplay between suppression an upweighting, by showing that the P<sub>D</sub> is attenuated when target features are no longer static, but instead vary randomly across trials. This attenuation of the P<sub>D</sub> under conditions that discourage target feature upweighting is consistent with a hybrid model of distractor processing, in which distractor inhibition is driven by two independent mechanisms. At the same time, it should be noted that it has even been argued that observed distractor inhibition can be exclusively explained by target feature upweighting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Oxner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Saenz, Buracas, &amp; Boynton, 2002</xref>). In the current experimental design, when target features varied, they only did so between two possible options, leaving open the possibility that the remaining part of the P<sub>D</sub> was still driven by target feature upweighting, but simply less pronounced upweighting given that in mixed-feature conditions it now had to be distributed across color space.</p><p id="P28">Although our results are consistent with the idea that the P<sub>D</sub> elicited by distractor in heterogeneous search displays with static target features is sensitive to task relevant regularities, the exact underlying mechanism remains elusive. As outlined above, one possibility is that the P<sub>D</sub> reflects both enhancement and suppression, such that the amplitude increases when the task also allows for secondary inhibition resulting from an upweighting of predictive target features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Noonan, Crittenden, Jensen, &amp; Stokes, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">van Moorselaar &amp; Slagter, 2020</xref>). Indeed, there is evidence that target representations can be strategically shifted off-veridical to optimally distinguish targets from distractors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Geng &amp; Witkowski, 2019</xref>). Alternatively, it could be argued that the P<sub>D</sub> purely reflects suppression, if one assumes that task relevant regularities influence how the distractor is encoded in relation to the other items in display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Becker, 2010</xref>). Whereas in the mixed-feature condition observers cannot rely on a relational distractor code and hence must rely on an absolute code, in the fixed-feature condition relational coding is possible to potentially strengthen distractor suppression. We believe this less likely however, given the behavioral evidence in support of target enhancement driving distractor inhibition in the current paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chang &amp; Egeth, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Oxner et al., 2022</xref>). Irrespective of the underlying mechanism however, the current results highlight the importance of taking target regularities into consideration when examining distractor suppression via the P<sub>D</sub>.</p><p id="P29">The observation that the electrophysiological response elicited by salient distractors is modulated by target predictability is also consistent with previous ERP studies relying on homogeneous instead of heterogeneous search displays. When the target is defined as the unique shape in the display (e.g., a diamond among circles, or vice versa) there is some disagreement on the presence of a distractor P<sub>D</sub> when the target shape varies unpredictable across trials, with some studies actually reporting an N2pc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Burra &amp; Kerzel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hickey, McDonald, &amp; Theeuwes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) suggesting attentional capture rather than distractor suppression (but see) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McDonald et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">van Moorselaar et al., 2021</xref>). By contrast, when the unique target shape is fixed, favoring feature search mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bacon &amp; Egeth, 1994</xref>), not only the target N2pc increases, but distractors also reliably elicit a P<sub>D</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Burra &amp; Kerzel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">van Moorselaar et al., 2021</xref>). It should be noted however that even though a P<sub>D</sub> signals suppression of distractors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Forschack, Gundlach, Hillyard, &amp; Müller, 2022</xref>), in these displays distractors typically continue to interfere with attentional selection. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, one could argue that suppression was in place, but insufficiently so to counteract bottom-up attentional capture. Alternatively, the P<sub>D</sub> may not necessarily signal suppression of a salient stimulus, but instead processing of a salient, yet irrelevant feature that does not require a further read out. Although highly speculative, such a framework would predict that any salient distractor would generate a P<sub>D</sub>, as long as the distractor does not resemble the target. In these circumstances, the initial capture by the salient distractor, does not require the formation of an object representation of the distractor as it can be immediately discarded as “not being the target”. Indeed, there is evidence that attention can be disengaged very rapidly if the distractor does not resemble the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Born, Kerzel, &amp; Theeuwes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Mulckhuyse, Van der Stigchel, &amp; Theeuwes, 2009</xref>). In this framework, the P<sub>D</sub> can still be envisioned as the mirror image of the N2pc, but not because they reflect covert shifts of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Eimer, 1996</xref>) or suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gaspelin &amp; Luck, 2018b</xref>), but instead indexing object individuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Foster, Bsales, &amp; Awh, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Mazza &amp; Caramazza, 2015</xref>) on the one hand in case of an N2pc and, and ignoring of specific features on the other hand in case of the P<sub>D</sub>.</p><p id="P30">An important caveat in the interpretation of our results is that targets and neutral non-targets always shared the same color and hence their effects cannot be disambiguated. Therefore, rather than attributing the observed P<sub>D</sub> attenuation to an upweighting of static target features, an alternative explanation is to assume that the neural adaptation to repeated colors over time results in a reduced the inter-item competition between non-target items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Adam &amp; Serences, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Solomon &amp; Kohn, 2014</xref>). According to such a framework however, the singleton should become increasingly less salient over time in the fixed-feature condition, which appears at odds with the observation that behaviorally the effect did not differ between conditions, and the fact that P<sub>D</sub> decreased rather than increased in the mixed-feature condition where neural adaptation across trials should be less pronounced. Nevertheless, future work examining to what extent the P<sub>D</sub> is sensitive to task relevant regularities should also take non-target regularities into account and also consider that the early positivity that we chose to label P<sub>D</sub> in the current study, overlaps with the Ppc component which is proposed to be sensitive to feature discontinuities within search displays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Fortier-Gauthier, Moffat, Dell’Acqua, McDonald, &amp; Jolicœur, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Gokce, Geyer, Finke, Müller, &amp; Töllner, 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Our behavioral results indicate a finding what has been considered to be “a striking reversal of the capture effect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chang &amp; Egeth, 2019</xref>) as observers were significantly faster on distractor present trials than on absent trials. This reversal of the capture effect has now been reported in several recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gaspelin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lien, Ruthruff, &amp; Hauck, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Ma &amp; Abrams, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Stilwell &amp; Gaspelin, 2021</xref>). While some may consider this reversal as surprising, this finding is consistent with our claim that during feature search in which the target is typically non-salient, the attentional window is adjusted to keep the discriminability of the target to an acceptable signal-to-noise-ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Liesefeld &amp; Müller, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Theeuwes, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">2010</xref>). Because of the small attentional window, search proceeds serially and during serial search, there is no attentional capture by the salient distractor singleton. Because they are in serial search, participants can immediately discard the distractor which gives them one less item to inspect in distractor present than in absent trials (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Theeuwes, 2010</xref>, in press for a discussion). Consistent with this notion is our speculation that in these circumstances, in which search is serial, the distractor will generate a P<sub>D</sub> because it can be immediately discarded as irrelevant and “not being the target”</p><p id="P32">In summary, the current study clearly demonstrates that in displays that encourage feature search mode, the P<sub>D</sub> cannot unequivocally be attributed to suppression of distractor features, as at least in part, it is also sensitive to target regularities. This finding has large implications for future studies that use the P<sub>D</sub> to examine whether specific distractor features can be proactively suppressed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS158970-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d32aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S14"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by a European Research Council (ERC) advanced grant (833029) to J.T.

The target shape (i.e., diamond or circle) was cued by the shape of the fixation marker (see top left of the figure).

Participants (n = 24) were instructed to report the orientation of the line inside the shape cued by the fixation marker (i.e., diamond or circle). In the fixed-features condition (half of the experiment) this target shape, as well as the target colour was static across trials.
