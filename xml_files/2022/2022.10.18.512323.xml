Thailand was affected by the wild-type, and the Delta variant started in mid-2021. Due to the shortage of effective vaccines, the ministry of public health of Thailand suggested the heterologous vaccine scheme, which comprises inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (CoronaVac) and an adenoviral-based vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1). However, data on the humoral and cellular immune responses of the single or 2 shots of inactivated vaccine followed by the adenoviral-based vaccine are very limited. In this current study, the sera from participants who received either single or 2 shots of CoronaVac followed by the ChAdOx1 vaccine were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding-domain (RBD) IgG. The cytokine level was also assessed using Luminex immunoassay. The PBMC were collected to evaluate spike-specific T-cell and B-cell responses. Participants who received 2 shots of CoronaVac followed by ChAdOx1 possessed significantly (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) higher levels of spike RBD-specific IgG. They also exhibited a higher level of CD4+T-cell and IFN-gamma than those who received only 1 shot of CoronaVac followed by the ChAdOx1 vaccine. The volunteers who received two shots of CoronaVac followed by ChAdOx1 had a significantly (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) higher marginal B-cell response against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S peptides than those who received only one shot of CoronaVac followed by ChAdOx1. Surprisingly, the class switch B-cell response to Delta variant SARS-CoV-2 S peptides of the volunteers who received 1 shot of CoronaVac followed by ChAdOx1 was significantly (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) higher than those who received 2 shots of CoronaVac. However, participants who received only a single shot of inactivated vaccine followed by an adenoviral-based vectored vaccine possessed a higher level of TNF-alpha and IL-6. This study indicated that boosting the ChAdOx1 as a third dose after completing 2 shots of CoronaVac induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2), first emerged in December 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Over 300 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and over 5.5 million deaths in January 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Vaccination is one of the most effective strategies to reduce illness and mortality rates from the Covid-19 virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Various COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and used to fight against the pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. However, as a developing country, Thailand faces significant challenges in acquiring and distributing adequate vaccine supplies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The majority of Thai people could only access the first Covid-19 vaccine, which was inactivated COVID-19 from China, called CoronaVac® (Sinovac), in mid-2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The adenoviral-based vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 AZD1222) was available in Thailand a few months after the first arrival of CoronaVac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Due to the limited vaccine supplies, The Ministry of Public health of Thailand implemented a heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy to create herd immunity to combat the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses play essential parts in developing immunity after immunization with the vaccine against Covid-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].

Two shots of inactivated vaccine elicit a higher CD4+ T-cell response to SAR-CoV-2 spike protein than only 1 dose of inactivated vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The previous report showed that participants who obtained 2 shots of CoronaVac followed by ChAdOx1 possessed a higher level of spike RBD-specific IgG and total immunoglobulins than those who received two-dose of CoronaVac or ChAdOx1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. However, the data for SAR-CoV-2-specific cell-mediated immune response following vaccination with a heterologous prime-boost strategy are still scarce since most studies only focus on the humoral immune response. To fill the knowledge gap, we characterized various parameters of SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immune responses induced by once or twice CoronaVac followed by ChAdOx1 in healthy Thai individuals.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>1</label><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="P4">All experiments with humans were conducted in accordance with the ethical approval by the ethical committee of the Department of Medical Sciences on 23<sup>rd</sup> July 2021 with approval number; MOPH 0625/EC095 and study code; 15/2564.

The mass vaccine is one of the best strategies to encounter this problem to create herd immunity against SAR-CoV-2 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. The heterologous vaccination is currently considered in developing countries due to the shortage of vaccines. In this study, we investigated the IgG antibody response against receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and cellular immune response following the 1 or 2 doses of inactivated SAR-CoV-2 vaccine CoronaVac followed by the adenoviral-based vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 AZD1222). We demonstrated the antibody level against the SAR-CoV-2 induced by either 1 or 2 shots of CoronaVac followed by ChAdOx1 at 4 weeks after immunization. The antibody response induced by 2 doses of CoronaVac followed by ChAdOx1 was greater up to almost 3-fold compared to only 1 dose of CoronaVac followed by ChAdOx1 vaccination. These data suggested that a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine elicits greater immunogenicity than 2 doses. Our results were similar to previous research, which indicated that boosting ChAdOx1 after completing 2 shots of CoronaVac elicited a higher number of RBD-specific IgG than those without the boosting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Several studies found that three doses of inactivated or mRNA vaccine resulted in a more significant immunogenic response than two doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p id="P22">Cellular immune responses were evaluated in the participants who received a booster dose of ChAdOx1 following either 1 or 2 shots of CoronaVac 4 weeks after the third vaccination. We demonstrated that vaccinees who received 1 shot of ChAdOx1 after 2 shots of CoronaVac exhibited a higher level of non-specific CD4+ T-cell than those who received 1 shot of ChAdOx1 after only 1 dose of CoronaVac. Unlike the mRNA vaccine, the inactivated vaccine contains the entire viral antigen and the immunogenic N protein, not just the spike protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. The whole viral antigen induces T-cell immunity, which may explain this study’s high CD4+ T-cell response. The intracellular cytokine immunostaining technique also measured the specific-cellular immune response for wild-type SAR CoV-2 and Delta variant peptide protein. We discovered that those who received three doses of heterologous vaccine produced more IFN-gamma against wild-type SAR CoV-2 and Delta variant than those who received two doses. Adenoviral vector vaccines have been demonstrated to induce the aggressive cellular immune response and drive Th1 expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The response against the spike protein may be influenced by the strong Th1 reaction to the adenoviral vector in the live vaccine. However, participants who received a single dose of CoronaVac followed by ChAOx1 demonstrated higher T-cell intracellular TNF-alpha against wild-type SAR CoV-2 and Delta variant than those who received 2 doses of CoronaVac followed by ChAOx1. The previous study showed similar results: boosting with CoronaVac induced the activation of CD4+T-cell and secretion of IFN- gamma against wild-type SAR-CoV-2, Delta, and Omicron variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Goa and colleagues demonstrated that CD4+T-cell response against wild-type strain is cross-reactive against Omicron strain in participants who received BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p><p id="P23">The cytokines secretion (IFN-gamma, TNF- alpha, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-12p70, respectively) in response to T-cell stimulated with pools of Spike peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 wild type and Delta variant were also analyzed by Luminex immunoassay. Surprisingly, IL-6 and IL-12p70 were significantly higher in participants immunized by a single shot of CoronaVac followed by ChAdOx1 compared to those who were immunized with 2 doses of CoronaVac 4 weeks after vaccination. Many types of vaccines increase IL-6, such as influenza and the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. For the influenza vaccine, the natural killer cell produces a high level of interferon-gamma, which stimulates CD11b+ dendritic cells to release IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. A recent study has reported the response of NK-cell followed by ChAdOx1, which may explain and support the increase of IL-6 in this current study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].</p><p id="P24">In humoral immune response to vaccination, B-cells are stimulated by antigens in vaccines and developed into either plasma cells or memory B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Memory B-cells are essential in vaccine-induced immunity since they rapidly produce antibodies to respond and protect against pathogen invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. The class switch B-cell is responsible for switching IgM production to IgA or IgG production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Surprisingly, after weeks of vaccination with 2 shots of CoronaVac followed by the ChAdOx1 vaccine, the percentage of class switch B-cells was significantly lower than after only 1 shot of CoronaVac followed by the ChAdOx1 vaccine. Germinal centers in secondary lymphoid organs serve as microenvironments for the affinity development of humoral immunity 2 weeks after vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. After T-cell-dependent activation, B-cells migrate to germinal centers, specifically differentiated into high-affinity memory B-cells and plasma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. This theory is supported by our data demonstrating that the inactivated vaccination can promote humoral immunity, reflected in the marked decline in B-cell counts. The recent study also demonstrated a similar result in the substantially reduced humoral B-cell levels measured using the CYTOF method in humans after a month of immunizing with the inactivated vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. The specific SAR-CoV 2 antibody level was maintained for at least 6 months after vaccination with the inactivated vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. The high antibody level after the vaccination highlights the memory immune response and signifies the importance of booster immunization.</p><p id="P25">The current study has some limitations. We included a small number of participants who received either 1 or 2 doses of inactivated vaccine followed by 1 shot of adenoviral-based vaccine. Second, we did not measure the baseline IgG antibody response against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 spike protein SARS-CoV-2 before and after the first vaccination. In addition, the samples for T-cell and B-cell responses were low due to this study’s limited time and budget. Furthermore, we only included Wild type SAR CoV-2 and Delta variants because they were the dominant strains during the study. The investigation of vaccine protection against emerging variants should be considered.</p><p id="P26">In conclusion, boosting the ChAdOx1 as a third dose after completing 2 doses of CoronaVac induced strong both humoral and cellular immune responses.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Clinical Research Centre (CRC) from the Department of Medical Sciences and all the participants for supporting this project.</p><sec id="S21"><title>Funding</title><p>Department of Medical Sciences provided funding for this project.
