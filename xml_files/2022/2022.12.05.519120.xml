The plant RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) has been implicated in stem cell maintenance, presumably by forming repressor complexes with E2F transcription factors. Surprisingly we find that mutations in all three canonical E2Fs do not compromise the cell cycle, but similarly to <italic>RBR</italic> silencing, result in overproliferation. Contrary to the growth arrest upon RBR silencing, when exit from proliferation to differentiation is inhibited, the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant develops enlarged organs with supernumerary stem and differentiated cells as the quiescence is compromised. While E2F, RBR and the M-phase regulatory MYB3Rs are part of the DREAM repressor complexes, and recruited to overlapping groups of targets, they regulate distinct sets of genes. Only the loss of E2Fs but not the MYB3Rs interferes with quiescence, which might be due to the ability of E2Fs to control both G1-S and some key G2-M targets. We conclude that collectively the three canonical E2Fs in complex with RBR have central roles in establishing cellular quiescence during organ development, leading to enhanced plant growth.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">In multicellular organisms, both the entry into and the exit from the cell division cycle is developmentally regulated. During plant development, there is a tight balance among cells proliferating in meristematic regions of emerging young organs, stem cells that are in a reversible quiescent status with a capacity to divide upon stimulation, and the most common cellular state of terminally differentiated cells formed after permanent exit from the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Scheres, 2007</xref>). The principal regulation of cell proliferation by highly conserved molecular mechanisms is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Morgan, 2007</xref>), but how the cell cycle machinery is controlled in quiescent cells to maintain transient and stable repression of mitosis remains unclear.</p><p id="P4">Evidence from animal model organisms indicates that the RETINOBLASTOMA (Rb)-E2F transcriptional regulatory pathway plays a central role in coordinating proliferation and quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Marescal &amp; Cheeseman, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Yao, 2014</xref>). Binding of Rb to the E2F-dimerization partner (DP) heterodimers can convert these complexes to transcriptional repressors, while phosphorylation of Rb by Cdk-cyclin complexes releases E2Fs and their ability to activate transcription. Accordingly, animal E2Fs can function as bistable switches on their target genes, determining whether the cells enter into the cell cycle or exit to establish quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Yao et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The Rb-E2F pathway is remarkably conserved in plants, and it is well established that the plant RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) coordinates cell proliferation and differentiation by regulating the activity of three canonical E2F transcription factors (E2FA, E2FB and E2FC - (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Borghi et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gutzat et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Magyar et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wildwater et al., 2005</xref>) that form dimers with one of the two DP proteins (DPA and DPB). The three non-canonical E2Fs (E2FD, E and F) function independently of DP and RBR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lammens al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Mariconti et al., 2002</xref>). Canonical E2Fs are structurally related to their animal counterparts, and consensus E2F-binding sites were identified in a large number of cell cycle regulatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Mariconti et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Vandepoele et al., 2002</xref>). Their C-termini contain the transactivation domain overlapping with the RBR-binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kosugi &amp; Ohashi, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Magyar et al., 2000</xref>) and thus function as transcriptional activators or repressors depending on whether they are in complex with RBR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Magyar et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Oszi et al., 2020</xref>). Overexpression studies suggest that E2FA and E2FB function as activators, but recent findings showed that they could also repress genes specifically involved in embryo and seed development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Leviczky et al., 2019</xref>). Surprisingly, genetic studies showed that E2F mutations either in single, double or even triple mutants did not universally compromise cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Heyman et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Leviczky et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Oszi et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P6">It has been established that loss of function <italic>rbr</italic> mutants are gametophytic lethal due to abnormalities during meiosis and gametophyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ebel et al., 2004</xref>). Manipulation of RBR level during sporophyte development severely compromises the balance between proliferation and differentiation; ectopic overexpression of RBR led to diminishment of root and shoot meristems, while the consequence of RBR silencing is the inhibition of differentiation and increased number of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wildwater et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Wyrzykowska et al., 2006</xref>). Conditional RBR silencing strongly represses leaf growth by stimulating the overproliferation of stem cells in the stomatal lineage and inhibiting terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Borghi et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Desvoyes et al., 2006</xref>), and triggers cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Horvath et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wildwater et al., 2005</xref>). It was suggested that upon RBR silencing the E2Fs are de-repressed, which is responsible for the above described developmental defects. However, the recent description of a fully viable, although partially sterile mutant plant, in which all three canonical E2Fs carry a T-DNA insertion (a triple <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant) questions whether E2Fs are indeed essential for the activation of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wang et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). This is surprising because there is ample evidence that plant E2Fs are the primary effectors of RBR just like in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Desvoyes &amp; Gutierrez, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kent &amp; Leone, 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To understand the role of E2Fs for the developmental regulation of cell cycle, in this work we analysed the <italic>e2fabc</italic> triple mutant in detail for cell proliferation defects and for the deregulation of E2F targets. Surprisingly, just as upon RBR silencing, we observed overproliferation in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> triple mutant, suggesting that E2Fs are not required for maintaining cell proliferation, but rather have a repressive role. RBR silencing leads to growth arrest during seedling establishment due to the inhibition of this developmental transition and of cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gutzat et al., 2011</xref>). This is not the case for the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant, which shows hyperplasia during embryonic and post-embryonic organ development with delayed cell cycle exit and unstable quiescence both in stem and in terminally differentiated cells. We established that the three E2Fs and RBR have largely overlapping gene targets and cell cycle genes were markedly upregulated in <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant seedlings. We conclude that the three canonical E2Fs are collectively involved in cell cycle exit and in establishing transient and stable cellular quiescence by forming repressor complexes with RBR.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The triple e2fabc mutant displays hyperplasia, leading to enlarged organs and plant stature</title><p id="P8">Several alleles of T-DNA insertion lines have been described for canonical E2Fs, all of which disrupt the carboxyl terminus containing the entire transactivation and RBR-binding domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig.1a</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Leviczky et al., 2019</xref>). As described previously, the triple <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant is partially sterile, mostly due to aborted cell divisions in developing gametophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Yao et al., 2018</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>). In addition, at a very low frequency, we also observed supernumerary nuclei in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant embryo sacs (2%; n=240), a characteristic phenotype for <italic>rbr</italic> mutant ovules <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ebel et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). Further similarities to <italic>rbr</italic> mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>) are the twin embryo sacs that may originate from two megagametophyte mother cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). These overproliferation phenotypes suggest that the canonical E2Fs may also have common repressor functions with RBR at some stages of gametophytic development.</p><p id="P9">To our surprise, the <italic>e2fabc</italic> triple mutant was not only viable, but showed an increased plant size at the adult stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b</xref>) as well as longer roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c,d</xref>) and larger plantlet and rosette size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig.2a-e</xref>). Importantly, another triple <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant obtained by crossing the <italic>e2fab</italic> double with the <italic>e2fc-2</italic> T-DNA insertion mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig.1</xref>), gave identical phenotypes with the original <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant line (Extended <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Data Fig2f,g</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Due to the above described sterility, the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant only produced few seeds, but these were significantly larger and heavier than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1e</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wang et al., 2014</xref>)), containing enlarged embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1f</xref>) that consisted of smaller and more numerous cells than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1g-i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data 2f-i-l</xref>). Likewise, developing leaves of the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant seedlings became gradually larger than those of WT, until they reached 1.5 times the size of WT leaves at 20 DAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2a-b</xref>). Cellular analysis revealed that cell size was comparable with WT at early leaf development, but decreased at 16 DAG. We observed some fully differentiated lobbed pavement cells with straight division planes in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant, but not in WT, indicating their re-entry into cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2e-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data. Fig. 3a</xref>). The number of these extra divisions continuously rose and became the highest in the most advanced leaves at 16 DAG, resulting in smaller sized cells than in the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2f-d</xref>). As a result, the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant leaves contained almost twice as many cells (48%) than the control WT at 16 DAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2c-d</xref>). Leaf cells dispersed among lobbed pavement cells, round and smaller than 60μm<sup>2</sup> are considered to be stomatal meristemoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dong et al., 2009</xref>). The number of these cells was significantly increased in the expanding <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant leaf at 12 and 16 DAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2e-g</xref>), suggesting that not only the stable quiescence in pavement cells but also the transient quiescence in stomata stem cells is broken in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant. Consistent with the overproliferation phenotypes, the expression levels of the S-phase-related <italic>MCM3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig.3b</xref>) and the mitotic <italic>CDKB1;1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2h</xref>), continuously increased in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant during leaf development whereas these were only detectable at the youngest stage of 9 DAG in the wild-type. The elevated expression of two genes associated with the stem cell lineage of stomatal meristemoids: <italic>TOO MANY MOUTH (TMM;</italic>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2i</xref>), and <italic>SPEECHLESS</italic> (<italic>SPCH</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig.3b</xref>) was also in agreement with the observed phenotype. Taken together, these data suggest that E2Fs are essential to allow cell cycle arrest to establish both stable and transient quiescence.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Canonical E2Fs maintain quiescence through the recruitment of RBR to repress cell cycle-related genes</title><p id="P11">To further understand the underlying mechanism for the repressor role of E2Fs, we investigated global gene expression changes in the triple <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant seedlings. 1,767 genes were significantly upregulated and only 646 were downregulated in <italic>e2fabc</italic> compared to the WT (adj<italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.01). Additionally, Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with upregulated, but not with downregulated genes, were highly enriched with function linked to cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a</xref>). To go further, we evaluated the expression changes of two gene categories: canonical E2F targets, defined as genes mis-regulated in <italic>E2FA</italic> over-expressing lines, and harbouring a consensus E2F binding motif in their promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Vandepoele et al., 2002</xref>), that are highly enriched in genes related to the control of the G1/S transition, and G2/M-specific genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Haga et al., 2011</xref>). Among the genes upregulated in <italic>e2fabc</italic>, we found significant enrichment for canonical E2F target genes (<italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 2.2e-16), but interestingly G2/M-specific genes were also affected (<italic>P</italic>-value = 0.0001401, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3b</xref>). On the other hand, neither category was enriched among the downregulated genes in <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3b</xref>, p = 0.3336 and 1 respectively). Similarly, scatter plot analysis comparing expression in <italic>e2fabc</italic> and wild type seedlings showed general upregulation of the canonical E2F target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3c</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Strong up-regulation of cell cycle genes is also observed when RBR function is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Borghi et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gutzat et al., 2011</xref>). To test whether E2FA, B, C and RBR actually target the same loci, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) using plants expressing translational GFP fusions under the control of the native promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kallai et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lang et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Magyar et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Oszi et al., 2020</xref>). Binding of all four proteins occurs mostly just upstream from transcriptional start sites of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig.4a</xref>), and targets identified here for E2FA and RBR largely overlapped with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Verkest et al., 2014</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig.4b-c</xref>), validating the reliability of our data. Pearson correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3d</xref>), as well as plots representing 2 by 2 comparisons of distances separating defined peaks from the closest TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3e</xref>) revealed that the four proteins have very similar binding profiles genome-wide, as further illustrated by the screenshot on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3f</xref>.</p><p id="P13">The ability of canonical E2Fs and RBR to target the same set of genes, together with the observation that the simultaneous loss of E2FA, B and C triggers over-proliferation like RBR silencing, suggest that one key function of E2F proteins during vegetative development could be the recruitment of RBR to impose cell proliferation arrest. We therefore monitored the presence of RBR-DPB complexes in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant, compared to <italic>e2fab</italic> mutants in which E2FC is still intact and functional. As expected, RBR was in complex with DPB in the <italic>e2fab</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4a</xref>), but not in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant, supporting that RBR recruitment to its targets is affected in these mutants.</p><p id="P14">Because the strong RBR co-suppression line is arrested during seedling growth (<italic>RBRcs</italic> - (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gutzat et al., 2011</xref>), we analysed the cotyledons for over-proliferation and compared them to the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig.5b-c</xref>). As in developing leaves, puzzle-formed pavement cells and guard cells in their regular bicellular forms could form in the cotyledon of <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutants, but meristemoids appeared clustered and differentiated pavement cells showed newly formed straight cross walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig.5a</xref>). By contrast, most of the epidermal cells in <italic>RBRcs</italic> were small embryonic-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig5d-e</xref>), and many dead cells could be visualised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig.5d-e</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Borghi et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gutzat et al., 2011</xref>). Cell size was markedly shifted from large cells towards smaller cells, and cell number was increased in both <italic>RBRcs</italic> and <italic>e2fabc</italic>, although much more in <italic>RBRcs</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig.6c-d</xref>). Consistently, the expression of key cell cycle regulators, DNA repair genes and embryonic genes was markedly increased in <italic>RBRcs</italic> lines, and to a lesser extent in <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig.7</xref>).

Pulse labelling with 5-ethynyl 20-deoxyuridine (EdU) revealed a similar increase of S-phase cell number in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant and the amiRBR line in comparison to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4c-d</xref>). Furthermore, we observed supernumerary undifferentiated columella stem cells in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> root cap, as well as supernumerary cortex/endoderm initials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4e-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig.9a</xref>), as previously shown in an RBR silenced line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wildwater et al., 2005</xref>). Mitosis, as followed by the YFP-tagged CYCB1;2 marker was clearly present in these supernumerary columella initials, providing further evidence for their sustained ability to divide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig.9b</xref>). The lack of signal in quiescent centre (QC) compared to the surrounding cells when using prolonged EdU labelling allows to visualise the low frequency of S-phase in these cells, as shown in WT, while both in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> triple mutant and RBR silenced QC cells positive EdU labelled nuclei can readily be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4g</xref>). Quiescence of stem cells was shown to protect them against DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cruz-Ramirez et al., 2013</xref>).

The RBR silenced lines also display spontaneous cell death within the root meristem, but this is not the case for the <italic>e2fabc</italic> line. Together, these data indicate that proliferation activities of the root meristem and specifically of the stem cells increased in the triple <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant root, as is the case in amiRBR lines, providing evidence for the role of E2F/RBR complexes in the maintenance of the quiescent state.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Though <italic>E2Fs</italic> and MYB3Rs can be in the same complex and recruited to a largely overlapping set of targets, they have unique regulatory roles</title><p id="P16">MYB3Rs together with E2FB, E2FC, and RBR, but not E2FA have been implicated in the repression of cell cycle genes as part of large multiprotein complexes, known as DREAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Horvath et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lang et al., 2021</xref>). We therefore investigated the interplay among E2Fs, RBR and repressive MYB3Rs in relation to their target gene regulation. We defined target genes as those detected with the highest confidence (<italic>q</italic>-value &lt; 0.01 enrichment &gt; 3). As expected, lists of genes bound by each E2F were largely overlapping, irrespective of the combination of isoforms looked at (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Fig.11a</xref>). To collectively deal with target genes of E2FA, E2FB and E2FC, we defined a gene category representing general E2F targets, that is characterised by being amongst the most significant targets of at least two E2Fs (hereafter called E2F(2)). E2F(2)-, RBR- and MYB3R3-bound genes showed dramatic overlap in any combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Fig.11b</xref>), defining 7 gene categories depending on the combination of factors that bind to them. <italic>EMR</italic> (bound by <underline>E</underline>2F, <underline>M</underline>YB3R3, and <underline>R</underline>BR) corresponded to 637 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5a</xref>). For most of these genes, peaks of ChIP signals exactly coincide for E2FA, E2FB, E2FC, RBR and MYB3R3 at the site of transcriptional initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Fig.11c</xref>). GO terms associated with <italic>EMR</italic> genes were highly and exclusively enriched with categories related to cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5a</xref>). Enrichment of cell cycle-related GO terms was observed both for <italic>EMR</italic> and <italic>EM</italic>, and less prominently in <italic>M</italic>, but not at all in other categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5a</xref>). Both the G1/S E2F targets and the G2/M-specific genes comprise a significant fraction of <italic>EMR</italic> and <italic>EM</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5b</xref>). This suggests that genes with cell cycle-related functions are preferentially regulated by protein complexes containing both E2F and MYB3R3 transcription factors.</p><p id="P17">We then analysed the effects of E2F and MYB3R mutations on the expression of genes in each category as defined by our ChIP-seq data. For this purpose, RNA-seq gene expression datasets of <italic>e2fabc</italic> and <italic>myb3r135</italic> triple mutant were utilised. Genes within the <italic>EMR</italic> and <italic>EM</italic> groups were frequently upregulated in either <italic>e2fabc</italic> or <italic>myb3r135</italic> mutants, but very rarely in both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5c</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that in spite of the fact that MYB3Rs and E2Fs can be present in the same protein complex and they are recruited onto the same promoter site, on a particular target gene only one or the other regulate the expression. This unique mode of regulation can be also confirmed for canonical E2F target and G2/M-specific genes, which are preferentially influenced by E2Fs and MYB3Rs, respectively, but much less frequently by both factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5d</xref>). Interestingly, the propension of genes to be influenced either by E2Fs or MYB3Rs correlated with the presence of consensus motives for E2F or MYB3R binding, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5.e-f</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that E2F and MYB3R transcription factors could bind to common cell cycle genes, but they specifically regulate the expressions of genes holding their characteristic E2F or MSA binding sequences, respectively.</p><p id="P18">While MYB3Rs are specifically targeted and regulate mitotic genes containing MSA elements, E2Fs can regulate cell-cycle genes involved both in G1-S and G2-M transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3b</xref>), an example is CDKB1:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2h</xref>), a critical controller of G2-M and the switch from mitosis to endoreduplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Boudolf et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, the activating MYB3R, MYB3R4 is also a direct target of canonical E2Fs and is upregulated in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant leaves at all analysed time points, whereas expression of the repressor MYB3R3 remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5g</xref>). Accordingly, the MYB3R4 target, <italic>KNOLLE</italic> with a role in cytokinesis, was also upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5g</xref>). These suggest that E2Fs may also regulate mitosis indirectly through the activating MYB3Rs. The ability of RBR and the three canonical E2Fs to regulate both G1/S and G2/M transitions may explain why only upon their loss the quiescence is broken, but not upon MYB3Rs that only act on mitotic genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">The E2F-Rb regulatory pathway is a pivotal conserved regulator of cell proliferation both in animal and plant cells, acting at the critical transition point of G1 to S phase, known as restriction point. The textbook model is that E2Fs, when Rb-bound, restrict cell proliferation by preventing the expression of key cell cycle genes this is relieved through Rb phosphorylation by CDKs, the activity of which is regulated by a plethora of signalling inputs. Therefore, it is surprising that genetic knockout of all three canonical E2Fs in Arabidopsis can produce viable plants with a functional cell cycle. Here we show that while none of these E2Fs are required for activation of cell cycle genes, collectively they are responsible for their repression and thereby to establish both transient quiescence in stem cells as stable quiescence in differentiated cells. This scenario resembles to what has been established for the mammalian activator E2Fs (E2F1-3), as on one hand they were also found dispensable for cell proliferation while on the other they form complexes with Rb in differentiating cells to silence cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chong et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Much of the previous studies have focused on the functional differences among the three canonical E2Fs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">De Veylder et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">del Pozo et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Magyar et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Magyar et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Sozzani et al., 2006</xref>). E2FA and E2FB are portrayed as transcriptional activators and E2FC as a repressor. Moreover, it appears that they work through different mechanisms, only E2FB and E2FC but not E2FA are part of DREAM-like multi-subunit protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lang et al., 2021</xref>). Cell proliferation in single <italic>e2fa, e2fb</italic> or <italic>e2fc</italic> mutants is largely normal and these plants only display mild phenotypes, e.g., the compromised meristem maintenance and reduced formation of lateral root primordia in <italic>e2fa</italic> mutant, and a slight increase in cell number during leaf development in <italic>e2fb</italic> mutant and an <italic>e2fc</italic> silenced line, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Berckmans et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">del Pozo et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Leviczky et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Oszi et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that the distinction between activator and repressor classes of E2Fs is more nuanced. Interestingly, <italic>e2fae2fb</italic> double knock-out line could not be obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Li et al., 2017</xref>), but this appears to be allele specific, as combining the <italic>e2fb</italic> mutant with <italic>e2fa-2</italic> is viable and did not show proliferation defects during embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Heyman et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Leviczky et al., 2019</xref>). Here we show that combining this <italic>e2fae2fb</italic> double mutant with two different <italic>e2fc</italic> knockout lines, both display overproliferation, mostly due to the inability of maintaining quiescence. This suggests that all the three canonical E2Fs are required for repression of cell cycle genes even if they act through different molecular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Leviczky et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Oszi et al., 2020</xref>). The principal component of repressor complexes on all canonical E2Fs is RBR and it was demonstrated that all three canonical Arabidopsis E2Fs strongly interact with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lang et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Magyar et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Oszi et al., 2020</xref>). However, we have seen a stunning difference between the phenotypes of RBR silencing and the triple <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant, both showing overproliferation during organ development, but only upon RBR silencing and not in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant is cell differentiation repressed. A similar inhibition of differentiation occurs when CYCD3;1, the regulatory component of the major RBR kinase is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dewitte et al., 2003</xref>). On the one hand, RBR repression on E2Fs is the pivotal regulator of the restriction point in G1 and in response to developmental cues can determine the G1 length and whether cells can exit to differentiation. In this scenario tuning E2F activation of cell cycle genes by RBR is the critical mechanism. On the other hand, mutation of all three E2Fs abrogates both the RBR-E2F corepressor function and the transcriptional activation of cell cycle genes. The comparison of RBR silencing and <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant lines indicates that E2F activator function is important for the cell cycle exit and onset of differentiation, while maintaining quiescence is primarily regulated by RBR-E2F co-repression. In addition, our results show that plant E2Fs, like their animal counterparts, are the primary effectors of RBR in nearly every process where RBR is involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6a</xref>). The transient stem cell quiescence is most sensitively abrogated in the stomata lineage when RBR is silenced or the canonical E2Fs are mutated, as indicated by the abundance of small cells characterised as stomata stem cells and by the continuous upregulation of stomata stem cell factors, <italic>TMM</italic> and <italic>SPCH</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Borghi et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, RBR, in an E2F-independent manner, by direct interaction with the stomata terminal differentiation transcription factor, FAMA, was also shown to regulate the late steps of differentiation within the stomata cell linage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Matos et al., 2014</xref>). However, in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant we have not seen the characteristic phenotype of the <italic>fama-1</italic> mutant, called fama-tumours, clusters of small, narrow epidermal cells that are unable to go through the final stages of stomata differentiation. RBR and E2Fs can also directly regulate genes involved in late embryonic differentiation programs, e.g., <italic>LEC2</italic> and <italic>ABI3</italic>, which are direct E2F and RBR targets and are upregulated both when RBR is silenced or in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant, but only in the former the developmental transition of seedling establishment is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gutzat et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that as during leaf emergence, the developmental arrest in seedlings, when RBR is silenced, is due to the deregulated cell cycle.</p><p id="P21">It was shown both in animals and plants that quiescence protects long-lived stem cells against stress and toxicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cheung &amp; Rando, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cruz-Ramirez et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Legesse-Miller et al., 2012</xref>). In agreement, we found that stem cells are sensitive to genotoxic stress both upon RBR silencing and in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant. RBR and E2Fs were also implicated to directly regulate the expression of DNA damage genes and cell death. In this respect we observed a much more pronounced spontaneous cell death with RBR silenced cells than in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant, which correlated with the level of induction of DNA damage genes, suggesting that both co-repression and E2F transactivation function contributes to this regulation.</p><p id="P22">RBR, E2FB and E2FC together with the mitotic MYB3Rs can be part of large repressor complexes, called DREAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lang et al., 2021</xref>). Here we show that RBR, E2Fs and MYB3Rs are also recruited to largely overlapping sets of cell cycle target genes, but still maintain a specific regulatory function on E2F targets or mitotic genes dependent on whether the MSA or E2F target sequence is present in these promoters. We have shown previously that mutation of the three repressor MYB3R (<italic>myb3r1/3/5</italic>) in Arabidopsis resulted in excess cells in developing organs but exclusively within the meristems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, mitotic genes like <italic>CYCB1;2</italic> were found to be ectopically expressed also in differentiated leaf cells, but this did not result in mitotic reactivation, possibly because E2F-RBR complexes are still present, and capable of repressing genes involved in the G1/S transition, which may explain why quiescence is efficiently maintained in the myb3r1/3/5 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>). In contrast, in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant, where the E2F target genes are de-repressed, we find that both the transient quiescence in stem cells and terminal quiescence in differentiated cells are broken. Although E2Fs primarily regulate genes with G1-S function, they were also shown to control the expression of key G2-M regulatory genes, like the plant specific CDKBs, supporting that E2Fs regulate both cell cycle transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Magyar et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, E2Fs and RBR were specifically enriched on the promoter of the activator MYB3R4, a key regulator of mitosis, and indeed it was induced and activated in the <italic>e2fabc</italic> mutant leaf, which might explain the central role of E2Fs to maintain cellular quiescence by controlling both G1/S and G2/M transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Taken together, we have shown that the canonical E2Fs together with RBR form a repressor complex on a cohort of cell cycle genes that is pivotal for maintaining quiescence.

The beads were washed 2 × 5 min in ChIP Wash Buffer 1 (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris–HCl at pH 8, 2 mM EDTA at pH 8, 150 mM NaCl), 2 × 5 min in ChIP Wash Buffer 2 (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris–HCl at pH 8, 2 mM EDTA at pH 8, 500 mM NaCl), 2 × 5 min in ChIP Wash Buffer 3 (0.25 mM LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM Tris–HCl at pH 8, 1 mM EDTA at pH 8) and twice in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8, 1 mM EDTA at pH 8). ChIPed DNA was eluted by two 15-min incubations at 65°C with 250 μL of Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO<sub>3</sub>). Chromatin was reverse cross-linked by adding 20 μL of NaCl 5 M and incubated overnight at 65°C. Reverse cross-linked DNA was treated with RNase and Proteinase K and extracted with phenol–chloroform. DNA was ethanol precipitated in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen and resuspended in 10 μL of nuclease-free water in a DNA low-bind tube. Libraries were then generated using 10 ng of DNA and NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality of libraries was assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent), prior to 1 × 75 bp high-throughput sequencing by NextSeq 500 (Illumina).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Analysis of ChIP-seq data</title><p id="P32">Trimmomatic-0.38 was used for quality trimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Martins et al., 2011</xref>).

Left: in the wild-type, E2Fs form complexes with RBR to repress cell cycle genes and allow cell division arrest in quiescent and differentiated cells.

Right: in RBR-deficient lines, E2F/RBR complexes are also lacking, but E2Fs are fully active, leading to a more pronounced hyperactivation of cell cycle genes and thus completely preventing cell differentiation, and inducing cell death.</p><p>b: Distinct molecular roles of E2Fs and MYB3Rs in the control of cell cycle arrest. Top: in the wild-type, Repressor complexes containing RBR, E2Fs and MYB3Rs target G1/S and G2/M genes to repress their expression either via the MSA or the E2F motives. Middle: in the <italic>myb3R1,3,5</italic> mutant that lacks repressor MYB3Rs, E2Fs are still present and able to repress G1/S and some G2/M genes bound via the E2F motif.

Bottom: in the e2fabc mutant, repressor MYB3Rs can still repress some G2/M genes with or without RBR, but repression of both G1/S and G2/M activators such as MYB3R4 is lost, resulting in enhanced cell proliferation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS158252-f008"/></fig></floats-group></article>
