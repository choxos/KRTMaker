Many enzymes harness large-scale motions of their domains to achieve tremendous catalytic prowess and high selectivity for specific substrates. One outstanding example is provided by the three-domain enzyme adenylate kinase (AK), which catalyzes phosphotransfer between ATP to AMP. Here we study the phenomenon of substrate inhibition by AMP and its correlation with domain motions. Using single-molecule FRET spectroscopy, we show that AMP does not block access to the ATP binding site, neither by competitive binding to the ATP cognate site nor by directly closing the LID domain. Instead, inhibitory concentrations of AMP lead to a faster and more cooperative domain closure by ATP, leading in turn to an increased population of the closed state. The effect of AMP binding can be modulated through mutations throughout the structure of the enzyme, as shown by the screening of an extensive AK mutant library. Mutation of multiple conserved residues leads to increased substrate inhibition, suggesting a positive selection during evolution. Combining these insights, we developed a model that explains the complex activity of AK, particularly substrate inhibition, based on the experimentally observed opening and closing rates. Notably, the model indicates that the catalytic power is affected by the microsecond balance between the open and closed states of the enzyme. Our findings highlight the crucial role of protein motions in enzymatic activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>smFRET</kwd><kwd>enzymatic activity</kwd><kwd>protein dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Classification</title><kwd>Biological Sciences</kwd><kwd>Biophysics</kwd><kwd>Computational Biology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Enzymes have been designed by nature to accelerate vital chemical reactions by many orders of magnitude. Quite a few of them have evolved to harness large-scale motions of domains and subunits to promote their activity. The study of the structural dynamics of these proteins is essential to decipher how they function and are regulated, as has been demonstrated in multiple experimental and theoretical reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The enzyme adenylate kinase (AK) is a paradigmatic example of a strong relation between conformational dynamics and catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). AK plays a key role in maintaining ATP levels in cells by catalyzing the reaction ATP + AMP ⇄ ADP + ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). It consists of three domains: the large CORE domain, the LID domain that binds ATP, and the nucleotide monophosphate (NMP)-binding domain that binds AMP. X-ray crystallographic studies showed that the LID and NMP domains undergo a major conformational rearrangement upon substrate binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). This movement, termed domain closure, forms the enzyme’s active center and helps to exclude solvent molecules that might interfere with the chemical reaction. AK’s domain-closure dynamics have been studied using NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) and fluorescence experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), as well as multiple molecular dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). In particular, our recent single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments demonstrated that AK’s opening and closing rates are significantly faster than previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). In the presence of substrates, domain closure is completed in just a few tens of microseconds. These are likely the fastest large-scale conformational dynamics measured to date, and they are orders of magnitude faster than the overall turnover rate of the enzyme. It was proposed that these fast domain movements might assist the enzyme in orienting its substrates optimally for catalysis, a hypothesis supported by recent simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Interestingly, AK also incurs a pronounced AMP-mediated substrate inhibition (SI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Despite many efforts, the mechanism behind SI has not been elucidated convincingly. While some studies have hinted toward the competitive binding of AMP at the ATP site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), others claimed that AMP substrate inhibition in AK is uncompetitive in relation to ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Whether large-scale domain motions in AK relate to SI has also been debated. Bulk FRET studies have indicated that inhibition arises due to substantial closing of the LID domain upon AMP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). However, it was unclear if this effect was induced by direct binding of AMP to the ATP site (competitive inhibition at the ATP site) or through allosteric modulation (i.e., AMP binding at its cognate site affects LID domain movement). Other studies suggested that at high AMP concentrations, binding of AMP before the release of ADP from the LID domain might lead to the formation of an abortive complex that causes inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). The latter effect could arise if LID opening is slow and is the rate-limiting step in catalysis, as has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In this work, we carried out experimental and computational studies on several inhibition-prone as well as non-inhibited mutants of AK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) to determine the mechanism of AMP-mediated SI in AK. Based on the screening of an extensive AK mutant library, we show that mutations throughout the enzyme’s structure modulate SI, suggesting that it has been under positive selection during evolution. We establish that inhibition cannot be explained by either competitive binding of AMP at the ATP site or spurious LID domain closure by AMP in the absence of ATP. Instead, we find that for inhibition-prone variants of AK, AMP facilitates domain closure at lower concentrations of ATP, which may interfere with proper substrate binding mechanics required for the reaction. Based on these results, we propose a kinetic model that combines conformational dynamics and chemical steps to explain the enzymatic activity of AK with substrate inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Structural and kinetic attributes of AK variants with substrate inhibition</title><p id="P5">In an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), we characterized a series of mutants of AK and found a correlation between AMP-mediated SI and protein stability. An important question that arises is whether there is a specific region that is responsible for the gain or loss of SI, possibly by affecting how the substrates bind to the protein. To answer this, we created an extensive library of AK mutants and characterized their SI profiles. We particularly sought to identify mutations that alter SI without perturbing the enzymatic activity. Accordingly, using the crystal structure of AK with the bound inhibitor AP<sub>5</sub>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), we first identified 71 residues that were at least 8Å away from the inhibitor and their sidechains were not involved in any interactions with the rest of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1a</xref>, see details in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). We then generated a library of 923 mutants wherein 13 different amino acids were introduced at each of these 71 locations identified above (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). Next, we developed a screening method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1b</xref>) to measure the extent of AMP-mediated SI directly from the cell lysate of 1248 individual colonies by measuring the ratio of the initial reaction velocity at two different concentrations of AMP (100 μM and 500 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We selected ~200 candidates from this dataset that showed lower, higher, and similar SI as the WT protein and sequenced them by Sanger sequencing to recover 86 unique mutations with clean chromatograms in the first pass. We further purified these proteins and measured their activity profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). For a quantitative comparison between the mutants and literature values, the AMP-related Michaelis constant (<italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic>) and inhibition constant (<italic>K<sub>I</sub></italic>) were obtained by a fit to a model of uncompetitive inhibition (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>), and the values are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>. We mapped the positions of the inhibition-prone mutants (<italic>K<sub>I</sub></italic> =&lt; 500) and the non-inhibited mutants (<italic>K<sub>I</sub></italic> &gt;= 1500) on the structure of AK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). Both effects can be observed for residues distributed all over the structure rather than in specific regions of the protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>, we observed that at those locations where mutation led to a loss of inhibition, the WT residue had a statistically significant (p&lt;0.01, Student’s t-test) higher conservation than those that led to an increase of inhibition. (The conservation score was determined by a high frequency of occurrence in a multiple sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>)). In other words, the gain of SI upon mutation tends to occur at positions of low conservation, while the loss of SI occurs at highly conserved locations. This signifies that SI in AK has been under positive selection during evolution. Since back-to-consensus mutations are generally stabilizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), this plot also signifies that higher protein stability generally leads to more SI in AK, as seen from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The mutant screening experiment did not identify a specific structural attribute that is responsible for SI by AMP. Further, a crystallographic study of one of the mutants also did not demonstrate a structural change that may explain the effect of AMP. In particular, we determined the crystal structure of L107I AK, which shows strong inhibition, in complex with Ap<sub>5</sub>A to a resolution of 2.05 Å. The structure was found to be very similar to other closed AK structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>), with a 0.3 Å root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the 1AKE structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). As no differences in the static structure of AK were found that could explain differences in enzymatic activity, these are more likely rooted in dynamic interactions. Therefore, we turned to studies of the dynamic properties of AK mutants in relation to SI.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>From biochemistry to structural dynamics</title><p id="P8">To explain the origins of SI in AK and similar multi-substrate enzymes, previous studies have primarily considered three hypotheses. The first involved binding of the inhibiting substrate to an additional site (e.g. the ATP site) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). The second, uncompetitive inhibition by AMP through blocking the accessibility of the ATP binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Finally, it was suggested that kinetic differences between alternating pathways towards the fully substrate-bound complex could lead to inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To probe the origins of SI further, we selected three variants of AK with similar thermal stabilities as the WT: L82V and L107I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), which are more inhibited than the WT, and F86W, which is not inhibited by AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Michaelis-Menten curves for these variants as a function of AMP concentration are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>. We first investigated if SI in AK arises due to AMP having a second binding site in addition to the one on the NMP domain. The additional binding site could be the ATP-binding site – as AMP is a close structural analog of ATP – or any other yet-unknown site. In that context, we found that for the WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), the presence of excess ATP led to a gradual and dose-dependent loss in SI, which is a classic apparent sign of competitive inhibition at the ATP binding site. In other words, it seemed possible that the competitive binding of AMP at the ATP binding site at high concentrations causes inhibition, which is relieved by excess ATP in the solution. If this were true, then under conditions when the AMP concentration vastly surpasses the ATP concentration, binding of AMP to the ATP site would be preferred and result in a complete loss of activity. Contrary to this expectation, the enzyme retains significant residual activity even at high AMP concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), as seen particularly well for L107I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We therefore ask: does AMP inhibit AK by binding to the ATP binding site in the LID domain, or does it affect the catalytic properties differently? To gain insight into this question, we turned to smFRET spectroscopy to measure the domain movements directly. AK was labeled at residues 73 and 142, positioned in the CORE and LID domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>), and studied in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). In the absence of substrates, AK molecules yielded a FRET efficiency histogram dominated by a peak at ~0.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>, blue), corresponding to the open conformation. A shoulder towards higher FRET efficiency values indicated that the closed conformation is also sampled, though to a small extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). The addition of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>, green and purple) shifted the histogram towards higher FRET efficiency values, resulting from a considerable increase in the population of the closed conformation. In the presence of 1 mM AMP (orange), similar shifts were observed, but they required much lower concentrations of ATP.</p><p id="P11">Surprisingly, in the presence of high concentrations of AMP as a sole substrate, the FRET efficiency histogram of the WT protein remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), indicating that AMP alone cannot cause LID domain closure. To see if the effect of AMP is different in mutants with stronger or weaker SI, we also double-labeled the three variants introduced above (L107I, L82V and F86W). None of these single-point mutants significantly affected the FRET efficiency histogram of the apoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>), and the addition of AMP alone did not induce a significant shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). The only exception was L82V, the most inhibited mutant, which showed a slight shift towards higher FRET efficiencies. To accurately retrieve changes in the populations of the open and closed conformations of the enzyme under various conditions, we used the hidden-Markov model-based analysis method H<sup>2</sup>MM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). This algorithm employs photon arrival times as input for an optimization process that obtains both occupancies and rates of exchange of conformational states and is capable of retrieving microsecond dynamics. Representative trajectories including state assignments using the Viterbi algorithm are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>. The model we used involved only two conformational states, open and closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). The resulting parameters were validated with different tests as outlined in the Supporting Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5-8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3+4</xref>). A notable increase in the population of the closed state by AMP was seen only for L82V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). Interestingly, both closing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9a</xref>) and opening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9b</xref>) rates were accelerated in the binary AK-AMP complex. This effect was particularly substantial for L107I and L82V. In contrast, no changes were seen for the uninhibited F86W.</p><p id="P12">Clearly, AMP alone does not promote the closed state of the LID domain in AK. However, this does not rule out that AMP binds to the ATP site and blocks access for the native substrate, thereby inhibiting the protein. To check this point, we tested whether AMP can competitively replace ATP from its cognate binding site. To limit the potential effect of ADP, which binds to both the ATP and AMP site, we utilized the slowly hydrolyzable ATP analog ATP-γ-S. In the presence of 50 μM ATP-γ-S, partial closure was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). If AMP can displace ATP/ATP-γ-S from its native binding site, adding a vast excess of AMP should induce a shift towards the open conformation. Instead, we observed a minor shift towards the closed state in the FRET efficiency histograms, rendering the possibility that AMP acts as a competitive substrate inhibitor very unlikely.</p><p id="P13">To provide support to the point that AMP does not bind at the ATP site, in addition to the single-molecule studies, we rationally designed a mutant Q92Y that is predicted to weaken AMP binding at its cognate site, based on the structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> AK with bound Ap<sub>5</sub>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). The mutation indeed led to a loss in activity for both the WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10a</xref>) and L82V (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10b</xref>). Using Differential Scanning Fluorimetry to obtain the change in thermal melting temperatures of AK upon ligand binding as a function of ligand concentration, we found that Q92Y on the background of WT weakens AMP binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10c</xref>). On the background of the highly inhibited mutant L82V (L82V-Q92Y mutant), it completely abolished AMP binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10d</xref>), while ATP binding was retained for both WT and L82V backgrounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10e-f</xref>). This experiment indicated that AMP cannot bind elsewhere to its cognate site. This was also confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry studies, which found no more than one binding site for both ATP and AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>AMP binding has an allosteric effect on the LID domain</title><p id="P14">Given the observed effect of AMP binding at its own site on LID domain dynamics, it is imperative to find whether AMP further modulates the effect of ATP on domain closure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> shows how the population of the closed state of the enzyme changes in response to substrate binding to the LID domain, either with ATP alone or also in the presence of 1 mM AMP. (In the latter case, ADP was also added to maintain the enzymatic reaction under equilibrium- see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). The very presence of ATP as a sole substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, circles) enabled a large conformational change from a predominantly open to a more closed conformation. The maximum occupancy that can be achieved for the closed state is 56-78%, in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Fitting the curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> to simple binding isotherms provided the transition midpoint concentrations (which we call <italic>C<sub>50</sub></italic>), which were found to correlate with the strength of substrate inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>). The impact of a fixed concentration of AMP on the ATP-dependent population of the closed state is shown in squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. LID domain closure occurred at a 20-40 times lower substrate concentration in the presence of AMP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>), indicating remarkable cooperativity in substrate binding. This cooperativity was almost entirely absent for the non-inhibited mutant F86W (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). Interestingly, previous work has shown that AMP binding reduces the <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> for ATP in the WT but not in the F86W mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). The strongest cooperativity was observed for the most inhibited mutant, L82V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). Furthermore, in this mutant, the closed state was significantly more populated (78.4±0.7%) than for the WT (57.1±0.6%).</p><p id="P15">It is clear from the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> that AMP has an effect on the closure of the LID domain, even though it does not directly bind to that domain. AMP must therefore affect the LID domain allosterically. To shed further light on the effect of AMP on LID domain mechanics, we studied domain-closure dynamics at a fixed concentration of ATP (1 mM, together with specified concentrations of ADP to maintain equilibrium) and increased concentrations of AMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). As reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), both opening and closing rates are much faster than the enzymatic turnover (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>). In the WT protein in the absence of AMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>), closing rates (27,307±752 s<sup>-1</sup>) were slightly faster than opening rates (23,937±1,123 s<sup>-1</sup>). Strikingly, the gradual addition of AMP did not affect the rate of domain opening. For the closing rate, small AMP concentrations – at which no inhibition is detected (up to ~1 mM) – also did not have a measurable impact. However, at inhibitory AMP concentrations (&gt; 1 mM), domain closure was significantly accelerated (up to 50,289±2,795 s<sup>-1</sup>), leading to a higher occupancy of the closed state of 63.5±0.4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>). Interestingly, this overpopulation of the closed state coincided with the range of AMP concentrations where the most substantial drop in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>) was observed. A very similar picture was seen with the more inhibited variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b-c</xref>). No measurable impact of AMP binding was detected for the opening rates, whereas the closing rates increased above 100 μM. A <italic>C<sub>50</sub></italic> value of 2568±820 μM was found for the WT, with significantly lower values (~500 μM) for L107I and L82V. Moreover, L107I was shifted further towards the closed state (64.8±0.5%) than it is possible in the presence of ATP alone (55.8±0.8%). For L82V, the population of the closed state (75.5±0.8%) was the largest, which might match that mutant’s overall low activity. No enhancement of the closing rate was detected for the non-inhibited mutant F86W (similar to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>A model to explain substrate inhibition</title><p id="P16">Given that AMP inhibits AK’s enzymatic activity and also affects domain-closure dynamics, we postulated that the two phenomena are correlated. Therefore, we devised a kinetic model for AK, based on the hypothesis that different closed states can be sampled, depending upon the order of ligand binding. Some of these states are incompatible with catalysis and must convert to the catalysis-prone state before the reaction occurs. As per our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>), the apoenzyme E can be present in both open (E<sup>O</sup>, blue) and closed (E<sup>C</sup>, red) states. (States are defined only for the ATP-binding LID domain.) The status of the LID domain does not affect the binding of AMP to the NMP domain; hence, both open and closed states can bind AMP. However, ATP can bind only to the open state.</p><p id="P17">If ATP binds first at the LID domain, the ET<sup>O</sup> and ET<sup>C</sup>, i.e. open and closed conformations of the ATP-bound protein, respectively, are formed. Both of these states can subsequently bind AMP and form a double substrate-bound state, ETM. If AMP binds first at the NMP domain to form EM<sup>O</sup> and EM<sup>C</sup>, the consequent binding of ATP leads to the formation of ETM<sub>inh</sub>. ETM and ETM<sub>inh</sub> are distinguished by their binding order – ATP first, then AMP or vice versa-based on a hypothesis that initial AMP binding may result in a limited or different sampling of the relative orientation of the nucleotides (see below). Hence, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ETM</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>inh</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is an unproductive closed state, while ETM<sup>C</sup> is productive. The two ETM states can interconvert only through their open states, as suggested recently by MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). At the same time, phosphoryl transfer can happen only through ETM<sup>C</sup>. In essence, we have introduced a kinetic hindrance for the path that binds AMP first. When a typical activity assay of AK is carried out in the bulk in the presence of saturating ATP concentrations, at low AMP levels greater flux of the reaction goes through the pathway involving the productive ETM intermediate. However, as AMP levels increase, a larger fraction of the flux goes through the pathway involving the unproductive ETM<sub>inh</sub> state, leading to a drop in activity.</p><p id="P18">To simulate kinetics based on this model, we used experimentally observed opening and closing rates of the LID domain for <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext></mml:msup><mml:mo>⇌</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext>ET</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ET</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext></mml:msup><mml:mo>⇌</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ET</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext>EM</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>EM</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext></mml:msup><mml:mo>⇌</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>EM</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext>ETM</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ETM</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext></mml:msup><mml:mo>⇌</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ETM</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> as input in the model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S8</xref>). We assumed that each species has one specific opening and closing rate. The concentration of nucleotides determined the occupancy of each of these states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). The single-molecule experiments could not distinguish between ET and ETM, as no change in the apparent protein dynamics was observed upon the addition of AMP at non-inhibiting concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).

Nucleotide binding rates are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S9</xref>.</p><p id="P19">Under these model assumptions, a simulation of the enzyme activity at a saturating ATP concentration (1mM) and varying AMP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>) was effectively able to qualitatively reproduce the SI pattern of the WT as well as the mutants L107I and L82V. Further, no inhibition was observed for the F86W mutant, as expected. On the other hand, using a saturating AMP concentration (1mM) and varying ATP concentrations, the simulation did not show SI for any mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). The ability to obtain the correct level of inhibition by AMP for the different mutants provides a strong support for the model. While in principle we could use the model to quantitatively fit the enzyme activity curves, we believe that our lack of knowledge on some of the involved parameters does not currently warrant such a calculation. Future studies might shed light on several of the unknown parameters, facilitating a more quantitative analysis.</p><p id="P20">We used the model to obtain some further insight into the role of domain closure dynamics in enzyme activity. To this end, we altered the rates of LID domain closing of each of the ETM states in turn, using one of two ways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11</xref>): either by preserving the open/closed ratio <italic>K<sub>C</sub></italic> or by preserving the opening rate, similar to the experimentally observed effect of AMP. In both scenarios, all other parameters were kept constant.

With <italic>K<sub>C</sub></italic> preserved, also varying the rate towards the productive ETM<sup>C</sup> had a minor effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11b</xref>). A much more substantial impact of varying the closing rate towards <inline-formula><mml:math id="M6"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ETM</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>inh</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> was observed when the opening rate was fixed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11c</xref>). When the conformational equilibrium was altered, the unproductive states became more populated, which caused stronger inhibition. In contrast, for the productive closing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11d</xref>), enhancing the domain closure rate had a positive effect on turnover.</p><p id="P21">An important criterion determining SI strength is the conversion rate between <inline-formula><mml:math id="M7"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ETM</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>inh</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and ETM<sup>O</sup>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11e</xref> depicts how an increase in this rate can almost completely thwart SI while a reduction in the rate increases the effect.

In particular, the complex interplay between conformational changes and enzymatic activity has been frequently investigated. An important aspect here is the AMP- mediated SI, which has been studied for several decades, but no mechanism has been conclusively established. In a previous work, several stabilizing and destabilizing point mutations were introduced into AK, and the mutants exhibited many extremes of SI (from very strong to no SI at all) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In the present work, we used several of those mutants (covering a range of SI behavior) to pinpoint a mechanism for inhibition. We show that neither uncompetitive nor competitive binding of AMP can explain SI in AK. Instead, we find that inhibition arises due to strong allosteric communication between the NMP and LID domains, which manifests in a highly cooperative closing of the LID domain for inhibition-prone mutants in the presence of both ligands (ATP and AMP) as compared to ATP alone. Based on this, we propose a model for the enzymatic activity that explains why greater sampling of the LID closed state in the presence of AMP and ATP might lead to SI. According to this model, the order of substrate binding matters. In particular, the initial binding of AMP followed by ATP leads to a closed state that does not allow the correct positioning of the ligands for effective phosphate transfer. Using the experimentally observed opening and closing rates for each state of the enzyme, this model can effectively reproduce the SI profiles of the different mutants studied. The enzymatic cycle of AK has traditionally been understood as a random bi-bi mechanism where the two substrates ATP and AMP can bind in any order. Our data shows that AK activity follows a particular class of random reactions: the substrates can bind in any order, but the outcome of the reaction is different along the two pathways.</p><p id="P23">Among the two inhibition-prone mutants, L82V displayed somewhat different properties than L107I. Being the most inhibition-prone, L82V showed an increase in closed-state occupancy with AMP alone, indicating that the allosteric communication between the LID and NMP sites is the highest in this mutant. Nevertheless, even for this mutant, opening rates are higher than closing rates in the presence of only AMP; hence, structural inaccessibility of the ATP binding site cannot be the reason for SI. In the presence of both AMP and ATP, the closed state occupancy for L82V is the highest among all mutants (78% vs. 63-65% for others), which is likely the reason for the potent inhibition and overall low activity. In contrast, F86W displayed minimal impact of AMP on LID domain dynamics, and likewise, no inhibition.</p><p id="P24">Controlling the equilibrium between the open and closed state in AK provides a way to regulate enzymatic activity. Modulating this conformational equilibrium by other means, like mutations or osmolytes, was shown to affect enzymatic catalysis directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). AMP also appears to be a major regulator of AK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). In this context, we found that urea can lift AMP-mediated inhibition by repopulating the open state. We will focus on this effect in a future study.</p><p id="P25">The maximal catalytic rate of AK is obtained at or near the expected physiological concentration of AMP (~300 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>)). Changes in AMP concentration will accordingly lead to changes in AK’s activity, which can substantially affect other processes in the cell by altering the availability of nucleotides. For example, we have recently shown that elevated AMP concentrations decrease the fitness of <italic>E.coli</italic> cells expressing inhibition-prone AK strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Paalme <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that AMP levels in <italic>E.coli</italic> cells depend on which carbon sources are available; for example, AMP levels are elevated when only acetate is present as a carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). For mitochondrial AK it was shown that phosphorylation of AMP to ADP is inhibited when AMP levels sharply increase (for example during ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>)), thus reducing the amount of adenine nucleotides available for oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). The current work, based on an extensive library of AK mutants and subsequent informatics analyses, shows that residues favoring substrate inhibition are often well conserved, suggesting that substrate inhibition in AK has a high functional value. Our recent study of mutant <italic>E.coli</italic> AK strains shows the highest bacterial growth rates for AK variants with a <italic>K<sub>I</sub></italic> similar to the WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>); <italic>E.coli</italic> AK might have evolved to represent the ideal tradeoff between efficient AMP binding and thermal stability on one side and SI on the other side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Even single-point mutations can change this balance, as our library data clearly shows. Interestingly, SI can be modulated through mutations that span most regions of the proteins, suggesting that long-range allosteric communication is a general feature of AK.</p><p id="P26">It is important to mention that previous work on AK dynamics suggested that the LID opening rate is the rate-determining step in catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). In contrast, a recent study demonstrated an enhanced tendency toward enzyme opening for several mutants with a low catalytic activity, suggesting that domain opening is not rate-limiting at least in those mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Our smFRET data in this study and the previous one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) demonstrate that rates of domain movement (both opening and closing) are orders of magnitude faster than the enzymatic turnover, which implies that the enzyme opens and closes multiple times before the catalytic cycle is completed. Our model of the enzymatic activity coupled with conformational changes suggests that as long as these rates are substantially higher than the catalytic turnover rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>), the explicit interconversion rates between the open and closed states do not determine enzyme activity. Instead, the relative population of the two states is what determines activity and inhibition.</p><p id="P27">A matter of intense debate in enzyme catalysis is whether conformational fluctuations play a role in catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). While several studies have claimed that enzyme fluctuations play a direct role in the chemical step, theoretical studies have refuted those (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Our work suggests that the ultrafast domain movements help to tune the equilibrium between states of the enzyme with different activities continuously. Such a mechanism is not unique to AK. For example, we recently discovered that the activity of the AAA+ disaggregation machine ClpB is tightly correlated to the distribution between active and inactive conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). However, the interconversion between these two states happens on a much faster timescale than any other protein activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Schanda et al. found that the enzymatic activity of the TET2 aminopeptidase is controlled by the conformational equilibrium of a highly dynamic loop in the catalytic chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Also, the turnover in the HisFH enzyme complex is dictated by the population of the active state, with the conversion between ground and active state taking place on a faster time scale than enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>).</p><p id="P28">This study goes beyond previous attempts to connect conformational dynamics and chemical steps in enzymes by developing a kinetic model that explicitly takes conformational changes into account. The model builds on the recent <italic>in silico</italic> observation that fast opening and closing cycles might help to find the correct mutual substrate orientation efficiently and to guarantee the high catalytic activity of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). It is further based on the hypothesis that <italic>the order of binding of the two substrates to the enzyme</italic> dictates how effectively repeated opening and closing cycles help to reorientate the substrates for the reaction. Strikingly, this model is able to correctly reproduce trends of substrate inhibition among the WT enzyme and several mutants. In conclusion, our study of a common and widely studied enzyme uncovers the mechanistic relationship between very fast conformational variation and catalysis.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P29">See Supporting Information for a detailed description of the methodology for sample preparation, data collection and analysis.

We focus here on the domain closure dynamics of adenylate kinase (AK) and how they are affected by substrate inhibition. By screening an extensive mutant library, we show that this feature of the enzyme is well conserved in evolution. Importantly, domain closure is required in order to bring AK’s substrates close together for their chemical reaction; single-molecule FRET studies directly measure the populations of the open and closed states. We find that overpopulation of the closed state can be detrimental to activity. The results allow us to develop a kinetic model that properly accounts for AK kinetics by combining conformational dynamics and biochemical steps.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Structural and kinetic attributes of AK variants.</title><p>(a) Structure of AK with its three domains.

(a) The apoprotein (blue trace) mainly adopts an open conformation, occasionally exploring the closed state. The binding of ATP increases the population of the closed state, as demonstrated by histograms at 100 μM (green) and 1 mM (purple) ATP. When 1 mM AMP is added, a significant population of the closed state is attained even at a low ATP concentration of 50 μM (orange). In this experiment, ADP was also added at concentrations that maintained the equilibrium of the enzymatic reaction (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). The dashed lines indicate the most likely positions of the open and closed state (0.37/0.72 for the WT, respectively). (b) AMP alone, even at 30 mM (green), leads to very minimal changes in FRET efficiency compared to the apoprotein (blue). ATP-γ-S, a slowly hydrolyzable analog of ATP, binds to the ATP binding site and triggers partial closure at 50 μM (orange). In the presence of both ligands (purple), ATP-γ-S is still bound to the ATP-binding site and not outcompeted by AMP, which would trigger LID opening. Instead, the binding of AMP to its own site even promotes closure to a minor extent. (c) For the apoprotein, the FRET efficiency histogram of the WT (blue) and all mutants are similar. Shown are F86W (green), L107 (red) and L82V (black). (d) FRET efficiency histogram for all mutants in the presence of 5 mM AMP. Only for L82V, a significant shift to higher FRET efficiency is detected. e) Values for the occupancy of the closed state as a function of AMP concentration were obtained by H<sup>2</sup>MM analysis. The experiment confirms that the occupancy of the closed state for the WT (blue), L107I (red) and F86W (green) is not significantly altered by AMP alone. In contrast, for L82V (black), a partial closure is observed. Asterisks indicate the significance of the deviation of parameters from the apoprotein (***: p&lt;0.01, **: p&lt;0.05, *: p&lt;0.1, no index: p&gt;0.1, Student’s t-test).

Subsequent binding of AMP leads to a productive closed state (ETM) that undergoes the chemical step of the enzyme in the closed conformation (ETM<sup>C</sup>). However, if AMP binds first (red pathway, via EM), subsequent binding of ATP causes the formation of ETM<sub>inh</sub>, which deviates from the productive state ETM in the orientation of the substrates.
