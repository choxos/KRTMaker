We reveal distinct organ-specific roles of the MYOSIN-RESEMBLING CHLOROPLAST PROTEIN (MRC) in regulating granule initiation in the endosperm and leaves of wheat. We isolated three independent TILLING mutants of tetraploid wheat (<italic>Triticum turgidum</italic> cv. Kronos) with premature stop or missense mutations in the A-genome homeolog, which we showed to be the only active homeolog in tetraploid wheat due to a disruption of the B-genome homeolog. Wheat endosperm contains both large A-type granules initiated during early grain development, and small B-type granules that initiate about 10 – 15 days later. The <italic>mrc</italic> mutants had significantly smaller A-type granules and a higher relative volume of B-type granules in the endosperm than the wild type. Whereas B-type granules initiated 15 - 20 days post anthesis (dpa) in the wild-type, they appeared as early as 10 dpa in the <italic>mrc-1</italic> mutant, suggesting a role for MRC in suppressing B-type granule initiation during early grain development. By contrast, MRC promotes granule initiation in leaves: mutants carrying premature stop mutations in <italic>MRC</italic> had fewer granules per chloroplast than the wild type. These contrasting roles of MRC among wheat organs provide new insight into functional diversification of granule initiation proteins, and suggest that they may facilitate the diverse patterns of granule initiation observed across species and organs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Starch is the major storage carbohydrate in leaves, seeds and storage organs of most plants. It is synthesised in plastids as insoluble granules composed of two glucose polymers: amylopectin and amylose. Amylopectin is a branched polymer with linear α-1,4-glucan chains and α-1,6-branch points, and forms the semi-crystalline starch granule matrix - typically constituting 70-90% <italic>w/w</italic> of starch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Smith and Zeeman, 2020</xref>). Amylose constitutes 10 - 30% <italic>w/w</italic> of starch and is composed primarily of long α-1,4-linked linear chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Seung, 2020</xref>). The biosynthesis of the starch polymers is relatively well understood at the molecular level, and is generally conserved between leaf and storage starches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Smith and Zeeman, 2020</xref>). However, we are only beginning to understand how starch granule formation is initiated, and the factors underpinning the vast diversity in granule initiation patterns observed between different organs and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Tetlow and Emes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Seung and Smith, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P5">A prime example of diverse granule initiation patterns between species can be observed in the seed endosperms of grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Matsushima et al., 2013</xref>). Grass species of the Triticeae, including important cereal crops such as wheat, barley and rye, have a unique bimodal size distribution of starch granules in the grain endosperm – containing large flattened A-type granules (20-30 μm in diameter) and small round B-type granules (2-7 μm in diameter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Howard et al., 2011</xref>). The initiation of these two different types of granules is both spatially and temporally separated: A-type granules initiate in amyloplasts as early as 4 days post anthesis (dpa), whereas B-type granules initiate 10-15 days after the A-type granules (i.e., around 15-20 dpa) and at least partly within stromules that emanate from the amyloplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Parker, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bechtel et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Langeveld et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Howard et al., 2011</xref>). This is distinct from most other grass species, which produce “compound” starch granules – where multiple granules initiate early during grain development in each amyloplast and eventually fuse (e.g., in rice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Matsushima et al., 2013</xref>). Our recent work has identified proteins that are important for determining the initiation of bimodal starch granules in wheat. These include B-GRANULE CONTENT1 (BGC1) in <italic>wheat/Aegilops</italic> - which is orthologous to FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 (FLO6) in barley and rice and PROTEIN TARGETING TO STARCH 2 (PTST2) in Arabidopsis and <italic>Brachypodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Peng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Saito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Seung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Watson-Lazowski et al., 2022</xref>). BGC1 in wheat has a dose-dependent effect on granule initiation, where partial reductions in gene dosage can almost eliminate B-type granules without affecting A-type granule formation, whereas complete loss of function also causes defective A-type granule formation, including the formation of some compound/semi-compound granules that arise from multiple initiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Howard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Saccomanno et al., 2022</xref>). STARCH SYNTHASE 4 (SS4) is also required for normal A-type granule formation. In its absence, compound granules form in place of most A-type granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hawkins et al., 2021</xref>). The increased number of initiations per amyloplast that led to compound granule formation in these mutants was unexpected since in Arabidopsis leaves both SS4 and PTST2 promote granule initiation, and mutants lacking either protein have reduced numbers of starch granules per chloroplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Roldán et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Seung et al., 2017</xref>). These observations suggest that the proteins involved in granule initiation are to some extent conserved between species and organs, but they can act differently depending on the patterns of granule initiation in the species/tissue.</p><p id="P6">To gain further insight into such differences, we explored the function of wheat MYOSIN-RESEMBLING CHLOROPLAST PROTEIN (MRC, also known as PROTEIN INVOLVED IN STARCH INITIATION, PII1) in both chloroplasts of leaves and amyloplasts of the endosperm. MRC is a long coiled-coil protein that promotes granule initiation in Arabidopsis leaves, as most chloroplasts in the <italic>mrc</italic> mutant contain only a single granule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Seung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Vandromme et al., 2019</xref>). The exact function of MRC is unknown, but it is proposed to act via an interaction with SS4 and PTST2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Seung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Vandromme et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with previous work in Arabidopsis, we found that MRC promotes starch granule initiation in wheat leaves, but we discovered an unexpected, distinct role for MRC in the temporal control of B-type granule initiation in the wheat endosperm. MRC is expressed at the early stages of grain development, and wheat <italic>mrc</italic> mutants have severe alterations in the starch granule size distribution relative to the wild type, with smaller A-type granules and a higher relative volume of B-type granules. We demonstrate that this phenotype arises from the early initiation of B-type granules in the mutant, suggesting MRC represses B-type granule initiation during early grain development. This role of MRC in the wheat endosperm demonstrates how the function of granule initiation proteins can be adapted to mediate specific patterns of granule initiation among different species/tissues.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The wheat orthologs of MRC are encoded on chromosomes 6A and 6D</title><p id="P7">The starch granule initiation protein MRC is highly conserved among land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Seung et al., 2018</xref>). To determine the role of MRC in wheat, we searched the wheat genome for genes encoding MRC orthologs. We ran a BLASTp search using the amino acid sequence of Arabidopsis MRC (<italic>At</italic>MRC, At4g32190) against the protein sequences from both tetraploid durum wheat (Svevo v1.1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Maccaferri et al., 2019</xref>) and hexaploid bread wheat (IWGSG Chinese Spring)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Appels et al., 2018</xref>) genomes on Ensembl Plants. For hexaploid wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>), the two top protein hits were TraesCS6A02G180500.1 (encoded on chromosome 6A) and TraesCS6D02G164600.1 (encoded on chromosome 6D), which shared 95% sequence identity with each other and were predicted as homeologs on Ensembl. Both genes had a two-exon structure like the Arabidopsis gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Seung et al., 2018</xref>), and were in syntenic positions on the A and D genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). For tetraploid durum wheat (<italic>Triticum turgidum),</italic> the top protein hit was TRITD6Av1G081580.1 (encoded on chromosome 6A), which was identical in nucleotide and amino acid sequence to TraesCS6A02G180500.1. To determine whether these proteins were true orthologs of <italic>At</italic>MRC, we repeated the phylogenetic analyses of MRC homologs from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Seung et al., 2018</xref>) with the wheat protein sequences included. The 6A and 6D proteins clustered together on the tree, distinctly within the grass clade containing the rice and maize sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>). This confirms that the proteins are the wheat orthologs of MRC. They will hereafter be referred to as <italic>Ta</italic>MRC-A1 (TraesCS6A02G180500) or <italic>Tt</italic>MRC-A1 (TRITD6Av1G081580), and <italic>Ta</italic>MRC-D1 (TraesCS6D02G164600). Notably, we did not find a full gene model for MRC on chromosome 6B, or anywhere else on the B genome, either in the durum or bread wheat genome.</p><p id="P8">To investigate why no homeolog was detected on chromosome 6B, we looked at the syntenic region of chromosome 6B in Chinese Spring, where there was a stretch of sequence that had homology to exon 2 and the beginning of the 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, around 14kb downstream of that, there was a region highly similar to the end of the 3’ UTR of <italic>TaMRC-A1.</italic> We looked at the transposable element annotation of the wheat reference genome around the exon 2 fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Daron et al., 2014</xref>), and a complete <italic>gypsy</italic> retrotransposon was annotated between the two 3’UTR fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Further, we identified the 5 bp target site duplication (GAGAT, which is part of the 3’UTR) and the inverted terminal repeat (TGTAA and TTACA at the start and end of the retrotransposon, respectively) characteristic of retrotransposon insertions. The distance between the 5’ end of the exon 2 fragment and its upstream neighbouring gene (TraesCS6B02G20500, a respiratory burst oxidase homolog) was much larger than the distance between <italic>Ta</italic>MRC and the homeologs of the same neighbouring gene on 6A and 6D, indicating a large insertion in this 6B region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Indeed, a fragment of another <italic>gypsy</italic> retrotransposon was found ca. 16 kb upstream of the exon 2 fragment. Additionally, there was a sequence with homology to the 5’ UTR of <italic>TaMRC-A1</italic> (85% identity over 243 bp) just 3 bp upstream of the exon 2 fragment, which suggested that a ~1.3 kbp deletion (based on A-genome distances) removed some of the 5’ UTR, all of exon 1, intron 1 and the start of exon 2 of <italic>TaMRC-B1</italic>. Similar to Chinese Spring, we found identical disruptions in <italic>TaMRC-B1</italic> sequences with retrotransposon insertions and deletions in ten additional wheat genome assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Walkowiak et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, it appears that a deletion and a series of transposon insertions severely disrupted <italic>MRC</italic> on chromosome 6B in bread wheat.</p><p id="P9">Since a B-genome copy was also absent from durum wheat, it is likely that the disruption of <italic>MRC</italic> on chromosome 6B preceded the second hybridisation that resulted in hexaploid wheat. To further investigate when the disruption of <italic>MRC-B1</italic> occurred, we looked for <italic>MRC-B1</italic> in more tetraploid wheat accessions by aligning genome sequencing reads from <italic>Triticum dicoccoides</italic> (wild emmer) (n=10) and <italic>Triticum turgidum</italic> ssp. <italic>durum</italic> (pasta wheat) (n=12) against the A and B genomes of Chinese Spring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). The exon 1 deletion and the retrotransposon insertion at the 3’ end were detected in all accessions (except for a few lines that had poor sequencing depth in the region), suggesting that <italic>TaMRC</italic> on 6B was disrupted before or immediately after the hybridization of diploid ancestors carrying the A and B genomes. To distinguish these possibilities, we examined <italic>MRC</italic> in <italic>Aegilops speltoides,</italic> the diploid species thought to be most closely related to the progenitor species of the wheat B genome. We ran a BLASTn search on the genome assembly of the <italic>Aegilops speltoides</italic> accession TS01 using the coding sequence of <italic>TaMRC-A1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Li et al., 2022</xref>) (Supplemental File 1). The top hit was on chromosome 6S (homologous to chromosome 6B in wheat) with intact exons one and two (97.5% sequence identity), and the translated protein sequence had 96% identity to <italic>Ta</italic>MRC-A1 with BLASTp. Thus, it is likely that <italic>MRC</italic> is intact in <italic>Aegilops speltoides,</italic> suggesting that the loss of the B-homeolog occurred shortly after the hybridisation that gave rise to tetraploid wheat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). It is therefore expected that all tetraploid wheats have one <italic>MRC</italic> homeolog (on chromosome 6A), and all hexaploids have two (on chromosomes 6A and 6D).</p><sec id="S4"><title>MRC is expressed in leaves and developing endosperm</title><p id="P10">Using the hexaploid wheat expression browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Borrill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Ramirez-Gonzalez et al., 2018</xref>), we found that transcripts of the 6A and 6D homeologs were present in both leaves and grains, suggesting that MRC plays a role in both these tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). To obtain temporal information on MRC expression in the endosperm during grain development, we performed RNAseq analysis on dissected endosperms of durum wheat (<italic>Triticum turgidum</italic> cv. Kronos) throughout grain development. The full dataset is available in our accompanying paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). The Kronos variety was chosen as it is the genetic background of the tetraploid wheat TILLING mutants characterised below. <italic>TtMRC-A1</italic> (TRITD6Av1G081580.1) showed a peak of expression during early grain development (8 dpa), but strongly decreased in expression between 10 – 20 dpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). It therefore appears that <italic>MRC</italic> is expressed in the wheat endosperm almost exclusively during early grain development.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Loss of MRC does not affect the growth of wheat plants, or grain development</title><p id="P11">To study the function of MRC in wheat, we obtained mutants in durum wheat (<italic>Triticum turgidum</italic> cv.

We used the wheat <italic>in silico</italic> TILLING mutant resource, which has an EMS-mutagenised population of Kronos with exome-capture sequencing data for identification of lines with mutations of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Krasileva et al., 2017</xref>). We obtained three mutants that were likely to cause a loss of function in <italic>TtMRC-6A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The K3272 and K4681 lines contained premature stop codons in place of codons for the 258<sup>th</sup> and 550<sup>th</sup> amino acids respectively. In addition, we obtained a third line that contained a missense Leu289Phe mutation, which was predicted to be deleterious to protein function by SIFT scoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ng and Henikoff, 2006</xref>). The Leu<sup>289</sup> residue is highly conserved in all MRC orthologs, and its mutation to a Phe residue is predicted to disrupt coiled coil formation in the region of the residue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>). Since the 6B homeolog of MRC has likely become a pseudogene, we predicted that <italic>TtMRC-A1</italic> would be the only functional <italic>MRC</italic> homeolog in tetraploid wheat. However, to rule out the possibility that the fragment of exon 2 on chromosome 6B affects MRC function, we also obtained the K4305 and K3078 lines which contain two different premature stop codon mutations in the putative reading frame of the exon. We generated the <italic>mrc-1</italic> lines by crossing K3272 and K3078, and the <italic>mrc-2</italic> lines by crossing K4681 and K4305, where we isolated lines homozygous for either the 6A (F<sub>2</sub> <italic>aa</italic>BB) or 6B (F<sub>2</sub> AA<italic>bb</italic>) mutation, or both (F<sub>2</sub> <italic>aabb</italic>) The <italic>mrc-1</italic> double mutant line was backcrossed twice to wild type (WT), and the wild-type segregant (BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> AABB) and the homozygous double mutant (BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> <italic>aabb</italic>) were selected. These will be hereafter referred to as BC2 AABB and BC2 <italic>aabb.</italic> No backcrossing was done for the <italic>mrc-2</italic> line. The <italic>mrc-3</italic> line contained the K598 missense mutation, and no crossing was done.</p><p id="P12">There was no consistent effect of the independent <italic>mrc</italic> mutations on plant growth or grain development under our growth conditions.

The morphology of the mature grains of the mutants was indistinguishable from the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), and there were no differences in thousand grain weight (TGW) and grain size between the WT and any of the three mutants <italic>mrc-1, mrc-2, mrc-3,</italic> or between the WT and the backcrossed <italic>mrc-1 (mrc-1</italic> BC2 <italic>aabb</italic>); but the wild-type segregant (<italic>mrc-1</italic> BC2 AABB) had a slightly higher TGW and grain size compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Table 2C,D</xref>).

Starch content was largely similar between WT and the <italic>mrc</italic> mutants. Although some pairwise comparisons showed p&lt;0.05 (WT with <italic>mrc-2</italic> and <italic>mrc-3</italic>), the confidence intervals of the difference in means was still close to zero, suggesting that any effect of the mutations was small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Coulter counter measurements revealed that there were some minor differences between genotypes in the total number of granules relative to grain weight (granules/mg grain) (Figure 4B) but overall there was not a strong effect of loss of MRC. The backcrossed <italic>mrc-1</italic> mutant had more starch granules per unit grain weight than both the WT and the wild-type segregant, but the non-backcrossed <italic>mrc-1</italic> mutant was not significantly different to the WT. The <italic>mrc-2</italic> mutant also had relatively more granules than the WT, but <italic>mrc-3</italic> did not.</p><p id="P14">Granule size distributions were determined from the Coulter counter data by plotting the percentage of starch volume in each size bin relative to the total volume of starch measured. We observed clear bimodal distributions for all genotypes, with a peak corresponding to A-type granules (~ 18 – 25 μm) and a peak corresponding to B-type granules (~3 – 10 μm). However, the distribution profiles in the mutants were very different from the WT, with the peak corresponding to B-type granules being more prominent in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The profiles of the backcrossed <italic>mrc-1</italic> lines looked similar to their non-backcrossed equivalents. We fitted a bimodal log-normal distribution curve to the profiles of each sample to estimate the total volume percentage of B-type granules and the mean sizes of A- and B-type granules. Comparing the means of these extracted values between genotypes showed a higher B-type granule percentage (by volume) for all three mutants (<italic>mrc-1, mrc-2</italic> and <italic>mrc-3</italic>) compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). The strongest increase was seen for <italic>mrc-1,</italic> and this increase was consistent when comparing the double backcrossed <italic>mrc-1 (mrc-1</italic> BC2 <italic>aabb</italic>) with WT and the wild-type segregant (<italic>mrc-1</italic> BC2 AABB). There was a small increase in the volume percentage of B-type granules in the wild-type segregant compared to the WT, but the difference was much smaller than between the other genotypes. The higher B-type granule volume percentage in <italic>mrc</italic> mutants could be due to an increase in both B-type granule size and number. The mean B-type granule size was larger than WT for <italic>mrc-1</italic> (and <italic>mrc-1</italic> BC2 <italic>aabb</italic>) and <italic>mrc-2,</italic> but not <italic>mrc-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). By contrast, the mean A-type granule diameter was smaller for all three mutants than for WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, the increased proportion of B-type granule volume may be due to a combination of smaller A-type granules and larger and/or more numerous B-type granules.</p><p id="P15">We also explored whether the <italic>mrc</italic> mutations affected starch granule shape. Examination of iodine-stained thin sections of mature grains using light microscopy showed that, like the WT, all mutants had flattened A-type and round B-type granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Similarly, no defects in A- or B-type granule shape were observed in the mutants using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Starch polymer structure and granule composition was not affected by loss of functional MRC.

We measured the total starch content and number of starch granules in dissected endosperms of developing grains harvested 8, 14, 20 and 30 days post anthesis (dpa). The total starch content of the endosperm increased between each time point, and there was no significant difference between the mutant and the WT at any time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). At the 8 dpa timepoint, the mutant and the WT contained similar numbers of starch granules. Interestingly, for the two subsequent time points (14 dpa and 20 dpa), the mutant endosperms contained almost twice as many starch granules as the WT, despite similar starch contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). The largest increase in granule number during grain filling was observed between the 20 and 30 dpa timepoints in the WT, and between the 14 and 20 dpa timepoints in the mutant. At the 30 dpa timepoint, the difference in granule number between the mutant and WT decreased. We also noted that in both the WT and mutant, the number of starch granules decreased between the 8 and 14 dpa timepoints. The reason for this is unknown, but it has also been observed in <italic>Aegilops</italic> species – which are close relatives of wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Howard et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P19">In WT endosperm, there was a unimodal distribution of starch granule sizes at the 8 and 14 dpa timepoints, and only A-type granules with their characteristic flattened morphology were observed using SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). The A-type granules grew substantially in size between the two timepoints, seen as a shift in the granule size distribution peak. B-type granules only became prominent at the 20 dpa timepoint. In the <italic>mrc-1</italic> mutant A-type granules were initially the same size as those of WT (at 8 dpa), but subsequently grew more slowly than wild-type granules. By contrast, B-type granules were already present at 14 dpa in the <italic>mrc-1</italic> mutant, (seen as a distinct shoulder that appeared in the granule size distribution), considerably earlier than in the WT. Taken together, these data suggest that the larger number of granules observed between 14-20 dpa in the <italic>mrc-1</italic> endosperm compared to the WT (observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>) is due to the early initiation of B-type granules in the mutant.</p><p id="P20">B-type granules typically initiate in close proximity to each other– appearing as ‘clusters’ in between the A-type granules – and at least some B-type granules form in amyloplast stromules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Parker, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Langeveld et al., 2000</xref>). Given the unusual timing of B-type granule initiation in <italic>mrc-1,</italic> we explored whether the loss of MRC also affected the location of B-type granule initiation. First, we harvested grains during their development (10, 15, and 20 dpa), subjected them to critical point drying, and imaged the cut face of sections through the endosperm using SEM. Consistent with the findings from the purified starch granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>), B-type granules were already present at 10 dpa in the mutant, whereas they only became prominent after 20 dpa in the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A</xref>). The B-type granules occurred in clusters in the mutant that resembled those of the WT. Secondly, we examined sections off developing grains using light and electron microscopy. For light microscopy, sections were stained with toluidine blue (a negative stain for starch). At 15 dpa, most starch granules in the wild-type endosperm were flattened A-type granules, and very few B-type granules were visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9B</xref>). However, in the endosperm of the <italic>mrc-1</italic> mutant, many clusters of B-type granules were present. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we investigated whether these clusters of B-type granules occurred within single amyloplasts, and in particular in stromules. Indeed, multiple B-type granules were enclosed within amyloplasts, and the elongated morphology of these amyloplast regions strongly suggested that they are stromules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C</xref>). It is difficult to determine the exact percentage of B-type granules in stromules, because stromules are difficult to observe in two-dimensional sections. However, apart from their earlier occurrence in the mutant, we did not observe anything unusual about the location of B-type granules in the <italic>mrc-1</italic> mutant.</p><p id="P21">In conclusion, MRC is required for the temporal control of B-type granule initiation during wheat grain development. It is expressed during early grain development, and its loss leads to the early initiation of B-type granules.

MRC is expressed in the endosperm between 6–10 dpa but decreases rapidly in expression between 10–15 dpa, remaining low after 15 dpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This decline in expression coincides with when B-type granules start to form in the WT (between 14 –20 dpa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref> - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).

There was an increased number of starch granules in the <italic>mrc-1</italic> mutant compared to WT from 14 to 30 dpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), and this increase remained apparent in the mature grains of the backcrossed <italic>mrc-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P30">We propose that the early initiation of B-type granules results in drastically altered starch granule size distributions in the endosperm.

At 8 dpa, before the appearance of B-type granules, the size distribution curves of A-type granules were almost identical between mutant and WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>), and it was only at the later stages of grain development following B-type granule initiation that the A-type granules became smaller in the mutant compared to WT. The lack of difference in A-type granule number and size at 8 dpa suggests that the <italic>mrc-1</italic> mutation did not affect A-type granule initiation.</p><p id="P31">Our data show that the early B-type granule initiation alone could result in the increased proportion of B-type granule volume in mature grains, but it is difficult to make conclusions about the effect of MRC on B-type granule number specifically. The higher B-type granule volume could be caused by a combination of smaller A-type granules and larger and perhaps relatively more numerous B-type granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12</xref>). We measured a decrease in A-type granule size and an increase in B-type granule size in our <italic>mrc-1</italic> and <italic>mrc-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), and in some lines there was also a slight increase in total granule number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, it should be noted that there is currently no method for specifically quantifying the number of B-type granules, considering our definition of B-type granules comes from curve fitting volume/size distribution graphs from the Coulter counter, and small differences in B-type granule number may be difficult to detect as the B-type granules already make up a much larger proportion of the total granule number in WT.

We discovered that MRC has contrasting functions in the endosperm compared to the leaves. Rather than repressing granule initiation, MRC promotes granule initiation in the leaves, as in Arabidopsis leaves, although the mutant phenotype in wheat appears to be less severe than in Arabidopsis. In Arabidopsis <italic>mrc</italic> mutants, there is one large granule per chloroplast rather than the multiple smaller granules in wild-type chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Seung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Vandromme et al., 2019</xref>). Wheat <italic>mrc</italic> chloroplasts have fewer granules per chloroplast, but there are still multiple granules in each chloroplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). This difference in phenotype severity is similar to those observed for the orthologs of other granule initiation proteins of Arabidopsis (BGC1 and SS4) in wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hawkins et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Watson-Lazowski et al., 2022</xref>).

In one set of experiments, we detected larger granules in <italic>mrc-1</italic> compared to WT, although in another set we did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). This appears to be linked to whether a change in total leaf starch content was observed or not, since in both experiments, there was a reduced number of starch granules in the mutants. In the experiment where there was no difference in total starch at the end of the day, the individual (fewer) granules were larger in the mutant, as would be expected. However, in the experiment where the total starch content was lower in the <italic>mrc-1</italic> mutant compared to WT, the increase in granule size was not observed.</p><p id="P36">In Arabidopsis, lack of MRC does not reduce the total end of day leaf starch content; in fact, this is slightly higher in the mutant compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Seung et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, in wheat leaves the effect of <italic>mrc</italic> mutations on the total end of day starch content was variable in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11</xref>). This could reflect differences in the regulation of starch turnover in wheat vs. Arabidopsis leaves, since soluble sugars make up the majority of the wheat leaf carbohydrate content and are thought to be more important as a storage reserve than starch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Nie et al., 1995</xref>; Müller et al., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Watson-Lazowski et al., 2022</xref>). These differences may also contribute to the less severe effect on granule number in wheat <italic>mrc</italic> mutants compared to Arabidopsis leaves. The effect of MRC on leaf starch granule initiation is likely to differ depending on the developmental stage, so future studies should focus on the biochemistry of starch granule initiation across leaf and plant development to reveal a complete picture of the role of MRC and other granule initiation proteins in the wheat chloroplast. In Arabidopsis, reduced <italic>At</italic>SS4 abundance has a much stronger effect on granule formation in younger leaves compared to mature leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Crumpton-Taylor et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Exploring the biochemical basis of the contrasting roles of MRC between organs</title><p id="P37">Since MRC is a long coiled-coil protein with no known enzymatic domains, it is possible that it can exert opposite effects on granule initiation by interacting with different interaction partners.

Therefore, it is possible that in wheat, protein-protein interactions also play an important role in the function of MRC, although the nature of the interactions may be quite different. Recent work has begun to uncover the distinct roles of Arabidopsis starch granule initiation orthologs in wheat, and as for MRC, they are all quite different from their role in Arabidopsis. In the endosperm, SS4 restricts granule initiation during early grain development to ensure proper A-type granule formation and mutants defective in SS4 form compound granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hawkins et al., 2021</xref>). Similar, but less severe, is the <italic>bgc1</italic> mutant in wheat which also forms irregular compound-like granules but has a higher proportion of normal-looking A-type granules than <italic>ss4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hawkins et al., 2021</xref>). BGC1 not only represses granule initiation during A-type granule formation, but also promotes B-type granule formation, as mutants with reduced gene dosage of BGC1 have fewer B-type granules than WT, with no apparent impact on A-type granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chia et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P38">However, a B-type granule suppressing mechanism during early grain development, like we report here for MRC, has not previously been described, and suggests that MRC and BGC1 might have opposing roles in the wheat endosperm, despite their similar initiation promoting roles seen in leaves of Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Seung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Seung et al., 2018</xref>) and wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Watson-Lazowski et al., 2022</xref>). In support of this, our recent RNA-sequencing analysis of the developing wheat endosperm shows opposite expression patterns for MRC and BGC1 throughout grain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Wheat SS4 also promotes leaf granule initiation, as mutants had mostly starchless chloroplasts in the leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hawkins et al., 2021</xref>). Together with our finding for MRC, this suggests that there may be more distinct differences for granule initiation proteins between different organs of the same species in comparison to the same organs from different species. The Arabidopsis granule initiation proteins localise to distinct puncta in the chloroplast, but we do not yet know anything about the localisation of these wheat orthologs in the chloroplast or amyloplast. In the future, exploring the protein localisation, protein-protein interactions, and the connection between the two in both tissues could reveal what underpins these distinct functions of MRC.</p><p id="P39">The specific effect of the L289F mutation in the <italic>mrc-3</italic> mutant on endosperm starch may provide an important clue in these studies, since <italic>mrc-3</italic> had increased B-type granule percentage in the endosperm, but no differences in granule number in leaves.

It is also ideal that the B-genome homeolog has become a pseudogene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), meaning that only one or two homeologs need to be mutated in durum and bread wheat respectively to achieve an effect on granule size.

Along this line, we are currently investigating whether overexpression of MRC can be used to reduce the volume of B-type granules.</p><p id="P42">Since the repression of B-type granule initiation is likely to be a role specific to Triticeae species carrying a bimodal size distribution of endosperm starch, it remains to be determined what the role of MRC is in cereal species that do not have a bimodal distribution of starch granules, such as those that have compound granules (e.g. in rice). Also, oats have a bimodal distribution of starch granules, with large compound granules and smaller simple granules. However, in oat, the smaller granules initiate at the same time as the larger compound granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Saccomanno et al., 2017</xref>), and it would therefore be interesting to determine if differences in MRC function play a role in timing the initiation of the small granules during oat endosperm development. Exploring the role of MRC in multiple crop species would therefore not only reveal the molecular differences that result in distinct spatiotemporal patterns of granule initiation between species, but also potentially increase its biotechnological potential.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S15"><title>TaMRC bioinformatic analysis</title><p id="P43">To characterize <italic>TtMRC-B1</italic> in tetraploid wheat, we aligned the whole genome-sequencing reads of <italic>Triticum dicoccoides</italic> (n = 10) and <italic>Triticum turgidum ssp. durum</italic> (n = 10) from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Zhou et al., 2020</xref> against the ‘tetraploid’ version of the Ref-Seqv1.0 Chinese Spring assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Appels et al., 2018</xref>).

Cells were chosen across the section, where most of the granules were stained well and clearly visible, and cells directly next to vasculature were avoided. It should be noted that these are counts of granule sections, rather than the actual numbers of granules per chloroplast, as the actual number cannot be determined from two-dimensional sections. As much as possible, all chloroplasts in a cell were counted to avoid bias, although occasionally a few chloroplasts where the granules were unclear had to be omitted. Both lighter and darker stained granules were counted, but occasionally light-staining patches that were difficult to discern as granules were observed in all samples, and these were not included in the count.</p><p id="P57">For quantification of the granule size, we analysed the same samples as for the granules per chloroplast, using the ‘analyse particles’ function in ImageJ, and manually adjusted the thresholding in an image until the dark granules in the images were correctly separated.

We used the mixed_model() function with ‘family=negative.binomial’ from the ‘GLMMadaptive’ package, and the emmeans() function from the ‘emmeans’ package for pairwise comparisons in R.

In wild type, A-type granules initiate around 4 days post anthesis (dpa), and B-type granules initiate around 15 – 20 dpa. We propose that the expression of MRC during early endosperm development prevents the B-type granule formation, and B-type granule volume increases as MRC expression decreases after 10 dpa. This process is disrupted in mutants lacking a functional MRC protein, and granules initiate already from 10 dpa. The early initiation of B-type granules provides them with more time and substrate to grow, leading to higher volume of B-type granules in the mutant at grain maturity compared to the wild type, and a concomitant decrease in A-type granule size in the mutant.DD</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS155687-f012"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Statistics of pairwise comparisons of leaf granule per chloroplast in young wheat leaves, from negative binomial mixed effect models with biological replicate (3 of each genotype) as random effect, using Tukey post-hoc tests.
