Here we describe the generation and characterization of IVX-411, a computationally designed, two-component virus-like particle (VLP) displaying the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) on its surface. Immunization of mice with IVX-411 generates neutralizing antibodies against the ancestral strain as well as three variants of concern. Neutralizing antibody titers elicited by IVX-411 are durable and significantly higher than those elicited by immunization with soluble RBD and spike antigens. Furthermore, immunization with IVX-411 is shown to be protective in a Syrian Golden hamster challenge model using two different strains of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, these studies demonstrate that IVX-411 is highly immunogenic and capable of eliciting broad, protective immunity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2 vaccine</kwd><kwd>virus-like particles</kwd><kwd>protein nanoparticle</kwd><kwd>receptor binding domain</kwd><kwd>neutralizing antibody response</kwd><kwd>long-lived plasma cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Background</title><p id="P2">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to over 637 million confirmed cases and 6.6 million deaths worldwide as of November 29, 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Our understanding of this disease as well as the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, has grown dramatically since December, 2019 when it emerged in Wuhan, China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat. The virus can also lead to a potentially debilitating condition called ‘long-haul COVID’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Additionally, the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs) has illustrated the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to evolve, leading to increased transmissibility and immune evasion. Given continued viral evolution and transmission, further advances in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination approaches are necessary to stem the public health impact.</p><p id="P3">The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein has been the primary target for vaccine development due to the ability of anti-S protein antibodies to neutralize the virus and protect against severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. S protein trimers decorate the surface of the virion and are comprised of two subunits: S1 and S2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. S1 sits at the apex of the S protein and contains the receptor binding domain (RBD). The RBD binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein expressed in human airway epithelia as well as lung parenchyma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. After S1 binds ACE2, the S2 subunit facilitates viral fusion with the host cell. During this process, the S protein trimer undergoes a structural transition between its prefusion conformation and its post-fusion conformation, bringing together the fusion peptide and the host cell membrane, mediating virion entry. Antibodies which block S1 binding to ACE2 are often potently neutralizing. Consequently, it is unsurprising that the RBD is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies in human serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Rapid development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 was facilitated by two vaccine platform technologies: messenger RNA (mRNA) and viral vectors. While the deployment of these vaccines was instrumental in slowing viral transmission and saving lives, the associated reactogenicity and durability of these vaccines leave room for improvement. Furthermore, the two viral vector vaccines, Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) and ChAdOX1-S (AstraZeneca), have been linked to a rare blood clotting disorder, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Concern over this potentially life-threatening side effect has led to limited use of these vaccines in developed countries. Waning antibody responses to vaccination, particularly with the mRNA-based vaccines, have also been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. While two doses of the mRNA-based vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer) and mRNA1273 (Moderna), were roughly 90% efficacious in preventing COVID-19 up to two months post immunization, waning antibody responses have resulted in recommendations to receive multiple additional doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Critically, these first generation vaccines are also less efficacious against the omicron variant, which has led to an increase in breakthrough infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Considering these limitations, a new generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that generate broad, durable immunity with reduced reactogenicity are needed.</p><p id="P5">Virus-like particles (VLPs) are a compelling technology for developing new SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Whereas soluble recombinant viral proteins tend to be poorly immunogenic, particularly in the absence of an adjuvant, VLPs can induce both humoral and cellular immune responses even without adjuvants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. One advantage of VLPs is the multivalent presentation of antigen, which promotes B cell receptor clustering and activation, facilitating the production of high affinity antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Importantly, VLP-based vaccines displaying native viral antigens are already commercially available for the prevention of hepatitis B (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. These vaccines have excellent safety and durability profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Vaccination with HBV vaccines generates high antibody titers that are protective for up to 30 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Similarly, a single dose of the bivalent HPV vaccine elicits antibody titers that are maintained for at least seven years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Recent advances in computational protein design have allowed for the generation of novel, self-assembling VLPs that can display diverse antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Here we produced and further characterized a two-component, computationally designed VLP displaying 60 copies of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], referred to here as IVX-411. We show that immunization of naïve animals with IVX-411 elicits high neutralizing antibody titers against the ancestral strain as well as three VOCs. To evaluate the durability of this immune response, as well as the benefit of the VLP platform over soluble protein, we immunized mice with IVX-411 or soluble S protein. We found that immunization with IVX-411 generated higher neutralizing titers and increased antigen-specific long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) compared to immunization with soluble protein. Finally, Syrian Golden hamsters immunized with IVX-411 and challenged with SARS-CoV-2 had lower viral loads and reduced disease severity than unimmunized hamsters.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Component production and characterization</title><p id="P7">RBD-CompA gene based on previously described amino acid sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] was synthesized and cloned by Genscript in the pcDNA3.4+ vector.

Together, these results demonstrate that immunization with IVX-411 results in a broad, potent antibody response.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Immunization with IVX-411 induces a more potent humoral immune response than immunization with soluble protein</title><p id="P31">Having confirmed the immunogenicity of IVX-411, we next sought to evaluate its ability to elicit durable, humoral immunity compared to trimeric spike-based and RBD-based soluble antigens. Naïve BALB/c mice were immunized on Day 0 and boosted on Day 21 with either 0.2 mg of IVX-411, an equivalent antigen dose of RBD-CompA (0.15 μg), or an equivalent RBD antigen dose of S-2P (0.4 μg), a stabilized prefusion version of the S protein ectodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Each antigen was formulated with either MF59 or an aqueous buffer. Serum samples were collected on days 0, 20, 35, 63, 91, 119, and 154. On Day 154 the animals were sacrificed, at which point LLPCs were isolated from the bone marrow and assessed by ELISpot.</p><p id="P32">Serum analysis by a cell-based PNA revealed that immunization with IVX-411 generated higher neutralizing antibody titers than immunization with soluble proteins. On Day 20, after a single immunization, only animals immunized with IVX-411 had neutralizing antibody titers above the lower limit of quantitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Even at this early timepoint, MF59 enhanced the neutralizing antibody response in naïve animals with the IVX-411 MF59 group having 4.4-fold higher Day 20 neutralizing antibody titers compared to animals immunized with IVX-411 alone. This trend was consistent throughout the duration of the study. Compared to the aqueous formulations, immunization with antigen plus MF59 resulted in 16, 3.1, and 116-fold increases in Day 35 neutralizing antibody titers for IVX-411, RBD-CompA, and S-2P, respectively. Importantly, the Day 35 neutralizing antibody titers in the IVX-411 MF59 group were 198-fold higher than those in the RBD-CompA MF59 group and 5.3-fold higher than those in the S-2P MF59 group. These results suggest that immunization with IVX-411 results in higher neutralizing antibody titers than immunization with soluble protein, particularly compared with soluble trimerized RBD, which is poorly immunogenic on its own. There were no statistically significant differences in the neutralizing antibody titers within the different treatment groups from Day 35 to Day 154, except for the RBD-CompA MF59 group. Unlike the other groups, neutralizing antibody titers following a second administration of RBD-CompA MF59 did not reach their peak until Day 154. The 7.9-fold increase in titers on Day 154 compared to Day 35 rose to the level of statistical significance. While the overall consistency of neutralizing antibody titers post-boost reveals the durability of the humoral immune response elicited by immunization in general, these results show that immunization with IVX-411 leads to higher neutralizing titers.</p><p id="P33">To further evaluate the ability of IVX-411 to generate a long-term humoral immune response, an ELISpot assay was performed on isolated LLPCs. Similar to the neutralizing antibody titer results, these results demonstrated adjuvantation was key to generating a sizable RBD-specific LLPC compartment in naïve animals. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of RBD-specific LLPCs between the aqueous conditions. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Compared to the aqueous formulations, immunization with antigen plus MF59 resulted in 4.3, 1.8, and 4.4-fold increases in LLPC counts for IVX-411, RBD-CompA, and S-2P, respectively. Immunization with IVX-411 MF59 resulted in a statistically significant, 3.9-fold increase in the number of LLPCs compared to immunization with RBD-CompA MF59. The 1.2-fold increase in LLPC counts observed in the IVX-411 MF59 immunized group compared to the S-2P MF59 immunized group was modest and did not reach the level of statistical significance. These results demonstrate that immunization with IVX-411 in the presence of an oil-in-water emulsion induces durable neutralizing antibody titers, which along with LLPC counts, are superior to those induced by immunization with soluble antigens.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Immunization with IVX-411 reduces disease severity and viral load in Syrian Golden hamster model</title><p id="P34">To evaluate whether IVX-411 could protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection, a viral challenge study using WA1/2020 (ancestral) and B.1.671.2 (delta) strains was performed in Syrian Golden hamsters. Hamsters were randomly assigned to five treatment groups: PBS, Unchallenged; PBS, WA1/2020; PBS, B.1.617.2; IVX-411, WA1/2020; and IVX-411, B.1.671.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). On Day 0 and Day 21 hamsters in the IVX-411, WA1/2020, and IVX-411, B.1.617.2 groups were immunized with IVX-411 formulated with MF59. Hamsters in the other three treatment groups (PBS, Unchallenged; PBS, WA1/2020; and PBS, B.1.617.2), were injected with PBS. Hamsters were weighed and bled on days 0, 21, and 35. On Day 42 all hamsters, except those in the PBS, Unchallenged group, were inoculated intranasally with either 4.64 x 10<sup>5</sup> TCID50/animal of WA1/2020 or 1.53 x 10<sup>6</sup> TCID50/animal of B.1.617.2. Body weights were recorded daily from Day 39 to Day 47, at which point animals were sacrificed and lung tissue as well as nasal swabs were collected. Hamsters challenged with either WA1/2020 or B.1.617.2 began to lose weight four to five days post challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). By six days post challenge, hamsters immunized with IVX-411 had significantly higher body weights compared to their unimmunized counterparts. Interestingly, this reduction in weight loss was more pronounced in animals challenged with B.1.617.2 compared to WA1/2020, despite the higher B.1.617.2 challenge dose. This continued to be the case until the termination of the study on Day 47.</p><p id="P35">As SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia develops, lung weight increases relative to body weight due to cellular infiltrates, edema, and a decrease in overall body weight. Consequently, we investigated the ability of immunization with IVX-411 to prevent an increase in lung weight. As expected, hamsters in the PBS, WA1/2020 and PBS, B.1.617.2 groups had increased lung weight compared to hamsters in the PBS, Unchallenged group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, this was only statistically significant in animals challenged with B.1.617.2. Similarly, unimmunized animals challenged with either WA1/2020 or B.1.617.2 had a 1.2 or 1.6-fold increase in lung weight as a percent of body weight respectively compared to their IVX-411 immunized counterparts. Immunization with IVX-411 led to a statistically significant reduction in lung weight in the context of challenge with B.1.617.2 and a trend towards lower lung weights in hamsters challenged with WA1/2020.</p><p id="P36">In addition to lung and body weight, the impact of IVX-411 immunization on histopathologic changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were also assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). The two challenge strains led to slightly different tissue changes in unimmunized animals. B1.617.2 infection led to more hemorrhage and less centriacinar and bronchiolar epithelial hypertrophy/hyperplasia compared to WA1/2020. The impact of IVX-411 immunization on lung pathology was the most notable in animals challenged with B1.617.2. Animals immunized with IVX-411 and then challenged with B1.617.2 had milder inflammation, reduced pulmonary hemorrhage, and decreased severity of bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia/hypertrophy compared to unimmunized animals. In the case of challenge with WA1/2020, immunization resulted in more subtle decreases in the severity of inflammation, pulmonary hemorrhage, and centriacinar hyperplasia/hypertrophy. The severity of bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia/hypertrophy was markedly improved when animals challenged with WA1/2020 had been previously immunized with IVX-411.</p><p id="P37">To further assess the level of protection conferred by immunization with IVX-411, lung tissue and nasal swabs were assessed for genomic RNA (N gene) and subgenomic RNA (E gene) by RT-qPCR. Genomic RNA measures both viable and nonviable viral genomes whereas subgenomic RNA is a measure of replicating virus levels. IVX-411 immunization significantly reduced the number of N gene copies per gram of lung tissue 31 and 66-fold and the number of N gene copies per nasal swab 4.4 and 3-fold in hamsters challenged with WA1/2020 and B.1.617.2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Consistent with the N gene results, IVX-411 immunization reduced the number of E gene copies per gram of lung tissue 60 and 132-fold and the number of E gene copies per nasal swab 5 and 3-fold in hamsters challenged with WA1/2020 and B.1.617.2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, the decreases in N and E gene copies in nasal swab samples collected from immunized animals did not reach the level of statistical significance.</p><p id="P38">Finally, to determine whether neutralizing antibodies elicited by IVX-411 vaccination were contributing to the observed protection, we evaluated the neutralizing antibody response elicited in the animals immunized with IVX-411 prior to challenge using a cell-based PNA. On Day 35, neutralizing antibody titers against both the ancestral and delta variant were present in six out of eight IVX-411, WA1/2020 hamsters and all eight IVX-411, B.1.617.2 hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Neutralizing titers against the ancestral strain increased approximately 14.5-fold in IVX-411 immunized animals compared to baseline. A roughly 3.8-fold increase in neutralizing titers against the delta variant was also observed. Overall, these results demonstrate that prophylactic immunization with IVX-411 is protective against severe manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian Golden hamsters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P39">As SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic, there is great interest in identifying vaccines with improved durability, less reactogenicity, and the potential for combination with other vaccines, such as seasonal influenza. VLPs have been shown to be highly immunogenic and possess many of the characteristics that may be of value for a next-generation SARS CoV-2 vaccine. Here, we show that IVX-411, a computationally designed VLP presenting the RBD of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain, is immunogenic in two rodent models. In mice, immunization with IVX-411 elicits neutralizing titers against the ancestral strain as well as three VOCs. These neutralizing antibody titers are durable and higher than those generated in response to immunization with a soluble spike protein. Critically, immunization with IVX-411 is protective in a Syrian Golden hamster challenge model. Together, these results further illustrate the potential of VLPs to be utilized as a modality for future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.</p><p id="P40">These data for IVX-411 are consistent with a large number of preclinical studies on I53-50 immunogens displaying RBD antigens from SARS-CoV-2 and/or other sarbecoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], and further demonstrate the precision and immunogenic potency of this platform. In naïve animals, higher neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 were observed after immunization with I53-50 VLPs displaying 60 copies of the RBD compared to soluble S protein trimers and trimerized RBD antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Interestingly, we observed IVX-411 generated higher neutralizing antibody titers in naïve mice than in Syrian Golden hamsters. However, differences in neutralizing antibody titers between different animal models are consistent with what others have reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Further, we observed improved potency in naïve animals by formulating IVX-411 with MF59, an oil-in-water emulsion. Such results have been externally replicated for I53-50-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in naïve human patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Our results are immunogenically similar to those observed from other RBD-based, single-component. SARS-CoV-2 VLP vaccines, which use nanoparticles such as ferritin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], hepatitis B surface antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], or mi3 (a variant of the I3-01 VLP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>], as well as biochemical conjugation methods such as SpyCatcher and sortase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. In comparison to these single-component VLP platforms, the two-component nature of I53-50 allows for simplified and modular manufacturing of highly defined immunogen structures through <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly. The precise structure of the final VLP product is enabled both by direct genetic fusion between antigens and CompA, eliminating the need for conjugation, as well as dependable complete and cooperative assembly of the nanoparticle structure due to highly-specific designed interactions between CompA and CompB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Finally, the manufacturing and clinical validation of I53-50-based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>] and RSV (Icosavax, Inc. unpublished data) confirms that this platform is scalable, manufacturable, and potently immunogenic while maintaining low reactogenicity, with ample potential to extend to other viral and bacterial indications.</p><p id="P41">The emergence of the omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant in November, 2021 led to a surge of infections in December, 2021 through March, 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Given the ability of the omicron variant to escape preexisting immunity elicited by both natural infection and immunization, updated booster vaccines targeting the omicron variant as well as the ancestral strain are now recommended for those 12 and older. The I53-50 VLP platform utilized in IVX-411 has the potential to combine multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens to direct immune responses against several VOCs, including omicron. This platform also has the potency and low reactogenicity needed to generate combination vaccines which could include additional VLP-based vaccines against other viruses. Prior experience with omicron suggests that future updates to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may be necessary as well as routine booster immunizations. The modular ability for antigen presentation on I53-50 VLPs in response to emerging VOCs, combined with the potential use of high-yield, stabilized RBD designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>], can enable this platform to meet many needs for future COVID-19 vaccination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS157968-supplement-Supplemental_Figure_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d36aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported in part by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation [INV-022092].
