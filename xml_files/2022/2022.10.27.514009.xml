The identity of many effectors remains unknown. Here, we identify RIX, a new domain that defines a class of polymorphic T6SS cargo effectors. RIX, which is widespread in the <italic>Vibrionaceae</italic> family, is located at N-termini of proteins containing diverse antibacterial and anti-eukaryotic toxin domains. We demonstrate that RIX-containing proteins are delivered via T6SS into neighboring cells, and that RIX is necessary and sufficient for secretion. We show that RIX-containing proteins can also act as tethers, enabling the T6SS-mediated delivery of other cargo effectors by a previously undescribed mechanism. RIX-containing proteins significantly enlarge the repertoire of known T6SS effectors, especially those with anti-eukaryotic activities. Our findings also suggest that T6SSs may play a major, currently underappreciated, role in interactions between vibrios and eukaryotes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a protein delivery apparatus in Gram-negative bacteria, which was originally described as an anti-eukaryotic determinant <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, further investigations revealed that most T6SSs play a role in interbacterial competition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, whereas only a few T6SSs have been identified as anti-eukaryotic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. These roles are mediated by toxic proteins, called effectors, which are deployed inside neighboring bacterial and eukaryotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Effectors are loaded onto a missile-like structure, which is ejected by a contractile sheath that engulfs it in the cytoplasm of the secreting cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The missile is composed of Hcp proteins that are stacked as hexameric rings forming an inner tube; the tube is capped by a spike complex comprising a VgrG trimer sharpened by a PAAR repeat-containing protein (hereafter referred to as PAAR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. T6SS effectors can be divided into two types: (1) specialized effectors, which are secreted structural components (i.e., Hcp, VgrG, or PAAR) containing a C-terminal toxin domain extension <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and (2) cargo effectors, which are toxic proteins that non-covalently interact with one of the missile components or its C-terminal extension <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, either directly or aided by an adaptor protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> or a co-effector <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Because cargo effectors can bind to diverse loading platforms on the tube or spike, they lack a canonical secretion signal or domain. Therefore, identifying cargo effectors is a challenging task, especially if they are not encoded within T6SS gene clusters or near T6SS-associated genes.</p><p id="P4">Many T6SS cargo effectors belong to one of three known classes of polymorphic toxins: (1) MIX (Marker for type sIX) domain-containing proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>; (2) FIX (Found in type sIX) domain-containing proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>; or (3) Rhs (Rearrangement hotspot) repeat-containing proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. These three domains are found N-terminal to diverse C-terminal toxin domains, and they are predicted to play a role in their delivery. MIX and FIX domains are specifically found in T6SS-secreted proteins, whereas Rhs repeats are also present in toxins secreted by other types of secretion systems. However, many other cargo effectors lack a known domain at their N-terminus; it is possible that these effectors contain N-terminal delivery domains that have not yet been revealed.</p><p id="P5">We previously identified Tme1, an antibacterial T6SS effector of <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic>. Tme1 contains a C-terminal toxin domain named Tme (T6SS Membrane-disrupting Effector), which permeabilizes membranes and dissipates membrane potential <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>; the sequence N-terminal to the Tme domain does not contain a known domain or activity. Here, we show that the N-terminus of Tme1 is necessary and sufficient to mediate T6SS secretion in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, and we use it to reveal a new domain that is widespread in members of the <italic>Vibrionaceae</italic> family. Proteins containing the identified domain, named RIX (aRginine-rich type sIX), are secreted via T6SS. RIX is found N-terminal to diverse C-terminal extensions with antibacterial and anti-eukaryotic toxic activities, as well as to sequences that function as loading platforms for cargo effectors. Therefore, we reveal a new class of T6SS-secreted proteins, including polymorphic toxins and effector tethers.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The N-terminus of Tme1 is necessary and sufficient for T6SS-mediated secretion</title><p id="P6">We previously reported that Tme1 is an antibacterial effector delivered by T6SS1 in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> BB22OP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>; its toxin domain, Tme, is located at the C-terminus. We hypothesized that the N-terminus of Tme1 plays a role in secretion via T6SS. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the expression and secretion of a truncated version of Tme1 lacking the first 60 amino acids (Tme1<sup>61-310</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, truncating the 60 N-terminal amino acids abrogated Tme1 secretion, indicating that this region is necessary for T6SS-mediated secretion. Next, we sought to determine whether the N-terminus of Tme1 is sufficient for T6SS-mediated secretion. To this end, we used Tse1, a <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> T6SS effector. Tse1 is unable to secrete via <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> T6SS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, right lanes). However, fusing the N-terminal 111 amino acids of Tme1 to Tse1 (Tme1<sup>1-111</sup>-Tse1) enabled its secretion via <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> T6SS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, left lanes). Shorter N-terminal Tme1 sequences were unstable when fused to Tse1, and were therefore not tested. Taken together, these results suggest that a region found at the N-terminus of Tme1 is necessary and sufficient for T6SS-mediated secretion.</p><p id="P7">To confirm that the N-terminus of Tme1 does not play a role in the effector’s antibacterial activity, we monitored the toxicity of Tme1 variants with truncations at the N-terminus and the C-terminus. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, truncating the first 60 amino acids of Tme1 did not affect the toxicity of this effector in the periplasm of <italic>E. coli</italic>, whereas truncating the last 85 amino acids of Tme1, corresponding to the end of the Tme domain, abrogated its toxicity. The expression of all Tme1 forms was detected in immunoblots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Thus, the N-terminal end of Tme1 is not required for toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>RIX is an arginine-rich domain found at N-termini of polymorphic toxins</title><p id="P8">Following these findings, we set out to identify regions homologous to the N-terminus of Tme1 in other proteins. We identified 502 unique protein accession numbers that contain a homologous sequence at their N-terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Dataset S1</xref>). A multiple sequence alignment of these homologs revealed a conserved, arginine-rich motif corresponding to amino acids 1-55 in Tme1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>); hereafter, we will refer to this region as the RIX (aRginine-rich type sIX) domain. RIX-containing proteins are encoded by 692 Gamma-proteobacterial strains, exclusively belonging to the marine bacteria families <italic>Vibrionaceae</italic> (i.e., <italic>Vibrio</italic> and <italic>Photobacterium</italic>), and <italic>Moritellaceae</italic> (i.e., <italic>Moritella</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Dataset S1</xref>). Many of the bacterial strains encoding RIX-containing proteins are pathogens of humans and animals; these include <italic>V. parahaemolyticus, V. cholerae, V. vulnificus, V. campbellii, V. coralliilyticus</italic>, and <italic>V. crassostreae</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Importantly, although none of the identified RIX-containing proteins is encoded within a T6SS gene cluster or module, almost all (97.7%) of the genomes encoding RIX-containing proteins harbor a T6SS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Dataset S2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Analysis of the amino acid sequences C-terminal to RIX based on all-against-all pairwise similarity (using the CLANS classification tool <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>) revealed 33 distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Remarkably, the majority of these C-terminal sequences contain domains that are known or predicted to be toxins with anti-eukaryotic activities (e.g., actin cross-linking, deamidase, adenylate cyclase, and glycosyltransferase) or antibacterial activities (e.g., pore-forming, HNH nuclease, and lysozyme-like) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). RIX-containing proteins with predicted antibacterial toxin domains are encoded upstream of a gene that possibly encodes a cognate immunity protein; genes encoding predicted anti-eukaryotic toxins do not neighbor a potential immunity gene. Notably, AlphaFold2 structure predictions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> of representatives from each cluster revealed a possible conserved RIX structure, comprising two alpha helices preceded and connected by short loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>RIX domain-containing proteins are secreted by T6SS</title><p id="P10">The results thus far indicated that: (1) Tme1 is a RIX-containing T6SS effector, (2) nearly all RIX-containing proteins are encoded by bacteria with a T6SS, and (3) most RIX-containing proteins have predicted C-terminal toxin domains. All together, these results led us to hypothesize that RIX-containing proteins are a new class of polymorphic T6SS effectors. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether a predicted RIX-containing protein from <italic>V. campbellii</italic> ATCC 25920, WP_005534959.1, which has a C-terminal domain of unknown function (Unknown_2; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S4A</xref>) functions as a T6SS effector. We first monitored the toxicity of this protein in bacteria. Expression of the WP_005534959.1 alone in <italic>E. coli</italic> was detrimental, whereas co-expression of the downstream-encoded protein (WP_005534960.1) antagonized this toxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S4B</xref>). We then tested the T6SS-mediated delivery of the predicted effector using a previously established T6SS surrogate system in a <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> RIMD 2210633 derivative strain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. We found that expression of the predicted effector and immunity proteins from a plasmid in the surrogate attacker strain led to the killing of a parental prey strain lacking the predicted immunity protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The killing was T6SS-dependent, since expression of the proteins in a derivative surrogate strain in which T6SS1 is inactive (∆<italic>hcp1</italic>) did not lead to killing of the prey strain. Expression of the predicted immunity protein from a plasmid in the prey strain protected it from this attack. These results indicate that the RIX domain-containing WP_005534959.1 and its downstream encoded WP_005534960.1 are an antibacterial T6SS effector and immunity pair.</p><p id="P11">To further support our hypothesis, we next determined whether RIX-containing proteins belonging to diverse clusters are secreted by T6SS. To this end, we monitored the expression and secretion of three additional RIX-containing proteins encoded by <italic>V. campbellii</italic> ATCC 25920: WP_005536620.1, WP_005530005.1, and WP_038863399.1; these proteins are predicted to have anti-eukaryotic toxin domains at their C-terminus (Deamidase_1, Deamidase_2, and Actin cross-linking, respectively; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Notably, the genomic neighborhood of their encoding genes did not include T6SS-associated genes that would suggest that these RIX-containing proteins are T6SS effectors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Dataset S1</xref>). Remarkably, the three RIX-containing proteins were secreted from a surrogate strain in a T6SS-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Furthermore, they were all toxic when expressed in the eukaryotic yeast model organism, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), suggesting that they affect a conserved eukaryotic target <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Taken together, these results support our hypothesis that RIX-containing proteins are secreted by T6SSs.</p><p id="P12">Next, we sought to demonstrate the secretion of another RIX-containing protein via its endogenous T6SS, in addition to Tme1, which was shown previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). To this end, we investigated WP_157622110.1, encoded by <italic>V. coralliillyticus</italic> BAA-450. To monitor the secretion of WP_157622110.1 via T6SS in <italic>V. coralliillyticus</italic>, we set out to identify the conditions under which T6SS1 of <italic>V. coralliilyticus</italic> BAA-450 is active. First, we monitored the secretion of the T6SS spike protein VgrG1, and the ability of this strain to intoxicate <italic>V. natriegens</italic> prey bacteria during competition under different temperatures in media containing 3% (w/v) NaCl. Our results revealed that <italic>V. coralliilyticus</italic> BAA-450 T6SS1 is an antibacterial system that is active at 30°C (i.e., under warm, marine-like conditions) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). We then monitored the secretion of the RIX-containing protein, WP_157622110.1, when expressed from a plasmid. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, WP_157622110.1 was secreted by <italic>V. coralliilyticus</italic> BAA-450 in a T6SS1-dependent manner, confirming the secretion of RIX-containing proteins via their endogenous T6SS. In addition, we confirmed that this RIX-containing protein is secreted in a T6SS-dependent manner from a surrogate strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>A RIX tether-dependent mechanism for T6SS effector delivery</title><p id="P13">Unlike most RIX domain-containing proteins, which have a predicted C-terminal toxin domain, WP_157622110.1 has a predicted C-terminal TTR (Transthyretin-like) domain (TTR_1; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This domain was previously identified at C-terminal extensions of secreted T6SS spike components, such as VgrG and PAAR, and it was suggested to function as an internal adaptor for cargo effectors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Therefore, we reasoned that WP_157622110.1 is not a toxic effector.</p><p id="P14">In <italic>V. coralliillyticus</italic> BAA-450, WP_157622110.1 is encoded by the first gene in a three-gene operon; notably, homologous modules comprising the TTR domain and the two downstream encoded proteins are also found fused to the T6SS-secreted components PAAR and VgrG in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The genetic composition of the three-gene operon and the presence of the TTR domain in WP_157622110.1 led us to hypothesize that: (1) the second and third genes in the operon encode an antibacterial T6SS cargo effector and its cognate immunity protein, and (2) the RIX domain-containing protein acts as a tether that mediates the effector’s delivery via T6SS.</p><p id="P15">Before addressing these hypotheses experimentally, we used AlphaFold2 to predict whether the RIX-containing protein interacts with its downstream encoded protein. Indeed, AlphaFold2 predicted that the C-terminus of the RIX-containing WP_157622110.1, corresponding to the TTR domain, interacts with the N-terminus of the predicted effector (WP_006958655.1; hereafter named Rte1 for <underline>R</underline>IX-tethered <underline>e</underline>ffector <underline>1</underline>) to complete a barrel-like fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This inter-domain prediction was made with a high degree of certainty, according to the AlphaFold2 predicted aligned error analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). In addition, an AlphaFold2 structure prediction indicated that Rte1 and its predicted immunity protein, WP_0507786602.1 (hereafter named Rti1 for <underline>R</underline>IX-<underline>t</underline>ethered <underline>i</underline>mmunity <underline>1</underline>), interact with a high degree of certainty (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S7A,B</xref>). Furthermore, sequence (HHpred <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>) and structure prediction (AlphaFold2 prediction followed by DALI server analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>) analyses suggest that Rte1 contains an ADPRT-like domain with a fold similar to that of the pertussis toxin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S7A</xref>), to which Rti1 is expected to bind (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S7A,B</xref>), and a C-terminal glycine-zipper-like domain. A conservation logo assembled from a multiple sequence alignment of Rte1 homologs revealed conserved residues (H94, S106, and E174) that are similar to the catalytic residues of ADPRT toxins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, which localize to a cleft within the predicted Rte1 structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S7A,C</xref>); this cleft corresponds to the ADPRT-like domain active site and is predicted to be occluded by Rti1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S7A</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Using these predictions, we set out to test our hypotheses. First, we determined whether Rte1 is toxic when expressed in bacteria. Indeed, its expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> was toxic; however, it was antagonized by co-expressing Rti1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S7D</xref>). Substitution of either H94 or S106, corresponding to conserved residues that were identified as the possible active site in the sequence and the structural analyses of Rte1, for alanine abolished the toxic activity of Rte1 in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S7E</xref>). The expression of all Rte1 forms in <italic>E. coli</italic> was confirmed in immunoblots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S7F</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Next, we tested whether Rte1 is secreted in a T6SS-dependent manner from the T6SS surrogate system, in the presence and absence of its cognate RIX domain-containing protein. To avoid self-intoxication of the surrogate strain by the effector, we used an inactive mutant of Rte1 (Rte1<sup>H94A</sup>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S7E</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, a plasmid-encoded Rte1<sup>H94A</sup> was secreted in a T6SS-dependent manner when the upstream-encoded RIX domain-containing protein, WP_157622110.1, was co-expressed; however, in the absence of the RIX-domain-containing protein, Rte1<sup>H94A</sup> was not detected in the medium. These results indicate that the RIX and TTR domains-containing protein is required for T6SS-mediated secretion of Rte1.</p><p id="P18">In addition, we investigated whether Rte1 and Rti1 function as an antibacterial T6SS effector and immunity pair in which the effector is dependent on a tether protein for delivery. To this end, we performed self-competition assays using the surrogate T6SS system. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, T6SS-dependent toxicity against a sensitive prey strain was only observed when Rte1 and Rti1 were expressed together with the upstream-encoded RIX domain-containing protein (pRIX+Rtei1), but not when they were expressed alone (pRtei1). Notably, expression of the RIX domain-containing protein alone (pRIX) did not result in prey intoxication. Expression of Rti1 from a plasmid in the prey strain protected it from the T6SS-mediated toxicity. Taken together, our results support a role for a RIX domain-containing protein as a tether that mediates the delivery of a cargo effector via T6SS.</p><p id="P19">When we examined other RIX domain-containing proteins that had no predicted toxin domain at their C-terminus, we identified two additional types of predicted RIX-associated T6SS tethers. As exemplified by WP_095560627.1 and WP_152436132.1, these RIX domain-containing proteins are encoded by the first gene in a three-gene operon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S8A</xref>). Notably, the effectors encoded by the second gene within these two operons are known: a Tae4 peptidoglycan amidase effector <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>and a homolog of the TseH cysteine hydrolase effector <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, respectively. The third gene in these operons encodes the predicted cognate immunity protein. Similar to the Rte1 tether example described above, a module encompassing the C-terminal extension of the RIX domain (i.e., the predicted loading platform), the effector, and the immunity protein can be found fused to a PAAR domain in other vibrios. Structure predictions using AlphaFold2 suggest that the RIX-fused C-terminal domain and the N-terminus of the downstream encoded effector interact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S8B</xref>), thus further supporting the notion that RIX domain-containing proteins can serve as T6SS tethers for cargo effectors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">In this work, we identified a new class of T6SS-secreted proteins that are widespread in <italic>Vibrionaceae</italic>. These proteins share an N-terminal domain that we named RIX; however, they have polymorphic C-terminal extensions with predicted antibacterial, anti-eukaryotic, or cargo binding activities (i.e., tethers). We showed that RIX is necessary for T6SS-mediated secretion, and we experimentally confirmed the T6SS-mediated secretion of six representative RIX-containing proteins: two antibacterial effectors (Tme1 and WP_005534959.1), three anti-eukaryotic effectors (WP_005536620.1, WP_005530005.1, and WP_038863399.1), and one tether (WP_157622110.1). In addition, we identified a novel, non-RIX-containing T6SS cargo effector, Rte1. Notably, without RIX, the identification of these polymorphic T6SS effectors would not have been trivial, since all RIX-encoding genes are orphan (i.e., they are not located near a T6SS-associated gene), and because many of the predicted toxin domains found in RIX-containing proteins have not been previously associated with T6SS effectors.</p><p id="P21">Revealing many RIX-containing proteins that have predicted anti-eukaryotic toxin domains suggests that we have underappreciated the potential role played by T6SS in the interactions between vibrios and eukaryotic organisms, whether they are hosts or predators. Although T6SS was originally described as an anti-eukaryotic determinant, allowing <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to escape predation by grazing amoeba <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, most <italic>Vibrio</italic> T6SSs investigated to date were shown to play a role in interbacterial competitions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, and only a handful of <italic>Vibrio</italic> T6SSs have been implicated in anti-eukaryotic activities. These <italic>Vibrio</italic> T6SSs include T6SS1 and T6SS3 in <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, T6SS1 in <italic>V. tasmanienses</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, and T6SS in <italic>V. crassostreae</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Several additional <italic>Vibrio</italic> T6SSs were also suggested to play a role in interactions with eukaryotes based on the presence of a predicted anti-eukaryotic MIX-effector in their genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, only a few T6SS effectors with anti-eukaryotic activities have been described to date, in vibrios and in other bacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Therefore, our identification of diverse families of RIX-containing effectors with known or predicted anti-eukaryotic activities substantially enlarges this list, and it may instigate future studies to identify the eukaryotic targets and the mechanisms of action of these novel effectors. Future work is also required to identify the potential eukaryotic organisms that are targeted by these potentially anti-eukaryotic T6SSs found in vibrios, and to determine whether their role is offensive or defensive.</p><p id="P22">In addition to effectors, RIX domains are also found in T6SS tethers, revealing a new mechanism of tether-mediated secretion for T6SS cargo effectors. Our results indicated that RIX domains replace PAAR and VgrG proteins, which are secreted structural components of the T6SS, in modules comprising a C-terminal loading platform extension and a cargo effector and immunity pair. We experimentally demonstrated that a new cargo effector, Rte1, required an upstream-encoded RIX-containing protein in order to be secreted by the T6SS and delivered into prey cells during bacterial competition. This tether-mediated secretion mechanism is similar to the recently described mechanism involving a MIX domain-containing co-effector <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, yet it is distinct since the RIX-containing tether is secreted via T6SS on its own, whereas the MIX-containing co-effector requires its effector partner for secretion. Notably, our attempts to determine the T6SS tube-spike component with which RIX domain-containing proteins interact have been inconclusive; therefore, future work is also required to determine the mechanism governing the secretion of RIX domain-containing proteins.</p><p id="P23">In conclusion, we identified a new class of polymorphic T6SS cargo effectors widespread in vibrios, and we revealed a new, tether-mediated secretion mechanism for T6SS cargo effectors. In future work, we will determine how RIX-containing proteins are loaded onto the secreted T6SS, and we will explore the potential use of RIX domains and RIX-containing tethers to deliver engineered, non-canonical cargo effectors via T6SS to be used as bio-treatments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> or molecular biology tools <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Strains and Media</title><p id="P24">For a complete list of strains used in this study, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains BL21 (DE3), DH5α (λ-pir), and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 were grown in 2xYT broth (1.6% wt/vol tryptone, 1% wt/vol yeast extract, and 0.5% wt/vol NaCl) or on lysogeny broth agar (LB; 1.5% wt/vol) plates at 37°C, or at 30°C when harboring effector expression plasmids.
