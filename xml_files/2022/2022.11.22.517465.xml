Nirmatrelvir – an orally available inhibitor of the 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease – has been shown to reduce the risk of progression to severe COVID-19. However, the impact of nirmatrelvir treatment on the development of SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immune responses is unknown. Here, by using a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we show that nirmatrelvir administration early after infection blunts the development of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell responses. Accordingly, upon secondary challenge, nirmatrelvir-treated mice recruited significantly fewer memory T and B cells to the infected lungs and to mediastinal lymph nodes, respectively. Together, the data highlight a potential negative impact of nirmatrelvir treatment with important implications for clinical management and might help explain the virological and/or symptomatic relapse after treatment completion reported in some individuals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19 rebound</kwd><kwd>Antiviral treatment</kwd><kwd>Nirmatrelvir</kwd><kwd>3CL<sup>pro</sup></kwd><kwd>M<sup>pro</sup></kwd><kwd>Animal models</kwd><kwd>Adaptive immunity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in more than 620 million confirmed infections causing greater than 6.5 million deaths worldwide as of October 2022 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html</ext-link>). Despite effective COVID-19 vaccines have been developed at an unprecedented pace, a vast number of people are either unwilling or unable to get vaccinated. SARS-CoV-2 is a beta-coronavirus whose RNA genome encodes for two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, and four structural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). The polyproteins are cleaved by the viral papain-like protease (PL<sup>pro</sup>) and by the viral main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) – the latter also referred to as 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CL<sup>pro</sup>) – to yield nonstructural proteins that are necessary to viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Paxlovid, a combination of an orally available M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor termed nirmatrelvir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) and ritonavir, has received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of COVID-19 on December 22, 2021. Despite its effectiveness at reducing viral titers and the risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), the impact of nirmatrelvir treatment on the development of adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. It is also unclear why some patients experience a surprising rebound of viral load and a rapid relapse of COVID-19 symptoms shortly after the completion of an early and effective nirmatrelvir treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Viral sequencing indicates that the relapse is not associated with the selection of treatment-resistant mutations, nor due to infection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Whether treatment rebound is due to an impairment in the development of adaptive immunity necessary to complete SARS-CoV-2 clearance remains to be determined.</p><p id="P4">Here, we set out to assess the impact of nirmatrelvir treatment on the development of antiviral adaptive immunity in a well-characterized mouse model of COVID-19, based on the controlled administration of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 to K18-hACE2 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Nirmatrelvir was synthesized prior to its publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) via a multistep convergent approach that differed from the reported procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Details and synthesis intermediates are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Materials and Methods</xref>. As expected, nirmatrelvir was able to inhibit the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> in a dose-dependent manner, as determined by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biochemical assay performed both by preincubating the protease with the compound for 30 minutes at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) or by directly adding the substrate to the reaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>), as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). In the two assays, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of nirmatrelvir on the M<sup>pro</sup> was 47 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and 14 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>), respectively. In both procedures, we used the commercially available SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor GC376 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) as positive control, showing an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.14 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and 4.8 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>), respectively. Next, the antiviral activity of nirmatrelvir against SARS-CoV-2 was examined by monitoring the protection from cytopathic effect in infected HEK293T-hACE2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) and by quantifying SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). Nirmatrelvir prevented death of HEK293T-hACE2 cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 variants D614G, B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron BA.1) with a mean IC<sub>50</sub> value of 33 ± 10 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) and prevented SARS-CoV-2 RNA release with a mean IC<sub>50</sub> value of 54 ± 25 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). Finally, we evaluated the antiviral activity of nirmatrelvir in a well-characterized mouse model of COVID-19, based on the controlled administration of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 to K18-hACE2 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Briefly, non-anesthetized mice were placed in a nose-only inhalation tower system and exposed to a target dose of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID<sub>50</sub>) of aerosolized B.1.1.529 under controlled pressure, temperature, and humidity conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Mice were treated for six times with vehicle or nirmatrelvir via oral gavage (150 mpk/mouse) starting at 4 hours post infection (p.i.) and every 12 hours thereafter up until day 3 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). The plasma concentration of nirmatrelvir evaluated 4 hours after the last administration was 1.39 ± 0.73 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). As expected, neither SARS-CoV-2 infection nor nirmatrelvir treatment affected the body weight of K18-hACE2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). In line with previously published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), whereas vehicle-treated SARS-CoV-2 infected mice showed robust viral replication in the lungs and in the nasal turbinates, nirmatrelvir-treated SARS-CoV-2 infected mice showed virtually undetectable viral RNA and infectious virus in the same anatomical compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F, G</xref>).</p><p id="P6">With this established system, we next set out to study the consequences of nirmatrelvir treatment on antiviral immune responses. To this end, we infected and treated another group of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice exactly as before but monitored them until 24 days p.i. to assess the SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody response in the sera. Because SARS-CoV-2 T cells are not readily detectable in the blood of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice infected with B.1.1.529 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A, B</xref>), we decided to subject the mice to a homologous re-challenge with a higher dose (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>) of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 to evaluate the eventual recruitment of memory T (and B) cells to the infected lung and lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes. The mean plasma concentration of nirmatrelvir 4 hours after the last administration was 1.40 ± 0.99 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>), remarkably similar to the previous experiment. No mice exhibited significant weight loss for the whole duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Of note, the levels of total IgG specific for the spike S1 subunit (Receptor Binding Domain, RBD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) and the levels of anti-B.1.1.529 neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) were remarkably reduced in nirmatrelvir-treated mice 14 and 21 days p.i., respectively, and 4 days after re-challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). Consistent with this, B cells recovered from the mediastinal lymph-nodes of nirmatrelvir-treated mice 4 days after re-challenge exhibited a lower expression of the activation marker CD95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>) and in one vehicle-treated mouse we could detect RBD-specific B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). Additionally, large lymphocytic aggregates consisting of proliferating B cells were detected in the lungs of vehicle- but not nirmatrelvir-treated mice, 4 days after re-challenge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells recovered from lung homogenates were assessed for intracellular IFN-γ and TNF-α expression upon <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with a pool of SARS-CoV-2 peptides covering the complete nucleocapsid, matrix, and spike proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). In line with the results obtained for the humoral response, we found that the frequency and absolute number of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> and IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> TNF-α<sup>+</sup> SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly lower in the lungs of nirmatrelvir-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice, 4 days after homologous re-challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I-N</xref>). Humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 were also reduced when nirmatrelvir treatment was initiated later (24 or 48 hours after infection) and when infection was performed with different SARS-CoV-2 variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). However, nirmatrelvir treatment of mice infected with unrelated viruses (i.e., vesicular stomatitis virus [VSV] and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [LCMV]) did not inhibit the development of antiviral adaptive immune responses, indicating that nirmatrelvir is not <italic>per se</italic> an immune suppressive drug (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Of note, we did not detect viral titers in the lungs of all but one nirmatrelvir-treated mouse after homologous re-challenge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A, B</xref>). Similarly, infection of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice with the poorly pathogenic Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) did not allow us to evaluate clinical signs of disease. We believe that the failure to observe decreased protection upon re-infection in mice treated with nirmatrelvir (despite a prominent reduction in adaptive immunity) has to do with the limitations of the experimental setup. Case in point, we infected mice with Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, we treated or not with nirmatrelvir and we re-challenged mice with Delta (B1.1.617) variant, known to be more pathogenic and to replicate at higher levels in mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6C, D</xref>, two out of six mice that were treated with nirmatrelvir during the primary infection showed higher viral RNA in the lungs upon Delta re-challenge. Future studies with different SARS-CoV-2 variants and/or doses should assess the impact of the reduced adaptive immunity caused by nirmatrelvir treatment on viral load and the severity of disease progression upon re-challenge.</p><p id="P8">In summary, our results indicate that nirmatrelvir treatment early after infection negatively impacts the development of adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. Although the mechanistic bases behind this observation were not addressed in this study, it is conceivable that this is due to insufficient antigen exposure (quantity and/or duration) of naïve B and T cells. It is worth noting that successful antimicrobial treatment does not inevitably result in reduced adaptive immune responses to any pathogen. For instance, treatment of mice infected with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> with amoxicillin early after infection did not significantly impair the development of T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Furthermore, treatment with antibiotics before <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection allowed the development of functional antigen-specific memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the absence of contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Thus, the effect of antiviral therapy on adaptive immunity probably depends on the impact of such treatment on several factors including not only pathogen replication but also duration of antigen expression and presentation, activation of innate immunity, etc. While the clinical data continue to support nirmatrelvir treatment for the prevention of severe COVID-19 in high-risk individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), the data reported here draw attention to a potential negative impact of this therapy. Whether this effect is an exclusive feature of nirmatrelvir or whether forthcoming antivirals acting on SARS-CoV-2 would have similar effects should be addressed in future studies. Although mice do not reproduce the viral rebound observed in some patients treated with nirmatrelvir, we believe that our results might help explain the virological and/or symptomatic relapse after treatment completion reported in some individuals and should inform clinical and public health policies.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S2"><title>Viruses</title><p id="P9">The SARS-CoV-2 isolates were propagated in Vero E6-hTMPRSS2 cells.
