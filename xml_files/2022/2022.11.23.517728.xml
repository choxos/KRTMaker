Targeting of RNA transcripts to axons is one of the mechanisms that allows rapid local translation of proteins in response to extracellular signals. 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA are non-coding sequences that play a critical role in determining transcript localisation and translation by interacting with specific RNA binding proteins (RBPs).

Although initially the presence of RNA transcripts in axons was considered an oddity, a wealth of studies demonstrated that RNA transport and translation in axons is a widespread phenomenon observed in most neuronal cell types and across the species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. We now know that local synthesis of axonal transcripts is essential for many biological functions, including axon extension, growth cone turning and nerve regeneration after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. During neuronal development, axons extend over long distances to reach their targets, driven by their growth cone, which responds rapidly to local cues along its migratory path [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. At early developmental stages, sympathetic neurons respond to neurotrophin 3 (NT3) released from the vasculature surrounding the axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. NT3 elicits a local signalling sufficient to support axon growth and cell survival of the relatively immature neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. However, at later stages, when axons have reached a considerable length, this local mechanism is no longer suitable to propagate the signalling back to the cell bodies in a reliable manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. As distal axons and growth cones approach their final targets, they release Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) that is then internalised within signalling endosomes and transported back to the cell bodies where it activates transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Although in this cell system both neurotrophins chiefly bind to the same tyrosine kinase receptor TrkA, their ability to signal to the nucleus has been linked to their differential internalization into signalling endosomes and retrograde transport to cell bodies. Because the NT3-TrkA complexes are not found in signalling endosomes and are not retrogradely transported, NT3 is considered to be a poor activator of gene expression and to act locally in axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P6">In addition to conveying the genetic data from the chromatin to the translational machinery, mRNA transcripts carry further information stored in their untranslated regions (UTRs). The 3’UTRs play a key role in regulating many aspects of RNA metabolism, including transcript localization, mRNA stability and translation by interacting with RNA binding proteins (RBPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. RBP complexes are initially assembled co-transcriptionally and are essential for regulating mRNA splicing, polyadenylation site (PAS) choice and alternative polyadenylation (APA), and mRNA nuclear export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Most RBPs are multifunctional and RBP complexes undergo extensive remodelling in the cytoplasm. For example, RBPs interaction with elements in the 3’UTR mediate mRNA targeting to dendrites and axons, and this event is necessary for the establishment of synapses, axon growth and neuronal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Critically, incorrect processing and delivery of mRNA causes severe developmental defects and has been implicated in many neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P7">We performed 3’end sequencing of RNA localised in axons and cell bodies of sympathetic neurons whose axons were exposed to either NGF or NT3, and found that both neurotrophins induce a robust transcriptional response with many transcripts specifically regulated when either growth factor was applied to the axon terminals. NGF and NT3 also induced Alternative Polyadenylation (APA), thereby generating multiple 3’UTR isoforms. A novel Bayesian procedure developed to accurately identify localised 3’ UTR isoforms revealed hundreds of isoforms that are actively and specifically transported in axons. Notably dozens of isoforms expressing the short 3’UTR were exclusively located in axons, suggesting that 3’UTRs may undergo local post-transcriptional remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] in response to either NGF or NT3. Integration of our findings with predicted binding events inferred from publicly available CLIP-sequencing data for 126 RNA binding proteins (RBP) revealed that RBP complexes associated with the downstream regions of the short 3’ UTRs compete with cleavage factors and promote the expression of long 3’ UTRs that are transported in axons. Once in the axonal compartment, the complexes induce the cleavage of the long 3’UTR through the interaction with additional RBPs.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S6"><title>NGF and NT3 applied to distal axons induce distinct transcriptional programmes</title><p id="P8">To identify mRNAs localised in sympathetic cell bodies and axons grown in the presence of NGF or NT3, we combined compartmentalized cultures and 3’UTR sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Neonatal rat sympathetic neurons were cultured in chambers that allow the physical separation of cell bodies from distal axons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). Sympathetic neurons are especially suitable for compartmentalized cultures because they grow in culture as a highly homogeneous population without glial cells. Neurons were seeded in the central compartment with NGF (100 ng/ml) and after 5 days, the NGF was lowered to 10ng/ml in the cell bodies, and NGF or NT3 were supplied at high concentration to the peripheral compartments to stimulate axon growth. After 7 additional days <italic>in vitro</italic>, RNA was isolated from either cell bodies or axons, subject to 2 rounds of linear amplification and sequenced by using 3’end-Seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. This technique allowed the sequencing of transcripts 3’ends independently of the length of the transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">methods</xref> for a detailed description of the protocol used; Fig. 1A). Analyses of the reads obtained from two independent biological replicates indicated the high reliability of the RNA sequencing in both compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). The lower correlation between the replicates from the axonal compartment is likely due to the lower amount of RNA isolated in axons.</p><p id="P9">We first tested whether exposure of distal axons to either NGF or NT3 leads to transcriptional changes in cell bodies. Differential gene expression analysis identified 232 genes that were up-regulated in NGF treated neurons compared to NT3 (FC&gt;1.5 and P value&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The genes were enriched in terms related to cell adhesion and glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, <italic>upper</italic>). Conversely, the expression of 119 genes was increased in the cell bodies of neurons whose axons were exposed to NT3, and they were enriched for terms such as neuron projection and synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1C</xref>, <italic>lower</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) enrichment analysis showed a neurotrophin-specific transcriptional regulation for these two categories of differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The 1,000 nucleotide promoter regions of the genes up-regulated in NGF were enriched in 14 TFBS motifs that included motifs bound by EGR1, EGR2 and EGR3 (P-Value=3.46E-04, 43% of the promoter regions of NGF up-regulated genes), FOS, FOSB and FOSL1, JUNB and JUND (P-Value=3.91E-03, 16% the promoter regions of NGF up-regulated genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>), all belonging to the Reactome biological pathway of NGF-stimulated transcription (HSA-9031628). Fewer motifs were enriched within the 1,000 nucleotide promoter regions of transcripts up-regulated in neurons whose axons were exposed to NT3, and they all related to embryonic development. Such motifs were bound by SOX2, POU5F1 (2.26E-02, 8% of the promoter regions of NT3 up-regulated genes) and SOX17 (P-Value=2.39E-02, 23% of the promoter regions of NT3 up-regulated genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Alternative Polyadenylation (APA) takes place principally co-transcriptionally, giving rise to transcripts expressing identical coding regions and 3’UTRs of often widely different length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. To ask whether neurotrophins induce distinct co-transcriptional APA regulation, we investigated the shifts of the relative 3’ UTR usage of transcripts expressed in cell bodies of neurons whose axons were exposed to either NGF or NT3. 27 transcripts showed distal-to-proximal promoter 3’ UTR shift with NGF compared to NT3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>), and 45 distal-to-proximal promoter 3’ UTR shifts were observed in response to NT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Tracks of representative transcripts expressing long or short 3’ UTR in cell bodies of neurons treated with NGF or NT3 are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref>. Differential 3’ UTR isoform usage can be due to selective increase of promoter-proximal 3’ UTR isoforms, promoter-distal isoforms or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Neurons exposed to NGF exhibited a similar number of promoter-proximal and promoter-distal 3’ UTR shifts (20/26). In contrast, NT3 induced twice as many promoter-proximal shifts as promoter-distal shifts (34/16), indicating a preferential usage of isoforms with short 3’ UTR in NT3-treated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Distal-to-proximal promoter 3’ UTR usage is often indicative of higher translational efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. We found that in sympathetic neurons, 3’UTR shift targeted genes associated with distinct biological pathways. Whereas cellular stress and DNA damage were overrepresented terms in response to NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>, <italic>upper panel</italic>), in neurons treated with NT3 target genes were enriched in cell migration and differentiation biological pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>lower panel</italic>). Together, these data indicate that NGF and NT3 applied to distal axons are equally capable of regulating gene expression and co-transcriptional APA. This result was expected for NGF, given that NGF/TrkA complexes are retrogradely transported to the nucleus to activate transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. However, it was surprising to see that NT3 was equally capable of eliciting robust transcriptional changes, as NT3 cannot be endocytosed within signalling endosomes and is considered to trigger mostly local signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Together, our results demonstrate that NT3 is as effective as NGF in signalling from the axon terminals to the nucleus and is an equally potent regulator of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Identification of RBPs regulating transcript APA in response to NGF and NT3</title><p id="P11">RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs) have important functions in regulating mRNA processing and metabolism, including alternative polyadenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. To identify regulators of neurotrophin-specific 3’ UTR APA we interrogated publicly available cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) sequencing data for 126 RBPs assayed in human cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Visual inspection of the distribution of RBP cross-link events along the 3’ UTR isoforms identified by our screen revealed that a 500 nucleotide (nt) region preceding the 3’ ends exhibited the highest percentage of bound RBPs (70%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). This region is expected to serve a regulatory function given its high conservation score (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To identify global regulators of APA we searched for associations between cross-linking events mapping to defined regions along the promoter-proximal and promoter-distal 3’ UTRs, and the relative usage in cell bodies of the short 3’ UTR isoform. 126 RBPs were tested individually both in NGF and NT3 conditions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Material and Methods</xref> for details). We found that a positive association between RBP binding and the expression of 3’ UTR isoforms predominantly occurred at the 3’ end of both the promoter-proximal (Ip) and the promoter-distal 3’ UTR (Id), irrespective of the neurotrophin used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We identified 17 RBPs, preferentially bound within the [-350:+150] region surrounding the 3’ end, as positive regulators of polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). They included the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) factors CPSF160 and CSTF2, that are known to reside in the [-50:0] and [0:50] nt regions around the 3’ end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B,C</xref>). Notably, the binding of RBPs to specific 3’ end terminal regions was positively associated to both short and long 3’ UTR isoforms, which is consistent with the fact that these factors may promote 3’ end processing irrespective of 3’UTR length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p><p id="P13">Negative association between 3’ UTR isoform usage and RBP binding revealed that negative regulators of polyadenylation are uniquely detected in the [0:150] nt region downstream of the promoter-proximal 3’ end. Long 3’ UTR isoforms were not associated with any negative regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Interestingly, the 27 negative regulators of the short 3’ UTR form a densely connected network of experimentally validated interacting proteins that are enriched in biological processes related to mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). HuR is a well characterised RBP that competes with the CSTF factors downstream of poly(A) sites to block polyadenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Accordingly, we found that HuR binding downstream of the 3’ end of the promoter-proximal 3’ UTRs strongly associated with decreased promoter-proximal 3’ UTR usage, promoting the transcription of long 3’ UTR isoforms. In contrast, HuR binding upstream of the 3’ end does not affect polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Thus, the choice of short or long 3’ UTR mainly relies on factors residing within the 150 nt region downstream of the promoter-proximal 3’ end. Analysis of the predicted propensity to localise into cellular condensates revealed significant differences between the 17 positive and the 27 negative regulators of polyadenylation, with the former exhibiting higher probability to localise into P-bodies and cytoplasmic granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>). Altogether this analysis identifies novel and previously known regulators of polyadenylation along with their preferential location around the 3’ end. The data also show that positive regulators are more likely to concentrate into condensates where they may operate to promote the cleavage of the 3’ end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P14">Next, we asked whether NGF and NT3 may utilise distinct regulators of 3’ UTR APA. Although exposure of distal axons to NGF or NT3 resulted in very similar APA profiles in the cell body, subtle but significant differences were observed in dozens of transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). 3’ UTR position-dependent Fisher enrichment in RBP cross-link events were studied for the four groups of APA isoforms previously identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1F,G</xref>). The distributions of the enrichment scores (-log10(P-value)) along the 3’ UTR revealed that the regulatory regions with significant enrichment of RBPs were restricted to the region downstream the promoter-proximal 3’ end, irrespective of the grouping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2I-L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2G</xref>). This result suggests that the selection of either isoform between NGF and NT3 occurs through the binding of RBP factors that compete with cleavage factors in the downstream region of the 3’end. This mechanism is similar to the one predicted to promote the long 3’ UTR in lieu of the short. Significantly enriched regulators (P-value &lt;0.01) included four networks of RBPs associated with mRNA 3’ UTR binding and 3’ end processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2M-P</xref>). Altogether our data identify neurotrophin-specific regulators of 3’ UTR APA in sympathetic neurons by integrating human-derived CLIP data with rat sequencing data.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>NGF and NT3 induce the localisation of distinct mRNA transcripts in axons</title><p id="P15">We next asked whether NGF and NT3 induced the localisation of distinct mRNAs in axons. A similar number of transcripts and 3’ UTR isoforms were found in cell bodies and axons independently of neurotrophin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>). However, a significant number of axonal mRNAs with distinct cellular functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>) were uniquely detected in response to either NGF (n=1,962) or NT3 (n=1,089; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In line with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], a larger percentage of axonal transcripts expressed multiple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) and longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>) 3’UTR isoforms, when compared to cell bodies in both conditions.</p><p id="P16">The abundance of axonal mRNAs mostly correlated with expression levels in the cell bodies and transcript length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3C,D</xref>), suggesting that diffusion and anchoring are important mechanisms regulating mRNA localisation in axons. To identify the regulatory mechanisms responsible for active mRNA axonal localisation, we developed a statistical model and a novel metric that we named Localisation Score (LS). LS quantifies the efficiency of transcripts localisation in axons irrespective of mRNA length and abundance in the cell bodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Material and Methods</xref>). Thus, LS provides a better statistical tool than the gene abundance ratio between axons and cell bodies commonly used to quantify mRNA localisation, and enables the identification of over-transported mRNA irrespective of the expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3F,G</xref>). A positive LS indicates higher axonal mRNA abundance than would be expected for transcripts with similar size and expression level and correlates with active transport and stabilisation. Conversely, negative LS values are indicative of either transcript diffusion from the cell bodies or higher mRNA degradation. Using this novel metric, we identified thousands of over- and under-transported 3’ UTR isoforms in both NGF and NT3 conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3H-J</xref>). To validate the statistical model, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on transcripts predicted to be restricted to cell bodies. Analysis of Eid2 and Rab22a indicated that the mRNAs were virtually absent in NGF and NT3 treated axons, despite being highly expressed in the cell bodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3K,L</xref>). LS analysis revealed that NGF and NT3 promote axonal localisation of transcripts associated with largely similar GO biological pathways, such as vesicular localisation and axo-dendritic transport (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3M,N</xref>). Subtle but significant differences in axonal localisation of transcripts associated to specific biological pathways were detected in both conditions. For example, transcripts related to the collagen catabolic pathway exhibited higher LS in NGF axons compared to NT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E,F</xref>), while those related to the vascular endothelial-derived growth factors-related pathway had higher LS in NT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G,H</xref>). The latter finding is especially interesting considering that during the early development when sympathetic neurons are exposed to NT3, axons grow in close contact with blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], possibly inducing the transport of transcripts that mediate cross-signalling between neurons and endothelial cells. Analysis performed on individual transcripts identified 482 3’ UTR isoforms with significantly higher LS in NGF axons and 348 with higher LS in NT3-treated axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 10,11</xref>). Single molecule RNA Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (smFISH) of <italic>Atf3</italic>, a transcript predicted to localise in NT3 but not NGF-treated axons, confirmed that neurotrophins induce mRNA axonal localisation in a highly specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. These findings identify a large repertoire of transcripts that are localised and stored in developing sympathetic neuron axons. They also indicate that both NGF and NT3 applied to distal axons select the transcripts that will be localised peripherally.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Comprehensive identification of the RBP regulome for axonal mRNA localisation</title><p id="P17">The interaction of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements with <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors such as RBPs plays a crucial role in regulating mRNA stability and axonal transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. We next investigated whether specific RBPs accounted for the distinct mRNA axonal localisation observed in NGF and NT3 treated axons. Using the CLIP data described above, LS of transcripts with cross-linking events was tested for each individual RBPs on regions of 50 nucleotides along the 3’ UTR (see Material and Method). We found that the [-200:-50] nt region preceding the 3’ end exhibited the highest regulatory potential for axonal localisation in both NGF and NT3 conditions (median P-value=10e-25 across the 126 RBPs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The preferential binding of axonal localisation <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors to this specific region is in line with previous findings demonstrating the presence of NGF-dependent localisation elements within -150 nt from the 3’ end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].

Notably, we did not find RBPs linked to decreased localisation of specific axonal mRNAs in response either to NGF or NT3.

This unique expression pattern suggests that they are not the product of co-transcriptional APA and are cleaved in axons. Interestingly, isoforms that express short 3’UTRs only in axons were largely not overlapping between NGF and NT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <italic>right</italic>), suggesting substantial differential regulation between these two conditions.

Fisher enrichment in RBP cross-link events along the 3’ UTR of the remodelled isoforms revealed that while NGF-related predicted regulators of axonal remodelling preferentially localised to the [0:+50] nt region downstream the 3’ end, NT3-related predicted regulators were found on both sides of the 3’ end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5D,E</xref>). Thirty-five enriched RBPs were observed in both NGF and NT3 remodelled isoforms, whereas 10 and 18 were unique for NGF or NT3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 20-21</xref>). Common RBPs included HuR which is known to inhibit polyadenylation when bound to the region downstream of the 3’ end (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5C</xref>). UPF1, which belongs to the protein complex that we previously showed to mediate the 3’ UTR cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], was significantly enriched in the 50 nt region downstream of the 3’ end of remodelled isoforms in both NGF and NT3 treated axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5D</xref>). Analysis of the positional preference of the top predicted regulators of axonal cleavage revealed that for NT3-remodelled isoforms binding to the [-200:-150] nt window upstream the 3’ end is favoured, whereas regulatory regions of NGF-remodelled isoforms reside in the [50:100] nt region downstream the 3’ end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>). Neurotrophin-specific predicted regulators of axonal remodelling include AKAP8L, which is enriched in the [-200:-150] nt region of 3’ UTR short isoforms and is uniquely detected in NT3 condition, and PTBP1, which is enriched in the [0:50] nt region downstream of the pool of short 3’ UTR isoforms detected only in NGF-treated axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I</xref>).</p><p id="P21">We next studied whether RBPs predicted to regulate 3’ cleavage in axons may dictate the choice of the 3’ end in the nucleus.

Based on these findings, we propose a model in which RBPs responsible for axonal cleavage are primarily recruited to the downstream region of the promoter-proximal 3’ end in the nucleus, where they favour the expression of the long 3’ UTRs required for axonal localisation possibly by competing with cleavage factors. Once they reach the distal part of the axons, they promote the cleavage of the long 3’UTR by probably interacting with additional RBPs such as the ones we previously identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S12"><title>NT3 and NGF applied to distal axons regulates transcription</title><p id="P22">Despite binding to the same receptor TrkA, NGF and NT3 intracellular signalling is quite distinct. NGF-TrkA complexes are internalised into signalling endosomes that travel back long distances to the cell bodies where they activate transcription. In contrast, NT3 is a growth factor released by target tissues mostly during the early stage of neuronal development when axons are still short, and it is thought to act mostly locally in axon growth cones [6-9, 42]. Our data demonstrate that both neurotrophins when applied to distal axons, induce a robust transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref>). We also found that NGF and NT3 applied to distal axons regulate APA, inducing the expression of 3’UTR isoforms that are only partially overlapping. Thus, our findings indicate that NT3 is as capable as NGF of inducing transcriptional changes, opening the possibility that despite not being internalised in signalling endosomes, NT3 initiates a signalling pathway that is faithfully propagated to the nucleus. Given that the modality of how NGF containing signalling endosomes communicate to the nucleus is unknown, it is conceivable that both neurotrophins may share common intranuclear regulatory pathways, perhaps involving changes of nuclear calcium concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>The RBPome for axonal localisation</title><p id="P23">Subcellular localisation of mRNA enables the synthesis of proteins necessary for axon growth and synaptic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Here, we show that axonal exposure to NGF and NT3 regulates axonal localisation of specific transcripts enriched in defined biological pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). RBPs are key regulators of mRNA metabolism including mRNA transport and translation, and they are essential in determining when and where specific proteins will be expressed. By integrating our 3’ end-seq data with CLIP data generated in human cell lines, we discovered novel and known regulators of APA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), corroborating the suitability of human data to study the RBP regulome underlying mRNA metabolism in rat neurons. Using these data, we found that axonal localization is positively regulated by RBPs that facilitate mRNA transport, and negatively modulated by RBPs that regulate mRNA stability. Albeit universal axon-targeting motifs have not been identified so far, 32 RBPs were found to positively associate with axonal localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Furthermore, only minor differences in predicted regulators of transport were observed between NGF and NT3 treated axons, and no evidence was found for differential binding of destabilizing proteins and possibly mRNA stability between the two conditions. Thus, although NGF and NT3 regulate the transport of specific mRNA isoforms to axons, they utilise similar RBP complexes, suggesting a conserved mechanism for transcript localisation in neurons. Future studies will clarify whether the same combination of RBPs drives the transcript localisation to other neuronal compartments, such as dendrites and dendritic spines.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>A switch of RBP complex composition promotes 3’ UTR remodelling in axons</title><p id="P24">We recently discovered that few axonal transcripts including <italic>Inositol Monophosphatase 1 (IMPA1)</italic> undergo 3’UTR remodelling in sympathetic neuron axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Importantly 3’UTR cleavage is necessary for triggering the translation of <italic>IMPA1</italic> mRNA isoforms expressing a short, cleaved 3’UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Hundreds of transcripts with a proximal-to-distal shift of the 3’UTR are detected in axons. Several short 3’UTR isoforms were expressed exclusively in axons and in some cases specifically in response to either NGF and NT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.5</xref>). Analysis of the RBP complexes interacting with the remodelled isoforms revealed enrichment of UPF1 and PTBP1 that we previously identified as binding partners of the 3’UTR remodelling complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Based on our data, we propose that a group of RBPs is recruited co-transcriptionally to the region downstream of the proximal 3’ UTR competing with CSTF factors and suppressing the use of the proximal PAS. This event results in 3’ UTR lengthening, which is compatible with several studies indicating that isoforms expressing long 3’UTR are preferentially transported to axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. These factors may remain bound to the 3’ UTR within RBP granules and hitchhike along the axons to eventually co-localise in the axonal compartment with the long 3’ UTR isoform. Upon de-assembly of the transport granules in axons, some factors, including UPF1, promote the cleavage of the long 3’UTR into the short 3’UTR isoform. Transport granules have been considered as “translation factories” that contain RBPs, mRNAs, ribosomes and translation factors, and regulate local protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Here, we propose a similar mechanism by which APA, RNA localization and neurotrophin-dependent translation are coupled and co-regulated.

In order to identify transcripts that show a marked change in the pA site usage between conditions, we scored the differences in proximal-to-distal poly(A) site usage using the following two scores: <disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math id="M1"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>Δ</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>proximal</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>distal</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>cond</mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>proximal</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>distal</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>cond</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>cond</mml:mtext><mml:mn>11</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>cond</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></disp-formula> <disp-formula id="FD2"><mml:math id="M2"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>Δ</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>PUD</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>proximal</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>proximal</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>distal</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mtext>cond</mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>proximal</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>proximal</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>distal</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>cond</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>cond</mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>cond</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P38">The statistical significance of the changes in proximal-to-distal poly(A) site ratio between conditions was assessed by Fisher’s exact count test using summed-up raw read counts of promoter-proximal versus promoter-distal 3’ UTR isoforms originating from either conditions (cell body versus axonal compartment or cell bodies of NGF versus NT3 conditions). We adjusted the P-Value controlling for False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 0.01.

Consequently, such metrics fail to identify highly transported but lowly expressed transcripts, and similarly they are more likely to associate highly expressed transcript with high mRNA axonal localisation scores albeit low transport efficiency as compared to transcripts of similar expression level. Here we aimed to develop a novel metric that accurately infers the axonal transport efficiency and stability, irrespective of the transcript length and the expression in the cell body using a hierarchical Bayesian model procedure.</p><p id="P40">First, we looked at the global relationship between the normalised read count per 3’ UTR isoforms in the axonal compartment and their corresponding normalised read counts in the cell body compartments. We found that the average 3’ UTR isoform abundance level-average log2 expression- in the axonal compartments of either NGF or NT3 condition is best approximated by a combination of polynomial regression model of degree four of the abundance in the cell body completed and a linear model of the transcript length as revealed by the Akaike’s An Information Criterion from ANOVA analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 22</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3E</xref>). Given our goal to set out a metric of axonal localisation independent of the cell body read counts and the transcript length, we created 102 groups of 3’ UTR isoforms of fixed expression ranges in the cell body (18 bins from 2<sup>3</sup> to 2<sup>20</sup> nucleotides) and fixed ranges of transcript lengths (10 bins from 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>4.5</sup> nucleotides). For each of these 102 groups, we generated a matrix of 10<sup>4</sup> simulated draws of axonal read count values predicted using the fitted polynomial regression model of degree four, obtained from the total pool of transcripts, over a regularly interspaced grid of 100 possible transcript lengths -ranging from the minimal to the maximal transcript length of this specific group, and 100 possible cell body read count values -again ranging from the minimal to the maximal cell body read count of this specific group. We then extracted the average and variance over the 10<sup>4</sup> axonal read count values for each of these 102 groups. Using these 102 pairs of averages and variances, we next fitted 102 negative binomial distributions to the 102 groups of axonal read counts by maximum likelihood (mle) using the fitdist function from the fitdistrplus R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. These 102 posterior predictive distributions of axonal read counts could then serve to assess whether the observed axonal abundance of each individual 3’ UTR isoform <inline-formula><mml:math id="M3"><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> are consistent with the fitted models given their associated transcript length and cell body abundance.

Thus for each 3’ UTR isoform <italic>i</italic>, we next computed the proportion of 10<sup>4</sup> values, randomly generated from the posterior negative distribution associated with its corresponding transcript length and abundance in the cell body, that were smaller or larger than the observed axonal read count. In order to get a single value per transcript, hereafter called <italic>Localisation Score</italic>, we selected the smallest of these two values (probabilities to observe smaller or larger axonal read count for a given isoform), transformed it using the log10, and multiplied it by -1 when the latter was selected. Hence positive values are associated with active transport or stabilisation, while negative values are associated with cell body restriction or degradation. Notably while the ratios between gene’s abundance in the axons and in the cell body depend on cell body abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3F</xref>, <italic>upper</italic>) and transcript length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3G</xref>, <italic>upper</italic>), this is not the case anymore with the novel localisation score metric (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 3F,G</xref>, <italic>lower</italic>). This analysis has been restricted on the 30,450 3’ UTR isoforms detected in the axonal compartments of neurons either exposed to NGF or NT3. The axonal localisation scores for these 3’ UTR isoforms have been computed for NGF and NT3 conditions independently and are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Mapping and analysis of CLIP data</title><p id="P41">To identify RBPs that bind to 3’ UTR regions, we examined iCLIP data for 18 RBPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>], and eCLIP data from K562 and HepG2 cells for 89 and 70 RBPs, respectively, available from ENCODE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>].
