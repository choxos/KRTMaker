Biodiversity monitoring using environmental DNA based technologies has become an important tool in understanding ecosystems. In recent years promising progress for non-invasive and, more importantly, non-destructive monitoring has been made by combining the retrieval of information transmitted by released environmental DNA with high-throughput sequencing technologies. Important ecosystems under continuous threat by disease but essential for food supplies are agricultural systems, often farmed as large monocultures and so highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Pest and pathogen monitoring in agricultural ecosystems is therefore key for efficient and early disease prevention and management. Air is rich in biodiversity, but has the lowest DNA concentration of all environmental media and yet it is required for windborne spread by many of the world’s most damaging crop pathogens. Our work and recent research suggests that ecosystems can be monitored efficiently using airborne nucleic acid information.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><p id="P2">Here we show that the airborne DNA of microbes can be recovered, sequenced and taxonomically classified, including down to the species level. Monitoring a field growing key crops we show that Air-seq can identify the presence of agriculturally significant pathogens and quantify their changing abundance over a period of 1.5 months often correlating with weather variables.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P3">We add to the evidence that aerial environmental DNA can be used as a source for biomonitoring in agricultural and more general terrestrial ecosystems. The ability to detect fluxes and occurrence patterns of species and strains with high throughput sample processing and analysis technologies highlights the value of airborne environmental DNA in monitoring biodiversity changes and tracking of taxa of human interest or concern.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Air-seq</kwd><kwd>disease monitoring</kwd><kwd>air shotgun metagenomics</kwd><kwd>environmental DNA</kwd><kwd>metagenome</kwd><kwd>strain typing</kwd><kwd>wheat disease</kwd><kwd>barley disease</kwd><kwd><italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S4" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Air is rich in biodiversity containing particles of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms such as pollen, matter from animals and a variety of bacterial and fungal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Wind patterns are important in influencing climate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], species dispersal, species biogeography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] and plant as well as animal health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Especially when anthropogenic actions cause dramatic effects on the environment, measures to understand processes and species fluxes influencing ecosystems become of increasing importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. One means to help characterise such changes is the utilisation of nucleic acids found as environmental DNA (eDNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. eDNA studies have become increasingly valuable in combination with high-throughput sequencing technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]: for example searching for the term ‘environmental DNA° on PubMed highlights 72,257 published articles in the 16 years between 2005 (the year that pyrosequencing as an early high throughput sequencing technology debuted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]) to 2021 in contrast to 18,782 results published in the 65 preceding years between 1959 (the start of PubMed records) to 2004. Hence, eDNA studies are especially helpful as they can be utilised to increase sample throughput at a reduced cost and facilitate profiling of environments in a non-destructive, non-invasive manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Plant agricultural ecosystems are, as a source of food, essential for human needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Because modern farming is mostly practised in large monocultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], disease - if not managed effectively - can have devastating effects on yield and food security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Disease propagation and outbreaks are not solely based on close distance transmission of pathogens to neighbouring plants, but also from long distance aerial dispersal of pathogenic material such as fungal spores between fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Disease monitoring is therefore crucial to prevent and mediate pathogen damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. In large patches of farmland this can be achieved with a multitude of technologies ranging from chemical, molecular to IoT (Internet of Things - i.e. systems of interconnected digital devices) technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. However, many current pathogen detection technologies rely on the detection and analysis of visual plant damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Highly specific molecular tools (e.g. PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] or antibody-based assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]) can test for single pathogens but fail to distinguish between different strains and genotypes. Next generation sequencing based approaches are of great potential to overcome these limitations providing the means for pathogen detection before disease establishment at a resolution that can distinguish between pathogen strains.</p><p id="P6">One promising approach to monitor disease onset in agroecosystems is to monitor the species composition of air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Air has already been a regular subject of study in the past to understand the species dynamics and composition of ecosystems (e.g. pollen dispersal) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. eDNA sampled from air in combination with high-throughput metagenomic sequencing therefore can be a useful tool in profiling ecosystems. Many of the present studies however rely on selective and targeted metabarcoding strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], while shotgun metagenomics is still challenging to achieve with low concentration DNA samples and, so far, very recently reported results are limited to urban areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p id="P7">For example, a recent study conducted by Aguayo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] reported that the ash dieback causing fungus <italic>Hymenoscyphus fraxineus</italic> is present at higher frequencies in air samples of forests with confirmed ash dieback disease. Two other studies by Lynggaard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] and Clarke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] showed the high accuracy of air eDNA profiling in systems with described species. We hypothesised that monitoring air metagenomes in agricultural ecosystems will show a rich dynamic of pests and pathogens associated with the cultivated crops and will be able to identify newly appearing and emerging diseases over time. To test our hypothesis we established a custom workflow hereafter termed ‘Air-seq° utilising a field-work compatible, small, battery powered and portable air-sampling device (i.e. the Coriolis Micro Microbial Air Sampler) and a next-generation sequencing workflow preparing aerial eDNA shotgun metagenome sequencing libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using Air-seq we show the metagenome dynamics in the months of June and July in a field growing wheat barley and pea close to the Earlham Institute at the Norwich Research Park in Norwich, United Kingdom (UK) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional file 1.docx</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S6"><title>Detection of <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> spores in a controlled wind tunnel experiment</title><p id="P8">We first tested the accuracy and quantitative ability of our Air-seq method in a wind-tunnel experiment releasing a specific amount of <italic>B. thuringiensis</italic> spores: we continuously sprayed a total number of 0 (i.e. water as a background control), 0.3, 30 and 300 million spores over a time-period of 10 minutes at a distance of 5 m from the air sampler. For each spore concentration we collected two replicates with 10 minutes sampling time. For each replicate we prepared an Illumina Nextera sequencing library and sequenced the libraries to an average of 3.60 ± 1.65 million 150 base-pair single-end reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the background control we observed <italic>Corynebacteriales</italic> (27.10 % of all counts), <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> (19.10 % of all counts) and <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> (17.58 % of all counts) as highest abundant orders, with <italic>Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Escherichia</italic> as highest abundant genus in each order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Releasing increasing amounts of spores, we observed a quantitative increase of the genus <italic>Bacillus</italic> in the samples (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.97, R-squared: 0.95): 0 % of reads were assigned as <italic>Bacillus</italic> with releasing 0 million spores, 0.88 % of reads with 0.3 million spores, 3.59 % of reads with 3 million spores, 22.02 % of reads with 30 million spores and 70.04 % of reads with 300 million spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Determination of a suitable air sampling time-window for in-field metagenome measurements</title><p id="P9">After wind-tunnel experimentation we tested air collection in the field. We prepared a collection time-series sampling air for 5, 10, 30, 60 and 120 minutes consecutively on the same day at a Norwich Research Park field site close to the Earlham Institute (52°37’21.1”N, 1°13’02.6”E). For each time-point we collected two samples. We prepared Illumina Nextera sequencing libraries from the samples and sequenced the libraries to 5.14 ± 1.94 million 150 base-pair single-end reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To determine a suitable time-period for future outdoor collections we counted the number of classified genera for each time-point. We found fewest genera at 5 and 10 minutes collection time (10 and 9, as well as 13 and 6 for each sample and time-point respectively) and observed a steep increase in genus numbers from 10 to 30 minutes sampling, with 28 detected genera in both samples at 30 minutes. This number increased even further to 34 and 37 genera in the 60 minute samples and 35 and 40 genera in the 120 minute samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). To determine whether the final Illumina library concentration or the sequencing depth contribute to the library complexity (i.e. a higher number of genera in a library) we analysed the number of detected genera per library along with the number of sequenced reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) and the obtained amount of final Illumina library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). We found that the nanograms of the constructed Illumina library correlated with the number of observed genera and that libraries containing ≥ 3.5 ng showed the highest number of genera (to obtain a library yield of ≥ 3.5 ng we had to sample air for ≥ 30 minutes at 200 litres per minute) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Although we sequenced some libraries with less than 3.5 ng total yield to a much higher depth than all other samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B, C</xref>) these samples still contained fewer genera than higher yielding libraries with less sequencing. This indicates that the more metagenomic DNA is present as starting material for the Nextera tagmentation reaction, the higher the likely complexity of a library will be (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We compared the samples using Pearson correlation analysis using the sum of the normalised reads per million (RPM) per detected genus of both samples for each collection time-point. We observed that the 30 and 60 minute sampling time-points correlated best with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.92 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). For the 30 and 60 to 120 minute samples we observed a drop in the correlation coefficient to 0.67 and 0.80 respectively. One of the 120 minute samples however was affected by heavy afternoon rain potentially inducing a bias in sample composition and so reducing the correlation coefficient.</p><p id="P12">For future sampling we decided to collect all air samples for 60 minutes: considering that for the 60 minute time-window we found almost as many genera as for 120 minutes sampling, the Coriolis air-sampler can be powered for 60 minutes with one battery load and the observation that the short time (5 and 10 minute) air collection samples suffered from low library concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) and higher read duplication rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Analysis of an agricultural field metagenome dynamics over 1.5 months</title><p id="P13">To assess air metagenome dynamics over multiple weeks in an in-field scenario we collected air for 60 minutes three times a week, in duplicate, between the 12<sup>th</sup> June and 29<sup>th</sup> July at the same coordinates (52°37’21.1”N, 1°13’02.6”E) as used for the collection time-series experiment.

We benchmarked our Air-seq workflow assessing its quantitative ability and accuracy. When releasing <italic>B. thuringiensis</italic> spores in a wind tunnel (i.e. a confined environment) we found Air-seq to quantitatively increase <italic>Bacillus</italic> counts with increasing spore release while not detecting any <italic>Bacillus</italic> in the no-spore controls. This agrees well with results obtained by Lynggard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] and Clare et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] showing the high accuracy of air eDNA profiling methods in zoos - areas with a well described environment.</p><p id="P25">We found air sampling time to be an important variable determining the genus richness of a sample. In an in-field experiment, we collected air for increasing amounts of time from 5 minutes to 120 minutes consecutively on the same day, observing that longer collections increase the number of observed genera in samples. We successfully prepared and sequenced libraries from 5 and 10 minutes collection time detecting at least 9 and 6 genera in the samples, but found that sampling times ≥ 30 minutes are important to increase observed genus numbers to 28 and more. This agreed with the final library concentrations which also increased with the collection time. Tagmentase enzyme library preparation methods are described to produce higher final library yields with increasing DNA starting amounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. The results therefore indicate that with longer air sampling, more eDNA for library preparation is collected. For our experiments we decided to collect for a consecutive time of 60 minutes and so harvesting 12,000 litres of air at a flow rate of 200 litres per minute using the Coriolis Micro air sampler. We found that this is a convenient time-period using one battery charge of our device at which we were able to detect as many genera as for the 120 minute collection window. The collection time however can vary depending on the environment, the desired application (e.g. rapid air testing or continuous sampling) and on the air-sampling device used. Collection systems from other manufacturers filter air with higher rates than 200 litres per minute and so could reduce collection times (e.g. SASS 4100 Dry Air Sampler with over 4,000 litres per minute; Research International, Monroe, WA, USA).</p><p id="P26">To study air metagenome dynamics over time we collected air three times a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) between the 12<sup>th</sup> of June and 29<sup>th</sup> of July in an agricultural environment growing wheat, barley and pea. For this time-period we observed one viral (a double stranded DNA <italic>Lederbergvirus</italic> bacteriophage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]), 5 bacterial and 11 eukaryotic phyla. As the phyla with highest abundances we found the prokaryotes <italic>Actino</italic>- and <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, as well as the eukaryotic <italic>Arthropoda, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota</italic> and <italic>Streptophyta</italic>. Especially for eukaryotic phyla we observed temporal dynamics such as a higher number of genera during specific time-periods (e.g. <italic>Streptophyta</italic> at the beginning, <italic>Ascomycota</italic> at the end of our time-series) and varying counts over time (e.g. Arthropoda counts peaking on specific days, <italic>Ascomycota</italic> counts increasing towards the end of our sampling series). Among the characterised genera, we also found the genera of crops growing at our study site at high abundance. We observed 23 plant genera in total with the genus <italic>Hordeum</italic> (includes barley) and <italic>Triticum</italic> (includes wheat) as first and third-most abundant next to the genus <italic>Chenopodium</italic>. The high <italic>Chenopodium</italic> frequency can be explained with <italic>Chenopodium album</italic> being a major weed in wheat and barley crops in temperate and European regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] and so contributing to <italic>Chenopodium</italic> presence in the data.</p><p id="P27">We searched our Air-seq data for pathogen species using the host-pathogen information contained in the PHI-base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] database. We observed 131 of 271 PHI-base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] pathogens. Representative for the studied environment we counted 96 of 131 plant pathogens, but we also observed 13 human pathogens. Most pathogens that we detected were described to colonise main crops (e.g. potatoes, tomatoes, wheat, barley, pea) and relatives that are reported to be present in the agricultural area around Norwich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. In detail we found 13 wheat, 7 barley and 2 pea pathogen species.</p><p id="P28">Especially for the grass crops we observed important and devastating species such as the wheat and barley powdery mildew causing <italic>B. graminis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] and the wheat Septoria tritici blotch disease causing <italic>Z. tritici</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Powdery mildew (<italic>B. graminis</italic>) and septoria tritici blotch (<italic>Z. tritici</italic>) are among the most common diseases of wheat in the UK. We also detected <italic>U. hordei</italic> as the most abundant barley pathogen. <italic>U. hordei</italic> is the cause of covered smut of barley and common in the UK. Similar to <italic>B. graminis</italic> and <italic>Z. tritici, its</italic> finding at high levels in Air-seq samples therefore can be anticipated and also demonstrates how crops are threatened for a prolonged period for the duration of flowering when they are most susceptible to infection. Among the most abundant wheat pathogens we further found <italic>P. tritici-repentis</italic> and <italic>Parastagonospora nodorum. P. tritici-repentis</italic> and <italic>P. nodorum</italic> respectively, cause tan spot and Septoria nodorum blotch of wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. The former disease is becoming more common, particularly in warmer, southern parts of the country. The latter disease was once common in the UK but has been very largely replaced by Septoria tritici blotch caused by <italic>Z. tritici</italic>. A PCR-based analysis of leaves of wheat in the UK found up to 100 % of samples to contain DNA of <italic>Z. tritici</italic> with 20 % and 30 %, respectively containing <italic>P. tritici-repentis</italic> or <italic>P. nodorum</italic> of samples to these pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. The detection of <italic>P. tritici-repentis</italic> and <italic>P. nodorum</italic> in the Air-seq samples indicates that these pathogens are present on alternative hosts from which spores are released and that could pose a threat to UK wheat crops if environmental conditions are conducive to infection.</p><p id="P29">We also observed multiple crop pathogenic <italic>Fusarium</italic> species. We detected <italic>Fusarium asiaticum</italic> at highest levels among the detected <italic>Fusarium</italic> species<italic>, which</italic> in its distribution has not been reported in Europe to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. However, genomes of species of the <italic>Fusarium</italic> complex are closely related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] and when carefully controlling reads assigned to <italic>Fusarium asiaticum</italic> using online BLAST searches, we found equally good hits to multiple <italic>Fusarium</italic> species. This although the BWA-MEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] algorithm assigned the 95 %-identity and 95 %-match length filtered reads uniquely to <italic>F. asiaticum</italic> species. It is therefore possible that some of the signals interpreted as coming from these species actually arise from other <italic>Fusarium</italic> isolates that share similarities with <italic>F. asiaticum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>].</p><p id="P30">We could relate pathogen frequencies to weather events. We observed multiple fungal crop pathogen species to coincide with elevated humidity and rainfall. This is interesting as the release of ascospores from perithecia is associated with periods of high humidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. We also found several fungal pathogens to coincide well with the measured wind speed. As fungal spores can spread by wind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], this could indicate the dispersal of spores either from or to our measurement location. Although humidity and wind speeds showed strong positive correlations with pathogen levels, we did not observe similar trends for the measured average daily temperature.</p><p id="P31">Among the most devastating wheat diseases threatening food production globally are three rusts: <italic>Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici</italic> (stem rust), <italic>Puccinia triticina</italic> (leaf rust) and <italic>Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici</italic> (stripe rust) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. Indicating the efficacy of Air-seq in detecting diseases we observed low abundances of <italic>P. striiformis</italic> and <italic>P. graminis</italic> on selected days of our sampling time-series. The detection of <italic>P. graminis</italic> in the Air-seq samples is of particular significance. Stem rust, caused by this pathogen, has been absent from the UK for almost 60 years, but was again observed on a single plant in 2013. Since this time there have been additional reports of stem rust caused by this pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. This indicates that the pathogen may not be uncommon and suggests that the relative rarity of stem rust may have been due to environmental factors not being conducive to infection. We also found that some reads mapped to the <italic>P. triticina</italic> genome with a %-identity and %-match score ≥ 95 %, however, at an abundance that was too low to pass the threshold of 0.05 % for classification.</p><p id="P32">Strain level epidemiology is important to monitor and measure disease threats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. While <italic>de novo</italic> identification of strains using metagenomics is challenging, requiring good coverage rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>], we hypothesised that comparison of nucleotide variants to an established database will allow detailed insights into the presence of pathogen strains at a shallow sequencing depth. Strain profiling using Air-seq methods would therefore enable a scenario where pathogens newly observed in the air can be rapidly evaluated for pathogenicity. A suitable reference dataset for <italic>P. striiformis f. sp. tritici</italic> (PST) strain characterisation has been established in 2013 by Hubbard et al., containing 39 PST UK isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. The study was performed close to our sampling area. PST is widespread across the western hemisphere and in the past new strains emerged with expanded virulence profiles and higher aggressiveness able to overcome resistance genes in e.g. European germplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>].

After quality filtering (%-identity and %-matched-sequence cutoff ≥ 95 for mapped reads, quality threshold &gt; 20 for variant filtering, &gt; 20 depth), we found 20 of 478 variants in our Air-seq data that could be uniquely assigned to a single isolate and so distinguish between PST genotypes. Most of the unique SNPs overlapped with the 13/123 PST strain sampled in Lincolnshire by Hubbard et al.

The detection of multiple taxa in air samples tractable to agricultural environments and more importantly the observation of agricultural pathogens colonising the plant species growing at our field site underlines the value of airborne environmental DNA methods. Moreover, the accuracy that we found - with air metagenomics able to detect temporal and weather dependent occurrence patterns as well as to type pathogen species and strains - highlights the value of airborne eDNA in monitoring biodiversity changes and tracking of taxa of human interest or concern.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Air sampling</title><p id="P35">Air samples were collected using the Coriolis Micro Microbial Air sampler (Bertin Instruments, Montigny le Bretonneux, France) with its tripod fully extended. During sampling we set a flow rate of 200 l/minute for a total of 60 minutes with 10 ml 0.05 % (v/v) Triton X-100 (T8787-50ML, Merck Sigma Aldrich) as collection buffer prepared with UltraPure DNase/RNase free, distilled water (10977023, Invitrogen). After collection we transferred the buffer to a 15 ml conical tube and stored the collected sample at −20 °C until processing. We observed that the collection buffer evaporated during collection to a volume range of 3.5 (on warm days) – 8 ml. To avoid drying of the collection buffer while sampling on especially hot days we topped-up the solution during sampling by briefly stopping air collection, adding 10 ml fresh collection buffer and then continuing with sampling until the 60 minute collection mark was reached (buffer top-up takes approximately one minute).

We discarded the flowthrough of the PVDF membrane and transferred the membrane immediately after filtration to a 0.7 mm Garnet particle containing tube (13123-50, MoBio – now QIAGEN PowerBead) using sterile tweezers. We immediately added 500 μl UltraPure DNase/RNase free, distilled water to the membrane and ground the reaction for 10 minutes on the TissueLyser II (Qiagen) at 32 Hz. We transferred the supernatant of the grinding step (approximately 300 μl) to a 1.5 ml conical tube and proceeded with DNA purification. DNA purification was performed using the GenFind V2 kit (A41497, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences) according to the standard protocol but with two minor modifications: Our starting volume was 300 μl instead of the 200 μl as in the standard protocol. We therefore adjusted (i.e. increased) the volumes of the buffer solutions as described in the GenFind V2 Blood &amp; Serum protocol (PN B66719AB) for 300 μl starting volume and we reduced the elution buffer volume to 10 μl UltraPure DNase/RNase free, distilled water - in brief: we prepared 450 μl binding buffer (1.5 x sample volume) by combining 440 μl magnetic particle free GenFind V2 Binding Buffer with 10 μl of GenFind V2 Binding Buffer containing magnetic particles. We added the binding buffer to the 300 μl lysate and mixed well. We incubated the reaction for 5 minutes at room temperature, briefly centrifuged the reaction using a table-top centrifuge and pelleted the beads on a magnetic stand. We washed the reaction using 500 μl GenFind V2 Wash Buffer 1, re-pelleted the beads on a magnetic stand and washed the reaction using 500 μl GenFind V2 Wash Buffer 2. We pelleted the beads on a magnetic stand, discarded the supernatant and eluted the extracted DNA in 10 μl water. The extracted DNA was not quantified as DNA amounts were below the detection limit of Qubit 2.0 High Sensitivity reagents (Q32581, Thermo Fisher).

We incubated the reaction for 5 minutes at 55 °C in a G-Storm GS1 (G-Storm) thermal cycler and after incubation added 5 μl Buffer PB (19066, QIAGEN) to inactivate and strip the transposase from the tagmented DNA. We cleaned the reaction using 10 μl (1 x ratio) AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and eluted the reaction in 20 μl UltraPure DNase/RNase free, distilled water.
