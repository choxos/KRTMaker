We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 exposure among 79 rats captured from NYC during the fall of 2021. Results showed that 13 of 79 rats (16.5%) tested IgG or IgM positive, and partial genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were recovered from four rats that were qRT-PCR positive. Using a virus challenge study, we also showed that Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants can cause robust infections in wild-type Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, including high level replications in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and induction of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Additionally, the Delta variant resulted in the highest infectivity. In summary, our results indicated that rats are susceptible to infection with Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants, and rats in the NYC municipal sewer systems have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings highlight the potential risk of secondary zoonotic transmission from urban rats and the need for further monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in those populations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>rat</kwd><kwd>surveillance</kwd><kwd>infection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">As of October 10, 2022, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused approximately 621 million human cases and 6.6 million deaths globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). In addition to humans, a wide range of wild, domestic, and captive animals were documented with exposure to SARS-CoV-2, such as deer, mink, otters, ferrets, hamsters, gorillas, cats, dogs, lions, and tigers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 in farmed mink was shown to cause infections in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), highlighting mink as a potential reservoir for secondary zoonotic infections.</p><p id="P3">SARS-CoV-2 has undergone rapid evolution, and a large number of genetic variants have been identified, including several variants of concern (VOC), such as Alpha (B.1.1.7 lineage), Beta (B.1.351 lineage), Gamma (P.1 lineage), Delta (B.1.617.2 and AY sublineages) and Omicron (B.1.1.529 and BA sublineages). The Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants were reported to have acquired substitutions at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that allowed for infectivity in mice and/or rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The tropism expansion of SARS-CoV-2 raises a potential risk for reverse-zoonotic transmission of emerging variants into rodent species, including wild mouse and rat species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Two independent SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies among wild rats from sewage systems in Belgium (late fall of 2020) and Hong Kong (spring of 2021) suggested possible exposure of these animals to SARS-CoV-2, but no viral RNA was detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). With new SARS-CoV-2 variants continuing to emerge, it is still unknown whether the more recent variants of concern (e.g., Delta and Omicron) are infectious to rats.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we evaluated the capability of Delta and Omicron variants to infect rats (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>) and investigated the exposure of rats to SARS-CoV-2 in New York City (NYC), New York, United Sates.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus in NYC rats</title><p id="P5">To evaluate whether wild rats have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, we conducted SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in Norway rats (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>) in NYC from September 13-November 16, 2021, when the Delta variant was predominant in humans. A total of 79 rats inhabiting three sampling sites in Brooklyn, NYC were captured and sampled. Using ELISA, we identified 9 out of 79 (11.4%) IgG-positive rat serum samples and 4 IgM-positive samples (5.1%) against both Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein and RBD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). All 13 seropositive samples were subjected to microneutralization assays against the B.1 lineage and the Alpha and Delta variants. However, all samples were negative for neutralizing antibodies. As a negative control, we used ELISA to examine 9 negative serum samples from uninfected SD rats and 6 serum samples from SD rats infected with rat coronaviruses, Sialodacryoadenitis Virus or Parker’s Rat Coronavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>); none exhibited IgG or IgM positivity against either spike protein or RBD (Data not shown).</p><p id="P6">Of all the tissues analyzed from the 79 rats, only four lung samples were positive by qRT-PCR against both N1 and N2 primers using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic panel (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The control group with RNA from 6 different strains of rat coronaviruses remained negative. It is noteworthy that two out of these four rats (Rat #2 and #19) were both seropositive and viral RNA-positive. In addition, we had seven inconclusive samples which were tested positive on either N1 or N2 primer but not both. However, viruses failed to be recovered from Vero E6, 293FT/hACE2+TMPRSS, rat lung epithelial (L2), or rat lung tracheal epithelial cell lines.</p><p id="P7">After subjecting these four qRT-PCR-positive samples to SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing, partial SARS-CoV-2 genome was identified in all samples with a viral genome coverage of 1.6% to 21.3% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Both molecular characterization and phylogenetic analyses on these partial genomes suggested that viruses in these rats are associated with genetic lineage B, which was predominant in NYC in the spring of 2020 during the early pandemic period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">In addition, we subjected these four qRT-PCR-positive and two additional inconclusive samples to pan-viral target hybridization enrichment sequencing. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 sequences were found in three out of four sequenced qRT-PCR-positive samples (Rats# 2, 19, and 43) and one of two inconclusive samples (Rat# 38). No sequence data was obtained for the qRT-PCR-positive sample from Rat# 46. Of interest, rat coronavirus was detected in another inconclusive sample (Rat# 30) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). The identified SARS-CoV-2 or rat coronavirus reads aligned with a number of genes across the genomes.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Rats displayed varying susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 variants</title><p id="P9">The Alpha variant emerged in late 2020 and quickly became a dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in NYC; subsequently, the Delta and Omicron variants predominated in NYC starting in June 2021 and December 2021, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). To investigate whether these SARS-CoV-2 variants are capable of infecting rats, we intranasally challenged 6-week-old wild-type SD rats with Alpha, Delta, or Omicron variants and collected tissues at 2- and 4-days post-infection (dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, the Omicron variant used in the challenge study possesses the same N501Y substitution as the Alpha variant and 16 additional substitutions, whereas the Delta variant does not possess N501Y, but contains the L452R and T478K substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">At 2 and 4 dpi, high levels of viral RNA were detected in both turbinate and lungs, and infectious viral titers were detected in turbinate and/or lungs, although no body weight loss or other clinical signs were observed in the rats with any of the variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-F</xref>). In particular, the lungs from the rats infected with the Delta variant showed both the highest RNA copies and the highest infectious viral titers at 2 dpi (RNA copies: <italic>p</italic>=0.0081 and 0.0060 for Delta vs. Alpha and Delta vs. Omicron, respectively; infectious viral titers: <italic>p</italic>=0.0287 and 0.0283 for Delta vs. Alpha and Delta vs. Omicron, respectively). In addition, antigen expression was detected in the lungs of all rats infected with any variant at 2 or 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). In line with the viral titers, the rats infected with the Delta variant showed the highest antigen expression in the lungs compared to those infected with other variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To assess the innate and adaptive immune response induced by the virus infection in rats, we determined the cytokine/chemokine expression in the lungs at 2 and 4 dpi and the antibody titers at 21 dpi. The results showed that all infections induced pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression (i.e., IFN-β, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, CCL-2, IP-10, IL-10) particularly at 2 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The expression of all the cytokines/chemokines induced by the Delta variant was higher than those induced by Alpha and/or Omicron variants.</p><p id="P12">Regarding the adaptive immune response, both IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were detected for all three variants at 21 dpi; however, IgM antibodies were not detected in any rats regardless of the variant used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). There was no significant difference between Alpha and Delta variants in the IgG antibody titers against Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein or RBD. However, Delta showed significantly higher anti-RBD IgG titers than Omicron. The homologous neutralizing antibody titers induced by the Delta variant were significantly higher than those induced by Alpha or Omicron (p=0.0441 and 0.0040, respectively). These results indicated that all the three variants can infect SD rats and induce innate and adaptive immune responses, and among these three variants, the Delta variant replicates more efficiently than the Alpha and Omicron variants in rats.</p><p id="P13">To detect potential host-adapted mutations, we sequenced the lung tissues from the rats challenged with Alpha, Delta, and Omicron. Results suggested there were no adapted amino acid substitutions along the RBDs across the three testing variants. However, N74K (N-terminal domain) on the spike protein was observed in all animals challenged by Alpha, and P681R (SD1/2) and D950N (heptapeptide repeat sequence 1) of spike in all animals challenged by Delta (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). In addition, additional amino acid substitutions in non-structural proteins NSP6, NSP13, and nucleoprotein were observed in some animals challenged by Alpha or Delta. Of interest, no adapted mutations were observed in the animals challenged by Omicron.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Structural modeling between RBD of SARS-CoV-2 variants and rat, mouse, and human ACE2</title><p id="P14">To explain the relative replication efficiency of the three SARS-CoV-2 viruses in SD rats, we computationally modeled the interaction between rat ACE2 and RBD from Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), as virus-receptor interaction is often an important virulence determinant. In our structural models, residue 452 does not directly engage with rat ACE2, but it is surrounded by a large number of residues nearby (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Therefore, the L452R mutation in the Delta variant could alter the structure conformation of the adjacent ß-strand at the ACE2 interface and thus indirectly modulate ACE2 binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Indeed, in vitro binding assays indicated that the RBD of the Delta variant, which has L452R/T478K double mutations, binds rat ACE2 with a &gt;2-fold stronger affinity than RBD of the prototype virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The enhanced binding of the Delta RBD to rat ACE2 is likely due to L452 alone, because residue 478 is distant from other amino acids, and T478K was found to have no significant effect on binding to mouse ACE2, which is a close homolog of rat ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). The Alpha variant also replicates well in rats but is slightly less efficient than Delta. Our structure model shows that the single mutation N501Y in Alpha RBD makes a favorable interaction with H353 in the rat ACE2, with the aromatic side chain of Y501 stacked against the side chain of H453 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). In vitro binding assays confirmed that the Alpha RBD binds rat ACE2 with a &gt;2-fold stronger affinity than RBD of the prototype virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), consistent with our structural analysis.</p><p id="P15">The Omicron variant has many mutations in its RBD compared to the prototype virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Among these mutations, eight are located near the ACE2 binding interface, including residues 405, 452, 477, 478, 486, 498, 501, and 505. Close inspection of these residues shows favorable interactions by residues R452, N477, R498, Y501, and H505 compared to their corresponding ones in the prototype strain. Residues D405 and K478 are somewhat distant from ACE2, while V486 appears to weaken the interaction with rat ACE2 compared to F486 in other SARS-CoV-2 viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Taken together, the Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants seem to have enhanced binding to the rat ACE2 compared to the prototype virus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Both serological and molecular data from this study suggested the rats from NYC were exposed to SARS-CoV-2. We found that of the tested rats, 16.5% were seropositive and 5.1% were qRT-PCR positive to SARS-CoV-2, which showed a higher exposure frequency than previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Genomic analyses suggested that the viruses in the rats that we collected were associated with the B lineage virus. We speculate SARS-CoV-2 exposure could have occurred during the early stages of the pandemic when the B lineage virus was predominant in NYC. This is supported by a recent study that reported that the Wuhan-Hu-1-like virus can infect SD rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), although an earlier study showed that the prototype Wuhan-Hu-1-like SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect SD rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Such a discrepancy may be due to variation in additional mutations in the challenge Wuhan-Hu-1-like strains or genetic variations in the SD rats used in these studies. Thus, further surveillance is needed to understand the virological prevalence in NYC rats, particularly for several emerging variants with high infectivity among rats, including those that circulated in NYC during the past two years of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p id="P18">A number of studies suggested that fragments of SARS-CoV-2 genomes were identified in sewage water systems, and that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage water systems coincides with outbreaks in resident human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). However, no evidence has shown that SARS-CoV-2 viruses in sewage water is infectious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), suggesting that sewage rats may have been exposed to the virus through unknown fomites, e.g. those contaminated with human food wastes. In a recent study, Zeiss et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) showed that, in a controlled laboratory setting studying transmission of another rat respiratory beta coronavirus, SDAV, approximately one-quarter of naïve rats shed virus following fomite exposure. Notably, previously exposed seropositive rats became reinfected with SDAV at similar rates following fomite exposure 114-165 days later, indicating that immunity is temporary. Two of four rats (Rat #2 and #19) in our study were both seropositive and viral RNA-positive, implying that previously exposed seropositive animals may still contract and shed SARS-CoV-2, consistent with lack of sterilizing immunity in humans exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or rats given SDAV. These data imply that rats previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 can still contribute to propagation of subsequent variants.</p><p id="P19">By using animal models, we further demonstrated that, in addition to Alpha and Beta variants reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), Delta and Omicron variants can also cause robust infections in SD rats. The tested variants caused robust replication in both upper and lower respiratory tracts of rats, although they did not cause any body weight loss or other clinical signs. Of the three testing variants, Delta replicated the most efficiently. The omicron variant showed a lower viral replication than both Alpha and Delta, although the difference did not reach a statistically significant level between Omicron and Alpha. This finding is in line with earlier reports that Omicron replicated less efficiently and caused less lung pathology in wildtype or human ACE2 transgenic mice or hamsters compared with other variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Structural modeling showed that all three variants Alpha, Delta and Omicron have enhanced binding to the rat ACE2 compared to the prototype Wuhan-Hu-1-like virus. In light of the biochemical data that Alpha and Delta RBDs bind to rat ACE2 equally well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), the difference in the replication efficiency of the three viruses could be due to factors other than receptor binding affinity. It is also interesting to note that many RBD mutations observed in the three variants, such as N501Y in Alpha and L452R/T478K in Delta, interact with ACE2 residues that vary between human and rat/mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Therefore, rats and mouse likely play an important role in the evolution of Alpha, Delta, Omicron variants, as previously proposed by Zhang et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In addition to receptor binding, a number of other studies suggested that other structural and non-structural proteins may play a critical role in the viral replication <italic>in vivo</italic> and the host tropism of SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Syed et al. showed that, despite envelope protein substitutions inhibiting virus assembly, Omicron has an overall higher assembly efficiency than the original SARS-CoV-2, similar to Delta variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Bojkova et al. showed that the Omicron variant is less effective in antagonizing the interferon response and has higher sensitivity in interferon treatment than the Delta variant which may be relevant with the substitutions on NSP3, NSP12, NSP13, nucleocapsid, and ORF3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Of interest, Omicron did not have any observed amino acid substitutions throughout the course of virus challenge in SD rats, whereas Alpha and Delta did for spike, nucleoprotein, or non-structural proteins NSP6 and NSP13. The roles of these amino acid substitutions on virus fitness needs to be further studied.</p><p id="P22">In summary, we found that the rats in NYC sewage system have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and that the Delta and Omicron variants can infect rats in addition to the Alpha and Beta variants. Our findings highlight the potential risk of secondary zoonotic transmission from rats and the need for further monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in wild rat populations.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Cells</title><p id="P23">Vero E6 cells (CRL-1586, American Type Culture Collection [ATCC]) and 293FT/hACE2+TMPRSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

reverse-zoonotic transmission of emerging variants into rodent species, including wild rat species. In this study, we presented both genetic and serological evidence for SARS-CoV-2 exposure in wild rat population from New York City, and these viruses are potentially linked to the viruses during the early stages of the pandemic. We also demonstrated that rats are susceptible to additional variants (i.e., Alpha, Delta, and Omicron) predominant in humans and that the susceptibility to different variants vary. Our findings highlight the potential risk of secondary zoonotic transmission from urban rats and the need for further monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in those populations.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing in wild rats.</title><p>(A) SARS-CoV-2 genomes found in rats in comparison with reference wild-type virus and variants of concern.
