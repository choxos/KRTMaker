(2011)</xref>). In leaves of C<sub>4</sub> plants, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is initially fixed by Phopsho<italic>enol</italic>pyruvate Carboxylase (PEPC) in mesophyll (M) cells into a 4-carbon acid (malate/aspartate). These C<sub>4</sub> acids then move to bundle sheath (BS) cells for decarboxylation to produce pyruvate and CO<sub>2</sub>. Pyruvate is transferred back to the mesophyll cells where it is reduced to phospho<italic>enol</italic>pyruvate that can accept another HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> molecule. This spatial separation of carboxylation and decarboxylation between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells builds a high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in bundle sheath cells and in so doing limits the oxygenation side-reaction of RuBisCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hatch, 1987</xref>). This greatly increases photosynthesis efficiency, particularly in hot and dry environments.</p><p id="P7">Efficient exchange of metabolites between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells is therefore crucial to the C<sub>4</sub> pathway and as a consequence compared with the ancestral C<sub>3</sub> condition C<sub>4</sub> leaves are typically reconfigured in both biochemistry and structure. Most C<sub>4</sub> plants have Kranz anatomy - with closely spaced veins and a wreath-like, concentric arrangement of enlarged bundle sheath cells surrounding mesophyll cells that maximises mesophyll-bundle sheath contact sites (Sedelnikova et al., 2018). Kranz anatomy is associated with increased cell-to-cell connectivity between the mesophyll and bundle sheath cells to allow the efficient exchange of metabolites. Metabolite exchange between the two cell types is proposed to occur via passive diffusion through plasmodesmata down a steep concentration gradient of C<sub>4</sub> metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hatch, 1987</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Plasmodesmata are regulated channels between adjacent plant cells and diverse in structure: from simple (with single openings in adjacent cells) to complex (highly branched with central cavities), or even asymmetric in their organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ross-Elliott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Faulkner, 2018</xref>). Plasmodesmata contain several structural components including a narrow tube of endoplasmic reticulum called the desmotubule, the cytoplasmic sleeve and the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Faulkner, 2018</xref>). Plasmodesmata are considered essential for cell-to-cell transport of metabolites in many C<sub>4</sub> grasses because suberized bundle sheath cell walls likely reduce CO<sub>2</sub> leakage by blocking apoplastic metabolite transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hatch and Osmond, 1976</xref>). Furthermore, C<sub>4</sub> grasses possess increased numbers of plasmodesmata between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Evert et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Botha et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Danila et al., 2016</xref>). As plasmodesmata occur in clusters (pitfields), increased cell-to-cell connectivity in C<sub>4</sub> leaves can be a result of increased pit field area or increased numbers of plasmodesmata per pit field area. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Danila et al. (2016)</xref> observed up to 9-fold increase in plasmodesmal frequency at the mesophyll-bundle sheath interface in C<sub>4</sub> maize and <italic>Setaria viridis</italic> compared with the C<sub>3</sub> species rice and wheat. This increase in the C<sub>4</sub> grasses was due to a 2-fold increase in plasmodesmata numbers per pitfield, and a 5-fold increase in pitfield area. In other C<sub>4</sub> grasses substantial variation in absolute plasmodesmata frequency was evident but they all possessed greater plasmodesmata frequency than C<sub>3</sub> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Danila et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To our knowledge, the distribution of plasmodesmata at the mesophyll-bundle sheath cell interface of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species has not been studied outside the grasses. Further, the cues that underpin increased plasmodesmata formation are not known. Given the known variation in how increased cell-to-cell connectivity is achieved in C<sub>4</sub> grasses and the fact that they evolved C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis independently from C<sub>4</sub> dicotyledenous lineages, we assessed plasmodesmata distribution in leaves of C<sub>3</sub> <italic>Tarenaya hassleriana</italic> and C<sub>4</sub> <italic>Gynandropsis gynandra</italic> that both belong to the <italic>Cleomaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Marshall et al., 2007</xref>) which is sister to the <italic>Brassicaceae. G. gynandra</italic> has been developed as a C<sub>4</sub> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Marshall et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Koteyeva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bräutigam et al., 2011</xref>). We discovered that plasmodesmal frequency is up to 8-fold higher at the mesophyll-bundle sheath cell interface in mature leaves of C<sub>4</sub> <italic>G. gynandra</italic> compared with that in C<sub>3</sub> species. Moreover, these increased numbers of plasmodesmata are rapidly established during de-etiolation. Pharmacological studies using multiple chloroplast inhibitors demonstrated that light, functional chloroplasts and photosynthesis are required to initiate plasmodesmata formation at mesophyll-bundle sheath cell interface of <italic>G. gynandra</italic>. Provision of exogenous sucrose can rescue defects in chloroplasts and photosynthesis. We conclude that increased plasmodesmatal connection is likely an unifying feature of all two-celled C<sub>4</sub> plants, and that during the evolution of the C<sub>4</sub> pathway the increased formation of secondary plasmodesmata is induced by the induction of photosynthesis itself.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Plant Material and growth conditions</title><p id="P10"><italic>G. gynandra</italic> and <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> seeds were germinated on wet filter papers in petri dishes.

Plasmodesmata numbers and cell lengths were determined using ImageJ software. Plasmodesmata were defined as dark channels in the EM images.

Plasmodesmata were more abundant between mesophyll and bundle cells in C<sub>4</sub> <italic>G. gynandra</italic> compared with both C<sub>3</sub> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Increased physical connectivity was specific to this interface, and no obvious increases were detected at the mesophyll-mesophyll or bundle sheath-bundle sheath cell interfaces in any species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information Fig. S1</xref>).</p><p id="P21">To quantify plasmodesmata numbers between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, we conducted serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM). SBF-SEM offers excellent resolution in 3D and has previously been used to quantify plasmodesmata in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ross-Elliott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Paterlini and Belevich, 2022</xref>). Thin sections prepared from fully expanded true leaves of <italic>G. gynandra</italic>, <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> were imaged, and an area of the mesophyll-bundle sheath cell interface identified for serial block face sectioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-c</xref>). From each species, between 281-438 serial transverse sections per mesophyll-bundle sheath cell interface were collected and compiled into videos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supporting Information Videos S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">3</xref>). Using these SBF-SEM sections we quantified plasmodesmata frequency by determining the number of plasmodesmata per length of mesophyll-bundle sheath cell interface imaged in 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In C<sub>4</sub> <italic>G. gynandra</italic>, plasmodesmata were visible in almost every mesophyll-bundle sheath cell interface assessed such that only 20 out of 467 contained no plasmodesmata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In contrast, in the two C<sub>3</sub> species plasmodesmata were not detected in the majority of interfaces (263/367 for <italic>T. hassleriana</italic>, 628/886 for <italic>A. thaliana</italic>). Because plasmodesmata appear in clusters (pitfields) rather than being equally distributed, a wide range of plasmodesmal frequencies per section were observed between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells in all three species. However, there were more sections with higher frequencies observed at the mesophyll-bundle sheath interface of C<sub>4</sub> <italic>G. gynandra</italic>, and this resulted in a 13-fold increase in the mean frequency compared with C<sub>3</sub> <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> and C<sub>3</sub> <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Plasmodesmal frequencies between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of the C<sub>3</sub> species <italic>T. hassleriana and A. thaliana</italic> were not significantly different to each other and were low compared with C<sub>4</sub> <italic>G. gynandra</italic>.</p><p id="P22">SBF-SEM provides an excellent 3D view of plasmodesmata frequency and distribution but is relatively low throughput and so limited numbers of cell interfaces can be visualised per unit time. We therefore used 2D electron microscopy to further explore the high occurrence of plasmodesmata at the mesophyll-bundle sheath cell interface of C<sub>4</sub> <italic>G. gynandra</italic>. Large areas of leaf sections were imaged at high resolution using 2D Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) mapping such that automated serial imaging at 10,000X magnification and subsequent image stitching enabled visualization of plasmodesmata at numerous interfaces of the same 2D section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Representative SEM maps in which cell interfaces (mesophyll-bundle sheath, mesophyll-mesophyll and bundle sheath-bundle sheath) were pseudocoloured according to plasmodesmal frequency, and consistent with the 3D SBF-SEM analysis reported above, illustrated that plasmodesmata were specifically enriched at the mesophyll-bundle sheath interface of C<sub>4</sub> <italic>G. gynandra</italic> (indicated by the numerous green-coloured interfaces). In contrast, frequency was lower and more uniform between all cellular interfaces in the C<sub>3</sub> species (indicated by the pink and orange pseudocoloured cell interfaces) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Plasmodesmata frequencies were quantified from at least three SEM maps originating from three independent plants (biological replicates; 10-40 individual mesophyll – bundle sheath, mesophyll-mesophyll and bundle sheath-bundle sheath cell interfaces per biological replicate). This showed that plasmodesmata numbers between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells were more than 8-fold higher in C<sub>4</sub> <italic>G. gynandra</italic> compared with both C<sub>3</sub> species. The three cellular interfaces (mesophyll-bundle sheath, mesophyll-mesophyll and bundle sheath-bundle sheath) in both C<sub>3</sub> species had similar plasmodesmal frequencies. Interestingly, plasmodesmal frequency of all three types of cell interface in <italic>G. gynandra</italic> was significantly higher than that of the corresponding interface in each of the two C<sub>3</sub> species. For example, the mesophyll-mesophyll and bundle sheath-bundle sheath interfaces were approximately 3 to 4-fold and 2-fold higher in C<sub>4</sub> <italic>G. gynandra</italic> compared with <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> respectively indicating that cell-to-cell connectivity is generally enhanced between photosynthetic cells of the C<sub>4</sub> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Plasmodesmata frequencies estimated from analysis of numerous mesophyll-bundle sheath cell interfaces using this 2D SEM mapping were not statistically different from the frequencies obtained from multiple serial sections of the mesophyll-bundle sheath interface using SBF-SEM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information Fig. 2</xref>). To allow greater replication and sampling subsequent analysis was therefore carried out with the 2D SEM mapping technique.</p><p id="P23">To investigate the relationship between increased frequency of plasmodesmata at the mesophyll-bundle sheath interface and pit fields, we visualized pitfields using SEM by tearing critical point dried mature leaves as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Danila et al.

Pitfields were clearly visible at the mesophyll-bundle sheath interface in all species, but unlike the previous work in grasses individual plasmodesmata within the pitfields could not be distinguished (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information Fig. 3a</xref>). When we measured the mean area of pitfields in each species there was no clear difference. This suggests that the increased plasmodesmata frequency at mesophyll-bundle sheath in <italic>G. gynandra</italic> most likely results from increased pit field numbers per cell interface rather than enlarged pit fields that contain more plasmodesmata (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information Fig. 3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Increased plasmodesmal frequency between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of C<sub>4</sub> <italic>G. gynandra</italic> is established after exposure to light</title><p id="P24">Induction of the photosynthetic apparatus associated with the C<sub>4</sub> pathway, such as chloroplast development and C<sub>4</sub> gene expression typically occurs rapidly in response to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Shen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Singh et al., 2021</xref>).

Cross sections of cotyledons showed that Kranz anatomy was already partially developed in 3-day-old dark grown seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). For example, veins were closely spaced, and bundle sheath cells contained abundant organelles. However, after 24 h of light cotyledons had almost doubled in size and substantial cell expansion and formation of air spaces was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). High-resolution 2D SEM maps from cross sections of at least three cotyledons (biological replicates) of <italic>G. gynandra</italic> were obtained at 0 h, 24 h and 48 h after transfer to light. In dark-grown seedlings plasmodesmal frequency at mesophyll-bundle sheath, mesophyll-mesophyll, and bundle sheath-bundle sheath were similar (n = 204) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). However, after light induction plasmodesmal frequency increased 1.7-fold after 24 h and 2.5-fold after 48 h between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of <italic>G. gynandra</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b-d</xref>). There was also a small increase in plasmodesmata numbers between mesophyll cells after light exposure. These responses were specific to de-etiolation because growth in the dark for 48 h did not increase plasmodesmata numbers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information Fig. 4a-d</xref>). These data indicate that as with true leaves, cotyledons of <italic>G. gynandra</italic> develop high plasmodesmal connectivity between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, and that this takes place rapidly in response to light. We conclude that light is a crucial developmental cue for the formation of secondary plasmodesmata at the mesophyll-bundle sheath interface in the C<sub>4</sub> plant <italic>G. gynandra</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Functional chloroplasts are required for light-induced formation of plasmodesmata between the mesophyll and bundle sheath</title><p id="P25">De-etiolation involves the transition from skotomorphogenic to photomorphogenic growth whereby fully photosynthetic chloroplasts develop from etioplasts within hours of light exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Pipitone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Singh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cackett et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the increase in plasmodesmal connectivity between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells during de-etiolation is either a direct response to light or is triggered by signals from the chloroplast or photosynthesis. To investigate this, we used inhibitors with distinct modes of action to perturb chloroplast function. Lincomycin and norflurazon block plastid translation and carotenoid biosynthesis respectively and so stop the development of chloroplasts from etioplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mulo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chamovitz et al., 1991</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). DCMU [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea] blocks the electron transport chain at Photosystem II (PSII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Trebst, 2007</xref>) and thus inhibits photosynthesis directly. Seedlings were grown with and without each inhibitor and transferred to light for 48 h. Lincomycin- and DCMU-treated seedlings had pale yellow cotyledons indistinguishable from non-treated controls. Norflurazon treatment generated seedlings with white cotyledons, consistent with compromised carotenoid accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Etioplast ultrastructure was largely unaffected by the inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). After 48 h of light cotyledons of controls and DCMU-treated seedlings were green and etioplasts had developed into chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Norflurazon and lincomycin-treated seedlings had pale cotyledons even after light induction and the etioplast-to-chloroplast development was arrested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). To confirm that each inhibitor had the expected effect on chloroplast function we used chlorophyll fluorescence imaging to quantify <italic>F<sub>v</sub></italic>/<italic>F<sub>m</sub></italic> which provides a read-out for the maximum quantum efficiency of Photosystem II. Each inhibitor drastically reduced <italic>F<sub>v</sub></italic>/<italic>F<sub>m</sub></italic> compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>). Norflurazon-treated seedlings were not visible on the chlorophyll fluorescence imager as chlorophyll content was too low.</p><p id="P26">Using 2D SEM maps we quantified plasmodesmal frequency in nearly 1200 independent cell interfaces (549 interfaces for the 0 h time point, 649 interfaces for the 48 h time point). None of the three inhibitors affected plasmodesmal frequency at any cell interface in dark-grown seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e-g</xref>). However, despite cotyledon expansion being unaffected by the inhibitors during de-etiolation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information Fig. 5a</xref>) plasmodesmal frequencies did not increase significantly in seedlings treated with norflurazon, lincomycin or DCMU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e-g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information Fig. 5b</xref>). In summary, inhibitors that perturbed the etioplast-to-chloroplast transition or blocked photosynthetic electron transport, reduced light-induced plasmodesmata formation between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of C<sub>4</sub> <italic>G. gynandra</italic>. We conclude that chloroplast function, and in particular photosynthetic electron transport, play important roles in controlling the formation of secondary plasmodesmata in the C<sub>4</sub> leaf.</p><p id="P27">The inhibitory effect of DCMU on plasmodesmata formation could be associated with signaling from a dysfunctional photosynthetic electron transport chain, or because less photosynthate is produced. To test the latter hypothesis plants were grown on sucrose during DCMU treatment. No distinguishable effects on phenotype of the seedlings or etioplast-to-chloroplast development were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>) and provision of sucrose did not rescue the reduction in <italic>F<sub>v</sub></italic>/<italic>F<sub>m</sub></italic> caused by DCMU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). However, when we quantified plasmodesmal frequencies in a total of 1655 cell interfaces DCMU-treated seedlings supplemented with sucrose had plasmodesmal frequencies at the mesophyll-bundle sheath interface comparable to those in untreated seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>, p &gt; 0.05) indicating full rescue by sucrose of the DCMU-induced inhibition of plasmodesmata formation. Thus, when photosynthetic electron transport is inhibited, sucrose is sufficient to restore plasmodesmata formation at the mesophyll-bundle sheath cell interface of <italic>G. gynandra</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S13"><title>Increased plasmodesmata frequency is a conserved C<sub>4</sub> trait</title><p id="P28">A critical feature of the C<sub>4</sub> pathway is the spatial separation of biochemical processes such that CO<sub>2</sub> can be concentrated around RuBisCO. The consequence of this partitioning of photosynthesis is an absolute requirement for the exchange of metabolites between cell types. In C<sub>4</sub> grasses this has long been associated with increased plasmodesmal frequency between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Evert et al., 1977</xref>). Previous work quantified plasmodesmata frequency at the mesophyll-bundle sheath cell interface of <italic>G. gynandra</italic> and yielded comparable values for plasmodesmata frequencies as in our work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Koteyeva et al., 2014</xref>), but they did not quantify plasmodesmata in any other cell interface or compared plasmodesmal frequency with related C<sub>3</sub> species. Therefore, despite the very different leaf morphology between monocotyledons and dicotyledons, our results reveal that increased plasmodesmal connectivity between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells is likely a conserved trait among C<sub>4</sub> plants that separate photosynthesis between two cell types. In <italic>G. gynandra</italic>, the mesophyll-bundle sheath interfaces had 8-13-fold higher plasmodesmata frequency than those of the closely related C<sub>3</sub> species <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This increase is comparable to plasmodesmata numbers and distributions reported for C<sub>4</sub> grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Botha et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Danila et al., 2016</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Danila et al. (2018)</xref> further reported that C<sub>4</sub> grasses running the NAD-ME subtype of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis had the highest numbers of plasmodesmata between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. As <italic>G. gynandra</italic> also primarily uses NAD-ME to decarboxylate CO<sub>2</sub> in the bundle sheath, broader analysis of C<sub>4</sub> dicotyledons is required to determine the extent to which plasmodesmal frequencies correlate with the various biochemical sub-types.</p><p id="P29">Plasmodesmal frequencies at the mesophyll-bundle sheath interface of <italic>G. gynandra</italic> are consistent with those reported previously in this species where no analysis of closely related C<sub>3</sub> plants were possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Koteyeva et al., 2014</xref>). By quantifying plasmodesmata at all interface types and comparing plasmodesmal frequency with phylogenetically proximate C<sub>3</sub> plants we demonstrate that plasmodesmata numbers are generally higher at all three types of cell interface (mesophyll-bundle sheath, mesophyll-mesophyll, bundle sheath-bundle sheath) in C<sub>4</sub> <italic>G. gynandra</italic>. This is consistent with previous work that observed increased plasmodesmata frequencies between photosynthetic leaf cells in C<sub>4</sub> grasses compared with C<sub>3</sub> grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Danila et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Compared with C<sub>4</sub> grasses, a distinguishing feature of the increased plasmodesmal frequency between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of <italic>G. gynandra</italic> is that the increase was not associated with any detectable increase in pitfield area compared with C<sub>3</sub> <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> or C<sub>3</sub> <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information Fig. 2</xref>). This suggests that the primary mechanism for increased plasmodesmata numbers in <italic>G. gynandra</italic> is an increase in pitfields. Since we were not able to visualise individual plasmodesmata within pitfields, we cannot rule out that there is a higher frequency of individual plasmodesmata number within pitfields. However, we consider this is unlikely since pitfield appearance was largely similar between <italic>G. gynandra</italic>, <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> and A. thaliana (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information Fig. 2</xref>). In contrast, increased plasmodesmal frequency in C<sub>4</sub> grasses was accompanied by increases in pitfield area such that were up to 5 times greater than those in C<sub>3</sub> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Danila et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">2018</xref>). This difference suggests that the mechanisms by which increased plasmodesmata numbers between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells can vary between C<sub>4</sub> lineages.</p><p id="P31">Flux of metabolites between cells is likely to be determined by plasmodesmata number as increased numbers can facilitate greater flux. However, bundle sheath cells are not air-tight and plasmodesmata could also contribute to CO<sub>2</sub> leakiness such that a proportion of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrated in the bundle sheath diffuses back to the mesophyll. CO<sub>2</sub> leakiness particularly increases during photosynthetic induction in NADP-ME type C<sub>4</sub> plants such as sorghum and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, it is possible that plasmodesmata number and distribution need to be optimised to allow maximum photosynthetic efficiency in C<sub>4</sub> plants. Being able to accurately quantify plasmodesmal traits in diverse C<sub>4</sub> species may be crucial to develop further understanding in this area, and in particular in modelling metabolite flux through the C<sub>4</sub> pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Danila et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Von Caemmerer, 2021</xref>). This could incorporate recent models of metabolite diffusion through plasmodesmata such as the geometric and narrow escape models (Denim et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hughes et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Light triggers rapid plasmodesmata formation in pre-existing cell walls</title><p id="P32">In C<sub>4</sub> grasses the developmental cue that enhances plasmodesmata formation between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells is not known. However, <italic>Setaria viridis</italic> and maize show some plasticity in plasmodesmal density in response to growth irradiance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Danila et al., 2019</xref>). Our data provides a direct link between light and photosynthesis in establishing plasmodesmal frequency by showing that light rapidly triggers the formation of plasmodesmata at the mesophyll-bundle sheath interface in <italic>G. gynandra</italic>.</p><p id="P33">Plasmodesmata are either formed de novo during cell division by trapping ER strands between enlarging Golgi-derived vesicles in new cell walls (primary plasmodesmata) or formed in pre-existing cell walls (secondary plasmodesmata) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hepler, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ehlers and Kollmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Faulkner et al., 2008</xref>). We believe that the increase in plasmodesmata numbers between mesophyll and bundle sheath cell during dark to light transition is primarily driven by the formation of secondary plasmodesmata for the following reasons. Firstly, cotyledon growth from dark to light is thought to be exclusively driven by cell expansion and not cell division in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Tsukaya et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Stoynova-Bakalova et al., 2004</xref>). Secondly, the basic structure of bundle sheath cells was already formed in dark grown seedlings, and the formation of plasmodesmata was rapid. Our SEM mapping technique provided sufficient resolution to observe branching in plasmodesmata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), but interestingly we did not observe any structural differences between the plasmodesmata in different cell interfaces. Although primary and secondary plasmodesmata can be sometimes distinguished by structure, where secondary plasmodesmata are more branched, this is highly dependent on other factors such as leaf age and sink-source transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Roberts et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>A role for metabolism and organelles in formation of plasmodesmata</title><p id="P34">Our results suggest that chloroplasts, and more specifically photosynthesis, fuel the formation of secondary plasmodesmata between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells in C<sub>4</sub> <italic>G. gynandra</italic>. Inhibition of photosynthesis and chloroplast development through the application of inhibitors greatly reduced plasmodesmata formation during deetiolation but this effect could be rescued by the exogenous supply of sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). To our knowledge, a role of photosynthate in controlling formation of plasmodesmata has not been proposed previously. However, some findings are consistent with this hypothesis. For example, in rice constitutive overexpression of the C<sub>4</sub> maize <italic>GOLDEN2</italic>-<italic>LIKE</italic> transcription that controls chloroplast biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Waters et al., 2008</xref>) not only activated chloroplast and mitochondria development in bundle sheath cells but also increased plasmodesmata numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> links between organelles and plasmodesmata have been reported. <italic>A. thaliana</italic> mutants with altered cell-to-cell connectivity and/or plasmodesmata structure such INCREASED SIZE EXCLUSION LIMIT1 and 2 (ISE1/ISE2) encode mitochondrial and chloroplast RNA helicases respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kobayashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Stonebloom et al., 2009</xref>), while the GFP ARRESTED TRAFFICKING1 (GAT1) locus encodes a chloroplast thioredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Benitez-Alfonso et al., 2009</xref>). However, the mechanisms of how these organelle-localized proteins affect plasmodesmata formation are not understood. Retrograde signaling from chloroplast to nucleus has also been proposed to control plasmodesmata formation and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Burch-Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ganusova et al., 2020</xref>). The fact that exogenous supply of sucrose is sufficient to sustain plasmodesmata formation in the presence of DCMU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>) strongly suggests a direct metabolic role of chloroplasts in the enhanced formation of plasmodesmata in the C<sub>4</sub> leaf. This may involve sucrose or photosynthesis providing energy required for plasmodesmata formation, or sucrose acting as a signalling molecule to trigger plasmodesmata formation via sugar signalling. Further work is required to address how sugar controls plasmodesmata formation in <italic>G. gynandra</italic>. In summary, our work demonstrates that increased plasmodesmal connectivity is likely conserved trait found in both C<sub>4</sub> dicotyledons and monocotyledons. Moreover, the enhanced formation of plasmodesmata between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of C<sub>4</sub> leaves is coordinated and dependent on photosynthesis. Evolution therefore appears to have wired the enhanced formation of plasmodesmata in C<sub>4</sub> leaves to the development of chloroplasts and432 ultimately the induction of photosynthesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supporting Information Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS158468-supplement-Supporting_Information_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d21aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supporting Information Video 1</label><caption><title>Compiled video of sequential 50 nm sections of M-BS cell interface in mature leaves of C<sub>4</sub> <italic>G. gynandra</italic>.</title></caption><media xlink:href="EMS158468-supplement-Supporting_Information_Video_1.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d21aAdEcC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supporting Information Video 2</label><caption><title>Compiled video of sequential 50 nm sections of M-BS cell interface in mature leaves of C<sub>3</sub> <italic>T. hassleriana</italic>.</title></caption><media xlink:href="EMS158468-supplement-Supporting_Information_Video_2.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d21aAdEdC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supporting Information Video 3</label><caption><title>Compiled video of sequential 50 nm sections of M-BS cell interface in mature leaves of C<sub>3</sub> <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</title></caption><media xlink:href="EMS158468-supplement-Supporting_Information_Video_3.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d21aAdEeC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S16"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work was funded by the Advanced European Research Council (grant 694733 REVOLUTION to J.M.H.).
