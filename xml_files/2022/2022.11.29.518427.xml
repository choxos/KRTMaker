In this study, we generate a polyvalent lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA vaccine candidate for monkeypox virus (MPXV) and evaluate its immunogenicity in animal models. This polyvalent MPXV mRNA vaccine candidate, MPXVac-097, encodes five 2022 MPXV targets that are important surface antigens. Three-dose (prime-boost-booster) MPXVac-097 vaccination elicits strong antibody response to A35R and E8L antigens, moderate response to M1R, but not B6R or A29, highlighting the differences in immunogenicity. Bulk T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing reveals preferential usage of VJ combinations and clonal expansion of peripheral T cells after MPXVac-097 vaccination. These data demonstrate initial feasibility of developing MPXV mRNA vaccine and pave the way for its future optimization.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Monkeypox</kwd><kwd>mRNA vaccine</kwd><kwd>lipid nanoparticle</kwd><kwd>MPXVac-097</kwd><kwd>vaccinia virus</kwd><kwd>modified vaccinia Ankara</kwd><kwd>A35R</kwd><kwd>E8L</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">To date (August 28, 2022), the ongoing monkeypox outbreak has led to more than 47,000 confirmed cases and 12 deaths in over 90 countries. Because of its fast spread, world health organization declared the monkeypox outbreak a global public-health emergency on July 23<sup>rd</sup>. A retrospective study recently reported evidence of asymptomatic or undiagnosed monkeypox cases during early stage of monkeypox outbreak suggesting that asymptomatic cases fueled this epidemic, and symptom-based testing and quarantining may not suffice to contain monkeypox outbreak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In addition to testing and quarantining, an efficient measure to contain monkeypox virus (MPXV) transmission is the use of monkeypox vaccines for high-risk groups and close contacts of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. As the monkeypox outbreak grows rapidly, the demand for monkeypox vaccines surges drastically and many countries are facing the vaccine supply shortage.</p><p id="P3">Vaccination is the ultimate approach to prevent infectious disease outbreak from developing into a global pandemic. Replication-deficient modified vaccinia ankara (MVA) vaccine, JYNNEOS (commercial name in U.S., IMVANEX in Europe and IMVAMUNE in Canada) is the approved and preferred vaccine for monkeypox due to less side effects and contraindications compared to ACAM2000, which is a replication-competent vaccinia vaccine also available for use against monkeypox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The monkeypox vaccine in short supply is JYNNEOS, while ACAM2000 supply is abundant. However, the ACAM2000 vaccination is associated with unexpectedly high rate of myocarditis and pericarditis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, and can cause severe illness in immunocompromised patients. The authorization of JYNNEOS and ACAM2000 is based on 1) a phase 3 trial assessing neutralizing antibody response to vaccinia virus in vaccinees of MVA and ACAM2000<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>; and 2) a MPXV challenge experiment in macaques showing 100% protection after two doses of MVA or one dose of ACAM2000 injection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Although no data is currently available on the efficacy of either vaccine against 2022 MPXV in human, a series of clinical trials and cohort studies are underway to evaluate MVA vaccine’s efficacy, safety and protection durability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The 2022 MPXV variants causing the outbreak form the lineage B.1 branch that belongs to MPXV clade 3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Because of high sequence identity, immunity elicited by attenuated vaccinia vaccine can provide protection from monkeypox and smallpox. Both MPXV and vaccinia virus belong to Orthopoxvirus genus, which also includes variola virus, the pathogen of smallpox. Proteomic analysis of antibody response to MPXV infection and vaccinia vaccination revealed a number of immunodominant envelope proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Among them, vaccinia A27L<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, D8L<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, H3L<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, L1R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, A33R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and B5R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> have been identified as targets of neutralizing antibodies. Polyvalent DNA vaccines combining vaccinia antigens A27L, D8L, L1R, A33R and B5R protected macaques and mice from lethal MPXV challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The MPXV equivalent antigens of vaccinia A27L, D8L, L1R, A33R and B5R are A29L, E8L, M1R, A35R and B6R respectively. A number of important questions arise when exploring opportunities of developing a MPXV based vaccine. For example, how different are the MPXV and MVA antigens? Could an mRNA vaccine against MPXV elicit potent antibody response? Would an mRNA vaccine encoding these antigens be generally safe?</p><p id="P5">The mRNA vaccine technology has catalyzed the tremendous success of COVID mRNA vaccine, which has proven to be safe and effective across the globe in both initial clinical trials and real-world data. It is a versatile platform that can be adopted to develop mRNA vaccines against other infectious diseases, including monkeypox. Although MVA-based vaccine has less side effect than ACAM2000, its &gt;=3 grade adverse event rate is 7.7% in recipients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. In contrast, the &gt;=3 grade adverse event rate of COVID mRNA vaccine is similar to placebo group (1.5% in vaccine group vs. 1.3% in placebo group)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The MVA vaccine contains around 200 proteins, many of which are not immunogenic and likely associated with undesired side effects. Removal of undesired components in MPXV vaccines would improve its safety profile, which is the case for MVA that lost large fragments of genome during attenuation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Simplification of MPXV vaccine could facilitate rapid vaccine optimization. In addition, the manufacturing of mRNA vaccine can be achieved in vitro independent of complex cell culture as opposed to inactivated or attenuated vaccine; and is easily scalable by biochemical reactions. These features together make mRNA vaccine promising to enable the world to quickly fill the gap between vaccine supply and demand during a disease outbreak. The shortage of monkeypox vaccine and adaptability of mRNA vaccine prompt the idea of developing MPXV-targeting mRNA vaccine. However, whether the mRNA-based MPXV antigens can elicit significant immune response in vivo remains a critical question to be answered.</p><p id="P6">We designed a polyvalent mRNA vaccine candidate, MPXVac-097, against 2022 MPXV and initiated the testing of its antibody response as well as T cell receptor repertoire in vaccinated mice. Five MPXV antigens with prior evidence as neutralizing antibody targets, A29, E8L, M1R, A35R and B6R, were used in this vaccine design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). They were linked in tandem by 2A peptides and codon optimized based on the protein sequence of 2022 MPXV case identified in USA in May, 2022<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Their sequence alignment with homologs of MVA showed over 90% sequence identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), and identified dozens of species-specific residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). M1R antigen is largely conserved between MPXV and MVA, while the other four antigens contain 4-6% substitutions. Among these substitutions, K149E in A35R and T144A, S65T, L66I, R67H in E8L are located on reported neutralizing antibody interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and may lead to immune evasion of MVA neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The MPXV mRNA vaccine adopts the circulating MPXV sequence and can avoid this antigen mismatch. Interestingly, to prevent host cell interaction, the neutralizing antibody of E8L recognizes and blocks the ligand binding site which contains a large positive-charge patch to accommodate the negative charged chondroitin sulfate ligand of host cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To test whether this multivalent vaccine construct encoding five monkeypox antigens in tandem could be successfully translated, a reporter construct otherwise identical to the vaccine was made in parallel by appending GFP to the end of tandem construct (MPXV-PentAg-GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). After transfection with this GFP reporter, around 36% of 293T cells expressed GFP which was quantified by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) and observed under fluorescence microscope. The expression of GFP represents the successful translation of all residues from same mRNA transcript in a significant population of cells. We then advance the MPXVac-097 mRNA expression construct to lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Methods</xref>). The transcribed MPXVac-097 mRNA was successfully encapsulated in LNP, of which size distribution was determined by dynamic light scattering. The encapsulated MPXVac-097 LNP mRNA was monodispersed with an average radius of 49 nm and polydispersity index of 0.16 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P8">After confirming the successful translation of tandem construct and uniform size of the MPXVac-097 LNP-mRNA vaccine candidate, we characterized its initial immunogenicity in mice. Mice were immunized with three doses of 8 μg MPXVac-097 LNP mRNA two weeks apart (prime, boost and booster). The retro-orbital blood was collected on day 0, 14, 28 (just before prime, boost, booster) and day 20, 42 (6 days post boost and 14 days post booster). The isolated plasma from blood was used to quantify antibody titers against individual monkeypox antigen in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Two weeks post prime on day 14, a modest and insignificant increase of antibody titers against A35R and E8L was found in half of vaccinated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), suggesting a single dose (prime alone) is insufficient to elicit a strong antibody response. After the second and third doses, the antibody titer of A35R and E8L increased substantially, and became evident and significant in all mice on day 20, 28 and 42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Interestingly, the antibody titer against M1R, that had no change post prime, started to increase moderately post boost and booster in one mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Because the M1R antigen was sandwiched between A35R and E8L on the same mRNA transcript, its expression level would be comparable to A35R and E8L. The delayed increase of M1R antibody titer in one mouse was unlikely due to differential expression of antigens and may stem from the difference of antigen immunogenicity or surface display. Minimal antibody response was detected for either A29L or B6R post boost, again highlighting the differences in immunogenicity between these antigens in the setting of mRNA vaccination.</p><p id="P9">The antigens used in ELISA are purified ectodomains or truncating variants. Next, we sought to ask if the full-length MPXV antigens can be presented on cell surface and recognized by the plasma antibodies elicited by MPXVac-097. The five monkeypox antigens were separately expressed in 293T cells from which surface antigens were detected by plasma antibody from mice on day 20 and anti-mouse IgG antibody with PE on flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Expression of A35R and E8L led to an increase (12.6% and 1.2% respectively vs. 0.4% in negative control of SARS-CoV-2 spike) of 293T cells that were bound to the MPXV plasma antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). This increase of MPXV antibody-bound cells was consistent with findings in ELISA, and validated the observation of antibody response to surface presentation of A35R and E8L cellular antigens.</p><p id="P10">The ELISA and cell-surface antigen assays provided evidence of the initial B cell response to five monkeypox antigens in mice immunized with MPXVac-097. A natural question that follows is whether T cell response was induced in these animals. We went on to characterize the T cell response by profiling the repertoire of T cell receptors (TCR) in vaccinated mice via bulk TCR-sequencing (TCR-seq). TCR-seq of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) revealed VJ combination usage and clonality maps of TCRs from mice before and after two MPXVac-097 LNP mRNA injections on day 0 and day 20, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e-1g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7-9</xref>). MPXVac-097 LNP mRNA vaccination resulted in more frequent use of TRAJ13, TRAV12N-3, TRAV12D-3 in alpha chain and TRBJ1-4, TRBJ2-2, TRBV1 in beta chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). After immunization, the most frequent VJ combinations was switched to TRAJ13-TRAV12N-3/TRAV12D-3 and TRBJ2-7-TRABV1. The total number of clones and unique clones were not significantly different between samples on day 0 and 20 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>). The CDR3 length distributions are also similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>). In contrast, while the TCR repertoire compositions are similar between independent mice pre-vaccination, we observed distinct TCR repertoire compositions between day 0 and day 20 groups, suggesting that repertoire compositions changed substantially upon two-dose MPXVac- 097 vaccination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9b-c</xref>). Moreover, the clonal diversity of samples post boost was significantly reduced in two-dose MPXVac-097 vaccinated as compared to vaccine-naïve animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). There were also significant reduction of low-frequency clones and significant increase in expended or hyperexpanded clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9d</xref>), which together are indicative of clonal expansion induced by MPXVac-097 vaccination.</p><p id="P11">In summary, our study designed a multivalent monkeypox LNP-mRNA vaccine candidate, MPXVac-097, which can elicit significant antibody response against a subset of MPXV antigens (A35R and E8L) as well as T cell response in mice. Taken together, these data demonstrated initial feasibility of MPXV mRNA vaccine design and provided initial evidence of functionality for its future optimization.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2"><title>Institutional approval</title><p id="P12">The work described in this study is performed under relevant approved protocols (IACUC, rDNA/EHS) in place.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Plasmid cloning</title><p id="P13">The monkeypox antigen amino acid sequences used in the mRNA vaccine design were based on the genome of confirmed monkeypox case identified in Massachusetts in May, 2022 (Genbank ON563414.3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.

The pooled library was denatured, mixed with 5% PhiX and sequenced on MiSeq (Illumina) using MiSeq V3 2 x 300 cycle kit (Illumina).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>VDJ sequencing data analysis</title><p id="P24">The bulk VDJ sequencing data was pre-processed on MiSeq local run manager to trim adaptors and separate reads based on sample index. The reads with an average quality score less 30 were removed from downstream analysis. Clonotypes were called using MiXCR v2.1.5 with the recommended settings for 5’ RACE (RNA alignment to V gene transcripts with P region). The output was further processed with Immunarch v0.6.6 R package for statistical analyses using standard analysis pipelines. The initial samples were n = 5 independent mouse samples, assessed pre-vaccination and post-boost (labeled D0 and D20, respectively) in paired analyses. Samples were assessed for outliers by a multi-step process, (1) comparing the repertoire overlap (amino acid sequence and V gene) between samples using the Morisita method, separately for TRA AND TRB, (2) performing principal components analysis on combined TRA and TRB overlap information (Morisita indices), (3) determining the optimal PCs for subsequent analysis (details below), (4) calculating Mahalanobis sample distances using the optimal number of PCs, and (5) calculating p values using a chi-squared distribution (2 degrees of freedom for 2 PCs) and correcting for multiple testing using the FDR method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7a-c</xref>). The optimal number of PCs was chosen as two using the elbow plot method, and the choice was supported by PC scatter plots that demonstrated that PC1 best explained outlier samples, PC2 best explained the treatment differences, while Pearson correlation analyses of PC1 and PC2 demonstrated the best treatment specific correlation. The filtering parameter excluded two TCR libraries, one from each group (D0 or D20), and the final TCR analysis consists of four samples from each group (n = 4 each).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Statistics and Reproducibility</title><p id="P25">Standard statistical methods were applied to experimental data. The statistical methods are described in here, figure legends and/or supplementary Excel tables. Data on dot-bar plots are shown as mean ± s.e.m. with individual data points in plots.
