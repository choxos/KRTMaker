Gut microbial dysbiosis characterises the pathoetiology, but its role remains understudied. We report the first use of constraint-based microbial community modelling on a single individual with IBD, covering seven dates over 16 months, enabling us to identify a number of time-correlated microbial species and metabolites. We find that the individua’s dynamical microbial ecology in the disease state drives time-varying <italic>in silico</italic> overproduction, compared to healthy controls, of more than 24 biologically important metabolites, including oxygen, methane, thiamine, formaldehyde, trimethylamine N-oxide, folic acid, serotonin, histamine, and tryptamine. A number of these metabolites may yield new biomarkers of disease progression. The microbe-metabolite contribution analysis revealed that some genus <italic>Dialister</italic> species changed metabolic pathways according to the disease phases. At the first time point, characterised by the highest levels of blood and faecal inflammation biomarkers, they produced L-serine or formate. The production of the compounds, through a cascade effect, was mediated by the interaction with pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains and <italic>Desulfovibrio piger</italic>. We integrated the microbial community metabolic models of each time point with a male whole-body, organ-resolved model of human metabolism to track the metabolic consequences of dysbiosis at different body sites. The presence of <italic>D. piger</italic> in the gut microbiome influenced the sulphur metabolism with a domino effect affecting the liver. These results underline the importance of tracking an individual's gut microbiome along a time course, creating a new analysis framework for selfquantified medicine.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F8" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS158936-f008"/></fig>

The human microbiome consists of a large number of archaeal and bacterial, but also of viral and fungal, species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The composition of the microbiome depends on host factors, such as age, sex, location, ethnicity, and lifestyle (e.g., diet, exercise, and medication). Between healthy individuals, the relative abundances of taxa are highly variable, while the functional capabilities are more stable. In contrast, many multifactorial diseases are characterised by a dysbiotic microbiome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The gut microbiota differs among individuals, has a variable composition in different parts of the digestive tract, and can undergo extensive modifications throughout life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This aspect is regarded as an obstacle to gut microbiome-based medical applications, as it remains difficult to identify a clear signature of the dysbiotic microbiota. The microbiome of an individual can change during the outbreak of a disease, and the symptomatology of the patient changes accordingly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. This is particularly true for patients affected by Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a disorder characterised by episodic symptoms driven by time-changing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. This time-varying inflammation is the byproduct of the constant interaction between the human host’s immune system and the changing ecological profile of the host’s gut microbiome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The presence or absence of inflammation is strongly associated with four measurable faecal biomarkers: calprotectin and lactoferrin (shed from white blood cells), lysozyme (innate immune system), and secretory IgA (adaptive immune system) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, as indicators of levels of severity of episodic IBD. Historically, IBD has been considered to have two main subtypes: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). However, a large (30,000 patients) human genotype study in 2016 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> demonstrated that the human genetic predisposition is best explained by three subtypes: ileal Crohn’s disease (ICD), colonic Crohn’s disease (CCD), and UC. This same IBD tripartite division is seen when the gut microbiome ecology is clustered <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. This separation into three subtypes is even clearer when using the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database to cluster the gut microbiome of patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Recently, the study of the microbiome has moved from “Who is there?” to “What are they doing?”. In particular, the constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) framework, which relies on a genome-scale reconstruction of a target organism’s metabolism and the application of condition-specific constraints, e.g., meta-omics data and allowed uptake of nutrients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, has moved these questions further to “What do they produce?”, and “How do they interact?” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Genome-scale reconstructions are assembled using organisms’ genome sequences and biochemical, genetic, and physiological evidence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. COBRA assumes the biological systems to be at a steady state, i.e., the change in metabolite concentration over time is zero. Flux balance analysis (FBA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, a frequently used COBRA method, assumes in addition that the biological system tries to achieve an objective, e.g., maximal biomass yield <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. FBA has been successfully applied to investigate the role of the human gut microbiome in various complex diseases, including Parkinson’s disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and inflammatory bowel disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. To facilitate the application of constraint-based modelling to research on the human gut microbiome, the AGORA (Assembly of Gut Organisms through Reconstruction and Analysis) collection was established <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and recently expanded to cover over 7,200 semi-manually curated microbial genome-scale metabolic reconstructions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In prior studies, FBA was used on a set of microbiome samples comparing healthy individuals with IBD patients at a single time per patient. COBRA modelling has been used to link mechanistically host-microbiome-environment interactions to IBD-related changes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The potential of 818 microbial strains to deconjugate primary bile acids into secondary bile acids has been investigated with a combined approach based on comparative genomics followed by FBA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. In that study, it has been reported that microbial species can complement each other’s bile acid pathway to achieve the broader bile acid production repertoire observed in faecal samples <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Despite the numerous studies performed on CD, the evolution of the gut microbiome during disease onset and progression has not been analysed with FBA. Here, we bridge this gap by investigating how the extreme dysbiosis time variations of the gut microbiome ecology in a single individual with CCD can cause similar large time variations in a number of key metabolites. Another unexplored aspect of the disease is the interaction between host metabolism and the compounds produced by the normal and the dysbiotic gut microbiome. To tackle this specific aspect, we performed an additional investigation using sex-specific, organ-resolved, whole-body metabolic models of human metabolism, which account for 28 organs, tissues, and cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">The present study used FBA to analyse the metabolic evolution of the gut microbiome community in a single individual (“LS”) affected by left-sided CCD across seven time points covering a period of 16 months in 2012/2013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The metagenomic data for these seven time points have been previously compared <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> with a set of metagenomic data from healthy individuals drawn from the NIH Human Microbiome Project <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, as well as selected metagenomic data from patients with ICD and with UC. It has been shown <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> that LS’s gut microbiome taxonomic profile deviated a great deal from the healthy individuals and furthermore, that his gut microbiome exhibited major taxonomic shifts over time.</p><p id="P9">In the present study, the metagenomic data for LS’s seven time points, computed at both the species and strain levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) were mapped onto the AGORA2 collection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The taxonomic composition of the microbiome samples in AGORA2 for each time point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) was then analysed and diversity indexes were computed. As a comparison, we used the metagenomic relative abundance of both species and strain data from the cohort of 34 healthy control subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) and also mapped them on AGORA2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Subsequently, the contribution of each microbial species within the microbiome-level, time point-specific AGORA2 microbial community models to the global profile of 740 metabolites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) present in the gut was predicted (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S25">Methods: Simulations section</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We found that LS’s major gut microbiome taxonomic shifts over time led to correspondingly large FBA metabolic shifts from the personalised microbial community models. In particular, our model results show that a number of biologically important metabolites were highly (10-10,000x) overproduced, compared to HeAve, at various time points in LS's samples, including oxygen, methane, thiamine, formaldehyde, trimethylamine N-oxide, folic acid, serotonin, histamine, and tryptamine. Furthermore, our results suggest that through the production of few metabolites, i.e., L-serine and formate, species of the <italic>Dialister</italic> genus cooperate with many pathogenic strains, such as adherent invasive <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains, archaeal species, and <italic>Desulfovibrio piger</italic> ATCC2. The interactions trigger inflammatory responses and enhance methane production. Finally, <italic>D. piger</italic> ATCC2 plays an important role in the production of the host-toxic SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>. Additionally, we investigated host-microbiome co-metabolism during these time points. In conclusion, our study sheds light on metabolites and microbial species triggering the inflammatory responses, and their impact on host metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>Characterisation of the time points</title><p id="P11">The n=1 patient “LS” with CCD was a non-smoker male, 64 years old at baseline. A detailed description of his medical history is reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref>. We carried out (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">Methods</xref>) deep (~100M reads per sample) shotgun metagenomic sequencing, yielding 510 species and 790 strains relative abundance, on frozen faecal samples for seven time points, deemed LS1 to LS7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) according to the time of collection.</p><p id="P12">All time points were characterised by abnormal concentrations of hematic and faecal immune or inflammatory biomarkers, with LS1 having both the highest hematic complex reactive protein (CRP) and the highest faecal calprotectin concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In contrast, lactoferrin, lysozyme, and secretory IGA had their highest values at LS4 and LS7. The medical intervention between LS1 and LS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) consisted of two antibiotics, being 500 mg ciprofloxacin administered orally twice a day and 250 mg metronidazole administered orally three times per day for one month starting from 31<sup>st</sup> of January 2012 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. During this period, the patient also received daily 40 mg oral prednisone, a drug used to suppress the immune system and decrease inflammation.</p><p id="P13">In addition, we obtained shotgun metagenomic data (~100M reads per person) for the gut microbiome from 34 healthy individuals in the Human Microbiome Project <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). This control dataset allowed for the comparison of the LS microbiome with healthy individuals and for the identification of microbial and functional differences associated with the disease status at each time point.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Analysis of metagenomic data with microbiome-level metabolic models</title><p id="P14">First, we investigated the changes in the metagenomic phyla abundances in the healthy and disease microbiomes. We identified major differences over time between the seven LS times and the healthy microbiomes across the seven most abundant phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Then, we used the strains identified in the shotgun metagenomic data of LS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) as input to the AGORA2 collection of microbial metabolic reconstructions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">Methods</xref>). This process creates seven <italic>in silico</italic> microbial community models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) accounting for a total of 214 distinct microbes, covering both bacterial and archaeal species. The simulation (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">Methods</xref>) uses the seven ecological models to compute the metabolites produced by the microbial communities. In detail, the maximal production and uptake fluxes of each metabolite from all the microbial species is computed, following <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In the following sections, we will state when we are referring to the input metagenomic microbial abundances or to the AGORA2 mapped abundances.</p><p id="P15">Using the metagenomic relative abundances, we compared LS microbial species composition at each time point and with those of the 34 healthy controls, including calculating both the maximum (HeMax) and average (HeAve) abundance of each microbial species across the healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). We observed cases where LSMax&gt;HeAve, meaning that the disease state associated microbiome fluctuated over time and exceeded the average relative abundance in the healthy population. Additionally, we identified cases with LSMax&gt;HeMax, meaning that the relative abundance in the disease state could be greater than the largest cross-population variation. Using this comparison, the dysbiosis experienced by LS was characterised by a major decrease in microbe species that were dominant in the healthy individuals, thereby allowing for the time-dependent bloom of typically less abundant microbes in LS1-7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S3-S9</xref>).</p><p id="P16">In more detail, the average healthy control’s gut microbiomes were found to be predominantly composed of Bacteroidetes (65.6%) and a lower fraction of Firmicutes (30%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In contrast, the most abundant LS microbiome phylum at all seven time points was Firmicutes, which ranged from 1.4 to 2.5x the HeAve abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The overabundance of Firmicutes was driven by the blooming of normally rare Firmicutes species from classes Bacilli and Clostridia, with overabundances ranging from 100-1,000x HeAve for those species. In particular, the family Lachnospiraceae (in class Clostridia) was 2.6-3.7x HeAve, mainly represented by <italic>Dorea longicatena</italic> DSM 13814, normally rare, but 25x HeAve in LS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In contrast, the other dominant microbial phylum in healthy individuals, Bacteroidetes, was depleted by more than 10x in all LS time points except LS6 when it bounced back to half the abundance of HeAve.</p><p id="P17">The ecological absence of the normally dominant phylum Bacteroidetes allowed other, normally rare phyla in the healthy individuals, to dynamically bloom. In particular, the phylum Euryarchaeota was elevated by at least three times in all samples when compared with the HeAve, with an extreme overabundance in LS1 and LS6, which are 137x HeAve and 57x HeAve, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The observed high archaeal relative abundances in all the phases are typical of CD-associated dysbiosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. In particular, the presence of the family Methanobacteriaceae (dominated by <italic>Methanobrevibacter smithii)</italic> was strongly influenced by the disease, varying between 3-170x HeAve (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S13</xref>), with the highest value occurring at LS1. The phylum Proteobacteria was also overabundant, compared to healthy individuals, at all seven time points. For LS1-3, it was approximately seven times higher, and for LS7, it was ten times higher than HeAve. Within this phylum, the family Enterobacteriaceae reached a peak of &gt;150x HeAve in LS7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>). The abundance of family Enterobacteriaceae species <italic>E. coli</italic> in LS1 was 187x (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S11</xref>). Phylum Actinobacteria had a higher abundance (4-50x HeAve) at all time points and a higher diversity with 58 different species present at time point LS5 compared to the healthy average (36 species) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Among these species, <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic> climaxed to seven times the HeAve. Finally, there were also isolated blooms of the phyla Fusobacteria (40x and 11x HeAve at LS1 and LS6) and Verrucomicrobia (seven times the HeAve at LS5).</p><p id="P18">To assess the diversity within each microbial community model, we calculated the alpha diversity based on the AGORA2 taxonomic assignments for both LS1-7 and HeAve. The highest LS alpha diversity was obtained for LS6 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Although LS2 was the time point with the highest number of species, it was not the one with the highest alpha diversity, when the taxonomic differences of the different samples were weighted with a hierarchical tree based on the taxonomies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Indeed, LS2 was mainly composed of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, which covered more than 70% of the relative abundance in the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To assess the changes in diversity between the time points, we calculated the beta diversity using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. The average beta diversity between samples was 58.00. The two most dissimilar samples were LS1 and LS2 (84.1%), likeliest reflecting the effect of the antibiotic treatment before LS2 collection. The two lowest beta diversities were between LS3 with LS4, which had a beta diversity of 23.44, and LS5 with LS7 of 35.76. The diversity between LS1 and LS6 was 79.50 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P20">In the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed on microbial composition and abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1, S2</xref>), the first component accounted for 54.7% of the total variability, while both the second and the third components each accounted for approximately 20% of the total variability. The different PCA components were mainly driven by the differential abundance of two archaeal species, i.e., the already mentioned <italic>M. smithii</italic> ATCC 35061, and <italic>Methanosphaera stadtmanae</italic> DSM 3091 (LSMax = 542x HeAve). Both archaea were more abundant in LS1 and LS6 in comparison to the other time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S2, S17</xref>). In the PCA cluster plot, LS6 was clearly separated from the other six time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), consistent with the higher alpha diversity of the LS6 microbiome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) compared to the other time points.</p><p id="P21">As aforementioned, the LS1 gut microbiome was severely depleted in almost all the most abundant HeAve species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S3-S9</xref>). We found 21 microbe species with relative abundance &gt;1% in HeAve, yet they were very rare (HeAve/LS1&gt;10) in LS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S3A</xref>), including the phylum Bacteroidetes species <italic>Prevotella copri</italic> (1436x), <italic>Bacteroides stercoris</italic> (152x), <italic>Bacteroides caccae</italic> (43x), <italic>Bacteroides ovatus</italic> (40x), <italic>Bacteroides vulgatus</italic> (28x), <italic>Bacteroides dorei</italic> (20x), <italic>Alistipes putredinis</italic> (15x) and the phylum Firmicutes species <italic>Eubacterium rectale</italic> (43x) and <italic>Ruminococcus bromii</italic> (11x). Only three of the 21 HeAve most abundant species had relative abundances in LS1 that were comparable (1&lt;HeAve/LS1&lt;5) to HeAve: <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic> (4.5x), and <italic>Alistipes finegoldii</italic> (3x), <italic>Dialister invisus</italic> (1.5x). We note that <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic> is a well-known anti-inflammatory bacterium.

With the exception of <italic>Dialister invisus</italic> (which we will return to later), all of the dominant LS1 microbiome species ranged from 100 to almost 1,000 times more abundant than in the healthy gut microbiome. A number of these normally rare species (e.g., <italic>E. coli, M. smithii, M. stadtmanae, and P. micra</italic>) will have major impacts on key metabolite production, as we will discuss later in this paper.

We also predicted microbe-specific contributions to the overall fluxes in each microbial community model (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">Methods</xref>). To allow for the comparison between the LS microbiome and the healthy gut microbiome, we calculated the parameter healthy average of the fluxes (HeAveFluxes) from the healthy controls metagenomic input to our simulation model, creating 34 healthy controls microbial community models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The resulting HeAveFluxes parameter enabled us to discover that over 20 metabolites had a maximum value over the LS1-7 LS dysbiotic gut microbiome, which ranged from 10 to 750 times higher than the maximum values across the healthy controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Next, we examined in detail the strong time variations of a number of key gut microbially produced metabolites.

All but five of these 24 were greatly overproduced by LS, with LSMax from 5x to 750x times the highest value found across the 34 healthy controls. For each of these 24 metabolites, we then visually pattern-matched the metabolite time graph to microbial species relative abundance graphs over time. This approach allowed the identification of several microbe-metabolite relationship time variation patterns over LS1-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S15-S21</xref>).

Many reconstructions of microbial species included in the simulations (e.g., <italic>Eggerthella lenta</italic> DSM 2243, <italic>Bacteroides vulgatus</italic> ATCC 8482, and <italic>Megasphaera elsdenii</italic> DSM 20460) have a superoxide dismutase (VMH ID: SPODM) converting reactive oxygen species to oxygen and oxygen peroxide (2.0 h[c] + 2.0 o2s[c] -&gt; h2o2[c] + o2[c]), as well as an oxygen exchange (VMH ID: EX_o2) reaction. The simulations, therefore, suggest a novel, unidirectional interaction among these species boosting <italic>E. coli</italic> bloom with superoxide dismutase products. Our hypothesis is novel, yet consistent with the “oxygen hypothesis” that posits that some aspects of IBD symptoms result from an increase of oxygen and reactive oxygen species into the intestinal lumen competitively favouring facultative anaerobic species over strictly anaerobic ones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.

Indeed, formate in LS1 fuelled the proliferation of <italic>E. coli</italic> F11, <italic>M. smithii</italic> ATCC 35061, and <italic>D. piger</italic> ATCC 29098 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> F11 is an adherent invasive and pathogenic strain, which takes advantage of the leaking gut to replace strictly anaerobic bacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. <italic>M. smithii</italic> ATCC 35061 is a hydrogenotrophic archaeon that can use either CO2 and H2 or formate alone for methane production <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The increase in methane production, and, therefore, constipation and bloating events, is known to be partially caused by the increase of this archaeal species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>.

However, certain metabolic functions may require the presence of specific microbial species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. Hence, we investigated whether there were any function-specific microbes in the microbial community models at the different time points, whose presence was required for the production of specific metabolites. The analysis revealed that the Proteobacteria <italic>D. piger</italic> ATCC2 was the only microbial species involved in the production of sulphite (SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) in the microbial community models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). We found that D. piger at its peak in LS was nearly four times more abundant than in the maximum relative abundance found across the healthy controls (LSMax/HeMax=3.7). Patients affected by IBD, such as ulcerative colitis, are strongly discouraged to consume foods with high SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> levels as being harmful and favouring tightening of inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. Furthermore, sodium sulfite, a common food additive, inhibits the activity of commensal and anti-inflammatory bacteria, such as <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. A large part of the SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> present in the gut comes from dietary intake <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>, however, some microbial species are known to produce SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>. <italic>D. piger</italic> ATTC2 was not able to synthesise SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> in single-species simulations. However, the pairwise simulations revealed that this species interacted with the Archaea <italic>M. stadtmanae</italic> DSM3091. Only when in synergy with the archaeal partner, <italic>D. piger</italic> ATTC2 could produce SO<sub>3</sub>. This metabolic dependency reflected a cooperative behaviour culminating in the production of the host-toxic SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>. To support this hypothesis, it is worth noting that the flux production of SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> in the LS time points, strongly reflects the abundance fluctuations of both <italic>M. stadtmanae</italic> and <italic>M. smithii</italic>, the two archaea in the community under investigation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S17</xref>).</p><p id="P51">The pairwise simulations revealed that <italic>D. piger</italic> ATCC 29098 absorbed ethanol, converted it into acetate, and, finally, secreted it. The acetate was then taken up by the acetoclastic Archaea <italic>M. stadtmanae</italic> DSM 3091. <italic>D. piger</italic> ATCC 2909 can metabolise ethanol using two alternative anaerobic pathways: in one case, the ethanol is oxidised to acetate via acetaldehyde as an intermediate. In the second case, other intermediates between acetaldehyde and acetate are generated, namely acetyl-CoA and acetyl-P <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. In the simulations, the conversion of ethanol to acetate had a yield of approximately 1 (0.93), as expected from experimental data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. The nearly 1:1 ethanol-to-acetate ratio reflected the release of an excess of reducing equivalents, such as methane, by syntrophic partners <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. <italic>D. piger</italic> ATCC 29098 ability to synthesise and export SO<sub>3</sub> may be recovered through the interaction with other archaeal partners as well. Accordingly, due to the commensalism, when <italic>M. stadtmanae</italic> DSM 3091 and <italic>D. piger</italic> ATCC 29098 were co-occurrent, the net flux production of methane was higher (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).

In this simulation, we inspected the microbial metabolic influence on a range of different organs and tissues of the host as the only variable was the gut microbiome ecology composition, which changed over time. We found that the dysbiosis resulted in greater flux changes in some organs or cell types than in others. In fact, red blood cells, platelets, and the retina showed the most pronounced changes in predicted fluxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Interestingly, Episcleritis, a disease involving the eyes, is one of the most common extraintestinal IBD manifestations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. The predicted flux through the metabolism of the prostaglandin E2 was altered in the pancreas in LS2 and LS7. Prostaglandin release is one of the first triggering factors of the inflammatory cascade typical of CD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. Finally, many drugs, such as mesalazine, are used to inhibit the release of prostaglandins and leukotrienes in different body sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup> underlying the key role of these molecules in the establishment of CD.</p><p id="P54">Notably, the sulphite metabolism in the liver was dependent on the presence of <italic>D. piger</italic> ATCC 2909 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S4</xref>) in the gut. In the microbiome-associated whole-body model, sulphite from the small and large intestine could be either transported directly to the liver through the portal vein or as cysteine-S-sulphate (VMH ID: slfcys). In the liver, cysteine-S-sulphate can then be metabolised to cysteine (VMH ID: cys_L) and SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2- 80</sup>. In our simulations, SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> was oxidised to SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> through sulphite oxidase activity (VMH ID: SULFOX). This reaction produced hydrogen peroxide in the model and thus could contribute to oxidative stress, which we do not model as such. At the same time, sulphur metabolism was linked to the metabolism of bile acids in the simulations in LS2 and LS7. Indeed, cysteine-S-sulphate is a precursor of hypotaurine and taurine. The flux through the reactions involved in this pathway (involving the reactions HYPTROX, r0539, and r0381) changed with the time points, being increased in LS2 and LS7. Around 85% of bile acid reactions were affected by the presence of <italic>D. piger</italic> ATCC 2909 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). The increase of these compounds led to an increase in faecal H2S, which has been reported to be increased in IBD patients compared to healthy controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>, in LS2 and LS7. Cysteine was converted to L-cystine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S20</xref>) by a state transition reaction named Glutathione:Cystine Oxidoreductase (VMH ID: CYSGLTH). CYSGLTH enabled the oxidation of glutathione; thus, acting as a scavenger molecule. Based on our predictions, the presence of <italic>D. piger</italic> changed the fluxes in the transsulfuration pathway leading to higher cysteine to glutathione turnover.</p><p id="P55">In conclusion, the analysis of the microbiome-associated whole-body model has the potential to shed light on the alteration in the metabolism of different body sites caused by the dynamic dysbiotic microbiome. The alteration of the sulphur metabolism in the liver and its link with the presence or absence of <italic>D. piger</italic> ATCC 2909 in the large intestine reflects the intercommunication among the different body sites. This network and its influence on the disease onset has been so far largely overlooked. However, this connection could reveal understudied pathobiology mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P56">The time course analysis performed on a patient affected by IBD enabled the analysis of how net metabolite production fluxes were induced by the change of the gut microbial community composition during a time course covering more than one year. To date, this is the first analysis inspecting the disease evolution in a patient affected by Crohn’s disease with metabolic modelling. The study revealed that substantial metabolic changes are associated with the disease evolution as a direct consequence of the patient’s changing gut microbiome composition, notably involving archaeal species. A number of biologically important metabolites were found to be highly overproduced over time in the patient, compared to healthy controls. This list includes oxygen, methane, thiamine, formaldehyde, TMAO, folic acid, serotonin, histamine, and tryptamine, which may yield new biomarkers of disease progression. The analyses with microbiome-associated whole-body models revealed that the presence of <italic>D.piger</italic> could alter the metabolism of sulphur in the liver. Since the microbial composition is variable among individuals, to obtain a wide and general representation of the microbiome the time course inspection of a higher number of patients will be needed. However, the functional redundancy present in the gut microbiota allows to some extent to generalise our results to other patients. Taken together, we demonstrated that microbial community metabolic modelling is a very valuable <italic>in silico</italic> approach to track correspondence between metagenomic data and metabolite production and can yield testable novel hypotheses to be addressed with additional validation studies. These results underline the importance of tracking an individual's gut microbiome composition and metabolic production along a time course, paving the way to new analyses for self-quantified medicine.</p></sec><sec id="S19" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S20"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="P57">The stool samples of the patient were collected by consent under two protocols: HRPP 141853 (American Gut Project) and HRPP 150275 (Evaluating the Human Microbiome).

LS has episodic major increases in all of these inflammatory/immune biomarkers, as healthy values for each are CRP&lt;1, lactoferrin&lt;7.3, lysozyme&lt;600, calprotectin&lt;50, and SecIGA (30-275). The medical intervention between LS1 and LS2 consisted of ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and prednisone. “Microbes” refers to the number of metabolic models identified in the metagenomic samples according to the threshold selected (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">Methods</xref>) and that were included in each time point-specific microbial community model. The number of reactions and metabolites refers to the size of the condition-specific microbial community models at each time point.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS158936-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Graphical representation of the time evolution of the gut microbiome ecology.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Stacked barplot representing the metagenomic phyla abundance of the gut microbiome in the different LS samples with a comparison to the Healthy Average (HeAve).
