Mala s 1, a β-propeller protein, is an allergen identified in <italic>Malassezia sympodialis</italic> inducing both IgE and T-cell reactivity in the majority of patients with AE. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of Mala s 1 allergen in skin disease. An anti-Mala s 1 antibody was used to investigate the cellular localisation of Mala s 1, the potential of Mala s 1 as a therapeutic target and examine cross-reactivity of the anti-Mala s 1 antibody with human skin. We demonstrate by high pressure freezing electron microscopy and immune-staining that Mala s 1 is located in the cell wall of <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> yeast cells. Despite the ability of the anti-Mala s 1 antibody to bind to yeast cells, it did not inhibit <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> growth suggesting Mala s 1 may not be an attractive antifungal target. The Mala s 1 predicted protein sequence was analysed <italic>in silico</italic> and was found to contain a motif indicative of a KELCH protein, a group of β-propeller proteins. Humans express a large number of KELCH proteins including some that are localised in the skin. To test the hypothesis that antibodies against Mala s 1 cross react with human skin proteins we examined the binding of anti-Mala s 1 antibody to human skin explant samples. Reactivity with the antibody was visualised in the epidermal layer of skin. To further characterise putative human targets recognised by the anti-Mala s 1 antibody, proteins were extracted from immunoblot gel bands and proteomic analysis performed. Several candidate human proteins were identified. To conclude, we propose that Mala s 1 is a KELCH-like β-propeller protein with similarity to human skin proteins and Mala s 1 recognition may trigger the production of cross-reactive responses that contribute to skin diseases associated with <italic>M. sympodialis</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3"><italic>Malassezia</italic> is an abundant genus of 18 yeast species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Vijaya Chandra <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) that includes the dominant commensal fungi of the human skin microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Findley <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>), with most prevalent distribution in skin areas of high sebum enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Byrd <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>).

Genetic and environmental factors leading to impaired skin barrier function have been associated with the pathogenesis of AE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Nutten, 2015</xref>). Several human proteins have roles in maintaining skin barrier function, for example filaggrin and filaggrin-2 are important proteins in barrier formation and skin moisturisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), while epiplakin and desmoplakin are essential in epidermal integrity and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Vasioukhin <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ishikawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Skin barrier impairment results in increased contact with different microbes, such as the commensal yeast <italic>Malassezia</italic>, perpetuating skin damage, as well as inducing local and systemic inflammatory reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Nutten, 2015</xref>). Ten IgE-binding proteins (Mala s 1 and Mala s 5 to 13) have been characterized in <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Gioti <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>), one of the most frequent species colonizing the skin of both healthy individuals and AE patients in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Jagielski <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Falk <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). These proteins act as allergens, inducing both IgE and T-cell reactivity in more than 50% of patients with AE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Scheynius <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Vilhelmsson <italic>et al</italic>, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Balaji <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P5">One hypothesis linking <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> to the pathogenesis of AE is cross-reactivity generated by <italic>Malassezia</italic>-allergens, which are highly homologous to human proteins. Cross-reactivity between <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> allergens and human proteins has been documented for Mala s 11 and Mala s 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Balaji <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schmid-Grendelmeier <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Vilhelmsson <italic>et al</italic>, 2007a</xref>). Mala s 11 is predicted to be a manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Gioti <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Vilhelmsson <italic>et al</italic>, 2007a</xref>). Up to 36% of AE individuals have high levels of specific IgE against human MnSOD and positive skin tests against this allergen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schmid-Grendelmeier <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Human and fungal MnSOD induce proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from sensitised AE patients (Schmid-Grendelmeier <italic>et al</italic>, 2005). In addition, CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells from AE individuals, specifically sensitised to the <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> Mala s 13 allergen, were reactive to human thioredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Balaji <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). The high similarity with the corresponding mammalian homologs suggests that autoreactive T cells could contribute to tissue inflammation in AE.</p><p id="P6">Mala s 1 is a 37 kDa protein predicted to be secreted and, to date, has not been shown to have sequence homology to any specific human protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Zargari <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Gioti <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). The crystal structure of Mala s 1 revealed it to be a β-propeller protein that binds lipids such as phosphatidylinositols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Vilhelmsson <italic>et al</italic>, 2007b</xref>). Mala s 1 is similar to Tri14, a mycotoxin synthesis protein involved in virulence and plant invasion in <italic>Gibberella zeae</italic> (anamorph <italic>Fusarium graminearum)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Vilhelmsson <italic>et al</italic>, 2007b</xref>). Mala s 1 is mainly localized in the <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> cell wall and in the budding area, as visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Zargari <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). Therefore, Mala s 1 may be important for the replication of <italic>Malassezia</italic> and, thus, a potential therapeutic target.</p><p id="P7"><italic>M. sympodialis</italic> cells can communicate with host cells, such as PBMCs and keratinocytes, through the release of extracellular nanosized vesicles, designated MalaEx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Gehrmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Johansson <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Vallhov <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). MalaEx are enriched in Mala s 1 compared with the allergens produced by whole <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Johansson <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>).

Recently, the presence of small RNAs in MalaEx was identified, suggesting that they have the potential to deliver functional mRNAs and microRNA-like RNAs to recipient host cells, thereby interfering with the host RNAi machinery to silence host immune genes and cause infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Rayner <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Another potential mechanism of communication with host cells is related to the β-propeller protein structure of Mala s 1 (Vilhelmsson 2017). β-propeller proteins contain different motifs allowing their classification into groups or families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kopec &amp; Lupas, 2013</xref>). One of these β-propeller families contains a KELCH motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kopec &amp; Lupas, 2013</xref>). The KELCH motif is commonly found in bacterial and eukaryotic proteins with diverse enzymatic functions, and is composed of 50 amino acids, which fold into four stranded beta sheets (Interpro: IPR015915). The interest in KELCH proteins has increased in recent years as these β-propeller proteins are involved in multiple cellular functions and protein-protein interactions with a wide cellular distribution in intracellular compartments, cell surface and extracellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adams <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p><p id="P9">In this study, the aims were to characterise Mala s 1 to a) examine its precise cellular localisation in <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> using high pressure freezing Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), b) investigate its potential as a drug target by examining if an anti-Mala s 1 antibody interferes with <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> growth, and c) evaluate potential cross-reactivity between Mala s 1 and human skin proteins, including KELCH proteins, using an anti-Mala s 1 antibody in a human skin explant model.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>M. sympodialis and C. albicans <italic>culture conditions</italic></title><p id="P10"><italic>Malassezia sympodialis</italic> (ATCC 42132) was used for all experiments. <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> was grown fresh from -70 °C glycerol stocks for each experiment by plating on Dixon agar containing 3.6% w/v malt extract, 2% w/v desiccated ox-bile, 0.6% w/v bacto tryptone, 0.2% v/v oleic acid, 1% v/v Tween 40, 0.2% v/v glycerol, 2% w/v bacto agar (mDixon) at 35 °C for 4-5 days.

Non-inoculated tissue from six different skin donors was analysed by immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-Mala s 1 antibody. For all donors, samples stained with the anti-Mala s 1 antibody showed detectable fluorescent signal when compared to controls (only secondary antibody or IgG<sub>1</sub> isotype control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

There was some variation in staining between different donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).

Proteins were also extracted from <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> yeast cells grown on mDixon agar and in mDixon broth as Mala s 1 protein controls. Expression of the Mala s 1 protein was evaluated by immunoblotting.

The anti-Mala s 1 antibody also identified a protein ≥200 kDa in protein extracts from non-inoculated skin samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). These gel bands were recovered and processed by automated in-gel trypsin digestion and the peptides separated and identified by LC-MS/MS. To identify the potential protein(s) recognised by the Mala s 1 antibody, proteins identified by proteomics (n=180) were filtered, initially by selecting proteins of expected size (≥ 200 kDa= 17 proteins found), then proteins where the number of peptides were ≥2 and peptide spectrum matches (PSM) was ≥2 (n=12). Next, proteins were filtered according to their cellular localisation and protein structure (n=6). MalaEx can also contain Mala s 1 and can be taken up by human keratinocytes and monocytes where MalaEx are mainly found in close proximity to the nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Johansson <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Therefore, proteins localising to the cell nucleus were also included. Considering the antibody binding pattern observed in skin samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), an extra filter was applied for proteins expressed in all epidermal layers and in nuclei, cytoskeleton, and cytoplasm. After applying all filters, two proteins remained as potential targets: epiplakin and desmoplakin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Mala s 1 is a potential KELCH protein</title><p id="P33">Mala s 1 is a β-propeller protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Vilhelmsson <italic>et al</italic>, 2007b</xref>) containing 4-8 symmetrical beta sheets.

This led us to test the hypothesis that Mala s 1 might be a β-propeller protein with a KELCH motif and hence act as an allergen due to molecular mimicry with human skin proteins. The 350 aa Mala s 1 protein sequence (Uniport ID M5E589) was analysed manually for KELCH motifs using the previously published motif consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Prag &amp; Adams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adams <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>).

The antibody target epitope sequence was only found in the Mala s 1 protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P34">Immunostaining with TEM confirmed that Mala s 1 is localised in the <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> cell wall. Binding of the anti-Mala s 1 specific antibody to its cell wall target did not inhibit growth of the fungus suggesting that Mala s 1 is not an antifungal therapeutic target. The anti-Mala s 1 antibody recognised and bound to unknown targets in full thickness human skin explants. This cross-reactivity could be due to anti-Mala s 1 antibody recognising human proteins with similar tertiary structures or epitopes to Mala s 1 despite Mala s 1 not having a clear human homologue. Proteomic analysis of anti-Mala s 1 antibody-reactive proteins isolated from western blotting revealed a number of candidate human targets, but none contained the specific peptide epitope recognised by the antibody on Mala s 1. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that Mala s 1 contains a KELCH domain, a common motif for protein-protein interactions. This poses the question whether the Mala s 1 KELCH domain is responsible for cross-reactivity between anti-<italic>Malassezia</italic> antibodies and human skin proteins.</p><p id="P35">Taking advantage of an anti-Mala s 1 specific mouse monoclonal antibody (Zagari <italic>et al</italic>, 1994, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Schmidt <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>), we demonstrated by TEM immuno-gold labelling that Mala s 1 is mainly localised to the cell wall of <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> yeast cells, in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Zargari <italic>et al</italic>, (1997)</xref>. The immuno-gold labelling was found in a disperse pattern around the cell periphery of the mother cell wall, but also in the budding area and inside yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). As immuno-gold labelled Mala s 1 particles appeared to be enriched at the plasma membrane/cell wall interface we cannot rule out that we are also visualizing the MalaEx vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Gehrmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>), which are enriched in Mala s 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Johansson <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Although the anti-Mala s 1 antibody recognised and bound the <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> yeast cell wall, drug susceptibility testing did not show an antifungal effect against <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This suggested that Mala s 1 is not essential for replication nor as a cell wall component; hence, Mala s 1 is not a potential target for antifungal therapy. AmBD was also ineffective in the drug susceptibility testing performed in this study, whereas voriconazole was fungicidal at low drug concentrations. Previous studies have documented higher susceptibility of <italic>Malassezia</italic> species to triazoles, specifically triazoles with anti-mould activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Rojas <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Miranda <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Carrillo-Muñoz <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Leong <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Contrary to this study, AmBD has been reported to achieve 100% growth inhibition at high MICs (ranging from 0.5 to 4 μg/ml) for cutaneous clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Rojas <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Leong <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>) and MICs ≥ 8 μg/ml to AmBD were documented for blood-recovered <italic>Malassezia furfur</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Iatta <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). These differences could be explained by the type of medium used for antifungal susceptibility testing, mDixon vs supplemented RMPI 1640 or the fungal isolates used in this study. In the future the anti-Mala s 1 antibody used in combination with antifungal drugs could be tested for synergy of the antibody with other antifungal therapies. Potential beneficial immunomodulatory effects and effector functions of the anti-Mala s 1 antibody could also be tested in assays with immune cells or in other <italic>ex vivo</italic> human-pathogen interaction models.</p><p id="P37">Since we found that the anti-Mala s 1 antibody did recognise human proteins present in non-inoculated human skin explants, we used a combination of bioinformatics and proteomics to investigate potential human skin orthologous proteins that may contribute to the host’s inflammatory responses to this allergen. Although several candidate proteins were identified, such as epiplakin and desmoplakin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), we cannot definitively pinpoint that the anti-Mala s 1 antibody cross reacts with a single human skin protein. Bioinformatics analysis revealed for the first time that Mala s 1 allergen is a potential KELCH protein. Proteins with KELCH motifs have wide-ranging functions including cellular communication, with examples that contribute to microbial pathogenicity and skin function relevant to this study. Two important examples of these KELCH proteins are the human intracellular NS1-binding protein (NS1-BP) targeted by NS1 protein of Influenza A virus during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Wolff <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) and the KELCH K13-propeller protein in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> where SNPs are associated with artemisinin resistance, which limits the eradication of malaria in areas where these mutations are highly prevalent, for example Southeast Asia and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Ménard <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Another example of a KELCH protein complex that functions specifically in the skin is the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2/KELCH-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Nfr2/KEAP1) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Helou <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). In this complex, Nfr2 initiates the transcription of antioxidant enzymes, limits both the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory responses, such as inflammasomes, while KEAP1 supresses these functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Helou <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Dysregulation of the Nfr2/KEAP1 system has been associated with skin damage and psoriatic plaque formation in a psoriasis-mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Ogawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Considering the multiple functions of KELCH proteins in the skin and their roles in the pathogenesis of human infections, the study of Mala s 1 allergen and determining its role during interaction with skin is highly relevant.</p><p id="P38">In the current study, two potential human target proteins that cross-react with Mala s 1 antibody were identified: epiplakin and desmoplakin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The distribution of these two proteins in the epidermis was compared to the observed binding pattern of anti-Mala s 1 antibody to human skin.</p><p id="P39">Desmoplakin (260 kDa) is closer to the size of the immunoblot band than epiplakin (460 kDa). Desmoplakin has a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain containing 6 β-strands in 2 anti-parallel β-sheets that is key in substrate recognition, membrane localisation and regulation of kinase activity (Kurochkina <italic>et al</italic>, 2013). Desmoplakin contains the 8 highly conserved residues, predictive of a KELCH motif consensus sequence between residues 480 and 540. Four of these residues are localised within the SH3 domain. SH3 domains can interact with KELCH proteins. For example, SH3 domain in Tyrosine-protein kinase Fyn has been described as interacting with KLHL2 (KELCH Like Family Member 2) which has an important role in ubiquitination and actin cytoskeleton formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Dhanoa <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Desmoplakin is essential in forming desmosomes, which are cell-cell adhesions necessary for skin integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Vasioukhin <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Recessive mutations in <italic>DSP</italic> (the desmoplakin gene) have been associated with palmoplantar keratoderma, acantholytic epidermolysis bullosa, dermatitis and extensive skin erosion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">McAleer <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P40">In conclusion, we propose that the IgE binding allergen Mala s 1 of <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> is a potential KELCH protein with a motif that is found in a diverse set of proteins, including over 100 human proteins, which can fold into a β -propeller. We suggest that the similarity of Mala s 1 to human proteins may lead to cross-reactivity and thereby contribute to the skin inflammation amongst AE patients sensitized to <italic>M. sympodialis</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS156699-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d36aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary material</label><media xlink:href="EMS156699-supplement-Supplementary_material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d36aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Giuseppe Ianiri and Joe Heitman for their continuous support and many insightful discussions.

Plotted colour lines correspond to the mean of three biological replicates, error bars correspond to standard deviation and different colours correspond to different drugs or no drug control.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156699-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Anti-Mala s 1 antibody reacts with human proteins in non-inoculated skin.</title><p>Sections were imaged with (a) Rh-TRITC channel (543 nm/569 nm, propidium iodide staining), (b) FITC channel (495 nm/519 nm, stained with secondary antibody labelled with Alexa 488), (c) DAPI channel (358 nm/461 nm, calcofluor staining), (d) images captured with differential interference contrast (DIC), (e) merge of all channels. 6 μm thin tissue sections were cut from frozen OCT skin sample blocks.
