We assessed the diversity of neutralizing antibody responses developed in an unvaccinated individual infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 by examining the ability of the distinct B cell germline-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in neutralizing known and currently circulating Omicron variants by pseudovirus and authentic virus neutralization assays. The ability of the antibodies developed post vaccination in neutralizing Omicron variants was compared to that obtained at baseline of the same individual and to those obtained from Omicron breakthrough infected individuals by pseudovirus neutralization assay. Broadly SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs representing unique B cell lineages with non-overlapping epitope specificities isolated from a single donor varied in their ability to neutralize Omicron variants. Plasma antibodies developed post vaccination from this individual demonstrated neutralization of Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4 with increased magnitude and found to be comparable with those obtained from other vaccinated individuals who were infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Development of B cell repertoire capable of producing antibodies with distinct affinity and specificities for the antigen immediately after infection capable of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies offers highest probability in protecting against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>monoclonal antibodies</kwd><kwd>neutralizing antibodies</kwd><kwd>antibody repertoire</kwd><kwd>Omicron</kwd><kwd>breakthrough infection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Observation</title><p id="P2">Currently the COVID-19 pandemic is primarily driven by the Omicron lineage variants globally (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global/6m">https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global/6m</ext-link>). Recently, few studies highlighted a significant reduction in effectiveness of the vaccine, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and natural infection induced neutralizing antibody responses against the Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and rapidly emerging BA.4/BA.5 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Little is known about the antibody responses mounted in individuals previously infected with the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (Wu-1/CoV2) prior to vaccination and capable of broadly neutralizing evolving VOCs including the currently circulating and rapidly emerging Omicron variants. We previously reported isolation of five RBD-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from an unvaccinated Indian individual (donor C-03-0020) who was infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). In the present study, we report isolation and characterization of two additional mAbs from the same individual: THSC20.HVTR11 and THSC20.HVTR55 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) by RBD-specific single B cell sorting and following same pipeline reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) that differed in their B cell origin. These two new mAbs varied in their ability to neutralize Omicron variants as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1A</xref>. While THSC20.HVTR11 was found to neutralize Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 potently but failed to neutralize Delta (B.1.617.2) and Kappa (B.1.617.1), THSC20.HVTR55 failed to neutralize all Omicron variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The loss of the ability of THSC20.HVTR11 to neutralize Delta and Kappa was found to be correlated with the presence of L452R mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1B</xref>). This could also likely be the reason for the inability of THSC20.HVTR11 to neutralize Omicron BA.4/BA.5. Both the newly isolated mAbs (THSC20.HVTR11 and THSC20.HVTR55) not only demonstrated strong binding affinity but also differed in their epitope specificities on RBD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 C-E</xref>). Remarkably, all the seven mAbs isolated from this donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>) were found to be derived from distinct B cell germlines (IGVH3-30, IGVH7-4-1, IGVH1-69, IGVH3-53, IGVH4-39, IGVH5-51, IGVH1-18 linked to the variable heavy chain IgG sequences and IGVL2-11, IGVL3-1, IGVL1-40, IGVL2-23, IGVL3-21, IGVK1-5, IGVK3-20 linked to the variable light chain IgG sequences respectively), when compared with those found in the CoVAbDAb database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) indicating the B cell repertoire rapidly expanded following infection giving rise to the neutralizing antibody diversity. Interestingly, only four mAbs (THSC20.HVTR04, THSC20.HVTR06, THSC20.HVTR11 and THSC20.HVTR26) were found to variably neutralize the Omicron variants when tested as pseudoviruses and authentic live viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-D</xref>). THSC20.HVTR04 (IGVH3-30) though found to have lost its activity against BA.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) presumably due to G446S and N440K mutations, it was found to potently neutralize BA.2, BA.4 (pseudovirus) and BA.5 (authentic live virus) with IC50 values of 0.29, 0.21 and 0.19 μg/mL respectively. On the other hand, THSC20.HVTR06 (IGVH7-4-1) could neutralize all the BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 variants but with low potencies, while THSC20.HVTR11 could neutralize BA.1 and BA.2 with comparable potency as THSC20.HVTR04, however failed to neutralize BA.4/BA5. THSC20.HVTR26 mAb that we reported to moderately neutralize BA.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) was included in the experiment for comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The N440K mutation which is common in Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 variants did not appear to affect the neutralization potential of THSC20.HVTR04 against BA.2 and BA.4/5, though likely have reduced its potency as noted earlier with SARS-CoV-2 wild type spike. Overall, we observed unique neutralization diversities conferred by the antibody repertoire developed in this particular individual through natural infection.</p><p id="P3">Next, we examined the magnitude and quality of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron variants developed in the same C-03-0020 donor and compared with antibody responses observed with individuals who were vaccinated post infection with ancestral SARS-CoV-2. The participants included in this study were members of DBT COVID-19 consortium cohort, organized by interdisciplinary research institutes and hospitals in the National Capital Region of India. The study protocol was approved by the Institute Ethics Committees of all participating institutions. Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants who contributed bio-specimens, and for the clinical information collected. As part of this case study, we first examined the magnitude of antibodies developed in the C-03-0020 donor, 20 weeks post receiving third vaccine dose of ChAdOx1nCoV-10 (Covishield™) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) for its extent to neutralize the Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4. Remarkably, antibodies obtained from the followed-up visit from this individual demonstrated neutralization of Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4 with significantly increased potency compared to its baseline convalescent antibodies by 16.06, 11.33 and 9.67 folds respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B</xref>). Next, we compared the magnitude of antibody response developed post vaccination in this particular individual (C-03-0020) with that obtained from sixteen vaccine breakthrough Omicron infected individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) and from ten individuals who received two doses of ChAdOx1nCoV-10 (Covishield™) but not reported to be infected post vaccination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>) in neutralizing Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4 variants. Interestingly, the plasma antibodies obtained from C-03-0020 donor post receiving three doses of vaccines showed neutralization of the three Omicron variants examined with comparable magnitude to that observed with antibodies developed in Omicron BTI individuals which demonstrated most potent neutralization of the same viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). This was observed in sharp contrast to that obtained from those who received full vaccine doses with no history of infection and re-infection as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). This indicates that the diversity of antibody responses mounted in this particular individual (C-03-0020) immediately post infection while collectively overcome the mutational landscape offered by the evolving SARS-CoV-2, development of cross neutralizing antibodies with higher magnitude following vaccine boosters observed was likely due to clonal expansion of the B cell linages developed in this individual through mutations within the antibody genes associated with affinity maturation as previously indicated elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). To further investigate whether what we observed with this particular individual (C-03-0020) is unique or not, we examined the ability and magnitude of antibody responses developed in seven additional individuals who were infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 in April 2020 before and after receiving at least two doses of vaccines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Although antibodies developed in these donors before vaccination varied in neutralizing Omicron variants, but the antibody/immune response mounted post vaccination, demonstrated neutralization of the same variants with increased potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) and which was comparable to that observed with C-03-0020 follow up plasma samples. Notably, we also made the following observations with the individuals previously infected with ancestral virus: (a) antibodies elicited post vaccination from one of them (C-10-0006) neutralized all the Omicron variants with significantly higher magnitude (potency) and (b) the ability to neutralize the same Omicron variants by plasma antibodies obtained post vaccinations from other donors varied - for example, antibodies elicited in donor C-03-0015 could neutralize all the Omicron examined in this study, while donor C-03-0008 could neutralize BA.1 and BA.2 but not BA.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Overall, these observations indicate that while vaccination post infection improved humoral immune responses, variability in their magnitude and potential to counter all Omicron variants was possibly be due to the differences in their ability to rapidly develop unique B cell repertoire post infection associated with mounting of robust polyclonal antibody responses. Individuals who were able to develop such strong polyclonal antibody responses post infection such as what we observed with C-03-0015 and C-03-0020 are more likely to be protected against emerging and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS156074-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d197aAdBbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S2"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the study participants, our collaborators and partners for their valuable support.

position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Importance</title></caption><p>Development of robust neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals is known, however varies at population level. We isolated monoclonal antibodies from an individual infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020 that not only varied in their B cell lineage origin but also varied in their capability and potency to neutralize all the known VOC and currently circulating Omicron variants. This indicated establishment of unique lineages that contributed in forming B cell repertoire in this particular individual immediately following infection giving rise to diverse antibody responses that could compensate each other in providing broadly neutralizing polyclonal antibody response. Individuals who were able to produce such potent polyclonal antibody responses after infection have a higher chance of being protected from evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Diversity of the antibody repertoire developed in an unvaccinated individual infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2.</title><p>A.

Post filtration, a total of 3448 sequences were retained (including 7 mAb sequences from the present study). Variable heavy and light chain IgG amino acid sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.453(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Maximum likelihood trees were constructed with IQTree (V 1.6.12) using a custom Ab amino acid substitution model(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Robustness of the tree was assessed using 1000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates as well as 1000 aSH-LRT replicates. Trees were visualized and annotated using ggtree package in R(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). C.

Experiments were done in duplicates and repeated at least three times. D. Neutralization potency of THSC20.HVTR04, THSC20.HVTR06, THSC20.HVTR11 and THSC20.HVTR26 mAbs against live authentic Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.5 assessed in focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT).

Comparison of the neutralization titer of antibodies developed in the C-03-0020 individual before and after vaccination with that developed in individuals with Omicron BTI and those who received two doses of vaccines (ChAdOx1nCoV19) with no history of infection. Red open and filled circles represent neutralization titer (ID50 doses) conferred by the plasma obtained from the C-03-0020 before and after receiving three doses of vaccine. ID50 refers to the reciprocal dilution of the heat-inactivated plasma samples that conferred 50% reduction in infection in a pseudovirus neutralization assay. The IC50 neutralization titers (IC50 values in μg/mL) of the four mAbs (THSC20.HVTR04, THSC20.HVTR06, THSC20.HVTR11 and THSC20.HVTR26) that showed variable neutralization potential against the Omicron variants are plotted as reference on the right.
