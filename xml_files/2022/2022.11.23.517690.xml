Both wild-type α-synuclein and its insertion mutant containing seven additional residues (MAAAEKT) after residue 22 were present in sarkosyl-insoluble material that was extracted from frontal cortex of the individual with JOS and examined by electron cryo-microscopy. The structures of JOS filaments, comprising either a single protofilament, or a pair of protofilaments, revealed a new α-synuclein fold that differs from the folds of Lewy body diseases and multiple system atrophy (MSA). The JOS fold consists of a compact core, the sequence of which (residues 36-100 of wild-type α-synuclein) is unaffected by the mutation, and two disconnected density islands (A and B) of mixed sequences. There is a non-proteinaceous cofactor bound between the core and island A. The JOS fold resembles the common substructure of MSA type I and type II dimeric filaments, with its core segment approximating the C-terminal body of MSA protofilaments B and its islands mimicking the N-terminal arm of MSA protofilaments A. The partial similarity of JOS and MSA folds extends to the locations of their cofactor-binding sites. Our findings provide insight into a likely mechanism of JOS fibrillation in which mutant α-synuclein of 147 amino acids forms a nucleus with the JOS fold, around which wild-type and mutant proteins assemble during elongation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>α-Synuclein</kwd><kwd>Duplication mutation in <italic>SNCA</italic></kwd><kwd>Juvenile-onset Synucleinopathy</kwd><kwd>Parkinson’s disease</kwd><kwd>Multiple system atrophy</kwd><kwd>Cryo-electron microscopy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">α-Synuclein is the major component of the filamentous inclusions found in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). We showed previously that assembled α–synuclein adopts distinct molecular conformers in the MSA and Lewy folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).

Since distinct α-synuclein folds characterise different diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), this unique case appears to represent a distinct disease, which we now name juvenile-onset synucleinopathy (JOS).</p><p id="P6">We also report the likely cause of JOS: a previously overlooked 21-nucleotide duplication in the second exon of one allele of <italic>SNCA</italic>.

The structure of these filaments was determined at 2.0 Å resolution and revealed a new α-synuclein fold that we call the JOS fold. In the structure of the remaining α-synuclein filaments (17%), determined at 2.3 Å resolution, there are two identical protofilaments with the JOS fold that pack against each other with C2 symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Both singlet and doublet filaments have a left-handed helical twist, as established from the densities for backbone oxygen atoms in the cryo-EM maps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>).</p><p id="P19">The JOS fold consists of a compact core, spanning residues 36-100 (in the numbering of wild-type α-synuclein), and two disconnected density islands (A and B). There is also a large non-proteinaceous density between the core and island A that may correspond to a bound cofactor and is similar in size and environment to the unidentified densities of Lewy and MSA folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). An additional density, next to the side chain of H50, may represent a post-translational modification. Other densities probably correspond to solvent molecules.</p><p id="P20">The core sequence is unaffected by the mutation and it has virtually the same conformation for residues K43-Q99 as the corresponding segment of MSA protofilament IIB2 (PDB:6XYQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). The conformation of this segment, which is stabilised in part by a characteristic salt bridge between residues E46 and K80, is also similar to the conformations of wild-type α-synuclein filaments following seeded aggregation using MSA brain seeds (PDB:7NCK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) and H50Q (PDB:6PEO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) or A53T (PDB:6LRQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) α-synuclein filaments assembled <italic>in vitro</italic>, with minor differences in the inversion of side chain orientations of residues K58 and T59 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In the core, most side chain densities are fully resolved in the 2.0 Å resolution map of JOS singlet filaments. In the islands, however, the side chain densities are not well resolved, precluding unambiguous sequence assignment. Since their main chain densities are fully resolved, we attribute the lack of distinct side chain densities to the islands consisting of a mixture of different sequences. These sequences probably come mainly from the amino- and/or carboxy-terminal regions of the same α-synuclein chain, but incorporation of exogenous peptide fragments cannot be excluded.</p><p id="P22">In the structure of island A, there are at least three clues that point to which sequences are incorporated. Island A makes a curved β-strand, the amino-terminal half of which is tightly packed against residues A53 and V55 of the core, whereas its carboxy-terminal half bends away opposite residue H50 and faces the non-proteinaceous density, separating it from residues K43 and K45. Its interface with the core resembles part of the protofilament interface of MSA filaments between the N-terminal arm of protofilaments A and the C-terminal body of protofilaments B. The MSA protofilament interface harbours a non-proteinaceous density that is surrounded by four lysine residues in approximately the same location, suggesting that the residues in island A that face a similar density in the JOS fold are also lysines. A residue with a small side chain, which is packed between A53 and V55, is almost certainly alanine. Side chain densities for Cβ atoms strongly suggest that island A comprises ten consecutive non-glycine residues.</p><p id="P23">Only two α-synuclein sequences satisfy all three clues:</p><p id="P24"><sub>14</sub>GVVAAAEKTKQG<sub>25</sub> in wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c-d</xref>) and</p><p id="P25"><sub>21</sub>KTMAAAEKTKQG<sub>32</sub> in the 147-residue insertion mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f-g</xref>).</p><p id="P26">There are insufficient clues to suggest which sequences the shorter island B is made of. However, we do note that our assignment of island A with the insertion mutant leaves an N-terminal segment that is long enough to reach and fill up the island B density. A model of the JOS fold made only of mutant protein, in which island B is assigned the sequence <sub>6</sub>KGLSKAKE<sub>13</sub> and is connected to island A (<sub>21</sub>KTMAAAEKTKQG<sub>32</sub>), is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>. In this model, residues 13-20, which connect islands B and A, mimic the conformation of the N-terminal arm of MSA protofilaments A. The absence of density for these residues in the cryo-EM map indicates that they are not ordered in the JOS filaments. An alternative explanation for the density of island B is that it can be reached from the last ordered residue of the core (L100) and that it consists of sequences from the C-terminal region of α-synuclein.</p><p id="P27">The cryo-EM reconstructions of JOS doublet filaments show that island A is essential for dimerisation, with the islands from both protofilaments facing each other across the filament axis. The 2.3 Å resolution map of the doublet filament further supports our sequence assignments for island A. Interestingly, there are no direct contacts between the ordered residues of both protofilaments. Like in dimeric filaments of TMEM106B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), an additional disconnected density of unknown identity resides on the symmetry axis and mediates their interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). This non-proteinaceous density, which is co-ordinated by neutral polar residues Q24 (Q31 in mutant α-synuclein) from both protofilaments, is probably of a different chemical nature than the large non-proteinaceous densities within each protofilament. The density of island B, which is farthest from the doublet filament axis, is less resolved than in the singlet filament map, but is similar in overall shape.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">We report a duplication of 21 nucleotides in one allele of <italic>SNCA</italic> in a case of JOS, which inserts seven amino acids (MAAAEKT) after residue 22 of α-synuclein. This is the first duplication mutation in <italic>SNCA</italic>. It was not present in the 141,456 individuals of the gnomAD project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). The clinical picture was more severe than in DLB and the age of onset (13 years) was atypical. Previously, missense mutations in the coding region of <italic>SNCA</italic> were reported in inherited cases of PD and DLB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Gene dosage mutations (duplications and triplications) of <italic>SNCA</italic> have also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Typically, individuals with these mutations have a family history of synucleinopathy. The individual with JOS had no family history, suggesting that the mutation occurred <italic>de novo</italic>.</p><p id="P29">The presence of extensive nerve cell loss and abundant filamentous α-synuclein inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) was confirmed and the latter were weakly Gallyas-Braak silver-positive. α-Synuclein inclusions of MSA are strongly Gallyas-Braak silver-positive, whereas those of PD and DLB are negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Luminescent conjugated oligothiophene pFTAA strongly labelled α-synuclein inclusions from the frontal cortex of the JOS individual, similar to what has been described in Parkinson’s disease and multiple system atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), by negative stain immuno-EM, these filaments had the same staining characteristics as those of PD, DLB and MSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). However, by cryo-EM, a different fold was present.</p><p id="P30">Immunoblotting of sarkosyl-insoluble material showed that both wild-type and mutant α-synucleins make up the JOS filaments. It is conceivable that mutant α-synuclein forms a nucleus, around which wild-type and mutant proteins assemble during elongation, giving rise to mixed filaments. This is reminiscent of mutation R406W in tau, where almost equal amounts of wild-type and mutant tau were present in the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P31">The JOS fold is the third known fold of assembled α-synuclein from human brain, the other two being the MSA and Lewy folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). The JOS fold differs from the Lewy fold, but it resembles the common substructure of MSA type I and type II filaments, with its core segment adopting nearly the same structure as the C-terminal body of MSA protofilaments B and their islands mimicking the N-terminal arms of MSA protofilaments A. This similarity of JOS and MSA folds extends to the locations of their cofactor-binding sites. In the brain of the JOS case, almost all a-synuclein inclusions were present in neurons, indicating that a fold similar to MSA folds can form in nerve cells. In the core part, the JOS fold is similar to the folds of recombinant α-synuclein filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). However, there is a small, but probably essential, difference between the JOS fold and the recombinant α-synuclein filament folds in one turn at K58. In the recombinant α-synuclein filament folds, this lysine side chain points inside the core, whereas it points outside in the JOS and MSA folds. In the MSA dimeric filaments, K58 of protofilament B makes a salt bridge with E35 of protofilament A. There is a second salt bridge between K60 of protofilament B and E28 of protofilament A.</p><p id="P32">In our model of JOS filaments that are only made of mutant α-synuclein, there are equivalent salt bridges between K65 and E20, and between K67 and E13, which stabilise the interaction between the filament core and the N-terminal region. This implies that mutant α-synuclein would be prone to form filament nuclei, possibly affected by the presence of a cofactor, that then could grow by incorporation of both wild-type and mutant proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS157737-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d77aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Electron Microscopy Facility of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology.
