For indoor air, small exhaled aerosols undergo rapid acidification to pH ∼4. IAV is known to be sensitive to mildly acidic conditions encountered within host endosomes, however, it is unknown whether the same mechanisms could mediate viral inactivation within the more acidic aerosol micro-environment. Here, we identified that transient exposure to pH 4 caused IAV inactivation by a two-stage process, with an initial sharp decline in infectious titers that was mainly attributed to premature attainment of the post-fusion conformation of viral protein haemagglutinin (HA). Changes to HA were observed by hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) as early as 10 seconds post-exposure to acidic conditions. In addition, virion integrity was partially but irreversibly affected by acidic conditions. This was attributed to a progressive unfolding of the internal matrix protein 1 (M1), and aligned with a more gradual decline in viral infectivity with time. In contrast, no acid-mediated changes to the genome or lipid envelope were detected. Our HDX-MS data are in agreement with other more labor-intensive structural analysis techniques such as X-ray crystallography, highlighting the usefulness of whole-virus HDX-MS for multiplexed protein analyses, even within enveloped viruses such as IAV. Improved understanding of respiratory virus fate within exhaled aerosols constitutes a global public health priority, and information gained here could aid development of novel strategies to control the airborne persistence of seasonal and/or pandemic influenza in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aerosols</kwd><kwd>Haemagglutinin</kwd><kwd>HDX-MS</kwd><kwd>Influenza virus</kwd><kwd>Matrix 1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Airborne transmission of infectious agents relies on the ability of pathogens to survive aerosol transport whilst they transit between hosts. Evidence in the literature increasingly points towards the expiratory aerosol as a major transmission mode for many respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), human rhinovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), respiratory syncytial virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), human adenovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), and influenza A virus (IAV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). The aerosol route dominates under certain environmental conditions, particularly indoor environments that are poorly ventilated. In one study, airborne transmission was estimated to account for half of all IAV transmission events within households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Viruses are also vulnerable during airborne transit, however, there continues to be a fundamental lack of understanding as to mechanisms that could drive virus inactivation within expiratory aerosols.</p><p id="P3">Upon exhalation, aerosols rapidly lose moisture and heat, with a large concomitant change in volume as equilibrium is established with the indoor environment. Numerous studies have attempted to assess how this process affects viral infectivity, with temperature, salt concentration, relative humidity, presence of respiratory surfactants, and air/liquid interface interactions all postulated to play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Importantly, aerosol pH has recently been recognized as a principle determinant of virus fate within aerosols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). When exhaled into typical indoor air, the pH of exhaled aerosol particles quickly deviates from neutral, and decreases to ∼4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Such a low pH can trigger the inactivation of acid-sensitive viruses. IAV in particular is sensitive to acidic conditions encountered in the endosome (37°C, ∼pH 5.5), with pH-induced conformational change to HA driving this sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). The pH-activated form of HA – also referred to as post-fusion conformation – allows HA to mediate membrane fusion between the endosome and the viral envelope, and allows viral uncoating and entry to proceed. However, if the post-fusion conformation is attained prematurely, HA will be unable to bind host cells and the virus is effectively inactivated. It is yet to be confirmed whether the same mechanism drives IAV inactivation under the more acidic conditions found within exhaled aerosols. Aerosol pH is within the range of general protein unfolding induced by acids (occurs between pH 2 and 5, whilst base-induced protein unfolding usually requires pH 10 or higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>)), and whether IAV inactivation within aerosols could be due to global protein denaturation or specifically due to HA remains to be understood.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we investigated the effects of aerosol-associated pH on IAV structural integrity, and determined the resulting effects on the viral infectious cycle. To decouple pH effects from other factors present within an evaporating aerosol micro-environment, we performed this study in bulk solutions with controlled pH values representative of aerosol particles in indoor air. IAV also presents certain challenges for structural analysis, as it is a complex virion comprised of 11 individual proteins, some of which are membrane embedded. To gain high-resolution information on potential changes occurring to IAV proteins under acidic aerosol conditions, we utilized hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass-spectrometry (HDX-MS). This method assesses local as well as global conformational changes of proteins in their near-native environment. By incubating a protein of interest in deuterated buffer (D<sub>2</sub>O), amide hydrogens will passively exchange for deuterium, and the rate of exchange is dependent on the structural environment of individual amides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Changes in local protein structure can therefore be distinguished by comparing amide exchanges rates of equivalent peptides after exposure of proteins to different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Importantly, this technique allows investigation of proteins in the whole-virion conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), as deuterium will diffuse as much as normal water through an intact viral capsid.</p><p id="P5">Two prior studies have applied HDX-MS to whole IAV, though both focused on the effect of host endosomal pH (∼5.5) on the surface-exposed HA protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). We sought to multiplex our HDX-MS analysis by analyzing three different viral proteins at once; surface-exposed HA, the mid-layer matrix protein 1 (M1), and the internal nucleoprotein (NP). Internal IAV proteins have never been characterized using HDX-MS before, under native nor acidic conditions. To complement the study on protein structure and obtain a global analysis of the state of IAV, integrity of the viral genome and of viral lipids were also assessed.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>IAV is rapidly inactivated under expiratory aerosol conditions</title><p id="P6">The majority of exhaled aerosols from humans are &lt;5 μm, with a large fraction being &lt;1 μm for most respiratory activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Previous studies have specifically identified influenza virus in aerosols of these sizes from infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Upon exhalation, aerosols rapidly lose water and equilibrate with acidic and basic trace gases present in indoor air, including nitric acid and ammonia. We previously published a biophysical Respiratory Aerosol Model (ResAM) used to show an exhaled particle of 1 μm initial radius will acidify to pH ∼4 due to this equilibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Depending on the initial size of the particle, the pH development will vary. Here, ResAM was used to estimate the pH trajectory of exhaled particles of 3 different initial sizes (0.2 μm, 1 μm, and 5 μm radius), representative of the range of ‘fine’ aerosols produced by humans. ResAM predicted that the same terminal acidic pH of ∼4 would be reached for all 3 particle sizes, with the smallest modelled particle size reaching this point less than 10 seconds post-exhalation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). With larger particles, more time is needed for the diffusion of trace acids into the particle, thus the acidification process was predicted to be slower, though a terminal pH of ∼4 was reached in all cases.</p><p id="P7">We first investigated the kinetics of IAV inactivation under conditions representative of aerosols equilibrated with indoor air (room-temperature, pH 4). Infectivity data (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) show that transient exposure to pH 4 at room temperature results in rapid virus inactivation, with infectious viral titers decaying by approximately 3-log<sub>10</sub> within 10 seconds of pH 4 exposure, and by &gt;5-log<sub>10</sub> by 30 seconds. Conversely, IAV spiked into pH 7 solution or PBS (both neutral controls) and held at the same temperature showed minimal decay for the full 24-hour monitoring period. Virus samples exposed to pH 4 also showed no productive infection in host epithelial cells at 3 hours (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) or 6 hours post-infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. S1</xref>) when compared to neutral controls, suggesting that an early step of the viral infection cycle was specifically impaired by low pH treatment.</p><p id="P8">To investigate whether this viral decay could be mediated specifically by HA (rather than general protein unfolding), pseudotyped Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) strains were used. VSV was pseudotyped with H1N1 IAV surface proteins HA and neuraminidase (NA), generating VSV-H1N1. Inactivation kinetics of the pseudotyped VSV strain at pH 4 were very similar to inactivation of wild-type IAV, with ∼3-log<sub>10</sub> decrease in infectivity after 10 seconds pH-exposure, and residual infectivity being below detection limits by 30 seconds (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). As IAV NA does not function in viral attachment or uncoating inside host cells, this result indicates that the majority of virus inactivation for pseudotyped VSV was mediated by non-reversible changes to HA. Control VSV, which expresses wild-type G protein rather than HA for host-cell attachment, showed no loss of infectivity as a result of the same pH treatment. Importantly, VSV G protein undergoes a similar low pH conformational change like IAV HA to mediate envelope fusion with host cells, but the change to G protein is entirely reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Additionally, fluorescence imaging of whole pH-treated IAV particles showed increased staining for the post-fusion form of HA after 10 seconds of pH 4 exposure (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), whilst the post-fusion form of HA was minimally present on pH 7-treated viruses. Some low-level signal was observed at pH 7, however this was attributed to background staining.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Transient acidic exposure induces localized conformational changes in external IAV protein haemagglutinin (HA)</title><p id="P9">Data in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> suggested the loss of IAV infectivity in the pH 4 condition was indeed due to a conformation change of HA into its post-fusion form, rather than general protein denaturation. To confirm this and map specific regions of HA affected by pH 4 exposure, we utilized whole-virus HDX-MS. Intact IAV particles were rapidly acidified to pH 4 in bulk solution prior to neutralization, whilst controls were held in neutral conditions for the same exposure time. All samples were then incubated in D<sub>2</sub>O buffer on ice for a dedicated time before H/D exchange reactions were quenched to lock exchanged deuterium in place. During quenching, whole viruses were also lysed with a urea and formic acid mixture, releasing internal proteins for subsequent protease digestion and HDX-MS analysis. Viral lysis was incorporated as the final step to retain the virus in its near native conformation during pH treatment, neutralization, and D<sub>2</sub>O incubation (HDX-MS schematic in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The HA protein itself is present as a homotrimer on the surface of whole IAV, with a membrane-embedded region and internal region anchoring the protein to the viral matrix layer (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Each HA monomer is comprised of two subunits, HA1 and HA2, connected by a short and relatively flexible hinge region. IAV in the neutral pH 7 condition was first used to characterize the global D<sub>2</sub>O incorporation levels of this surface-exposed glycoprotein. HA showed an alternance of fast- and slow-exchanging regions, suggesting the presence of dynamic and more structured regions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Peptide coverage was high for the HA1 region and much reduced for membrane-associated HA2 region. Reduced coverage for HA2 has been observed in prior HDX-MS studies analyzing HA of a different IAV strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Overall, 74% of residues within HA1 and 30% of those within HA2 of IAV were covered by our whole-virus HDX-MS analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. S2</xref>). Peptides analyzed in our study showed good correlation in their deuteration levels with previous study of HA by HDX-MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), with the same alternance in high- and low-exchanging regions despite use of different virus subtypes and strains (H3N2 X-31 vs H1N1 A/WSN/33).</p><p id="P11">Following characterization of HA dynamics at neutral pH, H/D exchange rates after transient pH 4 treatment of the whole virus were characterized. Three different D<sub>2</sub>O incubation times (30 sec, 300 sec, and 3,600 sec) were used here to allow detection of pH-induced changes occurring in highly flexible as well as in more structured regions. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> shows comparison of H/D exchange rates between neutral and pH 4 conditions, which identified several peptides of interest displaying increased exchange post-acid treatment (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Table S3</xref> for exchange levels in all detected HA peptides). These peptides with increased exchange were detected after just 10 seconds at low pH, and increasing the pH exposure time to 30 seconds did not appear to amplify these differences. Neutralization of all samples prior to HDX-MS ensured these pH-induced changes were non-reversible, and thus are likely to indicate the state of the HA protein on whole IAV after re-inhalation and neutralization of an acidified aerosol on the mucus membrane of a new host.</p><p id="P12">Six discrete peptides showed significant differences as a result of pH, 5 of which were localized within the HA1 chain (peptides numbered in bottom panel of <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The first identified peptide was from residue 51-58 (Peptide 1 in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). H/D exchange rates for this peptide after 30 seconds of D<sub>2</sub>O incubation were comparable between pH conditions (pH 4 vs 7), though significant differences emerged after longer D<sub>2</sub>O exposures of 300 and 3,600 seconds (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table S1</xref> for all statistical comparisons). Peptide 1 is located within the fusion domain (F’) of the HA1 subunit. Elevated H/D exchange here after pH 4 treatment is likely due to disruption of stabilizing contacts between this domain and the proximally located HA2 subunit [reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>)] as the protein transitions to a post-fusion conformation. Peptide 5 (residues 317-328) is located in the same fusion region, and showed a similar enhancement of H/D exchange post-pH 4 treatment. Two peptides that were unaffected by pH are also included in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, to highlight that H/D exchange rates were altered in specific parts of the HA protein only.</p><p id="P13">Peptides 2 (residues 81-92) and 3 (residues 89-95) are overlapping, though showed a differential kinetic in detected H/D exchange, suggesting that the 80-90 region is more dynamic than the 90-95 region. These observations were not anticipated as the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of HA [PDB: 1RU7 from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>)] suggests the presence of an α-helix in the 80-90 region, which was expected to be more protected from H/D exchange than the unstructured 90-95 region (positions highlighted in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Peptide 4 (residues 113-117) lies in the vestigial esterase (E′) subdomain of HA1 and spans an alpha-helical region and loops. Highly significant increases in H/D exchange rate for this peptide were observed at every D<sub>2</sub>O incubation time, suggesting that the secondary structure element might rapidly unfold upon pH 4 treatment. Peptide 4 is also buried within the center of the HA homotrimer in the pre-fusion conformation, making close contact with the β-loop of the HA2 subunit in neutral conditions. In the post-fusion confirmation, the RBD of HA1 is rotated away from the central stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), releasing contact with HA2 and leaving these previously protected peptides more exposed to the external environment.</p><p id="P14">Peptide 6 (residues 521-532) sits immediately prior to the anchoring transmembrane region of HA2. During transition to post-fusion HA, this membrane proximal region is reported to become disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), which is in-line with the large increase in H/D exchange rate observed after pH 4 exposure here. A similar increase in H/D exchange within the C-terminal region of HA for the H3N2 IAV strain X-31 was observed post-fusion by Garcia <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Interestingly, we observed one peptide within HA showing bimodal distribution, also referred as EX1 kinetics (residue 402-418, colored black in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), which is addressed in the next section.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Peptide bimodal distribution is induced by acidic exposure for the β-loop of HA protein</title><p id="P15">One peptide (HA2, 402-418) showing bimodal H/D exchange behavior was detected after pH 7 and pH 4 treatments, suggesting the presence of distinct populations with different conformations. This peptide is located within the β-loop of the HA2 subunit (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), which is one of the primary regions known to modify its conformation in pH-triggered HA, changing from a flexible loop to a stabilized α-helix. When in neutral conditions, unimodal H/D exchange was initially detected for this peptide. Representative spectra (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) show the mass shift and fraction of each population for the 402-418 peptide after a 30 second D<sub>2</sub>O incubation, with a single peak indicating unimodal distribution for pH 7 samples. A second population (orange) then became distinguishable after longer D<sub>2</sub>O incubation times, indicating bimodal distribution, though these two peaks were mostly overlapping for the entire D<sub>2</sub>O incubation period (up to 1 hour). Conversely, this bimodal distribution was observed even after short D<sub>2</sub>O incubation times following pH 4 treatment of the whole virus. The second peak was also substantially more deuterated than in control samples. Deconvolution analysis was applied to quantify the fraction of each population, and showed that this second, highly deuterated population dominated after exposure to pH 4 conditions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Bimodal exchange behavior is indicative of the presence of two distinct conformations, with long-range allosteric rearrangements occurring upon transiting from one state to another. Benhaim <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) reported a similar observation for the HA β-loop of the H3N2 strain X-31 after acidification at pH 5 at a host-temperature of 37°C. Their study showed appearance of an intermediate and highly deuterated peak after ∼1 minute of pH exposure, which progressively disappeared to be overtaken by a highly protected segment as pH exposure progressed. In our conditions, exposure times are too short to show this progressive disappearance of the second peak, and indicates HA is in the very initial stages of conformational change.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Transient exposure to low pH has a small effect on virion integrity, but not on genome integrity or lipid content</title><p id="P17">In addition to monitoring conformational changes on the surface-exposed HA trimeric protein, we determined whether structural integrity of virus particles and of genomic material was affected when whole IAV was pH-exposed. We suspected additional mechanisms of inactivation were occurring as HA conformational changes observed by HDX-MS were very similar upon 10- or 30-seconds of pH 4 exposure, though infectious titers continued to drop (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Initially, the structure of the viral capsid was assessed post-pH treatment by TEM imaging, and showed that IAV in neutral conditions (PBS and pH 7) was spherical/ovoid, with virions relatively well dispersed across the grids (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Spikes of HA were also readily visible and well organized across the viral surface. In contrast, after exposing the virus to pH 4 (30 seconds), virions were aggregated, and those appearing as single particles or smaller clusters had reduced structural integrity. Most noticeably, the organization of HA spikes on the surface of individual virions was compromised after pH treatment, providing additional evidence that HA had undergone an irreversible conformational change following transient acidic exposure. The post-fusion HA trimeric complex is known to expose hydrophobic regions within the HA2 stem that are buried pre-fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Increased hydrophobicity of virions due to HA conformation change is likely to mediate the partial aggregation of viral particles observed at pH 4. It is important to note our prior work has established that viral aggregation is not the driver of infectious titer loss in our system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Some virions also appeared to be in the process of lysis by TEM, though overall, most viral particles appeared structurally intact after pH 4 treatment.</p><p id="P19">Virion integrity was additionally investigated by determining if RNA release occurred during pH treatment. Whole viral samples were exposed to pH 4 or pH 7 for 30 seconds, prior to neutralization back to pH 7. Samples were then split in 2 groups; one treated with RNase, and the second mixed with PBS (no RNase) before incubation of all samples at 37°C for 30 min. Samples were then subject to viral RNA extraction and quantification by RT-qPCR. Samples with no RNase treatment showed comparable genome amplification regardless of pH pre-treatment (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), indicating the segment of the IAV genome amplified here was not affected by pH alone. Additionally, exposure of whole virus to acidic pH for up to 30 minutes resulted in no change to the amplified genome segment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. S3</xref>). For samples mixed with RNase however, we observed varying levels of amplifiable RNA copies. Copies in PBS and pH 7 control samples did not drop significantly after RNase treatment, indicating the amplified genome segment was sufficiently protected from degradation by a whole, intact virion. Conversely, pH 4-treated samples showed a significant loss of amplifiable genome after RNase exposure, suggesting some virions were no longer intact to protect the genome from RNase-mediated degradation. Overall, the drop in total genome copies was approximately 2-log<sub>10</sub> for pH 4-treated samples after 30 seconds. Whilst significant, this is not the same magnitude of titer decrease observed for infectivity (upwards of 5-log<sub>10</sub> loss of viral titer in the same time-frame), indicating that loss of virus integrity is likely to be contributing to inactivation, but is not the primary driver.</p><p id="P20">Finally, we assessed if pH treatment could affect the lipid classes within the IAV lipid envelope. Here, we measured the relative abundance of 500 lipid species using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) untargeted lipidomics, after whole-virus exposure to pH 4, 5, or 7 for 30 seconds. Data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref> shows no significant change in lipid levels upon pH 4 or pH 5 treatment over the time-frame of interest. While key viral lipids (e.g. sterols) have not been considered here, and future work will assess potential lipid alterations in more detail, data indicates there are no major alterations to the lipid envelope composition after acidic pH exposure over the time-scale of interest.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Ambient acidic exposure has no effect on internal nucleoprotein (NP)</title><p id="P21">As some virions were ruptured as a result of pH treatment, it was of interest to determine whether the conformation of the internal protein NP was also affected. Here, the multiplex capabilities of whole-virus HDX-MS were useful, as the same set of samples used for prior HA analysis were now analyzed for structural changes to NP. At neutral conditions (pH 7), NP showed a number of inherently flexible regions, particularly towards the C-terminal end of the protein (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). When comparing pH 7 to pH 4 treated samples, no significant changes in H/D exchange rates were detected for any peptides within NP (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B – C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supp. Table S4</xref> for full list of NP peptides), indicating no conformational changes or localized unfolding were occurring despite partial viral lysis and exposure to acidic conditions. NP gave the highest peptide coverage of this study, with 75% of the entire sequence covered by at least one peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. S5</xref>). It cannot be excluded that non-covered regions may show pH-induced conformational changes, and this could be the focus of follow-up work.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Ambient acidic exposure induces C-terminal flexibility in internal protein Matrix 1 (M1)</title><p id="P22">Lastly, we sought to determine whether the major capsid protein, M1, was structurally altered in pH-treated samples. M1 is an α-helical protein with two major domains; a globular N-terminal domain (NTD), and a comparably unstructured C-terminal domain (CTD), which are connected by a coiled linker sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). M1 proteins form a ‘shell’ layer underneath the viral envelope, and exposure of M1 to low pH during virus entry is thought to cause the M1 layer to dissociate, ultimately allowing viral disassembly and genome release into the host cell cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). However, the M1 conformational changes that accompany this event are substantially less well characterized than those of HA.</p><p id="P23">HDX-MS analysis of M1 under neutral conditions (pH 7) revealed a highly dynamic CTD, indicated by multiple peptides showing &gt;50% H/D exchange (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Flexibility of the M1 C-terminus is in line with the current literature on M1, and has been reported to cause issues with resolution of this region using the standard and far more labor-intensive crystallographic methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). As with HA, the close membrane association of the N-terminal region of the M1 protein caused some coverage limitations, with substantially less peptides generated from the membrane binding domain for HDX-MS. Despite this, 68% of the overall M1 protein sequence was covered by at least one unique peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. S6</xref>). When comparing pH 4-treated samples to this neutral state, H/D exchange rates of detected peptides in the M1 NTD were unaffected by pH treatment, with one exception (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). The loop encompassing residues 128-141 surprisingly showed protection from H/D exchange following pH 4 exposure (Peptide 1 in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C – D</xref>). This was shown for two overlapping peptides covering the same region (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), and this observation suggests that this region adopts a more structured conformation upon pH 4 exposure. In agreement with this, prior work comparing X-ray crystal structures of M1 at neutral and acidic conditions indicated that structural differences were negligible within the NTD, apart from a loop centered around residue 135 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Again, this demonstrates the benefits of HDX-MS for structural analysis that is far less labor intensive than typical methods, whilst also enabling the virus to be retained in its whole native conformation.</p><p id="P24">In sharp contrast to the ordered NTD, the CTD encompassing alpha-helices H10 to H12 exhibited significantly increased H/D exchange rates post-pH 4 exposure (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B – D</xref>). These results also correlate well with past work using small-angle X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy, which suggested that a low-pH induced conformational change in M1 was most pronounced in the CTD and in the linker region between N and CTDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Several peptides encompassing residues 202-212 in helix H11 also showed a bimodal distribution at neutral conditions, which was significantly more pronounced following pH 4 exposure (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E – F</xref>). This H/D exchange regime is reminiscent of long-range conformational changes and suggest that exposure to acidic treatment promotes transition of an alpha-helix to a loop structure. The absence of peptides showing EX1 kinetics in helix H10 and H12, in contrast with neighboring helix H11, may be explained by the more structured conformation of the latter helix. Indeed, helices H10 and H12 have very high deuteration levels after only 30 seconds deuteration, whereas helix H11 is more protected from exchange even after 1-hour incubation in deuterated buffer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supp. Table S5</xref>). The high magnitude of differences in H/D exchange rates observed for the CTD suggest a large unfolding of the alpha-helical structures upon acidic pH treatment, which may disrupt intra-molecular contacts known to exist between the CTD and NTD of neighboring M1 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>) and may lead to partial disassembly of the M1 shell.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">Environmental transmission relies on viruses staying infectious long enough to come into contact with the next host. Non-enveloped viruses are typically considered more stable than enveloped viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>), particularly in aqueous environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). Despite this sensitivity, many enveloped viruses do undergo effective environmental transmission, with expelled liquid droplets and aerosols being major transmission vectors. Low droplet pH has been shown to inactivate enveloped phi6 bacteriophage during fomite transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>), and our prior work identified low pH as a major factor driving inactivation of IAV in aerosol particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). This was supported by infectivity data here (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), which showed &gt;5-log<sub>10</sub> decrease in infectious IAV titers within 30 seconds of low pH exposure. Small aerosol particles rapidly acidify in indoor air, though acidification is predicted to be slower for larger aerosol particles (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Thus it may be that larger aerosol particles are the predominant carriers of infectious IAV. However, studies indicate that IAV is likely carried within the small aerosol size fraction, with both respiratory viral genomes and infectious IAV found to be enriched in fine aerosol particles ≤ 5 μm compared with coarser aerosols in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). Thus IAV is likely carried within small aerosols, and would quickly be exposed to acidic conditions upon aerosol exhalation.</p><p id="P26">In the present study, we sought to improve understanding of the effects that this acidic microenvironment may exert on the structure of IAV during environmental transmission. We placed particular focus on the effects of low pH on structural lipid, genome, and protein components of IAV, to investigate the processes mediating rapid virus inactivation. Understanding the mechanisms leading to aerosol-associated pathogen inactivation will be useful for public health, as these pathways could be targeted by novel treatments to enhance pathogen inactivation in the air. All experiments were performed with whole virus rather than purified molecules to mimic the natural virus setting where many stabilizing protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions are present. Collectively, our whole-virus data showed that viral proteins rather than lipids or genome were undergoing measurable changes over the time-course relevant to the observed pH-mediated viral decay. Multiplexed whole-virus HDX-MS data pointed to both HA (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> – <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and M1 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) proteins as drivers of virus inactivation. The remaining structural proteins of IAV (M2, NA) and the replication associated proteins (PA, PB1, PB2) were at too low of a copy number per virion to analyze using our whole-virus HDX-MS method. Viral ribonucleoprotein has previously been found to aggregate at low pH (∼5), though this aggregation was mostly reversed by pH neutralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>) suggesting no permanent changes occur. The amplified region of the IAV genome was also unaffected in our study by low pH exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. S3</xref>), and NP, which coats the IAV genome segments, showed no pH-induced conformational changes by HDX-MS analysis (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B – C</xref>). Thus, structural damage to replication-associated components of IAV are unlikely to be contributing to the loss of viral infectivity observed in acidic conditions.</p><p id="P27">Functionality data also confirmed the premature attainment of the post-fusion form of HA as a primary cause of rapid IAV inactivation under acidic aerosol conditions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C – E</xref>). The pH-mediated change of HA is well-documented in the literature, however conditions described to trigger this involve longer and hotter incubations at pH ∼5.5. Despite the very rapid time scale, the ambient temperature, and the substantially lower pH used here (1.5 pH units below fusion), HA was still shown to transition to the post-fusion state, or at the very least was triggered to enter a stable intermediate state that prevents viral attachment and entry. Other studies have reported intermediate HA states between pre- and post-fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>), some of which seem to also be reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>). The retained flexibility and bimodal H/D exchange behavior of the β-loop in particular (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A – C</xref>) indicated that for our pH-exposed samples, HA was in an intermediate state, similar to that shown by Benhaim <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) for H3N2 HA in early points post-pH exposure. Importantly, re-neutralization of our samples prior to any HDX-MS analysis indicated an irreversible transition had occurred, leading to definitive loss of viral infectivity after acidification. Additional experiments testing longer exposure times or higher temperatures (37°C as opposed to ambient) would help in classifying the degree of flexibility in the β-loop post-pH exposure in our system.</p><p id="P28">Interestingly, changes detected in HA at 10 seconds were not amplified by 30 seconds (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), despite viral titers continuing to drop (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Thus, whilst HA appeared to mediate the majority of inactivation, changes to M1 and the associated capsid disassembly could drive additional infectious titer loss. In fact, inactivation kinetics in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> could be classified as two-step kinetics, with a sharp initial drop in infectivity from 0 to 10 seconds post-pH exposure, followed by a slower rate of decay up to 30 seconds. This second portion of inactivation could be attributed to M1 conformational changes and associated capsid disassembly. In cryo-EM studies, incubation of H3N2 IAV at low pH was reported to induce loss of spherical virion morphology and a disruption and/or coiling of the matrix layer away from the viral envelope in some virions, whilst other virions in the same suspension showed unaffected morphology and a resolvable matrix later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). This suggests M1 disassembly affects some but not all virions in a population at the same rate. This was similarly observed for H1N1 A/WSN/33 here, with some but not all virions showing loss of spherical morphology by TEM after low pH treatment (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The virion integrity assay (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) also indicated that lysed viral particles could account for ∼2-log<sub>10</sub> in viral titer reduction by 30 seconds post-pH exposure. This would supplement the initial sharp 3-log<sub>10</sub> reduction seen over the first 10 seconds, which we attribute to HA changes. Whilst the first ∼30 seconds of acid exposure was of the most interest here, it could also be beneficial to classify the state of these IAV proteins after longer exposure times (e.g. 5 minutes, 30 minutes) in a subsequent study, to assess ongoing changes.</p><p id="P29">We acknowledge the limitations of this study for determining the effect of low aerosol pH on IAV in combination with other aerosol factors, including the presence of protective proteins and other organic components. We recognize that the salt-based pH buffers used here do not reflect the complexity and variability of lung and nasal fluids from human patients, in which IAV would be suspended in a physiological aerosol setting, and these may offer partial protection and reduce acid-mediated conformational changes to HA and/or M1. For example, IAV has been demonstrated to readily bind sialic acids present on respiratory mucins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). These mucins are part of the protective mucus layer secreted by epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, and presentation of sialylated glycans by respiratory mucins is intended to act as a decoy receptor for the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). This IAV-mucin interaction has also been shown to be weaker than the true IAV-host cell interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>) and is often reversible due to the action of viral neuraminidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>). It is therefore feasible that a transient interaction such as this could be stabilizing for the virus during aerosol transport between hosts. In fact, Hirose <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated IAV suspended in simulated gastric acid (pH 2) rapidly lost infectivity, but could be protected from acid-mediated inactivation for at least 4 hours if co-incubated with artificial mucus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>). It will be the focus of a follow-up study to determine if mucins can mediate stabilization of IAV proteins through aerosol-associated stress. However, our prior work has shown that protective effects of multiple respiratory matrices are no longer functional in bulk solution at a lower pH of 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), thus their inclusion would not have altered the outcomes of this particular study. Additionally, the aim of the current study was to intentionally decouple the effect of low pH from other factors (whether inactivating or protective) within an evaporating aerosol, for mechanistic characterization. The pH sensitivity of the A/WSN/33 strain used here is also similar to that of other strains, both lab-adapted and clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>), and WSN was intentionally used as a surrogate as clinical strains are typically harder to work with and don’t grow to the high titers required for HDX-MS analysis. Regardless, the panel of strains tested could be expanded in future work to gain additional sensitivity information.</p><p id="P30">Beyond the scope of this study, it will also be of interest to determine whether other respiratory viruses (e.g. MERS CoV, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, etc.) will be similarly affected by acidic aerosol pH, and whether a broad acting air treatment could be employed as a non-pharmaceutical intervention to reduce infectious viral loads in the air. Alternatively, a spray based therapeutic could be utilized to accelerate the acidification of exhaled aerosols in high-risk settings, enhancing the speed of viral inactivation. A prior study investigated the efficacy of a low pH (∼3.5) nasal spray for mitigating the effects of IAV infection in a ferret model. The nasal sprays tested were based on simple acid mixtures (including L-pyroglutamic acid, succinic acid, citric acid and ascorbic acid), and their topical application to infected ferrets reduced severity of viral-induced symptoms and reduced viral shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>). As multiple epitopes on HA were found to be affected by pH here, the non-specificity of low pH to drive IAV inactivation means that this approach may be less prone to resistance development than current antiviral drugs. IAV is also specifically reliant upon acidic pH exposure for progression of its natural infection cycle <italic>in vivo</italic>, thus development of resistance to acidic treatments is highly unlikely.</p><p id="P31">Overall, information gained here improves our understanding of the innate inactivation mechanisms for IAV under indoor aerosol conditions. Whole-virus HDX-MS has only been used previously to characterize the HA protein of H3N2 IAV strain X-31. We determined that IAV was not inactivated due to global protein denaturation, but instead have confirmed that localized structural changes occur to HA under aerosol-associated pH 4 conditions, similar to those changes induced by the acidic host cell endosome. We have also identified an additional mechanism of M1-driven inactivation. Expanding the existing body of IAV-specific HDX-MS data to encompass additional influenza virus strains and subtypes will be useful for the field in general to enable study of mechanistic similarities/differences between viral proteins, e.g. in terms of pH susceptibilities of different HA and M1 molecules. This could be used to predict environmental stability and transmission risks of emerging strains, assess the suitability of air treatment strategies, or to perform comparison of epitope flexibilities to predict the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies or antivirals.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Virus Stocks</title><p id="P32">Influenza A virus (IAV) strain A/WSN/33 [H1N1 subtype] was propagated in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (ThermoFisher).

Vertical error bars indicate the pH range between the innermost and outermost aerosol shells at each timepoint, with the mean pH presented as a continuous line. Thermodynamic and kinetic properties are those of synthetic lung fluid (SLF), a representative respiratory matrix.

IAV was spiked into neutral solutions of PBS or pH 7 buffer, or spiked into acidic pH 4 buffer. Aliquots were taken at multiple time-points post spiking (up to 86,400 sec, or 24 hours), and neutralized for quantification of remaining viral titer by plaque assay. For pH 4 samples, virus was spiked at 10<sup>6</sup> PFU/mL, or at 10<sup>7</sup> PFU/mL (10x IAV), to demonstrate that viral concentration did not affect the rate of viral decay. Data points indicate the mean ± SD of triplicate measurements at each time-point, presented as log<sub>10</sub> of remaining concentration (C) at each time-point relative to the initial concentration (C<sub>0</sub>).

Both VSV stocks were acidified to pH 4, and samples were neutralized after 10 or 30 sec of pH exposure. Control samples of each VSV strain were held at pH 7. Entry capacity of treated VSV samples was then determined by measuring the luciferase activity 7 hours post infection in MDCK cells. Data was derived from 3 independent experiments, with samples quantified in duplicate.
