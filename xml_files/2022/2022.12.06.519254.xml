Myogenesis is governed by myogenic regulatory transcription factors, including MYOD. However, very few MYOD-regulated effector proteins were shown to be sufficient to promote myogenesis. Here, we identified an unexpected role for the secreted matricellular protein ADAMTS-like 2 (ADAMTSL2) as a rheostat for Wnt signaling during myogenesis downstream of MYOD. ADAMTSL2 expression was induced during myoblast differentiation and ADAMTSL2 was required for myoblast differentiation. ADAMTSL2 ablation in myogenic precursor cells resulted in aberrant muscle architecture in vivo. The pro-myogenic ADAMTSL2 function was dependent on WNT ligands. Mechanistically, ADAMTSL2 potentiated WNT signaling by binding to WNT ligands and WNT receptors. Finally, we identified a WNT-binding ADAMTSL2 peptide that was sufficient to promote myogenesis. Since ADAMTSL2 was previously described as a negative regulator of TGFβ signaling in fibroblasts, ADAMTSL2 now emerges as a signaling node that could integrate and fine-tune WNT, TGFβ and potentially other signaling pathways within the dynamic microenvironment of differentiating myoblasts during skeletal muscle development and regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>acromelic dysplasia</kwd><kwd>ADAMTS proteases</kwd><kwd>ADAMTSL proteins</kwd><kwd>geleophysic dysplasia</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Skeletal muscles account for up to 40% of total body weight and are required for locomotion, respiration, feeding, and communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Janssen et al. 2000</xref>).

Remarkably, knockdown of ADAMTSL2 abolished myoblast differentiation indicating an essential role in myogenesis. Indeed, ADAMTSL2 was expressed during myoblast differentiation downstream of MYOD and its overexpression promoted myoblast to myotube differentiation. Mechanistically, ADAMTSL2 potentiated WNT signaling by binding to multiple WNT ligands and the canonical WNT co-receptor LRP6, suggesting that ADAMTSL2 may increase the signaling potency of endogenous WNT ligands during muscle differentiation. Conditional deletion of <italic>Adamtsl2</italic> in MYF5-positive myogenic progenitor cells during development resulted in increased muscle weight, mimicking muscle manifestations in patients with GD.

To validate a previous report showing induction of <italic>Adamtsl2</italic> expression in differentiating myoblasts, we measured the kinetics of <italic>Adamtsl2</italic> expression in C2C12 myoblasts up to 7 days post induction of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Koo et al. 2007</xref>). C2C12 myoblasts significantly upregulated ADAMTSL2 mRNA levels post induction of differentiation with a peak at 2 days and sustained levels until day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Notably, increased ADAMTSL2 mRNA expression preceded MYH4 (MyHC) induction and myotube formation. On the protein level, ADAMTSL2 was detected in MyHC-positive myocytes and myotubes but not MyHC-negative myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>, D).

As a result, the fusion index, i.e. the percentage of nuclei within multinucleated MyHC-positive myotubes, was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>).

Consistent with a lack of differentiation, we observed downregulation of myogenic transcription factors (<italic>Pax7</italic>, <italic>Myod1</italic>, <italic>Mrf4</italic>, <italic>Myog</italic>), myosin heavy chain (<italic>Myh4</italic>) and genes required for myocyte fusion (<italic>Mymk</italic>, <italic>Mymx</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We confirmed downregulation of these genes in an independent sample set and conversely found upregulation of the same genes when ADAMTSL2 was overexpressed in C2C12 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, C). Since myoblast differentiation requires cell cycle exit, we measured cell proliferation using Ki67 immunostaining. Myoblast proliferation was significantly increased in <italic>Adamtsl2</italic>-KD cells and decreased in ADAMTSL2-overexpressing cells, consistent with lack or promotion of myoblast differentiation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-G</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Since the <italic>Adamtsl2</italic>-KD phenotype is reminiscent of increased proliferation and lack of differentiation observed in MYOD-deficient myoblasts, we cross-referenced DEGs from <italic>Adamtsl2-</italic>KD C2C12 myoblasts with published DEGs from <italic>Myod1</italic> knockout (<italic>Myod1</italic>-KO) C2C12 myoblasts, both under differentiation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zhao et al. 2019</xref>). The Venn diagram shows that 19.4% (n = 1,113 of 5,720) of DEGs from <italic>Adamtsl2</italic>-KD were shared with <italic>Myod1</italic>-KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>). Not surprisingly, DEGs that are shared between <italic>Adamtsl2-</italic>KD and <italic>Myod1</italic>-KO myoblasts were almost exclusively enriched in gene sets related to skeletal muscle, myotube formation or myoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Myod1</italic>-KO specific DEGs (n = 1,419 of 2,602) were enriched in neurotransmission, neuron projection arborization, immune interactions, and ECM organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Adamtsl2</italic>-KD specific DEGs (n = 4,607 of 5,720) regulate bone and fat cell differentiation as well as growth factor signaling including WNT and BMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref>). Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) analysis showed much higher enrichment of myogenesis-related genes in the shared and <italic>Adamtsl2</italic>-KD-specific DEGs compared to <italic>Myod1</italic>-KO-specific DEGs based on the combined score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L</xref>). This analysis raised the question of whether MYOD may execute of the myogenic differentiation program through regulating ADAMTSL2. We first analyzed the ADAMTSL2 promoter sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site and identified 13 and 10 putative MYOD binding sites in mouse and human, respectively, suggesting direct regulation of ADAMTSL2 by MYOD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2M</xref>). Next, we asked if ADAMTSL2 could rescue lack of differentiation of MYOD-deficient C2C12 myoblasts. Knockdown of MYOD (<italic>Myod1</italic>-KD) using constitutive expression of <italic>Myod1</italic>-directed shRNA resulted in a ∼80% reduction of MYOD mRNA expression and a concomitant strong reduction of ADAMTSL2 mRNA supporting direct regulation of <italic>Adamtsl2</italic> by MYOD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2N</xref>). Strikingly, overexpression of recombinant ADAMTSL2 or its C-terminal thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) 2-4 domains (see below) not only fully rescued the differentiation defect of <italic>Myod1</italic>-KD myoblasts but even overcompensated resulting in a ∼2-fold increase in the fusion index compared to sh-Ctrl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2O</xref>, P).

We first verified the responsiveness of C2C12 myoblast to canonical TGFβ signaling, which induced SMAD2/3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). In contrast, SMAD2/3 phosphorylation was not changed in <italic>Adamtsl2</italic>-KD myoblasts, suggesting TGFβ-independent effects on myoblast differentiation. Next, we considered disruption of WNT signaling in <italic>Adamtsl2</italic>-KD myoblasts since (i) DEGs associated with WNT/β-catenin signaling were enriched in shared and <italic>Adamtsl2-</italic>KD-specific DEGs and (ii) WNT signaling is required for myoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cossu and Borello 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Tanaka et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Suzuki et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Li et al. 2020</xref>). We used stabilization of β-catenin upon binding of canonical WNT ligands to their receptors and its translocation into the nucleus to measure canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Total β-catenin levels as determined by western blotting were reduced in differentiating <italic>Adamtsl2</italic>-KD myoblasts and increased when ADAMTSL2 was overexpressed or added as recombinant protein suggesting that ADAMTSL2 potentiates WNT/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-E</xref>). Lithium chloride (LiCl), a known activator of canonical WNT signaling was used as positive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hedgepeth et al. 1997</xref>). Consistent with positive regulation of WNT signaling, β-catenin levels visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy were also reduced in <italic>Adamtsl2</italic>-KD myoblasts and no nuclear localization was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). In contrast, ADAMTSL2 overexpression resulted in the almost exclusive localization of β-catenin in the nucleus. To correlate temporal regulation of ADAMTSL2, β-catenin and MyHC during myoblast differentiation, we analyzed cell lysates of differentiating myoblasts by western blotting. Consistent with ADAMTSL2 mRNA kinetics, ADAMTSL2 peaked at day 2 after differentiation initiation and correlated with a peak in β-catenin, followed by induction of MyHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). In lysates from <italic>Adamtsl2</italic>-KD myoblasts, ADAMTSL2 protein was significantly reduced and unchanged during myoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Concomitantly, cellular β- catenin levels not associated with WNT signaling remained constant at a low level and MyHC was not induced.</p><p id="P14">If ADAMTSL2 promotes myogenesis exclusively through regulation of canonical Wnt signaling, then pharmacological stabilization of β-catenin with LiCl or CHIR 99021 or addition of recombinant WNT3a ligand are predicted to rescue lack of differentiation of <italic>Adamtsl2</italic>-KD myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Ring et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Clement-Lacroix et al. 2005</xref>).

However, the fusion index was not restored to control levels, suggesting the involvement of non-canonical WNT or other signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3K-M</xref>). To test if ADAMTSL2 required WNT ligands to regulate myoblast differentiation or if ADAMTSL2 itself could activate Wnt signaling, we differentiated C2C12 myoblasts in the presence of rADAMTSL2 and the porcupine inhibitor LGK 974, which blocks secretion of all WNT ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barrott et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Liu et al. 2013</xref>). As aforementioned, rADAMTSL2 promoted myoblast differentiation resulting in a ∼1.8-fold increase in the fusion index under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3N</xref>, O). However, LGK 974 inhibited differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts in the presence of rADAMTSL2. In addition, myoblasts overexpressing ADAMTSL2 did not differentiate in the presence of LGK 974 and MyHC was not induced, despite robust ADAMTSL2 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3P</xref>).

In addition to WNT3a, Myc-tagged ADAMTSL2 was also co-immunoprecipitated by V5-tagged WNT5a (non-canonical) and V5-tagged WNT7a (canonical/non-canonical), both WNT ligands are relevant for myogenesis during skeletal muscle formation or regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Le Grand et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">von Maltzahn et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Reggio et al. 2020</xref>).

By co-immunoprecipitation we localized one WNT3a binding site in the TRS1-Cys domains and one in the TSR2-7 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Based on equal input, WNT3a binding to TSR2-7 appeared to be much stronger.</p><p id="P16">To gain further molecular insights, we used AlphaFold to model the interaction between the C-terminal TSR2-7 domains of human ADAMTSL2 and WNT3 based on their respective primary amino acid sequences.

This is also reflected in the heat map of the predicted Local Distance Difference Test scores for the accuracy of the given alignment of individual TSR domains with WNT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>). To validate the AlphaFold model, we fine-mapped the WNT3a binding site in the C-terminal region of ADAMTSL2 by co-immunoprecipitation using constructs spanning the TSR2-7 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref>).

Key players in these regulatory networks are matricellular proteins, such as ADAMTSL2, which are ECM proteins that predominantly have regulatory rather than structural roles and are characterized by a highly dynamic and cell type-specific expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Murphy-Ullrich and Sage 2014</xref>). Here we identified an unexpected regulatory function for ADAMTSL2 in skeletal muscle as a regulator of myogenesis. Mechanistically, ADAMTSL2 promoted WNT signaling downstream of MYOD, a key myogenic transcription factor, by interacting with WNT ligands and the canonical WNT co-receptor LRP6. Therefore, ADAMTSL2 may facilitate the interaction between WNT ligands and their receptors or increase the effective concentration of WNT ligands at the cell surface or in the ECM.</p><p id="P19">ADAMTSL2 has previously been described as a negative regulator of TGFβ signaling in bronchial smooth muscle cells, skin and cardiac fibroblasts, and in the growth plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Le Goff et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hubmacher et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Delhon et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Rypdal et al. 2021</xref>). Since lack of myoblast differentiation in the absence of ADAMTSL2 would have been consistent with elevated TGFβ signaling we first considered dysregulation of TGFβ-signaling in ADAMTSL2- deficient myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Massague et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Liu et al. 2001</xref>). However, we did not detect alterations in canonical TGFβ signaling in ADAMTSL2-deficient myoblasts and it remains unclear if elevated TGFβ signaling is a driver of the phenotypes observed in skin fibroblasts, lung, heart, or cartilage or if TGFβ signaling increases as a consequence of an altered ECM structure. In addition, TGFβ signaling was not altered in mouse models for Weill-Marchesani syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that together with GD belongs to the acromelic dysplasia group and features the same musculoskeletal pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Sengle et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mularczyk et al. 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P20">As an alternative to regulation of TGFβ signaling by ADAMTSL2, we considered regulation of canonical WNT signaling based on its prominent role in myoblast differentiation and skeletal muscle development and the enrichment of DEGs from <italic>Adamtsl2</italic>-KD myoblasts in WNT signaling-related molecular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Girardi and Le Grand 2018</xref>). Canonical WNT signaling is required for myoblast differentiation at multiple steps on their trajectory towards myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cossu and Borello 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brack et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Tanaka et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Suzuki et al. 2015</xref>). Using a porcupine inhibitor, which blocks secretion of all WNT ligands, we abolished the capacity of ADAMTSL2 to promote myoblast differentiation. This dependency of the pro-myogenic function of ADAMTSL2 on secreted WNT ligands strongly suggested that it is mediated through canonical and/or non-canonical WNT signaling. It also showed that ADAMTSL2 did not activate Wnt signaling independent of WNT ligands. Regulation of canonical WNT signaling was further supported by the significant rescue of differentiation of ADAMTSL2-deficient myoblasts. However, the fact that we only partially rescued ADAMTSL2-deficiency suggested that ADAMTSL2 could potentially regulate both, canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling. This possibility was supported by our findings that ADAMTSL2 could bind to several, possibly all canonical and non-canonical all WNT ligands. In vivo, ADAMTSL2 may be agnostic to individual WNT ligands and consequently may modulate WNT signaling solely depending on the WNT ligands that are present in a given microenvironment. Alternatively, ADAMTSL2 could shift the balance between canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling or integrate WNT signaling with other signaling pathways, such as TGFβ signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Carthy et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Biressi et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dzialo et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Contreras et al. 2020</xref>). Detailed competition experiments with opposing WNT ligands in systems that are responsive to both, canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling, could address this question. Our biochemical and structural data further suggest that ADAMTSL2 could promote the WNT ligand/WNT receptor interaction and by doing so potentiate WNT signaling. It is possible that ADAMTSL2 forms a complex with the WNT ligand, the LRP6, and even the Frizzled receptor and thus sequesters all three WNT signaling components in close proximity to facilitate their interaction or to increases the affinity for WNT ligands to their receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hirai et al. 2019</xref>). In the predicted AlphaFold interaction model of the C-terminus of ADAMTSL2 and WNT3, the sites that bind to frizzled- and LRP6- co-receptors are predicted to be accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hirai et al. 2019</xref>). As a precedent, it was shown that the ECM protein biglycan bound to WNT3a and promoted its activity by simultaneously binding to LRP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Berendsen et al. 2011</xref>). Several secreted molecules, such as secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs), dickkopf (Dkk), or R-spondins can modulate WNT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cruciat and Niehrs 2013</xref>). However, most of these molecules repress WNT signaling, with the exception of R-spondins and Norrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Xu et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kim et al. 2008</xref>). In this regard, ADAMTSL2 behaves more like an R-spondin, since its WNT-modulatory activity was dependent on the presence of WNT ligand(s). In contrast to R-spondins however, ADAMTSL2 directly bound WNT ligands, while R-spondins stabilized the LRP6 receptor at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Zebisch and Jones 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dubey et al. 2020</xref>). ADAMTSL2 likely functions as a rheostat rather than an on-off switch for WNT signaling and myogenesis. Thus, myoblasts can fine-tune WNT signaling through transcriptional regulation of ADAMTSL2 without the need to regulate individual components of the WNT signaling pathway.</p><p id="P21">One surprising finding was that ADAMTSL2 overexpression fully rescued lack of differentiation of MYOD-deficient myoblasts. This suggested that ADAMTSL2 is a key effector molecule downstream of MYOD, which was corroborated by the identification of multiple putative MYOD binding sites in the promoter region of the human and mouse ADAMTSL2 gene. In addition, DEGs of differentiating <italic>Adamtsl2</italic>-KD and <italic>Myod1</italic>-KO myoblasts substantially overlapped and the overlapping DEGs were enriched in pathways related to myogenesis and skeletal muscle biology. This indicates that ADAMTSL2 may regulate the same myogenic pathways as MYOD, which as a transcription factor regulates transcription of target genes. Cellular changes however, are driven by effector molecules downstream of MYOD. As such, ADAMTSL2 could be key mediator a MYOD-ADAMTSL2-WNT axis that promotes myoblast differentiation during muscle formation. One limitation is that the consequences of MYOD ablation in vivo are not fully recapitulated by MYOD ablation in C2C12 myoblasts. <italic>Myod1</italic> KO mice have no developmental muscle phenotype due to compensation by the myogenic regulatory factor MYF5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Rudnicki et al. 1992</xref>). Only when both, <italic>Myod1</italic> and <italic>Myf5</italic> were knocked out myofibers were not formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Rudnicki et al. 1993</xref>). We observed a similar behavior, where knockdown of ADAMTSL2 in C2C12 myoblasts resulted in complete lack of differentiation, while differentiation of primary ADAMTSL2-deficient myoblasts was delayed, but not abolished. Elucidating the reasons for this discrepancy and the question what can potentially compensate for lack of ADAMTSL2 in myogenic precursor cells in vivo needs further investigation.</p><p id="P22">Pathogenic variants in <italic>ADAMTSL2</italic> cause GD in humans resulting in short stature and a pseudomuscular build characterized by apparent muscle hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Le Goff et al. 2008</xref>). In congruence, inactivation of <italic>Adamtsl2</italic> in myogenic precursor cells in vivo resulted in increased muscle mass and myofiber cross-sectional area. This would suggest that dysfunctional or absent ADAMTSL2 enhances myogenesis or promotes muscle fiber hypertrophy. However, our gain- and loss-of-ADAMTSL2 function studies in myoblasts in vitro suggested that ADAMTSL2 promotes myogenesis and the prediction for a loss-of-function phenotype in vivo would be reduced muscle size or impaired myogenesis. How can these contrasting findings be reconciled? First, C2C12 myoblasts were derived from adult myoblasts after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Yaffe and Saxel 1977</xref>). Therefore, C2C12 cells are more representative of adult skeletal muscle regeneration after injury rather than embryonic or postnatal skeletal muscle development, which differs with respect to myoblast origin and growth factor sensitivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hutcheson et al. 2009</xref>). Second, most <italic>ADAMTSL2</italic> variants causing GD are single nucleotide variants and so far no individual with GD with a complete lack of <italic>ADAMTSL2</italic> has been reported. The pathogenic <italic>ADAMTSL2</italic> variants that were analyzed biochemically resulted in reduced, but not abolished secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bader et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Piccolo et al. 2019</xref>). This would suggest that residual amounts of ADAMTSL2 are secreted in GD and a complete knockout of <italic>Adamtsl2</italic> may not recapitulate the consequence of GD-causing pathogenic variants in ADAMTSL2, including potential negative gain of functions. This is supported by the reported almost 100% perinatal lethality of <italic>Adamtsl2</italic> KO mice, while close to 70% of patients with GD survive childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hubmacher et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Marzin et al. 2020</xref>). In addition, GD-causing pathomechanisms could be related to the accumulation of mutant ADAMTSL2 protein within the secretory pathway, which may compromise autophagy, induce the unfolded protein response, or result in aberrant activation of TGFβ signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Piccolo et al. 2019</xref>). To distinguish between consequences of lack of ADAMTSL2 in <italic>Adamtsl2</italic> KO mice and that of GD-causing <italic>ADAMTSL2</italic> variants, knock-in mice harboring individual GD-causing pathogenic <italic>Adamtsl2</italic> variants will be required.</p><p id="P23">In summary, we identified a novel function for ADAMTSL2 in regulating WNT signaling during myogenesis.

The cycle threshold (ct) value was used to calculate the fold change using the 2<sup>−(ΔΔCT)</sup> method and graphs were plotted using Origin 2019 (OriginLab).</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p id="P33">sh-ctrl and <italic>Adamtsl2</italic>-KD C2C12 myoblasts (3 × 10<sup>5</sup>/well) were seeded in triplicates in 6-well plates and cultured in complete DMEM until confluency. To induce differentiation, C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in differentiation medium for an additional 3 days with daily medium change. After 3 days, cells were lysed with 1 ml Trizol and mRNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality control, library preparation, sequencing and bioinformatics determination of DEGs was performed by Azenta Life sciences (Genewiz). mRNA quality was controlled using NanoDrop, RNA Qubit and Tape Station instruments. Sequencing libraries were prepared by polyA selection for mRNA and sequenced to a depth of 20-30 Mio reads (HiSeq 4000 2 × 150 paired-end configuration, Illumina). Sequence reads were trimmed to remove possible adapter sequences and nucleotides with poor quality using Trimmomatic v.0.36. The trimmed reads were mapped to the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> GRCm38 reference genome (ENSEMBL) using STAR aligner v.2.5.2b. Unique gene hit counts were calculated by using featureCounts from the Subread package v.1.5.2. Only unique reads that fell within exon regions were counted. Gene hit counts were used for downstream differential expression analysis. Using DESeq2, a comparison of gene expression between the two groups of samples was performed. The Wald test was used to generate p-values and log<sub>2</sub>-fold changes. Genes with an adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 and absolute log<sub>2</sub>-fold change &gt;1 were called as differentially expressed genes for each comparison. Data are available at the GEO database (GSE185894)</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Immunofluorescence staining of cells</title><p id="P34">For immunofluorescence staining of proliferating and differentiating C2C12 myoblasts, 50,000 cells per chamber were seeded in 8-well glass chamber slides and cultured in complete DMEM until confluency. Differentiation was initiated by switching to differentiation medium. At the end of the culture period, cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed with ice-cold methanol (Fisher Chemicals) for 15 min at -20 °C. After three washes with PBS, cells were blocked with 5 % BSA in PBST for 2 h at RT.
