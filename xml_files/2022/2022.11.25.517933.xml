This subunit is encoded by in the mitochondrial genome, synthesized in the mitochondrial matrix and inserted into the inner membrane. Current knowledge indicates that in yeast, translational activation of the <italic>COB</italic> mRNA depends on Cbp1, Cbs1 and Cbs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dieckmann <italic>et al</italic>, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Islas-Osuna <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Rödel, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Rödel &amp; Fox, 1987</xref>). These proteins act on the <italic>COB</italic> 5’-UTR mRNA and interact with the mitoribosome to allow translation initiation, probably tethering translation to the mitochondrial inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gruschke <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Ott <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Cbs1 might act as a translational repressor maintaining the <italic>COB</italic> mRNA close to the ribosomal exit tunnel, and only after translation activation, Cbs1 is released from the mitoribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Salvatori <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Cbp3 and Cbp6 are chaperones that interact with the mitoribosome tunnel exit and with the newly synthesized Cyt<italic>b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gruschke <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). In some yeast strains, Cbp3/Cbp6 are necessary for <italic>COB</italic> mRNA efficient translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dieckmann &amp; Tzagoloff, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">García-Guerrero <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gruschke <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gruschke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wu &amp; Tzagoloff, 1989</xref>), although the main role of these proteins is to trigger heme <italic>b<sub>L</sub></italic> addition to Cyt<italic>b</italic>, through a mechanism that is not completely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">García-Guerrero <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hildenbeutel <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). The current model states that interaction of Cyt<italic>b</italic>, Cbp3 and Cbp6 form intermediate 0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hildenbeutel <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Upon addition of heme <italic>b<sub>L</sub></italic> site, the chaperone Cbp4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Crivellone, 1994</xref>) is recruited to stabilize the hemylated Cyt<italic>b</italic> forming intermediate I, comprising Cyt<italic>b</italic>, Cbp3, Cbp6, and Cbp4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hildenbeutel <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). After addition of heme <italic>b<sub>H</sub></italic> by an unknown mechanism, Cbp3 and Cbp6 are released, while subunits Qcr7 and Qcr8 are then added to form intermediate II. This intermediate is ready to associate with the Cor1/Cor2/Cyt<italic>c1</italic> subcomplex to continue the assembly pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Stephan &amp; Ott, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zara <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">2009b</xref>). The current model proposes that in mutants where complex III assembly is blocked, Cbp3 and Cbp6 are sequestered in intermediates containing Cyt<italic>b</italic> making them unavailable for more rounds of <italic>COB</italic> mRNA translation. This assembly-feedback regulation of translation is clearly observed in mutants lacking subunit Qcr7 or deficient in Cyt<italic>b</italic> hemylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gruschke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hildenbeutel <italic>et al</italic>.,2014</xref>).</p><p id="P5">High resolution structures of complex III from different organisms show that the carboxyl terminal region of Cyt<italic>b</italic> is facing the mitochondrial matrix and in close proximity to the Qcr7 amino terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Berndtsson <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Guo <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hartley <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Iwata <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lange &amp; Hunte, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rathore <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Sousa <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). This region could have an important mechanistic role for Cbp3/Cbp6 function during Cyt<italic>b</italic> synthesis and assembly, because the release of Cbp3/Cbp6 from assembly intermediates has only been described before the association of Qcr7 with Cyt<italic>b</italic> to form intermediate II. Cbp3/Cbp6 and Qcr7 could thus interact with the same region of the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminus. To investigate the possible role of the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region in complex III biogenesis, we deleted its last 8 or 13 residues. We demonstrate that this critical region of Cyt<italic>b</italic> is essential for synthesis regulation by assembly-feedback, and for correct progression of <italic>bc<sub>1</sub></italic> complex assembly. We also detected the presence of aberrant assembly subcomplexes that accumulate in the absence of the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The Cytb carboxyl terminal region is necessary for correct regulation of Cytb synthesis and respiratory growth</title><p id="P6">According to the available high resolution structures of mitochondrial <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> complex from different species, the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminus is facing the matrix side, and interacts with subunit Qcr7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Berndtsson <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Guo <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hartley <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Iwata <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lange &amp; Hunte, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rathore <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Sousa <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). In fact, Cyt<italic>b</italic>, Qcr7 and Qcr8 are the first subunits to interact during <italic>bc<sub>1</sub></italic> complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gruschke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; Zara <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">2009b</xref>). Compared to other complex III subunits, absence of Qcr7 has the greatest impact on decreasing Cyt<italic>b</italic> synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gruschke <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">García-Guerrero et al, 2018</xref>). For this reason, we hypothesized that the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region could play a central role in regulation of Cyt<italic>b</italic> synthesis. Furthermore, subunit Qcr7 was proposed to properly bind to Cyt<italic>b</italic> only after Cbp3/Cbp6 are released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gruschke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; Zara <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">2009b</xref>), thus the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region might be a major contact site shared by those proteins. To investigate whether the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region is critical for Cyt<italic>b</italic> synthesis, we truncated it by deleting several residues. By microprojectile bombardment we inserted two different mutant versions of <italic>COB</italic> in the mitochondrial genome. In the <italic>CytbΔC13</italic> mutant we deleted the sequence IENVLFYIGRVNK comprising the last 13 amino acids of the protein. This region is exposed to the mitochondrial matrix and contains the sequence IEN that is highly conserved among fungi and mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig EV1A</xref>). We also created the <italic>CytbΔC8</italic> mutant, where the last 8 amino acids (FYIGRVNK) were eliminated. In the fully assembled complex III, the somewhat less conserved FYI sequence of the <italic>Cytb</italic> C-terminal region resides closest to the N-terminal region of Qcr7.</p><p id="P7">In both strains, truncation of Cyt<italic>b</italic> induced a complete lack of respiratory growth on ethanol/glycerol medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>), similar to a control strain where the <italic>COB</italic> mRNA translational activator Cbs1 was deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Rödel, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Rödel &amp; Fox, 1987</xref>). To test whether truncation of the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminus abolished Complex III assembly by inhibiting Cyt<italic>b</italic> synthesis, we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> mitochondrial translation assays in the presence of (<sup>35</sup>S)-methionine and cycloheximide (to inhibit cytosolic translation). After 15 minutes of labeling, mitochondria were extracted and newly made polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography. Synthesis of mitochondrial products, including Cyt<italic>b</italic> synthesis, was unchanged in <italic>CytbΔC13</italic> and <italic>CytbΔC8</italic> mutants as compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). In contrast, steady state levels of Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 and Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC8 were drastically reduced when analyzed by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>), indicating that even though newly synthesized Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 and Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC8 were produced at wild-type levels, the truncated proteins exhibited markedly decreased stability.</p><p id="P8">In some wild-type yeast strains (e.g., BY4742 and W303), efficient translation of the <italic>COB</italic> mRNA depends on the chaperones Cbp3 and Cbp6, and on the presence of subunit Qcr7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">García-Guerrero <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gruschke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). We asked whether these factors still regulate Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 synthesis, since the C-terminal region could be an important site of interaction for Cyt<italic>b</italic> synthesis regulators. We generated deletion strains lacking Cbp3, Cbp6 or Qcr7 in cells carrying either wild-type Cyt<italic>b</italic> or Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13. As expected, <italic>in vivo</italic> mitochondrial translation assays revealed that wild-type Cyt<italic>b</italic> synthesis was dramatically reduced in <italic>Δcbp3, Δcbp6</italic> and <italic>Δqcr7</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). Synthesis of Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 was similarly reduced in the absence of Cbp3 and Cbp6. In contrast, Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 synthesis was no longer dependent on the presence of Qcr7, as the <italic>Δqcr7</italic> mutant showed normal levels of Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 (<sup>35</sup>S)-methionine labeling. Similar results were obtained for the mutant Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig EV1B</xref>). These results indicate that even though translation of the <italic>COBΔC13</italic> or <italic>COBΔC8</italic> mRNAs still depended on Cbp3 and Cbp6, it was no longer regulated by Qcr7 binding and consequently by the assembly-feedback mechanism.</p><p id="P9">According to the current model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Ott <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>), Cbp3/Cbp6 are translational activators of the <italic>COB</italic> mRNA. If complex III assembly is blocked at early stages (e.g., by absence of Qcr7), then Cbp3/Cbp6 remain associated with Cyt<italic>b</italic>, so these chaperones are not available for <italic>COB</italic> mRNA translational activation. This model explains why <italic>Δqcr7</italic> mutants show reduced Cyt<italic>b</italic> synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">García-Guerrero <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gruschke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we next investigated whether Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 and Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC8 still interact with Cbp3 by using .a strain expressing Cbp3 with a hemagglutinin epitope fused to its C-terminal region (Cbp3-HA). Presence of this tag does not affect respiratory capacity of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">García-Guerrero <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Mitochondria were isolated and subjected to (<sup>35</sup>S)-methionine labeling before solubilization with digitonin. Extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA commercial antibody. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography and Western blotting. Newly synthesized Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 and Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC8 were able to physically interact with Cbp3-HA, although with less efficiency, as was consistently observed in all our repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A, 2B</xref>). Since, strains carrying Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 and Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC8 had presented highly similar results, we decided to continue our experiments only with the Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 mutant.</p><p id="P10">Considering that Cbp3 seemed to have a weaker interaction with Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 than with full-length Cyt<italic>b</italic>, and Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 synthesis was no longer feedback-regulated, we asked whether the assembly intermediates containing Cbp3/Cbp6 were modified in our mutant. Mitochondria were solubilized with digitonin and separated, first by blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE), and then by 2D SDS-PAGE. As expected, wild-type Cyt<italic>b</italic> mitochondria showed the presence of Cbp3 at ~150-440 kDa corresponding to early complex III assembly intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gruschke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig EV2</xref>). A small fraction of Cyt<italic>b</italic> was also detected in these subcomplexes, but the main population was observed at fully assembled complex III dimers and supercomplexes. In contrast, Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 no longer comigrated with supercomplexes or complex III<sub>2</sub>. Instead, it was only detected in subcomplexes of an apparent mass of ~130 to 440 kDa. A population of Cbp3 comigrated with these subcomplexes. In addition, Cbp3 was enriched in a fraction migrating at ~60 kDa, which corresponds to the Cbp3-Cbp6 heterodimer. The ~30 kDa fraction corresponding to free Cbp3 was hardly detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gruschke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). In the absence of Cyt<italic>b</italic> (<italic>Δcbs1</italic>mutant), Cbp3 was observed only as Cbp3/Cbp6 heterodimer and monomer in similar intensities, with no other complex detected. These results suggest that the absence of the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region induced accumulation of the Cbp3-Cbp6 dimer, formation of additional Cbp3-containing complexes of higher molecular mass, and s severe reduction of steady state levels of Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13.</p><p id="P11">To better define the populations of Cbp3- and Cbp6-containing complexes that are present in the Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 mutant, we carried out a complexome profiling analysis. For this, purified mitochondria were solubilized with digitonin, and extracts were separated by BN-PAGE. Gel lanes from control and mutant were cut into 60 slices, and each fraction was trypsin-digested and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Cbp3 and Cbp6 had similar migration patterns, with a predominant population around 100-200 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). Indeed, one main peak with a clear shoulder at ~140 kDa was observed in the WT Cyt<italic>b</italic> strain from both proteins. These fractions correspond to the previously observed early-assembly intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gruschke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). In the Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 mutant these peaks were decreased by ~50%, with the appearance of an additional shoulder at lower mass (~100 kDa). The previously described Cbp3/Cbp6 complex of 66 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gruschke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>) was hardly detectable in wild-type and enriched in Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 mitochondria.

This lack of regulation might be due to the presence of increased concentrations of Cbp3/Cbp6 heterodimers or free Cbp3 and Cbp6 in the mutant. Moreover, Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 led to the formation of additional subcomplexes of smaller size containing Cbp3 and Cbp6.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The Cytochrome b carboxyl terminal region is indispensable for complex III assembly</title><p id="P13">Although we found that translation of the <italic>COBΔC13</italic> and <italic>COBΔC8</italic> mRNAs was as efficient as that of wild-type <italic>COB</italic> mRNA, Cyt<italic>b</italic> steady state levels decreased in the mutants, respiratory capacity was lost completely, indicating severe complex III deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>).

However, the bulk of Cbp3 and Cbp6, indicative of intermediates 0 and I, were not observed at the predicted masses of 97 and 115 kDa, respectively. Instead, they appeared as a peak with a pronounced shoulder at apparent masses that were ~25 kDa higher suggesting the presence of additional components. Consistent with its presence in intermediate I but not intermediate 0, Cbp4 peaked at ~140 kDa. Because significant amounts of Qcr7 and Qcr8 were also detected in the same mass range of 120-140 kDa, we concluded that before Cpb3 and Cbp6 dissociate to form intermediate II, the two subunits are able to associate and form additional intermediates, here referred to as 0<sup>7,8</sup> and I<sup>7,8</sup>. However, the low relative abundance of Qcr7 and Qcr8, the presence of rather high amounts of Cbp4 in this mass range and a shoulder observed at the lower edge of the main peak indicated the presence of significant amounts of intermediate I.</p><p id="P18">This notion was corroborated by the pattern of intermediates observed in the migration profiles from mutant Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13. In a range of overlapping peaks at ~80-180 kDa, sub-assemblies at apparent masses indicative of intermediates 0<sup>7,8</sup> and I<sup>7,8</sup>, but also a higher fraction of the canonical intermediates 0 and I were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). It should be noted that, in the mutant, Qcr7 was too low in abundance to be reliably quantified. This could be because the abundance of all assembly intermediates was markedly diminished by truncation of Cyt<italic>b</italic>. Nevertheless, the presence of Qcr7 in some sub-assemblies could still be deduced based not only on its migration pattern, but also on the diagnostic apparent masses of these intermediates established for the wild-type. The usefulness of this diagnostic mass approach is illustrated by the observation that in the mutant, an intermediate containing Cyt<italic>b</italic> and Cbp4, but not Cbp3/Cbp6, comigrated with Qcr8 at ~70 kDa rather than at ~85 kDa as predicted for intermediate II indicating the loss of Qcr7. We thus could assign this peak to a sub-assembly II<sup>Δ7</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). Likewise, the presence of large amounts of Cbp4 and Qcr8 at ~120 kDa in the mutant suggested the presence of intermediate I<sup>8</sup>.

Therefore, Cbp3/Cbp6, which are rate limiting for Cyt<italic>b</italic> synthesis, are available to activate more <italic>COB</italic> mRNA translation.

In previous reports, the hemylation state of Cyt<italic>b</italic> had been shown critical for accurate progression of the early-assembly steps and binding of Cbp4. It was previously observed that cytochrome <italic>b</italic>, in association with Cbp3/Cbp6, receives the heme <italic>b<sub>L</sub></italic>, and incorporation of Cbp4 stabilizes this hemylation, as well as facilitating addition of heme <italic>b<sub>H</sub></italic> to transit into formation of intermediate II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hildenbeutel <italic>et al</italic>.,2014</xref>). It is unclear whether the identified early sub-assemblies in the Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 mutant contain Cyt<italic>b</italic> with heme(s) <italic>b</italic> or not. High accumulation of the canonical heme <italic>bH</italic>-less intermediate 0 was consistently observed in the mutant profiles. Three sub-assemblies containing Cbp4 were also detected in Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13. We reason that conformational changes in the WT Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region might coordinate the incorporation of Cbp4 to assembly intermediate I. If WT Cyt<italic>b</italic> is not hemylated, then its C-terminal region could remain in a conformation that may hamper Cbp4 binding. At this point, it is not known if the missing Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region might block heme <italic>b<sub>L</sub></italic> insertion even if Cbp3/Cbp6 are associated, or if the incorporation of Cbp4 is unable to stabilize heme <italic>bL</italic> in this context. In addition, canonical intermediate II was not detected in the Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 mutant. An aberrant sub-assembly containing Cyt<italic>b</italic>, Cbp4 and Qcr8 (II<sup>Δ7</sup>) accumulated in its place. Lack of Qcr7 in this sub-assembly is not surprising since its major interaction site, the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal, is absent. This may explain the poor stability of this subunit in this complex. All these results suggest that the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region is crucial to regulate Cyt<italic>b</italic> hemylation, Cbp4 interaction with intermediate I and stability of Qcr7 within <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> complex.</p><p id="P26">Interestingly, our complexome profiling analysis revealed additional subassemblies containing the same components as intermediates 0 and I but migrating at slightly higher molecular masses. These sub-assemblies were consistently found in all analyzed biological replicates from WT and Cyt<italic>b</italic>ΔC13 strains. To further investigate which additional interactor(s) caused the observed mass shift, we carefully checked the list of identified proteins of ~15-25 kDa that comigrated with Cyt<italic>b</italic>, Cbp3, Cbp6 and Cbp4 in the mass range of 50-200 kDa. While we found several proteins with similar migration patterns, the profiles of Qcr7 and Qcr8 showed the best match with Cyt<italic>b</italic> and other chaperones. Moreover, their molecular masses fitted well to the observed differences in the apparent molecular masses. Hence, we propose that the two subunits can bind already to intermediates 0 and I. Such sub-assemblies, i.e., 0<sup>7,8</sup> and I<sup>7,8</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">EVTable 1</xref>) might denote parallel assembly pathways occurring during Cyt<italic>b</italic> folding and binding/releasing of subunits/chaperones ultimately converging in the formation of stable intermediates I and II. Binding of Qcr7/Qcr8 to intermediate I (i.e., I<sup>7,8</sup>) agrees with the recent evidence from the group of Martin Ott (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Salvatori <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Incorporation and settled interaction of such subunits is what could promote the final releasing of Cbp3/Cbp6. Nevertheless, it is not straightforward to understand why Qcr7/Qcr8 bind to intermediate 0. We speculate that there are interaction sites in Cyt<italic>b</italic> that might not be occupied by Cbp3/Cbp6 where Qcr7/Qcr8 can interact early and wait until Cbp4 binds to promote conformational changes that allow their final mode of interaction. Further structure and mechanistic research will be required to validate the existence of these subassemblies, as well as the specific molecular roles of all early assembly-involved complex III chaperones.</p><p id="P27">Chaperone Cbp3 interacts physically and directly with cytochrome <italic>b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gruschke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Ndi <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).

All three Cbp3 amino acids are still interacting with mutant cytochrome <italic>b</italic>, indicating that the Cbp3-Cyt<italic>b</italic> interaction takes place probably with one of the three matrix-side soluble Cyt<italic>b</italic> loops. Even though the cytochrome <italic>b</italic> carboxyl terminal region is not absolutely required for Cbp3 association, this region of the protein seems to regulate how tightly Cbp3/Cbp6 associates with cytochrome <italic>b</italic>. This function might be achieved by Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region conformational changes throughout the progression of this subunit through the assembly intermediates.</p><p id="P28">The Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region could also regulate, how Cbp4 incorporates and executes its role(s) in the assembly complex. This could be a direct or indirect role through the correct positioning of Cbp3/Cbp6 as well as Qcr7/Qcr8 in intermediates 0 or 0<sup>7,8</sup>. This is of particular importance since truncation of Cyt<italic>b</italic> did not prevent the formation of Cbp4-containing subcomplexes (I<sup>8</sup>, I<sup>7,8</sup> and II<sup>Δ7</sup>), that seem to be not functional, nonetheless. If hemylation proceeds correctly, Cbp3/Cbp6 are then released, which may be promoted not only by association of subunits Qcr7/Qcr8, but also by a new conformation of the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region enabling intermediate I to transit into intermediate II. Indeed, stability of intermediate II seems to depend on the presence of the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region, as we were unable to detect this intermediate in the mutant lacking this region.</p><p id="P29">In summary, our data demonstrate that the cytochrome <italic>b</italic> C-terminal region has an essential role in regulation of the assembly-feedback loop of <italic>COB</italic> mRNA translation, formation of early-assembly intermediates and, thereby, assembly of complex III. Based on previous work and the results presernted here, we propose an updated model in which, as Cyt<italic>b</italic> emerges from the mitoribosome, it first interacts with Cbp3 and Cbp6. These interactions are promoted by a specific conformation of the cytochrome <italic>b</italic> carboxyl terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>) to assemble into intermediate 0. Correct formation of this intermediate triggers the addition of heme <italic>bL</italic>. Maybe another conformation of the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region is necessary to assist heme binding by Cbp3/Cbp6 by an unknown mechanism. Cbp4 is recruited to stabilize heme <italic>b<sub>L</sub></italic>, and heme <italic>b<sub>H</sub></italic> is added to conform intermediate I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hildenbeutel <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, our data also suggest an alternative early-assembly route where intermediate 0 already binds Qcr7/Qcr8. Then, Cbp4 attaches and may help stabilize Cyt<italic>b</italic> folding/hemylation and proper interactions of Qcr7/Qcr8, which makes Cbp3/Cbp6 lose affinity for Cyt<italic>b</italic> and detach to form the intermediate II.</p><p id="P30">Finally, we would like to emphasize that the carboxyl terminal region of other mitochondrially encoded proteins is important for the biogenesis of their respective oxidative phosphorylation complexes. As the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region is essential at different steps of complex III biogenesis, it has also been shown for the carboxyl terminal region of Cox1, the largest subunit of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">García-Villegas <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Shingú-Vázquez <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>).

Moreover, biogenesis of complex II, which is only formed by nuclear encoded subunits, is also regulated by the C-terminal region of subunits Sdh1 and Sdh4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Oyedotun &amp; Lemire, 1997</xref>).This mechanism of regulation is not exclusively found in mitochondria since similar findings were reported for chloroplast-encoded mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Choquet &amp; Wollman, 2002</xref>). All these studies highlight the intricate regulation of translation and assembly involving a small soluble region of, in this case, mitochondrial proteins.

Heat maps (top) and migration plots (bottom) show the relative abundance values for the respective proteins. For data visualization and interpretation, the relative abundance of all analyzed proteins in the mass range between 40-400 kDa were re-normalized. First, the observed values of Cyt<italic>b</italic>, Cbp3, Cbp6, Cbp4 were normalized to intermediate I<sup>7,8</sup> at 144 kDa and set as 1.0 in the WT strain. Next, the relative abundances of subunits Qcr7 and Qcr8 were normalized to intermediate II and set to the adjusted value of Cbp4 at 91 kDa. The profiles of WT and mutant strains were re-normalized together. Abbreviations: 0: intermediate 0 (Cyt<italic>b</italic>, Cbp3 and Cbp6); I: intermediate I (Cyt<italic>b</italic>, Cbp3, Cbp6 and Cbp4); II: intermediate II (Cyt<italic>b</italic>, Cbp4, Qcr7 and Qcr8); 0<sup>7,8</sup>: intermediate 0 associated with Qcr7/Qcr8; I<sup>7,8</sup>: intermediate I associated with Qcr7/Qcr8; I<sup>8</sup>: intermediate I associated with Qcr8; II<sup>Δ7</sup>: intermediate II lacking Qcr7 (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">EV Fig 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">EV Table 1</xref> for extra details).

This region of the protein allows correct association with Cbp3/Cbp6 for Cyt<italic>b</italic> hemylation and synthesis regulation. After hemylation, the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region changes until it reaches its final conformation once <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> complex is fully assembled. If the Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminal region is missing, then there is an overall decreased accumulation of intermediates 0, I, 0<sup>7,8</sup> and I<sup>7,8</sup>; intermediate II is lost and instead intermediates II<sup>Δ7</sup> and I<sup>8</sup> appear. Upon truncation of Cyt<italic>b</italic> C-terminus, Cbp3/Cbp6 binding is inefficient, and free Cbp3/Cbp6 heterodimers are accumulated. Consequently, the assembly feedback regulation of Cyt<italic>b</italic> synthesis is lost, so now Cyt<italic>b</italic> is efficiently translated even if Qcr7 subunit is missing. Since canonical intermediate II is not formed in the mutant, the assembly of the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> complex is abrogated. Low abundant, not previously described intermediates 0<sup>7,8</sup>, I<sup>7,8</sup>, and I<sup>8</sup> are shown as transparent images.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS157734-f005"/></fig></floats-group></article>
