Small carpenter bees (<italic>Ceratina calcarata</italic>) nest in sun or shade, suggesting that maternal decisions about nest sites are influenced by thermal conditions that influence juvenile growth and survival. We investigated the costs and benefits to mothers and their offspring of warmer or cooler nest sites using a field experiment in which mothers and newly founded nests were placed in sunny or shady habitats. Maternal costs and benefits in sunny and shady treatments were quantified by comparing brood provisioning behaviour, nest size, number of brood cells, and offspring survival rates. Juvenile costs and benefits were quantified as body size, high temperature tolerance (CT<sub>max</sub>), metabolic rate, and pupal duration. The major maternal benefit of nesting in sun was significantly lower rates of total nest failure (caused by predation, parasitism or abandonment), which led to sun mothers producing 3.2 brood on average, while shade mothers produced only 2.9. However, sun nesting entailed costs to brood, which were significantly smaller, less likely to survive to adulthood and had significantly elevated CT<sub>max</sub>. This suggests that juvenile bees in sun nests bees experienced thermal stress during development, causing them to shunt resources from growth to thermoprotection, at the cost of smaller size and higher mortality. Pupae raised in a thermal-gradient “BeeCR” machine developed significantly faster at warmer average temperatures, which may be an additional benefit of sun nesting. Overall, our results highlight a tradeoff between maternal benefits and offspring costs when mothers choose nest sites, in which maternal fitness is enhanced by nesting in sun, despite significant physiological costs to offspring, due to the necessity for thermoprotective responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cost and benefits</kwd><kwd>ecological tradeoff</kwd><kwd>thermal stress</kwd><kwd>nest site selection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">For many animals, both vertebrates and invertebrates, nest site selection is a crucial prerequisite of raising offspring. Bees are central place foragers whose offspring must be raised in the shelter of a nest constructed in some sort of solid nesting substrate. Nests are crucial because juvenile bees are defenceless and mostly immobile, requiring considerable maternal care. In some bee groups, most notably the carpenter, orchid and sweat bees, mothers as well as offspring, spend much of their lives in their nests with their developing offspring, guarding them against predators and parasites, feeding young adults after they eclose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hogendoorn et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Quiñones and Wcislo 2015</xref>). In many bee species, offspring remain in their natal nests to overwinter and then reuse their nest to raise their own offspring – carpenter bees are known to reuse nests for many generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gerling et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cameron 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Schwarz et al. 2007</xref>). Thus, nest site selection has far-reaching fitness consequences for mothers and offspring, sometimes over multiple generations. Nest site selection in bees is influenced by both abiotic and biotic factors, including temperature, availability of nesting substrate, detectability of nests by predators and parasites, and proximity to food resources for both parents and offspring. Inevitably, choosing a nest site requires parents to evaluate multiple criteria, weighing the costs and benefits both for themselves as parents and for the welfare and survival of their offspring.</p><p id="P3">The best studied abiotic factor influencing nest site selection in bees is temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Potts and Willmer 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Potts et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hranitz et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Antoine and Forrest 2021</xref>). Nests in sunny locations heat up earlier in the day and reach higher temperatures than do nests in shade. Since bees are ectotherms whose metabolism is closely linked to ambient temperature, the thermal microenvironment inside a nest influences everything from maternal behaviour to juvenile development. Nesting in a sunny location can be advantageous, because mothers may be able to warm up and forage earlier in the day, and larvae may develop faster. However, if nests in sunny sites heat excessively, then their occupants may experience heat stress, impairing development and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chown et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Corbet and Huang 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Wenzel et al. 2020</xref>). Nesting substrate not only influences the thermal environment of the nest, but also influences whether bees can respond to seasonal changes in temperature. For instance, ground-nesting bees can excavate brood cells at deeper soil depths when temperatures rise in summer, providing juveniles raised at different times of the year, with similar and optimal developmental temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Antoine and Forrest 2021</xref>). In contrast, bees that nest above ground cannot usually adjust the size or position of their nests in response to seasonal changes in temperature from spring to summer. As a result, offspring produced in summer may experience conditions considerably warmer than were apparent to mothers selecting nest sites in spring.</p><p id="P4">Small carpenter bees excavate their nests in woody substrates like milled lumber or small twigs, and frequently choose sites with sunny exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rehan and Richards 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Vickruck et al. 2011</xref>). Field studies of small carpenter bees (genus <italic>Ceratina</italic>) demonstrate that females strongly prefer to nest in sunny sites, which provide internal nest temperatures warmer than ambient air temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Vickruck and Richards 2012</xref>). Paradoxically, <italic>Ceratina</italic> mothers prefer a nesting substrate, raspberry (<italic>Rubus</italic>) plants, that grows most frequently in partial or complete shade. These intersecting site and substrate preferences suggest that <italic>Ceratina</italic> mothers must weigh the costs and benefits of nesting in preferred locations against the costs and benefits of nesting in preferred substrates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Vickruck and Richards (2012)</xref> carried out a field experiment to investigate the reproductive consequences of nesting in sun versus shade and in different types of substrate. <italic>C. calcarata</italic> mothers that nested in sun produced more and larger offspring, but so few bees chose shady sites that it was not possible to convincingly determine whether the apparent advantages of sun nesting were ascribable to sun <italic>per se</italic>, to differences in nesting substrate, or to some unmeasured biotic factor such as differential susceptibility to brood parasitism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Vickruck and Richards 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P5">One intriguing result in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Vickruck and Richards (2012)</xref> suggested that nesting in sun might have subtle physiological consequences for developing juveniles – this was the observation that when brought into the lab, juvenile bees from sun nests developed more slowly than those from shade nests. Since all bees experienced the same ambient temperatures in the lab, the difference implied that developmental conditions in sun and shade nests had induced long-lasting differences in offspring metabolism. To test this hypothesis, nests containing <italic>C. calcarata</italic> brood were moved into three thermal field treatments (full shade, semi-shade, and full sun), then tested to find out their metabolic rates at physiologically relevant temperatures (10, 25 and 40°C). The effect of rearing treatment became apparent at the highest temperatures, with bees from sun nests exhibiting the highest metabolic rates, those from shade nests exhibiting the lowest, and those from semi-shade nests showing intermediate metabolic rates. This indicated that bees that experienced higher daily temperatures inside their nests developed the ability to respond to higher temperatures by greater elevation of their metabolic rates. One adaptive consequence of nesting in sunny nests may therefore be the ability of juvenile bees to better cope with high temperatures, perhaps because their warmer microenvironments induce them to activate thermoprotective biochemical pathways, such as those involved in the production of heatshock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hofmann and Todgham 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Torson et al. 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Objectives</title><p id="P6">In this study we follow up on previous studies on the thermal microenvironment of Ceratina nests to examine tradeoffs inherent in maternal decisions to nest in warm, sunny sites versus cool, shady sites. We investigated consequences for both mothers and offspring, focussing on how nesting location affects maternal foraging activity and brood productivity, as well as physiological traits of brood, including body size, metabolic rate, and high temperature tolerance. We did this using a field experiment to manipulate the thermal microenvironments of nests by moving them into sunny or shady sites shortly after mothers established their nests, thus randomizing mothers among thermal environments to avoid possible maternal effects associated with nesting site decisions. To evaluate the consequences of sun versus shade nesting for mothers, we compared their foraging behaviour at nest entrances, as well as opening nests to compare brood productivity and survival. To evaluate the consequences of sun versus shade nesting for offspring, we allowed juveniles to develop to pupation under sunny and shady treatment conditions, then brought them into the lab to evaluate body size, metabolic rate, and temperature tolerance. Since previous experience showed that bees could not be raised successfully outside their nests under field conditions, we repurposed a gradient PCR machine as a variable temperature incubator for investigating pupal developmental rates over a wide range of temperatures. The onset of Covid-19 restrictions on travel in spring 2020, necessitated a pandemic pivot in which field work was moved to our backyards and a lab was set up in the first author’s basement.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S4"><title>Description of nest initiation and thermal treatment field sites</title><p id="P7">In 2019, nest initiation sites were set up in sunny, unmowed areas of the Brock University campus (St. Catharines, Ontario; 43.117°N, -79.256°W). We tied raspberry (<italic>Rubus</italic> sp.) canes cut to about 0.5 m in length to bamboo stakes and placed these in known areas with frequent nesting activity by <italic>Ceratina calcarata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Vickruck et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Vickruck and Richards 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lewis and Richards 2017a</xref>). Twigs were checked every two to three days prior to 0900 h. The founding of a nest by an adult female was confirmed visually by the presence of a female or sawdust in the nest entrance or by buzzing sounds emitted after gently inserting a blade of grass into the nest entrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lewis and Richards 2017</xref>). Nests with mothers were randomly assigned to a sun or shade treatment site and relocated to sun or shade sites on the same day. Before nests were moved, the entrance was temporarily blocked with tape to prevent the mother from escaping. There were two sun treatment sites in a meadow that received direct sun from 0800 h to 1800 h, and two shade sites inside the woodland margin on the edge of the same meadow that never received direct sun but did receive dappled sunlight in early morning and late evening.</p><p id="P8">In 2020, we used similar field methods but set up the nest initiation and treatment sites in different locations with different source populations of bees. Nest initiation sites were set up in sunny portions of private properties in the municipality of Lincoln (43.170°N, -79.481°W) and at the Glenridge Quarry Naturalization Site (GQNS; 43.121°N, -79.237°W). After nest initiation, nests were moved to treatment sites (one sun and one shade) in Lincoln. The sun site received full and direct sun from 0800 h to 1900 h, while the shade site received early morning sunlight prior to 0800 h and was shaded the rest of the day.</p><p id="P9">In 2021, nest initiation sites were set up at the GQNS and at a private property in Welland (43.002°N, -79.207°W) to provide juvenile bees for a lab study relating developmental temperatures and durations. There were no treatment sites.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Temperature measurements in sun and shade treatments</title><p id="P10">We measured maximum daily nest temperatures using artificially constructed nest tunnels (“dummy nests”). These were created by drilling a hole 10 cm in length and 3.2 mm in diameter in the exposed pith of four raspberry canes. One dummy nest was placed at each of the treatment sites in 2019, and two were placed at each site in 2020. Daily maximum temperatures were recorded between 1300 h and 1500 h from 28 May to 20 August 2019 and from 3 June to 12 August 2020 using an Omega temperature unit (Model HH509R) by placing the wire thermocouple probe (T-type; 0.1°C precision) inside a dummy nest tunnel. The wire probe was held outside the nest at the height of the entrance to measure ambient air temperature. On rainy days it was assumed that nest temperature was equal to air temperature in both treatments, and air temperature was recorded from a covered patio near the treatment sites.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Maternal foraging behaviour</title><p id="P11">Maternal foraging behaviour was quantified by observing adult females as they departed from and returned to nest entrances during the 2019 brood-provisioning period. Up to 10 randomly selected nests were observed throughout the course of a day (0800 h to 1800 h) on 16 days between 26 June and 26 July 2019. Observations were facilitated by enclosing nest entrances with inverted plastic cups and lids that prevented bees from exiting or entering their nests until the cup was removed; cup removals delayed bees by only a few seconds and bees rapidly became accustomed to the procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lewis and Richards 2017</xref>). We distinguished between pollen flights (mother arrived at the nest with pollen visible on her hind legs) and nectar flights (mother arrived without pollen). We measured foraging activity in terms of the number of foraging trips (arrivals) per female per day, foraging trip duration (average time elapsed from a departure to the next arrival), and total daily foraging time (the summation of all flight durations per female per day) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Richards 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lewis and Richards 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Collections of nests and their occupants</title><p id="P12">Based on observed nest initiation dates and observations of forager activity, we aimed to collect nests at the full brood stage, when mothers had completed brood provisioning and egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rehan and Richards 2010a</xref>). Nest entrances were covered with tape early in the morning, to ensure the mother was inside and brought to the lab (or house) to be opened. Nests were opened by splitting the twig lengthwise, and all nest occupants were counted as a measure of maternal reproductive success. Nests with live bee occupants were designated as active brood (youngest offspring was at the provision mass or provision mass with egg stages) or full brood (youngest offspring had reached the larval or pupal stage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rehan and Richards 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">2013</xref>). Adults, pupae and larvae with uneaten provision masses were placed separately into 0.2 ml microcentrifuge tubes with a small hole in the lid.

Burrow length was measured with a ruler.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Traits of bees from sun and shade nests</title><sec id="S9"><title>Body size</title><p id="P13">Bees collected in 2019 and 2020 were weighed and measured. Wet mass of provision masses (including eggs), larvae, pupae and adult bees collected was measured immediately after removal from their nests. For eggs and larvae, wet mass included the mass of any pollen still attached. Dry mass was measured for all adults and for juveniles that died as pupae after drying the specimens in a 60°C oven for 48 hours. All masses were measured using an analytical balance (Mettler Toledo MX5, 0.00001g precision). In 2019, we measured both wet and dry mass, but due to lab closures in 2020, only dry mass was measured.</p><p id="P14">The head widths (HW) of adults or bees that died as pupae were measured across the widest portion of their face, including the compound eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Vickruck and Richards 2012</xref>).

The intake air was first drawn through a container of expended Amsorb Plus (Armstrong Medical) by a PP-2 Dual Pump System V1.0 air pump on the low setting (Sable Systems International), to assist with removing incurrent CO<sub>2</sub>. We used a volumeter (2.0 L) to calibrate flow rate, and a Flo-Box controller and Mass-Trak flow regulator (Sierra Instruments) to regulate the flow rate to 50 ml/min. The incurrent air was then pushed through a Rota-meter flowmeter. Two of these flowmeters were used for direct flow rate comparisons near the beginning and end of the flow through system. These devices were compared twice daily to check for air leaks in the system. After the flowmeter, the incurrent air passed through a container of indicating Drierite (W.A. Hammond Drierite Co.), to remove water vapour, and another container of Amsorb Plus to fully remove any remaining CO<sub>2</sub> from the incurrent air on its way to the insect. The CO<sub>2</sub> produced by each subject was measured by a S151 CO<sub>2</sub> Analyzer (Qubit Systems) in parts per million (ppm, set to 500 ppm range and calibrated with nitrogen gas).

Our observations of carpenter bee mothers at nest entrances demonstrated that shade and sun mothers expended similar effort foraging for pollen, whereas sun mothers expended significantly more effort (measured by total daily flight time) foraging for nectar. Mothers likely feed themselves outside the nest, so pollen and nectar provisions brought back to the nest would be destined for larval consumption. The extra time spent on nectar trips by sun mothers would have allowed them to add proportionately more nectar to larval provision masses. In sun nests, both provision masses and larvae would be more susceptible to desiccation than in shade nests. Provision masses with more nectar would supply more liquid to larvae and might humidify the brood cells. In honeybees, the proportion of foragers returning with water and nectar increases as temperatures rise (Cooper et al. 1985).</p><p id="P30">There may be additional consequences of adding extra nectar to larval provisions in sun nests. Larval growth and performance may be influenced by the sugar content of the nectar added to their provision masses. Leaf-cutter bee larvae whose pollen masses are supplemented with extra sugar grow to larger sizes and sometimes develop more slowly than those without (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Burkle and Irwin 2009</xref>). If carpenter bees followed this pattern, we would expect that brood from sun nests would be larger in size than brood from shade nests. In fact, we observed the opposite pattern, so extra nectar added to larval provisions in sun nests did not produce larger offspring. The smaller size of sun offspring is at odds with the observation that sun and shade mothers exhibited similar rates of pollen foraging, which should have produced offspring of similar body sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Danforth 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bosch and Vicens 2002</xref>). That sun offspring ended up smaller suggests that during development, they diverted energetic resources away from processes promoting growth and so ended up smaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Atkinson 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Richards et al. 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P31">A greater proportion of nests in shade were empty when collected, containing neither brood nor an adult female. This means that the sun mothers had a higher probability of successfully raising at least one offspring than did shade mothers. In the majority of empty nests, we could not determine what had happened to the occupants, but it is possible that being relocated from sun to shade led to higher rates of abandonment by shade mothers. Bee brood are helpless to defend themselves against predators and parasites, and nests left unguarded after a mother dies or abandons it are quickly raided by ants and other predators, which kill and remove all brood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lewis and Richards 2017</xref>). In our experiment, initial nest founding by mothers was in sunny sites, after which we randomly assigned each nest to sun or shade treatment, so it is possible that mothers were more likely to abandon their nests if they were moved to shade. Another possibility is that nest failures were due to higher predation or parasitism, rather than maternal abandonment. Shade nests are more attractive and vulnerable to parasites, especially if constructed in a native plant substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Vickruck et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Vickruck and Richards 2012</xref>). We noticed that some of the failed nests had short (&lt;10cm) tunnels that contained eggs or developing larvae of tree crickets (<italic>Oecanthus</italic> sp.), a known pest of raspberry plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">OMAFRA 2009</xref>). Additionally, sun nests might have experienced lower rates of nest failure because parasites avoided them. This could happen if host nests heat to higher temperatures than can be tolerated by parasite larvae, a situation that seems to explain why red mason bees (<italic>Osmia rufa</italic>) reared at higher temperatures have fewer parasites than those reared at lower temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Giejdasz and Fliszkiewicz 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Among surviving nests, shade nests contained more live offspring and sun nests produced fewer. Since tunnel length, the number of brood cells in surviving nests, and maternal pollen foraging rates were all similar in sun and shade, fewer live offspring in sun nests implies higher mortality for sun brood during development. In other words, mothers nesting in sun less frequently experienced catastrophic nest failure, but apart from this source of mortality, fewer of their brood survived to adulthood. In contrast, mothers nesting in shade were more likely to lose their entire brood, but if they avoided this, then more of their brood survived.</p><p id="P33">We can estimate the average reproductive success of sun and shade mothers by applying the simplifying assumption that the rates of total nest failure and brood productivity in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> respectively, accurately represent population level rates. If so, then in sun nests, 41% of mothers produced 0 brood while 59% produced an average of 5.4 brood, producing an estimate of about 3.2 brood per mother. In shade nests, 62% of mothers produced 0 brood while 38% produced an average of 7.5 brood, producing an estimate of 2.9 brood per mother. These simple calculations suggest that for sun mothers, lower rates of total nest failure more than compensated for lower brood survival, such that sun mothers produced more brood than shade mothers.</p><p id="P34">This demographic benefit of sun nesting must be weighed against possible costs to offspring of developing at higher temperatures. One of these costs is smaller body size, as sun brood were smaller than those from shade nests, despite probably having consumed more sugar, which should have resulted in larger body sizes. In bees, smaller body sizes generally are associated with lower survival and reproductive success in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Shimamoto et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Greenleaf et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Skandalis et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Rodríguez-Gironés and Bosch 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Grula et al. 2021</xref>). In <italic>Ceratina</italic> specifically, smaller females are less likely to survive overwintering hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rehan and Richards 2010a</xref>) and as mothers, they produce fewer and smaller offspring (Rehan and Richards 2010c). Smaller males may have lower mating success and perhaps lower survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alcock 1997</xref>). Long-term costs of smaller body size would suggest that the calculations above somewhat overestimate the advantages of nesting in sun. Nevertheless, sun nesting would appear to be the higher fitness strategy.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Physiological responses of offspring to sun and shade microenvironments</title><p id="P35">The CT<sub>max</sub> of adult offspring from sunny nests was about 0.8°C higher than that of shade bees, which demonstrates that their warmer microenvironments during development had long-term effects on how they respond to high temperatures. The observed CT<sub>max</sub> of both shade and sun bees averaged about 48.3°C, which closely matches the reported CT<sub>max</sub> =48°C of another <italic>C. calcarata</italic> population, as well as several tropical <italic>Ceratina</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hamblin et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">da Silva et al. 2021</xref>). This value of CT<sub>max</sub> is about 10°C higher than the maximum temperatures inside nests on warm days, so in our study, both shade and sun bees should have been inside their thermal safety margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sinclair et al. 2016</xref>). However, larvae and pupae might have different thermal performance curves than adults, with lower CT<sub>max</sub> and perhaps lower thermal optima. Nevertheless, if bees were experiencing temperatures above their thermal optima during development, we would expect declining performance and the necessity to mount a response to thermal stress.</p><p id="P36">As expected, <italic>C. calcarata</italic> offspring exhibited higher metabolic rates (VCO<sub>2</sub>) at 40°C than they did at 25°C, but sun and shade bees did not differ in their responses to temperature. The similarity in response contrasts with a previous study, in which bees from sunny nests showed elevated metabolic rates at 40°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Richards et al. 2020</xref>). Fieldwork for the previous study was carried out during the summer of 2016 which was one of the hottest, driest summers on record in southern Ontario, with temperatures slightly warmer than in 2020 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). This suggests that thermal differences between shade and sun treatments were large enough that year to induce a detectable change in metabolic responses of sun bees to high test temperatures, whereas in 2019, which was a moderate summer, conditions in sun nests were not extreme enough to induce the same response observed in 2016. Since 2020 was almost as warm as 2016, we suspect that we would have detected elevated metabolic rates of sun bees to high test temperatures in 2020, if pandemic shutdowns had not prevented those studies.</p><p id="P37">The developmental progress of juvenile bees could not be observed under field conditions, because outside of their nests, they were rapidly eaten or succumbed to weather-induced damage (J. de Haan, pers. obs). Instead, we used the BeeCR to raise <italic>Ceratina</italic> pupae in a gradient of daily temperature cycles that included temperatures such as those in sun and shade nests. Combining this information with local temperature records, we can estimate developmental rates in sun and shade, assuming that sun nests reached maximum temperatures about 4°C higher on average than shade nests (this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Richards et al. 2020</xref>). In 2019, the mean air temperature at our research sites was 20.5°C, which predicts a pupal duration of 19.8 days in shade and 15.3 days in sun. In 2020, the temperature was about 22.6°C which predicts a pupal duration of about 17.3 days in shade and 13.4 days in sun. If these predictions are realistic, then pupae in sun nests develop about 4 days faster than those in shade nests. This represents a significant shortening of the window of opportunity for parasites and predators to consume developing bee brood and may be an explanation for the lower rates of total nest failure in sun.</p><p id="P38">Bees raised at different temperatures demonstrated enormous variation in pupal developmental time, from 8 to 65 days, far more variation than would ever occur in natural conditions. In the BeeCR, the warmest temperature profiles were about 10°C higher than the average profile, with a high of 37.3°C and a low of 29.4°C, reflecting temperatures on the warmest summer days recorded in Niagara between 2012 and 2019. The coolest temperature profile had a high of only 16.8°C, a low of 9.7°C, and a mean of 12.2°C, reflecting the coolest summer day recorded in Niagara during the same time period. What was unrealistic, was that pupae experienced these hot and cold extremes repeatedly, day after day. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>, the breakpoint in thermal sensitivity occurs around 21°C, which happens to be close to the mean developmental temperature under field conditions. The greater sensitivity of pupae to temperatures below this threshold is interesting since they would rarely experience such temperatures during development. The increased thermal sensitivity of development at these cooler temperatures must reflect the fact that developmental rate is optimised for much warmer temperatures. For temperatures above the breakpoint, we see clear, but fairly normal biochemical sensitivity of development rate (Q<sub>10</sub> ~2-3), eventually reaching a temperature where development actually slows down (~32°C) reflective of the Q<sub>10</sub> falling below 1. Increases in temperature above 32°C are likely to result in larvae failing to develop.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>The cost of thermoprotective responses</title><p id="P39">For juvenile bees in sun nests, three important consequences of development at the higher temperatures experienced in sun nests were smaller body size, higher mortality, and an upwards shift in CT<sub>max</sub>. Ectotherms, including bees, that are exposed to extremely high, but sublethal temperatures can mount a protective heat shock response if they do not warm up too fast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hranitz and Barthell 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Elekonich 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hranitz et al. 2009</xref>). The combination of higher CTmax, smaller body size, and higher brood mortality in brood from sun nests, suggests that these juveniles experienced sufficient thermal stress to necessitate a thermoprotective response, in which developmental resources were diverted from growth to survival. Heatshock responses to acute thermal stress have been observed in multiple insect groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Krebs and Feder 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hranitz and Barthell 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Elekonich 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Torson et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Zhu et al. 2017</xref>). Heat shock proteins (HSPs) protect other cellular proteins from becoming damaged and promote recovery after the heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hofmann and Todgham 2010</xref>). Some HSPs are upregulated after an extreme thermal event or after chronic exposure to stressful temperatures, to protect the organism against other such events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kim et al. 2017</xref>). Overexpression of the heat-shock response results in a decrease in growth and development in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Krebs and Feder 1997</xref>) and is associated with higher mortality in heat-exposed juvenile leafcutter bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hranitz et al. 2009</xref>). From the point of view of both mother bees and their offspring, thermoprotection is a cost of nesting in sunny sites, but evidently it is a cost that for mothers, at least, is more than balanced by the advantages of higher <italic>per capita</italic> reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hranitz and Barthell 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hranitz et al. 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23"><title>The functional significance of CT<sub>max</sub></title><p id="P40">CT<sub>max</sub> is a convenient and apparently simple measure of maximum heat tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jorgensen et al. 2021</xref>). A simplistic interpretation of CT<sub>max</sub> would suggest that thermal differences between sun and shade nests were too small to matter, since the average CT<sub>max</sub> of 48°C implies that bees in both sun and shade would be well inside their thermal safety margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sinclair et al. 2016</xref>). Yet the upward shift in CT<sub>max</sub> due to larval experience in sun nests suggests that CT<sub>max</sub> provides a useful measure of the sun bees’ response to thermal stress. Recent studies suggest that the most commonly measured acute CTmax is systematically higher than a CTmax measured over longer time frames. In other words, the effects of exposures to warm stressors accumulate over time, and thus chronic exposure to less severe extreme temperatures could still be lethal for many ectotherms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jorgensen et al. 2021</xref>). Evidence is accumulating that intra-specific variation in CT<sub>max</sub> is considerably greater than interspecific variation, implying that intraspecific variation is an important phenotypic indicator of physiological responses to thermal stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sinclair et al. 2016</xref>). In fact, evidence is accumulating that acclimation at higher temperatures results in higher heat tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jorgensen et al. 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, higher heat tolerance likely has a cost. In our study, the higher CT<sub>max</sub> of sun bees was linked with higher brood mortality and smaller body sizes, suggesting that improved thermal tolerance in surviving brood was achieved by diverting resources from growth towards thermoprotective functions at the cost of reduced growth efficiency and higher mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Richards et al. 2020</xref>). Although there seems to be little variation in CT<sub>max</sub> at the species level in <italic>Ceratina</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">da Silva et al. 2021</xref>), we would argue that the current study demonstrates that intraspecific variation in CT<sub>max</sub> has functional significance.</p></sec><sec id="S24" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P41">The higher reproductive success of <italic>Ceratina</italic> mothers in sun certainly explains their strong preference for nesting in sun. Despite the costs to juveniles, mothers clearly have higher fitness in sun than in shade in our study populations. However, costs and benefits of nesting in sun and shade could differ from place to place and from time to time. For instance, urban <italic>Ceratina</italic> populations might experience lower predation, which might even up the rates of total nest failure in sun and shade. At the same time, urban heat islands might increase the thermoprotective costs to juveniles of sun nesting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hamblin et al. 2017</xref>). Such patterns might produce a cost/benefit calculus favouring shade-nesting. Climate change also seems very likely to change the fitness calculus; as very hot summer days become more frequent, the cost of thermoprotection in sun nests may rise to the point where sun nesting loses its advantage.</p><p id="P42">Changes or shifts in thermal breadth are not uncommon in Hymenoptera. Urban honeybees exposed to higher average temperatures shifted thermal breadth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sánchez-Echeverría et al. 2019</xref>), while urban-dwelling acorn-nesting ants that experienced higher temperatures, displayed a small increase in heat tolerance and substantial loss of cold tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Diamond et al. 2018</xref>). These patterns raise some interesting questions for future research on <italic>C. calcarata</italic> nesting in sun and shade. How persistent are shifts in thermal breadth of sun bees? Might females born in sun nests be better adapted to nesting in sun themselves? Another question relates to the relationship between CT<sub>max</sub> and CT<sub>min</sub>.

Student research halted overnight. Lab access and travel were restricted. With limited access to field sites and no access to lab equipment, we brainstormed alternative approaches that would repeat, if not replicate, our main experiments of 2019 and fulfill degree requirements for JL de Haan’s MSc in a satisfying way. Our 2019 results had provided convincing evidence developmental temperature has long-term impacts on <italic>C. calcarata</italic> physiology, so we thought about which physiological measurements would be feasible outside the lab. Authors MH Richards and GJ Tattersall suggested collecting more measurements of CT<sub>max</sub>: the Peltier plate device required running water, but a portable water pump and a bucket allowed the apparatus to be set up anywhere. No calibration of instruments was required, and the only maintenance was to change the water in the bucket after a few hours of use. Thus, a student’s home basement became a laboratory. To investigate how temperatures affect developmental rate, we needed to raise bees in controlled environments, but incubators were not available. Author A Skandalis suggested repurposing a gradient PCR unit as a portable insect incubator (“The BeeCR”). The idea was tested successfully at home in 20202, so a larger study was done by J Maretzki in 2021 when undergraduate lab access was permitted again. Two outcomes of our pandemic pivot produced long-term benefits for our research. The BeeCR is a flexible, inexpensive, easy-to-use incubator perfectly suited for raising small insects at multiple simultaneous sets of variable temperatures. And the ease with which “field” sites could be established in our backyards demonstrates how amenable small carpenter bees are to field manipulations, suggesting this is a model species for addressing a variety of ecological and physiological questions.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of pollen and nectar foraging metrics between sun and shade mothers in 2019.
