Interactions between the coinfecting pathogens and the host may alter the pathogenesis and transmission of one or both pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] and control of multiple diseases. Immunological effects of mixed infection include by stander immune activation in the absence of cognate antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] and cellular attrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P7">Globally, fishing communities have enormous challenges of access to health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The outcome of which, is the high HIV prevalence and incidence rates in Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. They also have high <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> prevalence rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. With significant geographical overlap, coinfection of HIV and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> is very common in the fishing communities.</p><p id="P8">Although the number of deaths as a result of schistosomiasis alone is low, there is a great deal of unacknowledged morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Among the possible subtle effects of schistosomiasis, an unresolved question is the extent to which schistosomiasis influences the host response to vaccinations and other infections such as HIV and how this affects the rate of progression to AIDS.</p><p id="P9">Few studies have directly investigated the association between <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection and HIV progression to AIDS. However, multiple studies have shown that the plasma HIV RNA level is predictive of both HIV disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] and risk of transmission of HIV to sexual partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] and that the treatment of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection with praziquantel (PZQ) reduced the rate of CD4 T cell decline in previously HIV and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> coinfected participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. While treatment for schistosomiasis is clearly not able to substitute for antiretroviral therapy, it may possibly be able to slow HIV disease progression.</p><p id="P10">Cellular immune responses including CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, B cells and NK cells are thought to play a significant role in the control of HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], and coinfection with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> may affect the quantity and quality of the cellular anti HIV specific immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], since as a single infection, adult schistosomes suppress immunity by modulating immune system components, including T helper (Th1) and interferon signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Scanty data is available to understand whether this immune suppression occurs in a coinfection of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and HIV infection.</p><p id="P11">Individually, HIV infection induces a predominant Th1 biased immune response and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> induces a predominant Th2 biased immune response.

In addition, IL-9 and IL-10 concentration were lower and IL-15 was higher when the participants were HIV only infected compared to when the participants were HIV and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> coinfected. The intermediate and low expression of CD3 in all these clusters is likely due to downregulated CD3 upon stimulation in responders.</p><p id="P38">The cells in clusters 11, 16 and 29 were predominantly CD8 T cells. Cells in cluster 11 predominantly secreted IFN-γ, cells in cluster 16 and 29 predominantly secreted perforin. The PTE peptides are short and likely did not favor CD4 T cell stimulation. Together, the data suggests that <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection enhanced downmodulation of HIV specific responses which recovered after <italic>S. mansoni</italic> clearance.</p><p id="P39">Immunoregulation function of IL-10 has been proposed as a mechanism through which <italic>S. mansoni</italic> induces downmodulation of Th1 immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. This study obtained similar results, where the IL-10 concentration is higher and IL-15 concentration is lower in the presence of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection. However, upon the clearance of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection by praziquantel treatment, IL-10 concentration reduced and IL-15 concentration increased. Furthermore, the <italic>S. mansoni</italic> egg burden increased with increase in IL-10 production.</p><p id="P40">IL-10 has been shown to limit antigen specific responses, as a means to balance between immune responses and pathology, however, in the presence of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection, higher concentrations of IL-10 are secreted, suggesting an enhanced immunoregulation to non S. <italic>mansoni</italic> immune responses including HIV.</p><p id="P41">In our study, <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection impaired IL-15 secretion in the plasma of HIV and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> coinfected individuals. IL-15 has been shown to stimulate anti-HIV immunity by enhancing CD8 T cell and NK cell functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. IL-15 response signature predicts Rh CMV/SIV vaccine efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].</p><p id="P42">IL-9 plays a significant role in expelling worms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and in the absence of the worms at the exit visit, IL-9 responses declined to basal level. Interestingly, IL-9 concentration at enrolment predicted greater CD4 T cell decline in HIV and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> coinfected individuals suggesting an enhanced CD4 loss. The data suggests that IL-9 may be playing a role with the delayed replenishment of CD4 cells after cell death.</p><p id="P43">Importantly, our study establishes an immune responses mechanism in a mixed infection of HIV and <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, where the interactions of these two pathogens downmodulates the immune responses involved in the control HIV. These data highlight the impairment of HIV specific immunity in co-infections and stress the need to develop combination therapies.</p><p id="P44">Due to study design constraints, we were not able to identify the cells that secreted IL-9 in the plasma.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p id="P45">The authors acknowledge Ben Gombe for PBMC isolation and sample shipment and William Senyonga for technical assistance in the CAA assays.
