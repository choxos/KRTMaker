ECRs almost unanimously declared a “love of research”, however, many reported frequent bullying and questionable research practices (QRPs), and that they intended to leave because of poor career stability. We replicated the survey in 2022 to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and sought more information on bullying and QRPs. Here, we compare data from 2019 (658 respondents) and 2022 (530 respondents), and detail poor professional and research conditions experienced by ECRs. Job satisfaction declined (62% versus 57%), workload concerns increased (48.6% versus 60.6%), more indicated “now is a poor time to commence a research career” (65% versus 76%) from 2019 to 2022, and roughly half reported experiencing bullying. Perhaps conditions could be tolerable if the ecosystem were yielding well-trained scientists and high-quality science. Unfortunately, there are signs of poor supervision and high rates of QRPs. ECRs detailed problems likely worthy of investigation, but few (22.4%) felt that their institute would act on a complaint. We conclude by suggesting strategies for ECR mentorship, training, and workforce considerations intended to maintain research excellence in Australia and improve ECR career stability.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In this paper we discuss survey data collected from Australian early career researchers (ECRs) in 2019 and in 2022, before and after/during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the goal of understanding the pressures on ECRs and on the research community. We focused our study on ECRs working in the STEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine) disciplines in universities and independent research institutes. Our published data from survey of 658 ECRs in 2019, found that ECRs’ ‘love of science’ was their major career motivator, but that most intended to leave their research position because of poor job security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Poor job security is a legitimate problem for Australian researchers. A survey by Professional Scientists Australia in 2021 found that approximately 25% of all science professionals were on a fixed-term contract, and that the average duration was only 18 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The situation for ECRs in academia is generally worse; our 2019 data suggested that 78% of ECRs were on short-term contracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], similar to Hardy et al.’s 2016 report suggesting that &gt;80% of ECRs were on short-term contracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P3">While competition can drive innovation and productivity, there is always a risk that such pressures will manifest poor or counter-productive behaviour. Our 2019 data suggest that the competitive environment left ECRs vulnerable to exploitation and abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Respondents reported alarming rates of bullying and harassment from those in positions of power (31.7% and 25.9% of female and males ECRs, respectively). In-depth interviews, conducted in parallel, revealed that ECRs experienced bullying from both senior males and females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], suggesting a systemic rather than a necessarily gendered problem. Workplace challenges are not unique to the Australian research ecosystem. In 2021, Nature’s international survey data revealed that 27% of respondents had experienced bullying, discrimination, or harassment, with 32% indicating that they had observed such behaviours in their current workplace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P4">The instability associated with short-term contracts is compounded by the subjective nature by which academic output and performance is often quantified. Academic research differs from work in most other sectors of the economy. In the broad economy, most individuals or businesses provide a specific service or product for which the relative value can be quantified. Demand for products/services can be constant, yielding jobs for which fair salary and stability can be anticipated; for example, nurses, teachers or police officers are relatively in constant demand, yielding career stability. By contrast, academic research generally seeks to advance understanding and develop new technologies. Making cutting edge contributions is non-trivial, and it can be challenging to quantify the value of a specific unique contribution as it may take years for the observation/invention to contribute to product development or policy. Because academic outputs are not easily quantifiable, nor easily verifiable in the short-term, it is possible to <italic>game</italic> the so-called metrics. Strategies to game metrics, and create the perception of greater individual productivity, include publication of many [low quality] publications, incorrect allocation of authorship, or, in extreme cases, using fraudulent data to bolster the perceived significance of an individual publication. In our 2019 survey respondents reported an alarming rate of being impacted by questionable research practices (QRPs) at their own institution (41.4% of females and 30.7% of males) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. In general, our understanding the impact of QRPs on the scientific community remains limited. While fraud is criminal and likely rare, data suggest that QRPs such as excluding data points may be a prevailing norm, and that these modest but more frequent deviations from truth may have a greater impact on the scientific endeavor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Poor quality or inaccurate data reporting is blamed for the so-called “reproducibility crisis” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. A 2015 Nature survey of 1,576 researchers found that 52% agreed that there is a significant crisis of reproducibility, and more than 60% suggested that the cause of poor reproductivity was pressure to publish coupled with selective reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Understanding the intertwined nature of QRPs and the precarious employment of ECRs is likely to be essential to understanding if our scientific industry is healthy and legitimately productive.</p><p id="P5">The plight of ECRs in Australia has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Australian university sector is reliant on revenue from international students, which contracted with pandemic-related travel restrictions. In 2020, Universities Australia estimated that Australian universities had lost 17,300 jobs and $1.8 billion in revenue compared to 2019 when we conducted our first survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. A 2022 report suggests that ~35,000 jobs were cut in the university sector, of which ~25% were academic positions (75% were administrative positions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. To understand the impact of the pandemic, we once again surveyed Australian ECRs. We replicated many questions from our 2019 survey, seeking input from January 6 to April 1, 2022. Because of the alarming rate of bullying and harassment and QRPs identified in 2019, the survey was modified to seek additional insight into these workplace problems. To date there has been work on the incidence and impact of bullying and harassment and/or QRPs on ECRs in STEMM fields in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], but limited work has been performed to understand the research environment in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>ECR demographics</title><p id="P6">In this paper we use data from our 2019 survey of 658 Australian ECRs, as previously described in eLife [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The new 2022 survey had 530 eligible responses, including 64% who identified as female, 34% as male, and 1% who preferred not to say. Although there were many more women than men this was not unexpected; women were over-represented in our 2019 survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]; and it is known that men have lower participation rates in voluntary surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The two most common age brackets were 31–35 years old (36.9%) and 36–40 years old (28.7%), with most respondents having completed their PhD 2–4 years earlier (36.4%) or 5–7 years earlier (31.9%). The four most common countries of birth were Australia (48.9%), England (5.9%), China (3.3%) and India (2.6%). Two thirds (66%) of the respondents held research-only positions at a university or research institute, 25% have combined teaching and research positions. Of the respondents, 48% identified as being in the medical and health sciences. The most recent data from the Australian Research Council (ARC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] indicates that 38.9% of Australia’s STEMM workforce is employed in the medical and health sciences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Comparison of our survey demographics with this ARC data indicates that our sample and the target population were not statistically different by discipline (χ<sup>2</sup>= 11.06 df = 9, p=0.27), and our survey population can be considered representative. A more detailed summary of respondent demographics is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1</xref> for numerical data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref></p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Workplace culture pre/post pandemic</title><p id="P7">The undesirable workplace culture identified in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] has become less desirable since the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall job satisfaction, already lower than the Australian workforce national average of 80% satisfied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], has decreased from 62% to 57%. Satisfaction with workplace culture decreased from 51% to 44%. Three-quarters of respondents (76%) agree or strongly agree this is a poor time for a young person to start in this career, compared with 65% in 2019. Similarly, 55% agree or strongly agree that their job is a source of personal strain compared with 52% in 2019.</p><p id="P8">We examined survey responses by several categories including gender, years postdoctoral, language spoken at home, whether or not the respondent had a disability or chronic health condition, sexual orientation, and research-only versus teaching and research positions. We also compared responses from 2019 with those from 2022, particularly for women, given the reports of the impact of COVID-19 on women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P9"><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows responses to a range of questions which reflect the workplace culture, and permits comparison of answers before (2019) and after (2022) the pandemic, as well as comparisons by gender. While there are differences between the impact on men and women, the only significant differences in 2022 were for feeling stressed (χ<sup>2</sup>= 7.47, df=2, P= 0.024) and inequitable hiring practices (χ<sup>2</sup>= 7.51, df=1, P= 0.006) where men were more stressed, but women more frequently reported inequitable hiring practices.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Stress and long work hours</title><p id="P10">As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, 48% of survey respondents reported feeling stressed or very stressed daily. Many (58%) were considering leaving because of because of depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns related to their work. There is a culture of working long hours in academia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. In our 2022 survey, 61% agreed their workload is too high compared with 49% in 2019. Of those who were employed full time and who worked at least 30 hours a week at work, all also worked at home; 20% worked over 16 hours a week at home. Of those who were employed full time and who worked at least 51 hours a week at work, 44% also worked over 11 hours a week at home; 14% worked more than 30 hours a week at home. Lack of work-life balance is a common concern, and this is captured in the comments provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Intention to leave</title><p id="P11">The reasons cited for intending to leave academia did not differ greatly between the 2019 and 2022 data (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Answers relating to job security, including inadequate job security, lack of funding or lack of independent positions, comprised 89.7% of the reasons ECRs cited for intending to leave research in 2019 and 76.7% in 2022. There were more responses for “other” (14.8%) than in the 2019 survey (8.2%). The principal reasons within “other” related to stress from over work and lack of work life balance, as well as general criticism of the workplace culture, demonstrating that pressures beyond job security are growing.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Intention to leave as a function of respondent demographics</title><p id="P12">Having examined the differences between the answers for men and women we looked for differences when respondents were segmented by years postdoctoral, language spoken at home, disability or chronic health condition, and by sexual preference. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref> shows differences according to years postdoctoral. As in 2019, those who were 5-10 years postdoctoral were more likely than those 0-4 years postdoctoral to report that their overall workload was too high, higher impact of harassment based on power position, and that they had experienced bullying. These concerns were reported with a greater frequency in 2022. Conversely, more senior respondents reported a lower level of job satisfaction than their junior colleagues. The differences between groups were only significant for <italic>“overall workload”</italic> (χ<sup>2</sup>= 12.92, df=2, P= 0.016).</p><p id="P13">We tabulated results based on country of birth (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), finding that those not born in Australia were more often concerned about inequitable hiring practices (55.9% versus 40.9% Australian born). There was broad concern from ECRs on this issue, with concerns increasing across all ECRs demographics from 38.5% in 2019 to 49.3% in 2022. We considered that contrasting those born or not born in Australia might not capture challenges faced by those from different cultural or language backgrounds. To explore this possibility, we assessed respondent data as a function of whether the ECR spoke English at home (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>). The most remarkable difference in the data for 2022 is the increased spread in the views about whether <italic>“it is a poor time for a young person to begin a research career”</italic> between those who speak English at home and those who do not. English speakers more often indicated that now is not good time to begin a research career than the non-English speakers (83.4% versus 61.7% difference in 2022 is significant, χ<sup>2</sup> = 18.7, df=2, p&lt;0.001). We presume that those who do not speak English at home either immigrated or live with family that have immigrated to Australia; note that only five individuals who do not speak English at home reported Australia as their country of birth. Those who spoke English as their first language more often cited mental health as a reason for intending to leave (60% versus 51.7%). Counterintuitively, while those who do not speak English at home appeared to be less pessimistic, they also appeared to be less satisfied with the workplace culture (χ<sup>2</sup>= 9, df=2, P= 0.011). Perhaps those from another country valued a job in Australia more than one in their country of origin. Overall, language appeared to only play a minor role in ECRs’ outlooks on their work environment, and it is concerning that for most of these workplace challenges approximately 50% of all respondents expressed concern.</p><p id="P14">It is common for PhD candidates and ECRs to travel internationally for education or work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], and often individuals pursue immigration in their host nation. It is worth considering how employment stability impacts the immigration process, and the additional stressor this may have on foreign born STEMM ECRs in Australia. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref> includes quotes from respondents who highlight this specific challenge.</p><p id="P15">In <xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">Table 8</xref> we investigated the impact of a disability or chronic health condition on ECRs. We did not collect these data in 2019, but the fact that 119 of 530 respondents (22.5%) identified as having a disability or chronic health condition demonstrates the importance of capturing these data. It is useful to know that 15% of all respondents indicated that they face barriers or limitations in their day-to-day activities because of chronic health issues or disabilities. Of those who reported disability or chronic health condition, 65% say they have mental health issues; 10% say they have a visual disability, 8% report they have dyslexia and 6% say they have a hearing disability. A further 10% say they have a listed disability but would prefer not to say what it is. For this cohort, respondents who suffer a disability more frequently considered leaving for mental health reasons (73.1% versus 52.8%), reported not feeling safe (19.3% versus 13.2%), were stressed (53.8% versus 48.4%), had been harassed based on power position (51.4% versus 46.3%), experienced bullying (66.7% versus 47.8%), or had been pressured regarding authorship (57.8% versus 49.0%). The differences between people with and without a disability are statistically significant for <italic>“do not feel safe”</italic> (χ<sup>2</sup>= 6, df=2, p=0.05), <italic>“considered leaving for mental health”</italic> (χ<sup>2</sup>=13, df=2, p=0.002) and <italic>“experienced bullying”</italic> (χ<sup>2</sup>=24, df=2, p&lt;0.001). Some might argue that a disability could make individuals pre-disposed or vulnerable to such challenges, but when 65% of subgroup, or 77 out of the 530 total respondents, report suffering mental health disability it may be worth considering the impact of the work environment. Similarly, it is worth noting that those who do not cite a disability nor mental health problems also report high levels of concern across all categories.</p><p id="P16">Next, we analyzed respondent data as a function of sexual orientation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T9">Table 9</xref>). Of those respondents who declared their sexual orientation, 16.6% self-declared as LGBTIQ. There was little difference between responses from people who reported they were heterosexual compared with those who said they were LGBTIQ. However, LGBTIQ respondents reported higher rates of being impacted by QRPs (57.1% versus 43.7%, (χ<sup>2</sup>=6.1, df=2, p=0.014) relative to their heterosexual peers. Although not quite statistically significant, LGBTIQ people also reported higher rates of inequitable hiring practices (57.1% versus 46.7%, χ<sup>2</sup>=3.66, df=1, p=0.056).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Influence of contract type</title><p id="P17">We compared respondents who were employed in research-only positions versus teaching and research positions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T10">Table 10</xref>). In Australia, most on-going, tenure-equivalent, positions are teaching and research appointments. Researchers appreciate that an additional teaching load can limit research productivity but often pursue teaching as a strategy to achieve career stability. This reasoning is consistent with reported workload concerns, with 58% of research-only respondents indicating that their workload was too high, compared with 72% for those on teaching and research contracts (χ2= 7.28, df=2, P= 0.026). Although not significantly different, inequitable hiring practices appear to trouble those on teaching and research positions more than those in research-only positions. It is possible that those exerting additional effort to teach feel especially aggrieved if they are unsuccessful in realizing contract renewal or advancement.</p><p id="P18">Next, we analyzed respondent data as a function of continuing versus short-term contracts (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T11">Table 11</xref>). The only significant difference between the groups was concern that workloads were too great (68.7% for continuing positions, 56.4% for contract positions of 1-3 years, and 61.5% for contract positions &lt; 1 year; (χ<sup>2</sup>=16.19, df=4 p=0.003). For all three groups, concern about high workload was greater than in 2019, prior to the pandemic. We expected that those having on-going positions would view many of the challenges in academia more favourably and were surprised to find that ECRs had similar concerns regardless of contract stability. Perhaps most striking is that regardless of contract stability, approximately half (44.7% to 50.8%) had experienced harassment from someone in a position of power, nearly three quarters expressed concern about lack of support from institutional superiors (68.5% to 74.0%), and approximately half claim to have been impacted by QRPs at their own institution sometimes or often (46.0% to 53.0%). Across all three areas, the situation has degraded substantially from 2019, with averages in harassment from a someone in a position of power increasing from 33.5% to 46.3%, lack of support from institutional superiors increasing from 60.0% to 70.5%, and the frequency by which ECRs were impacted by QRPs at their own institute increasing from 38.1% to 47.4%. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on researchers in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] and internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] and its consequent impact on work challenges is also highlighted by example free text comments provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T12">Table 12</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Mentorship and supervisor guidance</title><p id="P19">Academia is a challenging career. While the magnitude of the concerns communicated above may be surprising, most in the industry would have some awareness of these challenges because they are increasingly being aired in major reports or journals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. We asked ECRs about the support they have received from their supervisor(s) over the previous 12 months (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T13">Table 13</xref>). Despite the known challenges for ECRS and career stability, only 63.2% of supervisors discussed career aspirations with ECRs, 24.7% discussed skill development, 11.0% discussed alternative career options, and 9.1% of supervisors did not engage any of the items listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T13">Table 13</xref> over the past 12 months. These data do not have to be seen as an indictment of supervisors; instead, it could be used as a reminder that these questions are all important, and that asking these questions may spontaneously initiate mentorship activities. Supervisors are not able to modify the national research ecosystem, and many are likely struggling to maintain their own employment or career progression, but they may be able to impart wisdom and provide support to help ECRs to at least ask these important questions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T14">Table 14</xref> provides comments from respondents who describe challenges with their supervision; these comments highlight pressures on supervisors, as well as instances where supervisors likely have not behaved appropriately.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Bullying, harassment, and discrimination</title><p id="P20">Respondents to our 2019 survey reported a high prevalence of bullying and harassment and QRPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], however that survey did not provide respondents with an opportunity to offer a full explanation. In the 2022 survey we investigated both bullying and harassment and QRPs in greater depth. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T15">Table 15</xref> provides detail as to who was observed to be harassing or bullying from the perspective of respondents who experienced the event(s), or respondents who had observed the event(s). For those who experienced the event, 42.5% were perpetrated by the supervisor, 31.3% by another senior colleague, or 21.1% by a peer, respectively. For those who observed the event(s), 42.6% were perpetrated by the supervisor, 44.0% by another senior colleague, or 20.9% by a peer, respectively. These numbers are reasonably consistent, suggesting that supervisors are more often the perpetrators, although rates of abuse from senior colleagues and peers are equally concerning. It may be that the similar frequency indicates either certain common behaviours are viewed as bullying or harassment, or that these behaviours are common because they are tolerated by both supervisors and senior colleagues, and to a lesser extent by peers. We sought to determine if there appeared to be a causal basis for harassment or bullying (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T16">Table 16</xref>)</p><p id="P21">In our 2022 survey data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T16">Table 16</xref>), of those who experienced harassment or bullying, 22.9% felt it had been motivated by gender, 9.7% by race/ethnicity, 11.0% by age, 7.7% by nationality, and 5.0% by class or socio-economic background. For those who observed harassment or bullying, 21.6% felt that it had been motivated by gender, 15.8% by race/ethnicity, 9.3% by age, 11.1% by nationality, and 5.2% by class or socioeconomic background. The numbers for those experiencing and observing these behaviours are similar, again perhaps indicating that certain behaviours are commonly repeated in workplaces.</p><p id="P22">It is likely one of the reasons that bullying and discrimination continues to be problematic is that ECRs have relatively low confidence that institutional leaders will take their concerns seriously. For example, when respondents were asked if they felt that concerns related to their experiences of bullying or discrimination would be listened to, 55.7% said yes, 22% said no, and 22.3% were unsure (n = 463). Worse, when asked if respondents felt their concerns regarding bullying or harassment would be acted upon, only 26.4% said yes, 36.5% said no, and 37.2% were unsure (n = 463). Finally, when asked if respondents would feel comfortable speaking out about instances of bullying or discrimination without suffering negative personal consequences, only 36.1% said yes, 31.3% said no, 30.9% were unsure, and 1.7% preferred not to say (n = 463). Finally, example comments from those who experienced or observed bullying or harassment are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T17">Table 17</xref> and 18. These comments provide perspective on the type and severity of bullying, and the impact on individuals.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Questionable Research Practices</title><p id="P23">QRPs are also rife, 47% respondents reporting being impacted in 2022 compared with 38% in 2019. We asked respondents to indicate during what points in the research process they were pressured to engage in QRPs. Most common was with the ordering or inclusion of authors, with 49% of respondents claiming to be pressured to include or exclude authors (n = 443; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref> for more detail). Respondents reported pressure to consider engaging in QRPs during technical aspects of publications, including during Design/Methods (14.9%), during the analysis of data (17%), and during the presentation of results (18.4%). In each point in the publication process, greater than 5% of respondents were either uncertain or preferred not to say if they’d been pressured. Like other metrics, more women (54%) than men (40%) are subjected to pressure regarding authorship (χ<sup>2</sup>=11.24, df=3, P=0.011, no comparison with 2019 is available given we didn’t discriminate between different forms of QRPs in our earlier survey).</p><p id="P24">Next, we asked respondents more generally, if they were aware or suspicious of various forms of QRPs within their own Faculty (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T19">Table 19</xref>). The most common practice reported was claiming of undeserved authorship (60.9%). Intertwined with this was the nearly equal exclusion of worthy co-authors (41.6%). Perhaps more damaging to the broad scientific enterprise is relatively high frequency that respondents reporting being aware of instances where fellow faculty fabricated data (made up data, 10%), plagiarized data (5.9%), falsified data (altered data, 8.4%), selectively dropped data sets from analysis without transparent explanation (26.5%), and trialed iterative statistical analysis until finding a model that yielded a “significant” result (45.5%). The cumulative outcome of these indiscretions no doubt is contributing to the so-called “reproducibility crisis” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P25">We asked respondents what they felt was the likely source of the pressure(s) leading to QRPs. The most common identified pressure point was “<italic>my supervisor”</italic> (24.6%), followed by <italic>“colleagues in my faculty”</italic> (15.1%), <italic>“the competitive environment”</italic> (10.2%), <italic>“colleagues outside my faculty”</italic> (7.5%), <italic>“colleagues or managers at a former employer”</italic> (4.4%), <italic>“stakeholders with interest in the research”</italic> (3.8%), <italic>“a manager in my faculty”</italic> (3.3%), or “the funder of the research” (3.2%). As with bullying and discrimination, the supervisor was most likely to be the perpetrator, followed by faculty colleagues. Again, supervisors and faculty cannot solve all problems, but they may be able to significantly influence the forces leading to QRPs.</p><p id="P26">Answers relating to respondent views about the severity of the QRPs and response from the institutions are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T20">Table 20</xref>. It is concerning that 13.2% respondents felt that the nature of the QRPs of which they were aware are severe enough to warrant paper retraction, staff dismissal or a grant being repaid. A further 15.2% thought this was a possibility. At the same time, 20.1% believe there are on-going QRPs, commonly discussed by peers but are not being investigated. Only 7.9% felt that the described QRPs contributed “often” to the reproducibility crisis, while 47.6% of respondents felt that these QRPs “sometimes” contributed to the reproducibility crisis, which combined is more than half (55.5%). We consider these numbers in relation to the higher overall frequency of reported QRPs in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T19">Table 19</xref>; because disputed authorship is the most reported QRPs in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T19">Table 19</xref>, it is reasonable that respondents felt many of the QRP indiscretions would not necessarily compromise the validity of the reported data and therefore would be less likely to contribute to the reproducibly crisis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T21">Table 21</xref> includes statements from respondents describing QRPs at their own institution; these statements provide some context for the nature of QRPs and their severity.</p><p id="P27">Suspecting bullying and harassment and QRPs were likely to be found together in some workplaces, we examined that relationship. We found that for those who had experienced bullying, there was a higher incidence of impact by QRPs than for those who had not experienced bullying (authorship issues 57% versus 42%, presentation of results 26% versus 12%, analysis of data 25% versus 9% and Design/Method 22% versus 8%). Likewise, many more of those who had been impacted by QRPs had experienced bullying than those who had not (57% versus 34%). All these differences were statistically significant. (If have experienced bullying, differences with respect to Authorship, X<sup>2</sup>=11.33, df=3, P = 0.01; Design X<sup>2</sup>=21.38, df=3, P &lt; 0.001; Analysis X<sup>2</sup>=24.19, df=3, P&lt;0.001; Presentation X<sup>2</sup>=18.47, df=3, P &lt; 0.001.

In this report we aimed to dissect survey feedback solicited from Australian STEMM ECRs collected before the COVID-19 pandemic (2019) and after/during (2022). Data from the 2019 survey ECRs is published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], and it identified that ‘love of science’ was a major career motivator for ECRs, but that job insecurity would likely force a career change.</p><p id="P30">The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the stresses on Australian STEMM ECRs. These stresses further reveal systemic challenges within the academic ecosystem and emphasise the need for change. In 2019 we had 658 respondents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] and in 2022 we had 530 respondents; the overall distribution of respondents within the various STEMM disciplines was similar. There were more female respondents (64%) than male (34%), and two most common age brackets were 31–35 years old (36.9%) and 36–40 years old (28.7%). While job satisfaction rates in the Australian workforce average 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], ECR satisfaction in our surveys declined from 62% in 2019 to 57% in 2022. Almost half (48%) of respondents are stressed or very stressed daily, and many (58%) are considering leaving because of because of depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns related to their work. Most (76%) agreed or strongly agreed that this is a poor time for a young person to commence a research career.</p><p id="P31">Academics are known to work long hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]; a recent survey of academics in Australia and the UK found that respondents claimed to have worked a mean of 16–18 hours per week in excess of contract hours in the two weeks preceding the survey, and 90% reported working in excess of 10–12 hours per week over the previous six months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Most of our respondents (61%) agreed in 2022 that their workload is too high compared with 49% in 2019. Of those who were employed full time and who worked at least 51 hours a week at work, 44% also work over 11 hours a week at home; 14% work more than 30 hours a week at home. These numbers correlated with many text responses that expressed concern over work-life balance. In inadequate job security as well as lack of funding or lack of independent positions were the dominant reasons cited for intending to leave research in 2019 (89.7 %) and 2022 (76.7 %). While the ecosystem became more competitive in 2022, an increasing number of respondents cited other reasons for potentially leaving, including stresses associated with poor work-life balance, demonstrating increasing load on the system.</p><p id="P32">It is estimated that because of the pandemic the university sector lost <sup>~</sup>1.8 billion in revenue, and <sup>~</sup>35,000 jobs (<sup>~</sup>25% academic positions and 75% administrative positions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. While those in on-going positions are often sheltered from some of the stresses in academia, the pandemic created unusual circumstances and workloads where most felt vulnerable. Concerns over workload by staff were greatest for those on continuing positions (68.7%), then on short contracts &lt;1 year (61.5%), and finally for those on 1-3 year contracts (56.4%). This relationship likely highlights the stress of short-term contracts, and perhaps workload being re-directed onto on-going staff when others did not have their contracts renewed. A Nature Careers article, <italic>Pandemic burnout is rampant in academia,</italic> cites an academic as not optimistic that workloads will ease any time soon, stating <italic>“Every university will be under financial stringency, which means fewer faculty members and more workload”</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p><p id="P33">In 2022, relative to 2019, ECRs reported increased rates of harassment from a someone in a position of power (33.5% increasing to 46.3%), lack of support from institutional superiors (60.0% to increasing to 70.5%) and being impacted by QRPs at their own institute (38.1% increasing to 47.4%). Bullying and harassment were reported by roughly half (47.8%) of respondents in 2022. The perpetrator was most frequently the supervisor (42.5%), another senior colleague (31.3%), or a peer (21.1%), and where motivation could be assigned, it was assumed to be related to the respondents’ gender (22.9%), race/ethnicity (9.7 %), age (11.0 %), nationality (7.7%), or class/socio-economic background (5.0%). We reason that high rates of bullying and harassment persist because almost half (44.3%) of ECRs do not believe that their institute would listen, and many (31.3 %) feel that they themselves would suffer negative consequences as an outcome of a complaint, compared to fewer (22.4%) who anticipated that their institute would act on a complaint.</p><p id="P34">The frequency that ECRs reported being impacted by QRPs at their own institute increased from 2019 (38%) to 2022 (47%). The most frequent (49%) complaints were associated with authorship, including both undeserved authorship (60.9%) and exclusion of worthy co-authors (41.6%). In the technical portion of manuscripts, ECRs reported pressure to questionably modify design/methods (14.9%), data analysis (17%), and presentation of results (18.4%). ECRs also indicated that they were aware of fellow faculty who had fabricated data (made up data, 10%), plagiarized data (5.9%), falsified data (altered data, 8.4%), selectively dropped data sets from analysis without transparent explanation (26.5%), and trialed iterative statistical analysis until finding a model that yielded a “significant” result (45.5%). It can be difficult to quantify an individual’s contribution to a specific research output, and we take the view that it is better to be inclusive rather than exclusionary in awarding authorship. From the COPE Authorship guidelines, <italic>“Two minimum requirements define authorship across all definitions – making a substantial contribution to the work and being accountable for the work and its published form</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. The challenge with inappropriate authorship (inclusion or exclusion) is that publications are the primary currency of academia. This fact is also the motivator driving the high incidents of QRPs in the technical portions of publications, and in our view, this is the critical problem that underpins many of the challenges faced by ECRs in this study, and by academics around the world.</p><p id="P35">In academics’ efforts to create publication currency, a disconnect has formed where the true value or validity of a given publication has become difficult to quantify. The number of publications has grown to <sup>~</sup>4.618 million in 2021 from 3.973 million in 2019, a 16% increase in only two years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. This surge in publication number potentially puts further downward pressure on the value of a publication, in a manner analogous to central banks printing money and putting downward pressure on the dollar. Regardless of the cause, it is critical to appreciate that high publication rates and concerns about declining publication quality pre-date the pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Concern over the validity or reliability of published data led to what has been termed <italic>the reproducibility crisis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Some downplay the significance of the reproducibility crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], but in 2011 Prinz <italic>et al.,</italic> at Bayer, reported only being able to replicate 20-25% of 67 seminal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. They stated that despite well-resourced <italic>“reasonable efforts (sometimes the equivalent of 3–4 full-time employees over 6–12 months), we have frequently been unable to reconfirm published data</italic>.” A similar study was reported on in 2012 by Begley <italic>et al.,</italic> from Amgen. Their team attempted to replicate 53 <italic>“landmark”</italic> cancer studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Despite efforts, including working with original authors to discuss discrepancies, exchange reagents or repeat experiments under the authors’ direction, only six (11%) could be reproduced. John Ioannidis who famously argued <italic>“Why Most Published Research Findings Are False”</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], critiqued 49 landmark medical publications from 1990-2003 with greater than 1,000 citations on the topics of hormone therapies, stents, aspirin and vitamin E. Of the 34 that had been replicated, 14 (41%) were incorrect or significantly exaggerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Fame, career stability and financial compensation are motivators for researchers to exaggerate claims in publications. For ECRs a single Cell, Nature or Science paper can change their career trajectory, potentially launching them ahead of those with a decade more experience; this is a potentially powerful and dangerous motivator that not surprisingly results in many high impact papers not being reproducible. Nations need become motivated to control and improve the reliability of the publication process. An economic analysis by Freedman and colleagues in 2015 estimated that non-reproducible pre-clinical research cost the USA $28 billion per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]; there is a risk that the growth in publication output may put downward pressure on actual meaningful scientific output, or at least obscure good science in a sea of non-reproducible publications.</p><p id="P36">ECRs are attempting to build a track record, and compete for grants and employment, also frequently through paper publication. In addition to the reproducibility flaws highlighted above, the field suffers broader challenges ranking ideas, and therefore researchers. In response to the challenge of assigning value to an output, in 2023, eLife, a prestigious journal, will no longer reject papers once they have entered the review process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]; instead the paper, reviews, and responses to reviews will be published. Similarly, in response to the challenge of ranking the <italic>innovative</italic> aspect of grants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>], New Zealand is using a lottery system to award Explorer Grants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. In a survey of New Zealand researchers, most (63%) favored allocation of Explorer Grant funds via lottery, and interestingly many (40%) also favored application of this mechanism to other funding schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Tangible and non-tangible qualities in a researcher are increasingly difficult to delineate; for example, it can be difficult to dissect quality from self-promotion as shown by a study of Academic Thoracic Surgeons in Canada and the USA that observed that Twitter activity was positively associated with a higher H-Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. These data identified that <italic>“the number of people followed (P = .048), and the frequency of tweeting (P = .046) as independent predictors of a higher h-index”.</italic> This analysis does not demonstrate a causal relationship, nor that <italic>Tweeting</italic> confounds science, but it does suggest that a public profile may have a significant impact on the perceived value of published science, and thus the perceived capabilities of a given researcher. How many Twitter Followers read the papers published by these authors? What does a high Twitter follower count mean with respect to publication quality? We’re not sure, but we do intend to Tweet this paper once it has been published!</p><p id="P37">ECRs have also entered a minefield where prizes appear to play an increasing role in career success. There has been a corresponding boom in the number of prizes or awards in science [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], including many that target specific subgroups such as ECRs or women. While prestigious prizes, such as the Nobel Prize, are awarded based on a retrospective assessment of contributions, prizes given to PhD students or ECRs are often more prospective or maybe significantly influenced by their team or mentor’s contributions. An interesting analysis of tens of thousands of scientists found that specific mentorship was associated a 2-4-fold increase in a likelihood of prizewinning, but that later in their career protégés were most successful if their research evolved to differ from that of their mentor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. We wonder if awards or prizes might also distort metrics and put pressure on ECRs. In a recent editorial on this dilemma, Gabriel Popkin closed with the following comment <italic>“One thing is certain: while scientists will keep winning prizes, what’s less clear is whether science itself is winning.”</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Intertwined with prize winning and navigating the many “metrics challenges” of academic career development can be the growing perception that <italic>luck</italic> plays a critical role. A summary of interviews from those navigating academic careers repeatedly cited being <italic>lucky</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], while a similar summary of those navigating paths to become medical educators cited <italic>serendipity</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Similarly, there is growing data to suggest that the review processes used to rank grant applications are frequently underpowered, and winning can be assumed to be significantly influenced by chance or <italic>luck</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. In summary, today’s ECRs appear to be navigating a career path where success is intended to be based on merit, but where metrics are frequently distorted, and success can, in some cases, be attributed to luck.</p><p id="P38">The question is what to do about the impact of stresses on individual ECRs, on the field, and the possibility that stresses, like job security, may be directly impacting the validity of published literature? Based on our 2019 data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], and these new data from 2022, we propose the following: <list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P39">We need to develop an ecosystem that encourages institutions to invest in their ECRs, including their career development and stability. We need to slow the process down and take a long-term view of generating scientists and science. Standardised surveys could be used to collect data from PhD graduates and ECRs in Australia, identifying programs that have led to continuous employment, and institutions that supported ECR career development, making those institutions preferred places for study and employment. At the institutional level, group leaders could be encouraged to actively contribute to ECR development by integrating this output into workload calculations and promotion processes. Integrated into this ambition needs to be better alignment between Australia PhD graduate numbers and local job opportunities. Many graduates (75-78% in international surveys) aspire to obtain a job in academia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Unfortunately, in 2019, even before the pandemic, McCarthy and Wienk reported that since the mid-1990s Australian PhD graduate numbers have significantly outpaced academic jobs available in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Those who have an academic position, but who are dependent on grant funding to support their salary, are struggling, with low success rates for annual funding schemes (NHMRC Investigator Grant - 15.9% success rate in 2022, NHMRC IDEA Grant - 9.9% success rate in 2021, and the Australian Research Council Discovery Grant – 19 % success rate in 2022). Compounding poor academic employment prospects is the fact that Australian graduates more PhDs than the average of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>], yet has fewer advanced industries that typically employ highly skilled workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. One could argue that PhD students and ECRs are <italic>cheap</italic> labour for the research institutions, and that there are jobs overseas, but this does not seem like a sustainable lifestyle, nor a rational training investment for the country of Australia. It seems, instead, more rational to train a smaller number of stringently selected PhD students exceptionally well suiting them for both academic pursuits and alternate science career, thus offering these graduates more stable employment prospects, and more scientists for careers in Australia.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P40">Aligned with the above goal of producing fewer PhD graduates, but with stronger skillsets, the PhD program in Australia could be extended from 3-years, to 4- or 5-years. It is increasingly recognized that graduates should have training appropriate to guide a future career in academia or industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>], but this training takes time. In 2023, Australia will implement a new $206 million, 10-year, National Industry PhD Program that will link 1,800 PhD candidates with industry partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. Students will be provided with 12 weeks of training to gain an understanding of industry and receive a stipend top-up for up to 4 years. The extended 4-year timeline is a movement in the right direction, but the graduate number should not be increased by an additional 1,800 graduates unless there is legitimate evidence of job market need. ECRs could also receive generic professional development training in skills which benefit in project management and leadership to better fit them for academia or the wider scientific workforce, as has been promoted in recent years by the Australian Academy of Science’s EMCR Forum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P41">Based on our data, which show growing concern over QRPs, an independent research integrity watchdog is needed in Australia. Professor David Vaux, an Australian immunologist and integrity expert, has argued that a national integrity watchdog is needed to remove the conflict-of-interest associated with institutions investigating themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. Our respondents echo Vaux’s concerns, with only a fraction of ECRs (22.4%) indicating that they believed their institute would act on reported QRP concerns. An independent research integrity body could record and suggest general resolutions strategies for low level concerns, such as authorship disputes, and offer independent investigational resources for high level concerns, such as fraud [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>], which often comes hand in hand with bullying and harassment and has been linked to the volatile economic environment of the Australian higher education sector, and increased competition amongst its workforce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. In addition to higher quality investigation and being a better deterrent, this third-party watchdog could also better protect and anonymize whistle-blowers. University research and education is a billion-dollar business; it’s rational to assume there will be some bad behaviour and it's rational to assume that a third-party oversight is needed. Finally, funding agencies should consider investing a portion of research funds into replication studies. This replication unit would randomly sample all publications funded by their agency, and these randomly selected publications should be scrutinized and replicated where possible. Perhaps just the possibility that publications might be replicated, would motivate researchers to take greater care in what data/claims were reported. While this process would consume some funds, and likely slow the rate of publication, it may increase the net value of published, thus adding value to the scientific endeavour.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P42">Finally, it is time to be completely upfront with those considering entering PhD programs. Candidates should be made fully aware of discipline-specific career prospects. Institutions should be obligated to publish career and salary outcomes for previous graduates. There are plenty of reasons for a person to invest in educating themselves, but it is also a reasonable to expect institutions to provide the data required for potential candidates to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of such an investment.</p></list-item></list>

Data from collected from ECRs working in STEMM disciplines across Australia suggest that the workplace culture that existed in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] has further decayed over the pandemic. Job satisfaction has declined, workload concerns have increased, more ECRs have been impacted by QRPs, bullying and harassment, and in 2022 76% of ECRs believe “<italic>now is a poor time to commence a research career”.</italic> There are structural challenges in Australia, with PhD graduate numbers outstripping job opportunities as well as declining research funding, thereby contributing to career instability. As discussed above, structural stresses could be alleviated in part by transitioning away from a growth model that seeks to continuously generate more PhDs and more papers. At the institutional level, leaders may do more to protect their products (their scientists and their science) by slowing these processes down, and instead focusing on the provision stable work environments that aim to generate high quality reproducible outputs and which discourage poor behaviours or unethical practices. It’s now critical, for sake of the whole research ecosystem, that we reconsider how pressures may distort metrics and work together to identify new strategies to ensure that we promote the development of excellent scientists and excellent science.</p></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P44">This research project explored challenges faced by ECRs in the sciences at universities and at independent research institutes in Australia; it was a follow up project conducted in 2022 to an earlier project conducted in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].</p><p id="P45">The primary research questions from which the 2019 survey questions were derived were: (1) What are the principal factors that shape the ECR experience of various cohorts in the sciences in Australia?

The questionnaire was developed by first compiling questions, often used in a broader or international context, from the 2019 on-line survey and from recent research literature, including questions from Wellcome Trust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] and other recent surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>] in order to cover all the themes covered by the research questions. Five additional questions were created, and validated, when no suitable question was identified elsewhere. These questions were combined to create a question bank of 64 questions for this survey relevant to the research questions and the Australian context, and the survey was pilot tested. Matters investigated include inequity, bias or discrimination with respect to age, gender, sexuality or race, bullying and harassment, questionable research practices, quality of supervision, career planning and professional development. The data from these questions were supplemented by questions seeking demographic information which included the gender, age, research discipline, country of origin, family situation and work arrangements of respondents.</p><p id="P48">The invitation to take part in the survey was distributed via email after direct contact with the institutions, via social media or “umbrella groups” such as EMCR Forum, Research Australia, The Australian Society for Medical Research (ASMR) with members or affiliates drawn from the STEMM community who were likely to include the target group.</p><p id="P49">A pilot study (n=16) permitted testing for understanding and clarity and to check for technical difficulties; The pilot survey ran from January 6 to January 11, 2022; no difficulties were found so the survey continued unchanged as the national survey. Data from this national survey is discussed in this paper. The national survey ran from January 12 to April 1, 2022. The survey was conducted online using Qualtrics XM. Eligibility to participate was determined by the initial questions in the survey.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS158344-supplement-Supplementary_Tables.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d70aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank our survey respondents and all those who assisted in distributing invitations to the survey.

Working 60-70 hrs a week is normalised and expected, if you don't do it then you're not a good researcher. It seems to come from institutional expectations around publishing and the idea that research is a calling/privilege which we should be grateful to have. We don't recognise it as work and labor. I've seen this pressure destroys PhD students and ECR peers who work themselves to the bone without any end in sight.

The institution in the end supported the bully, who was superior in hierarchy, and was receiving all sort of high distinctions (including some of the highest - toll poppy of the year), so probably was seen as a better investment than junior staff. The bigger issue is, academia rewards academics who abuse, steal, falsify and destroy others to claim their fame. Those academics get more senior authorships, claim more grants as their own even when barely participating, and put their name forward for more awards, than others. It is sad that narcissistic (i.e. feeling you deserve more credit than your actual contributions) / psychopath (i.e., not feeling empathy) personalities get an edge in academia so get promoted, and that such bullies can just change Universities upon being discovered, without any consequences / reputation following them. Academia should have a duty of care for vulnerable people, especially PhD and ECR, and there should be an HR folder following Academics through their careers. Unfortunately, academia is like any other places where they are many applicants and only a few chosen: it breeds abuse. No one wants to jeopardise their whole career especially because academia has so much passionate and hard working people, so people stay silent. When, rarely, someone does speak up, the powerful defend each other, or are just scared about making any waves, or bad reputation for the institution (?), in any case, they do not act.</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" style="border-right: solid thin">4</td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>was subjected to bullying and harassment for 3 years in two roles from the same university (previous workplace) setting.

It became unbearable when he turned on another female collegue [sic] making it impossible for both of us to continue working with him. i [sic] had approched the Institute director for help and while he agree that my spervisor [sic] a bully, he told me to ignore it and toughen up. I complained to HR, they initiated an internal review and I was found to be at fault. With not opportunity to see the report or reply to the information used to target me, I took the insititute [sic] to fairwork [sic] for failing to stop a bully and intimidation. I was treated for depression and while my case was strong enough to go to court, I was not emotionally strong enough to proceed. The fairwork ombudsman found in my favour and ordered a penalty against the institute and awarded damages to me. While I won, I lost my job, my career direction and had to start all over again in a different research field. I am now years behind my peers and may not achieve my career goals of promotion and independent research [sic].</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" style="border-right: solid thin">5</td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>I reported a case of research grant fraud to the ARC (openly admitted by the perpetrator, and which would have been provable with documentary evidence). The ARC did not investigate it themselves, but passed the investigation to the university, which fudged it and said they could not find enough evidence to launch an investigation. Worse, I reported this apparent cover-up to the relevant state's anti-corruption watchdog, which compounded the cover-up by ruling that the university had had no motivation to cover up a fraud, and that the university did not have a conflict of interest in investiating [sic] a fraud by a staff member.</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" style="border-right: solid thin">6</td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>I do not currently have any faith in the oversight of scientific integrity in Australia. Policing scientific misconduct needs root-and-branch reform, and has to be based on a model that cannot be gamed or influenced by the establishment or the 'boys club', and must operate openly and transparently. I am certain that if I had committed a fraud worth hundreds of thousand of dollars, I would be in jail. Not so if you are a 'star' researcher with the backing of the establishment.

She has also behaved like this in previous roles, and keeps getting away with this behaviour. There are 7 of us who have ended up seeing counsillors/psychologists [sic], I have had anxiety and panic attacks, and now am triggered everytime I see an email come through from her. She has bullied over email, so we have all the emails saved in a folder, none of it has been face to face, and she's only bullied the women in her research group (until recently, then two of the males also have experienced this).</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" style="border-right: solid thin">8</td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>I was asked outright to forge data replicates by a highly esteemed academic (an OBE/FRS).

I've reported the worst of them and the University did nothing and I was forced to take annual leave because the University and my previous boss made it clear that the stress I was under did not meet the requirements for any kind of medical/special leave. Since leaving Universities and starting in a Medical Research Institute I have never been happier or felt safer. Reporting the harassment was a waste of time at the University but I do believe that in my current workplace it would not be futile.</italic></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
