The so called COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is an opportunistic secondary infection, primarily affecting ICU patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Patients affected by COVID-19 associated ARDS and CAPA suffer from an increased morbidity and mortality compared to patients without CAPA and COVID-19 ARDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Besides immunologic mechanisms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, invasive mechanical ventilation, concomitant corticosteroid or antibody treatment, and older age, were identified as independent risk factors for an increased susceptibility to invasive fungal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Changes in the gut microbiome are known to have an impact on the immune response via various cross talks between intestinal bacteria and immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).

Recently, our group has shown that changes in intestinal bacterial composition are associated with an increased complication rate of COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). CAPA is a severe infectious complication of COVID-19, and building on our previous results, we addressed the importance of the gut on the development of CAPA in the same patient cohort.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Study design and patient cohort</title><p id="P8">The aim of this single center observational study at the Klinikum rechts der Isar of the Technical University of Munich was to investigate possible associations between an altered intestinal and lung microbial composition and the occurrence of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) in critically ill patients.</p><p id="P9">To this end, we examined a total of 42 patients treated in our ICU for COVID-19 induced respiratory or multi-organ failure, between April and July 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (TaqMan™-PCR performed on Roche cobas® 6800, Basel, Switzerland), performed on nasopharyngeal swabs or tracheal fluid. During the ICU stay, patients were prospectively screened using respiratory specimens in defined time intervals (every three days during their ICU stay) for the development of CAPA. Beside galactomannan testing from serum and respiratory specimens, routine microbiological tests were performed at the same time intervals. All patients received a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest before ICU admission. Sixteen patients (38%) were diagnosed with CAPA at the time of study enrollment, based on the ECMM/ISHAM consensus criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Every COVID-19 patient fulfilling the mentioned criteria was discussed between experts in microbiology, infectious disease and intensive care medicine to ascertain that the criteria for CAPA were met. The remaining 26 patients served as CAPA-negative COVID-19 controls. The severity of COVID-19 disease was defined using the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). All patients were seriously ill with an average WHO grade of 6.8 (standard deviation: 1.33), and some patients died in the course of the disease (N = 15). Patients were fed parenterally together with enteral nutrition via a gastric tube (artificial feeding). Antibiotic therapies were classified according to their effect on the gut microbiome as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). We evaluated the antibiotic intake up to two weeks before the stool or sputum sample was taken. No vancomycin or linezolid was administered.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Microbial sampling and 16S rRNA gene sequencing</title><p id="P10">We collected a total of 14 tracheal and 40 stool samples for microbial profiling from the 42 COVID-19 patients treated in our ICU. Microbial samples had matching complete blood count (CBC) and serum samples available. For intubated patients, stool was collected either by a Flexi-Seal™ (Convatec, Munich, Germany) device (N = 13), a fecal collector (stool collection bag, N = 23) or regular means (N = 4). Tracheal secretions were obtained by endobronchial aspiration via respiratory tube or by bronchoalveolar lavage during intubation.</p><p id="P11">Preparation and sequencing of microbial samples was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Samples were stored in a solution to stabilize DNA (MaGix PBI, Microbiomix GmbH, Regensburg, Germany). Sample preparation and paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq targeting the V3V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Raw FASTQ files were processed using the NGSToolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TUM-Core-FacilityMicrobiome/ngstoolkit">https://github.com/TUM-Core-FacilityMicrobiome/ngstoolkit</ext-link>) based on USEARCH 1125 to generate denoised zero-radiation operational-taxonomic units (zOTUs). We excluded zOTUs with a relative abundance &lt;0.1% and a prevalence &lt;5%.

Briefly, read counts were normalized and differences in relative abundance of taxa and/or zOTUs were determined by a Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test for multiple groups and Mann-Whitney-U tests for pairwise comparisons, respectively. Associations between categorical variables were tested using Fisher’s Exact test. Similarity between samples was estimated using on a distance matrix based on generalized UniFrac distances. Confounders and possible effect modifiers of microbial ecosystems were determined via a permutational multivariate analysis of variance using the aforementioned distance matrix.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="P13">Patients signed the informed consent either before intubation or after extubation.

A basic summary of clinical characteristics and patient-level information are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">2</xref>. We first examined clinical covariates for their association with CAPA status and only found age to differ significantly between groups. Specifically, the median age among COVID-19 patients with CAPA was 76.5 years as opposed to 61.5 years in non-CAPA patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, p = 0.008, Mann-Whitney-U test). Further trends of a higher occurrence in CAPA patients could be appreciated for age-related pre-existing conditions such as coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl. Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) COVID-19 patients with pulmonary <italic>Aspergillus</italic> superinfection exhibited a worse course of disease, prolonged mechanical ventilation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl. Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 1B</xref>) and higher fatality rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Accordingly, vasopressor therapy was needed significantly more often in CAPA patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, the application of dexamethasone was balanced between CAPA and non-CAPA cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl. Table 3</xref>). Taken together, we confirmed that CAPA is associated with a significantly increased COVID-19 disease severity, and we found older age to be the main risk factor for contracting CAPA in our cohort.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Consideration of factors influencing the microbiome and comparability between study groups</title><p id="P15">16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of 40 fecal samples available from the 42 COVID-19 patients treated in our ICU revealed diverse ecosystems dominated by the two major phyla <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> (cumulative mean relative abundance, 85%). Importantly, we did not detect significant differences in gut microbial composition between CAPA and non-CAPA patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Figure 2B</xref>). Consequently, we evaluated further sample and patient metadata more carefully in an unbiased manner using a multivariate analysis of inter-individual variabilities in microbiota structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl. Table 4</xref>). Here, we found ‘days since hospital admission’ as the most prominent factor (p = 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Both, species richness and the abundance of a total of 47 genera correlated significantly (false discovery rate &lt; 0.1) with days passed since hospital admission (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Figure 2A</xref>). Most genera showed a negative relationship, including <italic>Actinomyces, Ruminococcus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>. On the other hand, <italic>Enteroccocus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> genera represented exceptions with increasing relative abundance during hospital stay.</p><p id="P16">Further influential covariates included ‘total length of ICU stay’, dexamethasone and antibiotic treatment, and whether patients were considered to be late in their COVID-19 disease course, i.e. if they had already cleared the virus from their upper airway as verified by PCR testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast to the above covariates, we did not find feeding, stool collection type or age to exhibit significant influence on the global microbiota structure in these 40 stool samples.</p><p id="P17">Patients with late COVID-19 were both hospitalized and treated in the ICU for a significantly longer time than their early disease counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Figure 2C, D</xref>). Furthermore, dexamethasone treatment was absent in late disease patients and fecal management more often involved a Flexi-Seal™ device (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Figure 2E</xref>) and a lack of antibiotic therapy tended to occur more in patients with early COVID-19 disease. Lastly, stool microbial alpha diversity was significantly lower in patients with late COVID-19 disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Suppl. Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P18">For further investigation into microbial changes accompanying CAPA, we accounted for the aforementioned factors by stratifying patients both by early (ED) versus late disease (LD) and non-CAPA versus CAPA status yielding four groups: ED non-CAPA (N = 15), ED CAPA (N = 10), LD non-CAPA (N = 9) and LD CAPA (N = 6). With this approach, no significant difference in hospitalization length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), antibiotic therapy, feeding or stool collection method could be observed between the respective CAPA and non-CAPA groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), allowing us to draw firm conclusions on microbial composition.</p><p id="P19">We further examined microbial samples from tracheal secretions, which were available from 9 non-CAPA and 5 CAPA patients (data not shown). Permutation analysis of inter-individual variabilities in microbiota structure found no significant role for CAPA status and again identified ‘days since admission’ as the most influential covariate. The latter was highest in four late disease COVID-19 patients. However, the limited patient number in this subset prohibited further statistically sound comparisons between non-CAPA and CAPA patients.</p><p id="P20">In summary, stool and bronchial microbial communities showed increased damage with hospital stay. Adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 disease course status yielded groups of CAPA and non-CAPA patients that were balanced concerning major influences on stool inter-individual variabilities.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Impaired fecal microbiota and staphylococcal outgrowth occurs in late but not early CAPA</title><p id="P21">In the following, we analyzed the association CAPA and gut microbial signatures in more detail. In the ED group, no difference in alpha diversity could be demonstrated for CAPA or non-CAPA patients (p = 0.89, Mann-Whitney-U test). On the other hand, in the group of LD, patients with CAPA tended to show a decrease in microbial richness compared to non-CAPA cases, although this was not significant according to the p-value (p = 0.11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly, LD CAPA samples were significantly overrepresented (Odds ratio = 15.0, p = 0.01 Fisher’s Exact test) among the least diverse 20 percent of samples as determined by sample richness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). No linear correlation could be observed for changes in gut microbial composition between CAPA and non-CAPA patients in ED versus LD respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that pulmonary aspergillosis associates with distinct metagenomic shifts in each condition. Interestingly, significantly more <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> was found in the stool of LD CAPA patients compared with LD non-CAPA patients. (p: 0.008, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, we observed both a trend towards a reduced gut microbial within-sample diversity and a specific expansion in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> relative abundance separating CAPA from non-CAPA cases late in COVID-19 disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">COVID-19 has now been a global pandemic since late 2019, impacting many aspects of life. Although vaccines have reduced morbidity, COVID-19 remains a threatening and serious disease, especially in predisposed and immunocompromised patients. Viral infections of the lung are prone to fungal superinfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) likely facilitated by inflammatory damage to the lung epithelium and an impaired immune response associated with the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Coinfection, on the other hand, leads to a significant worsening of respiratory symptoms with increased mortality in patients with viral pulmonary infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). This also applies to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in which coinfection with <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus,</italic> can lead to COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis with poor outcome and the need for intensive care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Risk factors of CAPA disease include severe lung injury in the setting of COVID-19, older age, and preexisting pulmonary disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). In addition, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has been associated with the development of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), and the use of azithromycin also appears to predispose to CAPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). While systemic corticosteroids are known risk factors for IPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), data on their role in increasing the risk for CAPA remain controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>)</p><p id="P23">The gut microbiome has critical influence on the maturation of intestinal lymphoid immune defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and, moreover, on the immune response in peripheral tissues via multiple cross talks with immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). There is evidence of interactions between intestinal bacteria and mycobiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) and bacterial metabolites such as short chain fatty acids seem to play a role in this inter-kingdom communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Studies in mice have shown that intestinal microbiota influence the adaptive immune response to <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> in the lung via regulation of CD4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). A disturbed gut microbial balance between bacteria and fungi, in combination with an impaired immune response, can potentially contribute to invasive aspergillosis as described in the context of IPA and CAPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), but studies on the relationship between CAPA and the gut microbiome are lacking.</p><p id="P24">Here, we were able to show for the first time that CAPA patients exhibit impaired stool and bronchial microbial communities late in COVID-19 disease. Specifically, this includes a trend towards reduced species richness and a significant relative increase of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> in fecal samples. We note that the limited number of cases for now preclude firm conclusions and further studies with higher numbers of cases are needed.</p><p id="P25"><italic>S. epidermidis</italic> belongs to the coagulase-negative staphylococci and is a facultative pathogen, managed for its high rate of nosocomial catheter and bloodstream infections. The bacterium furthermore serves as a genetic reservoir for <italic>S. aureus,</italic> increasing the pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of <italic>S. aureus</italic> via gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). While <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> occurs mainly on the skin of adults, the bacterium is increasingly found in the stool of preterm infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Studies on the prevalence and function of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> in the adult gut are scarce. It has been shown that strains of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> from the gut or skin do not differ essentially in their ability to form biofilms and pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). A recent study has identified the gut as a reservoir and origin of bloodstream infection with <italic>S. epidermidis,</italic> thus challenging the informal dogma that this infection originates exclusively from the environment or the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). In addition, colonization of the intestine with <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> in mice leads to serious damage of various extraintestinal organs, such as the kidneys and the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).</p><p id="P26">To consider potential confounders on the microbiome in the context of hospitalization, we addressed antibiotic therapy, diet, length of hospital stay, and method of stool collection. These factors were balanced in the late COVID-19 disease, which allowed for reasonable comparability between non-CAPA and CAPA cases. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out conclusively, that the microbial results were influenced by the circumstances of hospitalization and further functional studies are needed. Moreover, all samples were collected during the early phase of the pandemic when the SARS-CoV-2 wild type strain dominated. The influence of different virus strains on the composition of gut microbiota and development of CAPA need further investigation.</p><p id="P27">Nevertheless, our findings of an increase in fecal <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> in combination with the tendency of decreased microbial within-sample diversity in CAPA versus non-CAPA patients late in their COVID-19 disease may be indicative of an impaired gut microbiome in severe CAPA. The immunological consequences of the high percentage of coagulase-negative staphylococci the stool of patients with late CAPA disease are unclear. However, due to the option of addressing these changes by application of probiotics or adaption of stool management during hospitalization, the finding may be of therapeutic relevance in this severe disease. Further studies including these therapeutic options and larger case numbers are needed for validation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS155515-supplement-Supplemental_Figure_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d142aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Figure 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS155515-supplement-Supplemental_Figure_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d142aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplemental Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS155515-supplement-Supplemental_Table_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d142aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S16"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank all healthcare workers who made this study possible through their daily efforts in the ICU within the pandemic.
