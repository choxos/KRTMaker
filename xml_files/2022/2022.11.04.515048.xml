Thus, characterization of microbial functional guilds involved in these processes is high on the political agenda. Yet, typical sequence based characterization often represents only a minor fraction of their diversity in nature due to their frequent low relative abundance, insufficient sequencing depth of traditional metagenomes of complex communities, and limitations in coverage and efficiency of PCR-based assays. Here, we developed and tested a targeted metagenomic approach based on probe capture and hybridization to simultaneously characterize the diversity of multiple key metabolic genes involved in inorganic N and CH4 cycling. We designed comprehensive probe libraries for each of the 15 selected marker genes, resulting in 264,000 unique probes in total. These probes were used to selectively enrich the target genes in shotgun metagenomic libraries. In validation experiments with a mock community of cultured microorganisms, the target gene profiles were similar to those of the original community when sequenced with targeted metagenomics. Further, relative abundances of the marker genes obtained by targeted and shotgun metagenomics from agricultural and wetland soils correlated positively, indicating that the targeted approach did not introduce a significant quantitative bias. However, targeted metagenomics generated substantially higher diversity in terms of taxonomic coverage, and a larger number of sequence reads per sample, which allowed 35 times or 18% higher diversity estimates than when using shotgun metagenomics or targeted PCR amplification, respectively. Thus, captured metagenomics complements current approaches by enabling a targeted, more detailed characterization of the diversity of key functional genes involved in N and CH4 cycling within and across ecosystems.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The global nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycles are essential components of the Earth’s biosphere. All major N transformation processes, i.e., nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification and anammox, are performed exclusively by specific functional guilds of bacteria and archaea that are critical for ecosystem functioning. Their activities are thus crucial in regulating N availability for primary producers and microorganisms across ecosystems, as well as emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and other volatile N compounds through nitrification and denitrification. Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) is a major product of the microbial trophic chain driving C cycling, and, like most inorganic N compounds, its production and consumption is also regulated by very specific groups of microorganisms. Importantly, CH<sub>4</sub> is the second most potential greenhouse gas after CO<sub>2</sub>, and, together with N<sub>2</sub>O, contributes at least 25% of the total global warming caused by greenhouse gases (The global carbon project 2020, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Myhre et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Shotgun metagenomics have been useful to provide an unbiased picture of the natural microbiome. However, in complex and diverse microbial communities, such as those found in soils and sediments, even deeply sequenced metagenomes only generate reliable information for a small fraction of the diversity of microbial functional guilds involved in inorganic N and C cycling, mainly due to their low relative abundances. Therefore, characterization of specific functional groups has long relied on PCR amplification of genes that encode key metabolic enzymes, as is well exemplified for organisms involved in various N and C cycling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Knief 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bräuer et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alves et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Romdhane et al. 2021</xref>). However, the gene diversity involved in these biogeochemical processes captured by PCR-based approaches is limited and biased by the primers used, rendering quantitative assessments and comparisons between genes difficult. Further, in complex microbial communities, target genes of interest are encoded by a large diversity of organisms, and usually include a large fraction of novel gene sequence variants from uncharacterized organisms. The geometric expansion of genomic data has made it increasingly obvious that designing a single PCR primer pair to target the inherent diversity of metabolic genes is highly problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bonilla-Rosso et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P5">To improve the analysis of critical, but low abundant microbial guilds involved in N and CH<sub>4</sub> cycling within natural communities, a probe-based targeted metagenomics approach for key genes involved in these processes could be advantageous. For eukaryotes, targeted, high-throughput sequencing approaches known as probe capture, also called hybridisation capture or hybridisation-based target enrichment, have been used to study complex eukaryotic samples such as human exons, ancient human genomes, plant transcriptomes, and cancer marker single nucleotide polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Skoglund et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Ichida et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Futema et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kamil et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bewicke-Copley et al. 2019</xref>.). Different from sequence capture, where multiple probes are designed to cover a whole exon, captured metagenomics relies on large databases of multiple target genes clustered at predefined similarity cut-offs, which are used to design a large number of generic probes that are able to capture an extended sequence space for each of these sequence clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kushwaha et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Manoharan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Here, we developed and tested a novel probe-based metagenomics approach targeting 15 distinct functional genes involved in inorganic N cycling (i.e., N fixation, nitrification, denitrification, anammox, and DNRA), and genes involved in CH<sub>4</sub> production and consumption, based on newly developed gene and probe databases. To aid in the design of probe libraries to capture the diversity of N and CH<sub>4</sub> cycling genes, the MetCap bioinformatics pipeline was developed as a protocol to produce probes from highly complex datasets for targeted metagenomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kushwaha et al., 2015</xref>). This approach has been successfully used earlier to identify genes involved in microbial C metabolism in soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Manoharan et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Manoharan et al., 2017</xref>). We evaluated our approach using mock communities comprising DNA from organisms involved in inorganic N cycling, or CH<sub>4</sub> production or consumption with varying gene GC% content, which is known to affect probe hybridization efficiency. As proof-of-concept for use in complex communities, we used agricultural and wetland soil to compare traditional metagenomics and targeted metagenomic, and also compared the diversity of archaeal <italic>amoA</italic> genes (marker for ammonia oxidizers) and <italic>nosZ</italic> genes (marker for nitrous oxide reduction) obtained using our targeted probe capture approach with that obtained by shotgun metagenomics or PCR amplification in samples from two distinct soil types.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Development of databases and probes for targeted metagenomics</title><p id="P7">We compiled a total dataset of ~500,000 genes from public databases, after excluding redundant sequences and incorrect annotations, which comprised genes encoding the nitrogenase iron subunit (<italic>nifH</italic>), bacterial and archaeal ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (<italic>amoA</italic>), nitrite oxidoreductase beta subunit (<italic>nxrB</italic>), hydrazine oxidoreductase A (<italic>hzoA</italic>), formate dependent nitrite reductase (<italic>nrfA</italic>), periplasmic nitrate reductase alpha subunit (<italic>napA</italic>), respiratory nitrate reductase alpha subunit (<italic>narG</italic>), copper-containing nitrite reductase (<italic>nirK</italic>), cytochrome cd<sub>1</sub> nitrite reductase (<italic>nirS</italic>), nitric oxide reductase B subunit (<italic>norB</italic>), nitrous oxide reductase (<italic>nosZ</italic>), particulate methane monooxygenase subunit A (<italic>pmoA</italic>), soluble methane monooxygenase component A alpha chain (<italic>mmoX</italic>), and methyl-coenzyme M reductase I subunit alpha (<italic>mcrA</italic>). This information supported the generation of ~264,000 unique gene-specific biotin-labeled probes that were used for targeting the desired sequences in DNA from samples using streptavidin coated magnetobeads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kushwaha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Manoharan et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Relative gene detection and quantification using targeted metagenomics</title><p id="P8">The targeted metagenomic approach was evaluated using mock microbial communities comprising predefined mixtures of genomic DNA from 15 bacterial and three archaeal strains, together containing all 15 functional genes targeted by the probes and mixed in different proportions to produce six different median G+C contents ranging from 47% to 62% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The overall relative abundance of target genes in the captured metagenomes across all GC% categories was strongly positively correlated with those in the original mock communities (<italic>r</italic> = 0.78 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Comparisons between the relative abundance of individual genes in the mock communities as compared to captured metagenomes revealed nearly identical values (t = 1.8518e-10, df = 174.83, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), with the exception of the <italic>nirK</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a,b</xref>). Pearson correlation coefficients across all GC% categories varied between 0.76 and 0.93, although correlations were stronger within higher GC% categories (57%-63%; Rpearson = 0.80-0.93) than within lower GC% categories (47%-53%; Rpearson = 0.76-0.79) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Precision of gene identification</title><p id="P9">Target genes in the mock-communities were analyzed using both in-house and KEGG orthology Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with precision and recall values calculated for each set of models. To determine these values, we identified which reads constituted a “true positive” or a “true negative” by mapping them to their corresponding proteomes. Protein sequences encoded by each genome were annotated using KOFAM (a customized HMM database of KEGG Orthologs). In turn, reads mapped to a given protein were assigned the function according to the above-mentioned KOFAM annotation. Matching assignments of reads from the HMMs (both in-house and from KEGG’s orthology database) were counted as true positives. Precision for the in-house HMMs ranged from 74.1% (<italic>nifH</italic>) to 100.0% (<italic>mcrA</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). The average precision of the models was 93.4%, with a median of 99.8% (excluding <italic>amoA</italic> and <italic>pmoA</italic>). The recall ranged from 42.8% (<italic>nxrB</italic>) to 100.0% (<italic>mcrA</italic>). The average recall was 81.9%, with a median recall of 82.8%. Because KEGG only provides a model that combined the homologous genes <italic>pmoA</italic> and <italic>amoA</italic>, it was not possible to accurately calculate the precision and recall of the in-house models for these genes. An estimate of the precision could still be determined for the two genes though, where a “true positive” meant that the hit identified by the in-house models mapped to the HMM for (<italic>a/p)moA</italic> genes provided by KEGG (K10944). In this case, the precision of <italic>amoA</italic> gene was estimated to be 96.9%, and similarly, <italic>pmoA</italic> gene was estimated to be 100.0%. It is important to note that these estimates do not exclude the possibility that the in-house models predicted that a read belonged to an <italic>amoA</italic> gene, when it actually belonged to a <italic>pmoA</italic> gene, or vice versa.</p><p id="P10">Results using KEGG Orthologs’ HMMs instead of in-house HMMs showed similar results. Note, however, that the results for <italic>amoA</italic> and <italic>pmoA</italic> genes were combined due to the model for the associated KO being the same, as mentioned above. Because KEGG only offered a model combining <italic>amoA</italic> and <italic>pmoA</italic> genes, the custom HMM produced a number of gene matches for <italic>pmoA</italic> and <italic>amoA</italic> for which also archaeal-<italic>amoA (TamoA</italic>) were possible to distinguish. Precision ranged from 76.5% (<italic>a/pmoA</italic>) to 100.0% (<italic>mcrA</italic>), while recall varied from 34.3% (<italic>nifH</italic>) to 100.0% (<italic>mcrA</italic> and <italic>nxrB</italic>). The average and median precisions were 94.5% and 97.7%, while the average and median recalls were 93.39% and 99.03%, respectively. The precision of KOs was lower for <italic>napA</italic> genes than for other genes when compared with custom DNA HMMs. This could be accounted for by the presence of formate dehydrogenase, a known homolog of <italic>napA</italic>. Formate dehydrogenase (K00123) was indeed identified among the genomes used for the mock community, so it is possible that the custom HMM was misclassifying reads originating from this known ortholog to <italic>napA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cerqueira et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Overall the in-house HMM searches performed well when compared to reads mapped to the genomes and assigned KEGG Orthologs based on the full matched protein sequences, which indicates that the HMMs are able to accurately classify the reads in the mock-community. The in-house HMM was a feasible tool for detecting distantly related genes or novel clades of the gene, and can therefore be a more sensitive tool for detecting assigned KEGG Orthologs. As the results obtained with the custom HMM models generally yielded higher precision than those based on KEGG Orthologs, they were used for the final analyses. Noteworthy is that reads identified as false positives may in fact not be incorrect assignments, but could simply represent novel diversity of the genes of interest, not captured by the sequence database for the KEGG Orthologs.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Comparison between targeted and traditional metagenomes, and PCR amplicon sequences from complex environmental samples</title><p id="P12">We investigated the efficiency of the targeted metagenomics approach in natural complex ecosystems by directly comparing this approach with traditional untargeted metagenomes generated with a nearly 200 times higher sequencing depth (~220,000 reads and ~43 million reads per sample, respectively) in soils from a wetland in Bellefontaine, France, and from an agricultural field in Hungary (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). These soils represent distinct ecosystems with average physicochemical conditions, such as water and oxygen conditions, and N availability that favor different distributions of functional genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jones et al. 2014</xref>). Despite the large difference in sequencing depth, targeted metagenomics generated a much larger set of target functional genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), and up to 60 times as many identified gene sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), compared to traditional metagenomics. The relative abundances of functional genes in captured metagenomes correlated significantly with that in traditional metagenomes from both the agricultural field (<italic><underline>R</underline></italic><sup>Pearson</sup> = 0.96, d.f.=14, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.00001) and the wetland (<italic>R</italic><sup>Pearson</sup> = 0.70, d.f,=14, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Relative target gene abundances were also not different between the two approaches (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.90) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). However, reduced relative abundance was detected with targeted metagenomics in the agricultural site for <italic>nxrB, nrfA, narG</italic> and <italic>nosZ</italic> genes and the wetland site for <italic>nxrB</italic>, although, the targeted approach generated a much higher number of reads for these genes in both sites (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>.). The lower relative abundance genes at the agricultural site can be due to some of the other genes being detected more efficiently with the targeted approach. The different relative abundances of functional genes in the two ecosystems reflected the expected differences in their environmental conditions: (i) N<sub>2</sub> fixation genes were higher in the wetland, which are not fertilized; (ii) Genes involved in ammonia oxidation and in nitric and nitrous oxide reduction were higher in the agricultural soil, which are likely to be more oxic and are also subject to N fertilization resulting in higher N<sub>2</sub>O production rates ; (iii) Genes involved in methanogenesis were more abundant in the wetland, where anoxic conditions and methane production typically occur.</p><p id="P13">In order to compare the diversity of specific functional genes detected by targeted metagenomics, traditional metagenomics, and PCR amplicon sequencing, we used the archaeal <italic>amoA</italic> gene as a test case, for which there is a comprehensive reference database for classification available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alves et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, we compared the detection of <italic>nosZ</italic> genes between the targeted and untargeted metagenomics approaches in the agricultural soil, also based on an existing reference database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Graf et al., 2022</xref>). Comparisons were performed on different levels between: (i) targeted and traditional metagenomes, and PCR amplicons of the archaeal <italic>amoA</italic> gene in the agricultural soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>); (ii) targeted metagenomic reads of archaeal <italic>amoA</italic> genes in an arctic peatland soil and an archaeal <italic>amoA</italic> gene amplicon dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>), generated from the same soil in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Siljanen et al., 2019</xref>); and (iii) <italic>nosZ</italic> gene sequences identified by targeted or traditional metagenomics in the agricultural soil (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Comparison between agricultural and wetland soils showed that targeted metagenomics detected substantially higher diversity of archaeal <italic>amoA</italic> genes than PCR amplicon sequencing, while, as expected, traditional metagenomics detected a lower diversity than either of those two methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Specifically, targeted metagenomics detected 71-83 distinct taxonomic <italic>amoA</italic> gene bins, whereas PCR amplicon sequencing and traditional metagenomics detected 65-68 and only two bins, respectively. Rarefaction analysis also indicated that targeted metagenomics retrieved a higher alpha diversity of archaeal <italic>amoA</italic> genes than PCR amplicon sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B,C</xref>). Likewise, comparisons based on the peatland soils showed that targeted metagenomics detected a greater diversity of archaeal <italic>amoA</italic> genes than PCR amplicon sequencing, by detecting gene variants affiliated with nine different Nitrososphaera-related clades, in comparison with only two when amplicon sequencing was used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Targeted metagenomes yielded a higher number of taxonomic bins for <italic>nosZ</italic> genes from the agricultural soil (~6,800 bins) than traditional metagenomes (~1,300 bins) at a 90% identity cutoff, showing that the first approach detected a greater gene diversity based on much lower sequencing depth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Gene sequence reads from both methods mapped to similar lineages in a comprehensive reference phylogeny of <italic>nosZ</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Graf et al., 2022</xref>). However, a greater proportion of reads from the targeted metagenomics approach were assigned to deeper nodes of the phylogeny, particularly within the less studied clade II, suggesting that this method also captured novel <italic>nosZ</italic> variants not represented in the reference phylogeny.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">We developed and evaluated a new targeted metagenomics approach using probe capture to investigate the diversity and distributions of microbial functional groups involved in the cycling of inorganic N and CH<sub>4</sub>. This included the development of an extensive set of probes targeting 15 well-established marker genes encoding key metabolic enzymes and a bioinformatic pipeline to process and annotate the sequence data. In validation experiments with mock communities comprising 18 distinct organisms, we showed that this method successfully reproduced the expected relative abundances of all target functional genes, with one exception (i.e. <italic>nirK</italic>). We observed some variation in probe specificity among mock communities with different genomic GC content, with high GC communities having generally higher target gene detection efficiency. Such variation was likely due to stronger probe hybridization to sequences with higher GC content, given the higher binding energy between guanine and cytosine than between adenine and thymine. Targeted metagenomics also accurately reproduced the relative abundances of target genes obtained with traditional untargeted metagenomics in two distinct natural microbial communities from soils, showing that the probe capture step does not introduce significant quantitative bias. Using archaeal <italic>amo</italic>A genes as a case-study, targeted metagenomics with a sequencing depth of 120-180 Mb per sample generated at least 10 times more target gene sequences than traditional metagenomics (maximum number of <italic>amoA</italic> genes among whole metagenomes was two unique taxonomic bins) and 5 times less target genes than PCR amplicon sequencing with 12-20 Gb and 2.5 Mb datasets per sample, respectively. Moreover, targeted metagenomics also detected much higher gene sequence diversity than the two other methods. For example, the new targeted approach detected 35 times higher alpha-diversity of archaeal <italic>amoA</italic> genes than traditional metagenomics in the agricultural soil, and 5 times higher diversity of <italic>nosZ</italic> genes, especially that of genes affiliated with the less characterized Clade II. In turn, the new targeted method detected 18%, and 4.5 times higher diversity of archaeal <italic>amoA</italic> genes than PCR amplicon sequencing in agricultural, and arctic peatland soils, respectively.</p><p id="P17">It should be noted that the efficiency of this approach largely depends on the coverage and quality of the database used to generate the probes. However, the database is not constrained to full-length gene sequences from a limited diversity of full genomes and long metagenomic scaffolds available, and the probe/target diversity can be greatly extended through inclusion of gene fragments generated by PCR or from short metagenomic contigs. Despite its high target precision, this method may nevertheless capture non-target sequences, especially those of enzymes that are genetically closely related but have different functions, as we observed for <italic>napA</italic> genes and those encoding formate dehydrogenases. Such cases emphasize the importance of thorough data annotation and filtering procedures.</p><p id="P18">Despite the technological advances and declines in cost of high-throughput sequencing, traditional metagenomics remains impractical and prohibitively expensive to capture the diversity of specific, low abundant functional groups in complex environments. For example, the cost of generating these datasets was 100$/sample for targeted metagenomics, &gt;1000$/sample for traditional metagenomics, and 80$/sample per gene for PCR amplicon sequencing. In turn, PCR-based assays are limited by the biases associated with any set of primers targeting a large diversity of sequences and assay efficiencies, which also preclude detection of highly divergent new sequence diversity. The probe capture approach circumvents these limitations by using multiple short probes targeting different regions of each gene, which largely increases the likelihood of capturing sequence variants that elude PCR amplification. Thus, this approach has not only the potential to capture rare and novel gene diversity in complex environments, but also to identify cryptic microorganisms in low-biomass samples or involved in suggested metabolisms, such as in the phyllosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Putkinen et al., 2021</xref>) and coral holobiont (Glance et al., 2021). Moreover, targeted metagenomics also overcomes issues associated with running and comparing multiple independent PCR assays when investigating several distinct targets. In that sense, our approach effectively represents a PCR-independent, multiplex approach to characterize simultaneously and in-depth the distributions of a broad range of functional genes.</p><p id="P19">The targeted metagenomics approach developed here provides an efficient and cost-effective new strategy for studying microbial functional guilds that typically represent small fractions of natural microbiomes, and whose diversity is generally underestimated and highly underrepresented in metagenomic datasets. This approach also circumvents the limitations and biases associated with PCR-based methods and has higher potential to capture rare or novel functional gene diversity.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Target database (TDB) collection</title><p id="P20">A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) model was built based on reference sequence alignments from curated databases already available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alves et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Knief et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jones et al., 2014</xref>; Graf et al., 2016; fungene; WGS), or generated here from gene sequence data publicly available from their protein-coding nucleotide sequences, to cover all known diversity in each protein family.

The final output of these searches were collected and called target gene databases (TDBs). Since some of the genes are homologous, such as <italic>amoA</italic> and <italic>pmoA</italic> genes, and <italic>nxrB</italic> and nitrate reductase genes, the respective TDBs were curated with tblastx/diamond searches against <italic>refseq</italic> database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) to remove some of the duplicates or move them under correct gene annotation based on curation.
