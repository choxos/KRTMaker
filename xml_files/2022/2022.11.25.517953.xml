limited for currently approved COVID-19 vaccines. Further, the emergence of variants of concern (VoCs) that evade immune recognition has reduced vaccine effectiveness, compounding the problem. Here, we show that a single dose of a murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-based vaccine, which expresses the spike (S) protein of the virus circulating early in the pandemic (MCMV<sup>S</sup>), protects highly susceptible K18-hACE2 mice from clinical symptoms and death upon challenge with a lethal dose of D614G SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, MCMV<sup>S</sup> vaccination controlled two immune-evading VoCs, the Beta (B.1.135) and the Omicron (BA.1) variants in BALB/c mice, and S-specific immunity was maintained for at least 5 months after immunization, where neutralizing titers against all tested VoCs were higher at 5-months than at 1-month post-vaccination. Thus, cytomegalovirus (CMV)-based vector vaccines might allow for long-term protection against COVID-19.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Hubei province, China, in 2019 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Since then, the virus has spread worldwide and caused the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although SARS-CoV-2 was genetically largely stable during the initial months of the pandemic, several variants of concern (VoCs) have emerged in the meantime and present an increased threat to global public health <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> due to their augmented transmissibility and/or antibody escape <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">In the European Union, six vaccines are currently approved for administration in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, including two mRNA-based vaccines, two vector-based vaccines, one adjuvanted protein vaccine, and an inactivated virus vaccine. All authorized vaccines induce humoral immune responses against the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, which drives viral entry into cells and is the key target for neutralizing antibodies. However, vaccine-induced immunity wanes within months, resulting in reduced protection against infections and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Consequently, booster shots were recommended, but they also do not confer long-term protection against infection and disease, especially in light of novel immune-evasive VoCs, such as the Beta variant <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, or the currently dominating Omicron VoC (Pango lineage B.1.1.529) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, the need for a vaccine that confers long-lasting and broad immune protection remains unmet.</p><p id="P4">Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) belongs to the <italic>betaherpesvirinae</italic> subfamily and is a well-studied model virus for human CMV (HCMV) infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. CMVs induce uniquely robust anti-viral immunity, which persists over a lifetime <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. This long-term maintenance of antigen-specific lymphocytes, known as memory inflation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, is characterized by an accumulation and persistence of CD8 T cells with an effector memory (T<sub>EM</sub>) phenotype, recognizing immunodominant viral antigens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, CMV has been explored as a vaccine vector that provides long-term immune protection against many infectious targets, based on a peculiarly strong CD8 T cell immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. MCMV infection also results in lasting humoral immune responses toward viral antigens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, which can be exploited to retarget immune protection against other viruses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection for preclinical vaccine efficacy testing were initially restricted to transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2), or mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 variants because the original strains of SARS-CoV-2 could not bind to mouse ACE2 (mACE2) receptors. However, the N501Y mutation in the S protein observed in various VoCs, including Beta and Omicron VoCs, allows mACE2 binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and wild type (WT) mice infection, enabling the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the absence of exogenous receptor expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Recently, our group has demonstrated that an MCMV-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate encoding the S protein from the Wuhan prototype (MCMV<sup>S</sup>) induced long-lasting humoral and cellular immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Here, we show that immunization with MCMV<sup>S</sup> protects vaccinated K18-hACE2 mice against a lethal dose of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain. Furthermore, the same vaccination protects BALB/c mice against viral challenge with the immune-evasive Beta and Omicron strains, and the protection persists for at least 5 months with no signs of immune waning because immunity, particularly virus neutralizing titer (VNT), at 5 months was even stronger than at 5 weeks post-vaccination. Hence, our results argue that CMV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may provide long-term and broad protection against multiple VOCs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Immune responses of MCMV<sup>S</sup>–vaccinated K18-hACE2 mice</title><p id="P6">We have previously shown that MCMV<sup>S</sup> immunization of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice elicits a strong humoral response as well as an inflationary CD8 T cell response towards the S antigen, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Here, we immunized K18-hACE2 mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) with either MCMV<sup>S</sup>, MCMV<sup>WT</sup>, or PBS and challenged them one or three months later with a lethal dose of a SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Mice were bled 7 days before the SARS-CoV-2 challenge, and blood leukocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry (gating strategy shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). MCMV<sup>S</sup> and MCMV<sup>WT</sup> elicited comparable levels of CD8 T cells in total, primed, effector (T<sub>EFF</sub>), terminally differentiated effector (T<sub>TDE</sub>), effector memory (T<sub>EM</sub>), and central memory (T<sub>CM</sub>) compartments in short-term (1 month) and long-term (3 months) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). We noticed that a single mouse in the short-term group exhibited a very low frequency of primed CD8 T cells, possibly an indication of a technical failure.

The long-term cohort showed a ~ two-fold increase of S-specific T-cells in all examined subsets over the short-term cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), and dynamic monitoring of S-specific CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood confirmed a strong inflationary response at single animal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), in line with our previous report in C57BL/6 mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We also observed an increase in average neutralizing antibody titers in the sera of long-term MCMV<sup>S</sup>-vaccinated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Vaccinated mice showed high titers of anti-S IgGs, which recognized various variants of interest and concern. Sera of mice mock-immunized with MCMV<sup>WT</sup> or PBS did not show any S-specific antibody response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E and F</xref>), arguing strongly that the responses were not due to cross-reactions against potential MCMV antigens. Overall, these results indicated that MCMV<sup>S</sup> vaccination induces potent and lasting adaptive immunity towards the S antigen.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge after a single vaccine dose</title><p id="P8">A week after the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, short-term vaccinated K18-hACE2 mice were challenged with 2×10<sup>3</sup> PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1 strain, D614G mutation), and daily monitored for weight loss and disease indicators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). All MCMV<sup>S</sup>-immunized animals that robustly responded to vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B and 1F</xref>) were protected from clinical signs and weight loss, while mock-vaccinated mice became severely ill, reaching the humane end-point by day 5 post-infection or earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B and 2C</xref>). MCMV<sup>S</sup>-immunized mice survived the lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge, even when monitored for 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P9">SARS-CoV-2 can infect a broad range of tissues in K18-hACE2 mice as well as in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested whether MCMV<sup>S</sup> vaccination decreases the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the trachea, lungs, stomach, brain, heart, and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). In all organs, MCMV<sup>S</sup>-vaccinated animals showed reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load for up to 3 weeks, while mock-vaccinated groups exhibited high viral RNA copy numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.4</xref>). In particular, MCMV<sup>S</sup> vaccination reduced viral load in the trachea and lungs by roughly a 1,000-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, trachea and lungs) and also markedly reduced viral loads in the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, brain), which is known to be targeted by the virus in K18-hACE2 mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. The viral burden in other organs showed a similar pattern with a strong decrease of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in MCMV<sup>S</sup>-immunized animals at 7 days post-infection (dpi) in comparison with the control groups, where viral RNA persisted until 7 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, stomach, heart, and spleen). To sum up, MCMV<sup>S</sup> immunization protected animals from developing clinical signs and high viral loads in all organs tested.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge three months after vaccination</title><p id="P10">The sera/plasma of convalescent COVID-19 patients contains anti-S antibodies, which begin to diminish around 28 days after infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Similarly, clinically approved vaccines elicit immunity that wanes over time, and hence, durable immunity elicited by vaccines against COVID-19 is an unmet need. To define the long-term immune protection upon MCMV<sup>S</sup> vaccination, K18-hACE2 mice were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain three months after vaccination and daily monitored for clinical scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). All MCMV<sup>S</sup>-vaccinated mice were protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection, uniformly surviving, maintaining their weights and showing no noticeable symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Viral RNA burdens were reduced in the MCMV<sup>S</sup>-immunized group in all examined organs. A few mice showed remaining viral RNA detected in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, but only minor amounts of viral RNAs were detected in other organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), arguing that a single administration of the MCMV<sup>S</sup> vaccine protects mice for at least 3 months.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Sustained neutralizing antibody responses against Beta and the Omicron variants upon MCMV<sup>S</sup> immunization</title><p id="P11">While our data on protection were encouraging, the emergence of immune-evading SARS-CoV-2 VoCs compelled an examination of the protective ability of our MCMV-based vaccine against representative VoCs. To this end, we conducted vaccine efficacy studies against the Beta (B.1.351) and the Omicron variant (BA.1). Unlike the D614G strain, both VoCs contain the N501Y mutation in the S protein, which allows SARS-CoV-2 infection in common inbred mice, such as BALB/c and C57BL/6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The prototype S protein, present in MCMV<sup>S</sup>, binds to hACE2 but does not bind to mACE2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Hence, by immunizing BALB/c mice, we evaluated the efficacy of a vaccine formulation that does not engage the mACE2 receptor and has potentially fewer side effects. Moreover, to assess whether our vaccine can protect animals for more than 3 months, we challenged the long-term cohort at 5-months post-vaccination. A short-term cohort was challenged at 6 weeks after immunization as a point of reference. One week before the SARS-CoV-2 challenge, all mice were bled for immune status analyses.</p><p id="P12">Virus-neutralizing titers were examined by the pseudo-neutralization assay using pseudotyped VSV (pVSV) that expressed S antigens from the Wuhan, the Beta, or the Omicron variant at 1 or 5 months post-immunization. The neutralization capacity of sera was expressed as the titer resulting in 50% of pseudovirus neutralization (pVNT50), and a head-to-head comparison of pVNT50 against Wuhan and Beta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) or Wuhan and Omicron VoCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) was performed at 5 months post-vaccination. While pVNT50 values against both variants were reduced in most samples, the reduction of titers was less pronounced in Beta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) than in the Omicron variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), consistent with previous clinical observations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The neutralizing capacity was not due to cross-neutralizing effects against the vector, because sera from animals immunized with the MCMV<sup>WT</sup> did not neutralize the pseudoviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and 4B</xref>). Strikingly, monitoring for immune waning by comparison of the neutralizing capacity at 5 weeks and 5 months post-immunization revealed that pVNT50 did not decrease but rather increased from 5 weeks to 5 months post-immunization, and this was observed for all tested VoCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Taken together, an MCMV-based vaccine expressing a receptor-non-binding S antigen elicited strong and long-lasting neutralizing antibody responses.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Reduced viral loads in animals at 1 and 5 months after MCMV<sup>S</sup> immunization and challenge with Beta and Omicron variants</title><p id="P13">A week after the bleeding, animals were challenged with 6×10<sup>4</sup> PFU of the Beta or the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, and vaccine efficacy as determined by the reduction of viral burdens was measured. For this, we analyzed viral RNA copies and infectivity in the lung at 3 days post-infection. We chose this setup since infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles are only detectable for 3 days in the lungs and largely absent from extrapulmonary organs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. MCMV<sup>S</sup>-immunized animals harbored fewer infectious particles in the lungs as compared to the MCMV<sup>WT</sup> control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Parallel viral load analyses indicated that the short-term cohort (1 month) had on average higher residual viral RNAs than the long-term cohort (5 months) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). However, three animals in the 5-months post-vaccination group showed high viral RNA loads upon infection with the Beta VoC and two of the samples were also highly infectious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). These animals exhibited weak or undetectable neutralization against any tested variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), implying poor vaccination response or vaccination failure in a subset of animals. MCMV<sup>S</sup>-vaccinated animals also controlled replication of the Omicron variant based on viral load, which was 100-fold reduced in the short-term cohort and 10,000-fold in the long-term challenge scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). Isolation of infectious Omicron virus was not successful for unclear reasons at present. Taken together, our results are consistent with long-lasting and improving adaptive immunity against the S antigen over time upon vaccination with MCMV<sup>S</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, 1E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Protection against SARS-CoV-2-associated illness against immune-evasive Beta VoC</title><p id="P14">Next, we assessed protection against disease development upon challenge with the Beta or Omicron VoC. In groups challenged 1-month post-vaccination with the Beta variant, MCMV<sup>S</sup>-immunized animals retained their weights and displayed few clinical symptoms, while MCMV<sup>WT</sup> mock-immunized animals lost around 10% of their initial weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-C</xref>). Similarly, MCMV<sup>S</sup>-vaccinated animals were overall protected from weight loss in comparison with MCMV<sup>WT</sup>-controls at 5-months post-vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>) and displayed lower clinical scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref> and <bold>5F</bold>). A randomly pre-selected subset of animals was monitored for 7 days, where 50% of animals in the mock-immunized group reached the humane end-point, while body weights were maintained in all MCMV<sup>S</sup>-vaccinated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>). Animals that were challenged with the Omicron variant showed no weight loss and very mild clinical symptoms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), in line with reports by other studies. Animals vaccinated with MCMV<sup>S</sup> for 5 months were nevertheless protected against the mild symptoms elicited by the Omicron infection, because the cumulative clinical scores at dpi 3 were on average 2-fold lower in this than in the MCMV<sup>WT</sup> control group. Altogether, our data strongly indicate that a single dose of MCMV<sup>S</sup> vaccination provides long-lasting protection against the immune evasive Beta variant of SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">Several vaccines have been developed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

The emergence of the Omicron variant has emphasized the urgent need for such a vaccine, as the currently authorized vaccine regimens showed heterogeneous protection levels against this variant <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, resulting in 30-88% of vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization and frequent breakthrough infections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.

MCMV shares structural and functional homology with HCMV and allows <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses in the natural host. Hence, we used this model virus to test whether a CMV-based vector might in principle induce long-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease development.

Hence, our data indicate that our approach may provide durable immune protection against COVID-19 upon vaccination.</p><p id="P16">Neutralizing antibody responses correlate with vaccine effectiveness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and are therefore considered an important predictor of vaccine potency.

Here, we show that the MCMV<sup>S</sup> vaccine induces antibodies that neutralize the Beta and Omicron variants and protect against disease upon infection with these viruses, with neutralization titers increasing over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-C</xref>). This feature is unique for our vaccine approach and in stark contrast with other vaccine formulations, which require prime/boost administration for optimal performance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Considering that neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 wane at similar rates upon infection or vaccination with currently used vaccines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, our vaccine provides an improvement over both of these scenarios.</p><p id="P17">Interestingly, even the vaccinated animals with weak neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants were protected against illness and showed lowered viral loads in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This phenomenon was also demonstrated in a preclinical study with rhesus macaques and in clinical studies, where study subjects were protected although no neutralizing antibodies were observed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. One may speculate that T-cell immunity elicited by MCMV<sup>S</sup> vaccination protected these animals, but we cannot exclude the possibility that memory B lymphocytes in MCMV<sup>S</sup>-immunized mice responded to the challenge by rapidly generating neutralizing antibodies upon challenge, thus limiting virus replication and protecting the host. It is finally also possible that the concerted action of these two lymphocyte lineages protected the vaccinated mice against challenge. To differentiate between these scenarios, one may use MCMV vectors eliciting T-cell responses against S epitopes only, or mice lacking T-cells, but these experiments go beyond the scope of our study.</p><p id="P18">In this study, we showed that an S antigen that cannot bind to the target ACE2 receptor might still provide robust immune protection. Namely, we cloned the S antigen from the prototypical Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 into our vaccine vector, but the binding affinity of the Wuhan S protein to murine ACE2 receptors is low <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Consequently, the S antigen from our vaccine could not bind to the mACE2 receptor. On the other hand, the N501Y mutation in the S protein enables infection of common laboratory inbred mice, such as BALB/c or C57BL/6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and this mutation is present in the Beta and the Omicron VoCs. Therefore, MCMV<sup>S</sup> elicited protective immunity against variants that engaged the mACE2, although the S expressed by the vaccine vector did not. This is interesting because some studies reported that the binding of the S1 subunit of the S protein to ACE2 on endothelial cells may affect endothelial barrier integrity and cardiac activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. While we cannot formally exclude that long-term S antigen expression may drive adverse effects unrelated to ACE2 biding, our data demonstrate that our vaccine formulation protects mice against SARS-CoV-2 variants in absence of ACE2 receptor engagement, which is especially important if low levels of S antigen persist in the host.</p><p id="P19">The data presented here demonstrate that an MCMV-based vaccine candidate expressing the full-length prototype S protein is highly immunogenic and protective in mice, with robust activation of both arms of the adaptive immune system, cellular and humoral responses. We demonstrated robust protection against a lethal dose of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant in K18-hACE2 mice and the immune-evasive Beta and Omicron variants in BALB/c mice by a single dose of our MCMV<sup>S</sup> vaccine. Future research needs to focus on a head to head comparison of CMV-based vaccines with other COVID-19 vaccine formulations, on the length of protection and administration routes, paving the way towards clinical trials with appropriate CMV vectors. However, by demonstrating in proof of concept that a CMV vector can provide long-term protection against COVID-19 upon a single immunization shot, we provide here the first and crucial step in this direction.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="print-only"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell culture and viruses</title><p id="P20">Vero E6 (CRL-1586) and M2-10B4 cells (ATCC CRL-1972) were cultured as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.
