The World Health Organization (WHO) lists <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the highest threat level of ‘critical’ for bacterial pathogens for which new antibiotics are urgently required(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Protein bacteriocins, such as pyocins, are narrow-spectrum antibiotics that kill bacteria closely related to the producing strain and play a key role in colonization and competition in bacterial communities(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). One potential advantage of utilizing bacteriocins as therapeutic antibiotics is the ability to target a specific pathogen while avoiding collateral damage to the microbiota. This approach may enable antibiotic therapy without common complications associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, such <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection and domination of the microbiota with broadly drug resistant pathogens that may subsequently disseminate to cause serious systemic infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). In addition, there is growing concern that alteration of the microbiota, including that induced by the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, may increase the risk of developing a range of chronic inflammatory diseases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p><p id="P4"><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can produce a diverse range of pyocins. The soluble or S-type pyocins are multi-domain proteins produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to kill strains of the same species. S-type pyocins share basic characteristics including homologous cytotoxic domains with the well-studied colicins of <italic>E. coli</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Most characterized pyocins display a nuclease activity which targets DNA (S1, S2, S3, S8, Sn and AP41), rRNA (S6) or tRNA (S4 and SD2)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). In addition, pyocin S5 is a pore-forming toxin and pyocin M inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis through the degradation of lipid II(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Nuclease pyocins are normally co-expressed with immunity proteins that bind tightly to the cytotoxic domain to protect the producing strain from self-intoxication(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Initial contact with the cell surface for multiple S-type pyocins, including S5, SD2 and S2 and the unrelated L-type pyocin L1, is through the common polysaccharide antigen (CPA)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). CPA is a homopolymer of the rare deoxyhexose D-rhamnose that is not widely distributed in nature, with L-rhamnose being predominant. The CPA is therefore a useful generic receptor for diverse pyocins to target <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, enabling their accumulation on the cell surface. Structural and functional studies of pyocin S5 show that the CPA binding domain is formed by the second of two kinked three-helix bundle (kTHB) domains and that the sequence of this domain is highly conserved in pyocins that target the CPA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). The N-terminal kTHB domains of pyocin S5 mediates interaction with the cell surface FptA transporter, a TonB-dependent transporter (TBDT). Similar to other identified pyocin transporters, the normal physiological role of FptA is in iron acquisition, in this case through transport of the iron-siderophore ferripyochelin across the outer membrane(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Parasitisation of iron uptake pathways by pyocins extends to the energization of transport by the TonB1-ExbB-ExbD complex which services a repertoire of outer membrane TBDTs to energise outer membrane transport. In the case of pyocins, this system is hijacked through the presence of an N-terminal TonB-binding motif that directly binds to the C-terminal domain of TonB1, energizing translocation directly though the lumen of the cognate TBDT(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). In the case of the pore-forming pyocin S5, transport to the periplasm is sufficient for the C-terminal cytotoxic domain to insert into and depolarize the inner membrane to kill the cell. For nuclease-type pyocins, an additional inner membrane translocation domain is required to mediate transport to the cytoplasm where its nucleic acid substrate is located(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). For pyocin G, inner membrane translocation has been shown to be dependent on both the AAA<sup>+</sup>ATPase/protease FtsH and TonB1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In this study, two novel pyocins, namely SX1 and SX2, were identified and characterized. Both pyocins display potent killing activity against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1. However, only pyocin SX2 affords effective protection in a <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> model of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments demonstrated that pyocin SX1 is a metal dependent DNase. In contrast, pyocin SX2 did not show any DNase activity but inhibited protein synthesis in an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription-translation assay. Mapping the uptake pathways of SX1 and SX2 shows these pyocins utilize the common polysaccharide antigen (CPA) as a cell surface receptor and a previously uncharacterized TonB-dependent transporter (TBDT) PA0434 as a translocator to cross the outer membrane.

Two genes encoding putative novel pyocins, designated pyocins SX1 and SX2, were identified in the genome sequences of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> LMG5031 and <italic>Pseudomonas sp</italic>. 2_1_26, respectively. Both putative pyocin genes are located downstream from a P-box element which is the regulatory sequence for production of many pyocins and upstream from genes encoding putative immunity proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Comparison of the SX1 and SX2 sequences with the sequence of pyocin S2, indicates high levels of sequence identity within the CPA binding domain and inner membrane translocation domains, but little identity within the transporter binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, little sequence identity between the transporter domains of pyocins SX1 or SX2 was observed with any of the characterized pyocins indicating they likely utilize a novel pyocin transporter. However, the transporter binding domains of pyocin SX1 and SX2 share 65% sequence identity indicating they may utilize the same unknown transporter. Further analysis showed that pyocin SX1 has a DNA-targeting HNH-nuclease cytotoxic domain that shares 63% amino acid identity with pyocin S2 whereas pyocin SX2 contains a pyocin G-like cytotoxic domain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). A cytotoxic domain homologous to those of pyocin SX2 and pyocin G is present in carocin D and carocin S3 and from <italic>P. carotovorum</italic> and both of these bacteriocins have been reported to display DNase activity in vitro(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). The deduced domain structures for pyocin SX1 and SX2 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>. Based on the above analysis we predict that pyocins SX1 and SX2 utilise the CPA as their receptor and an unknown TonB-dependent receptor as their transporter.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of pyocins SX1 and SX2</title><p id="P9">To determine if the putative pyocins SX1 and SX2 display killing activity against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates and predicted DNase activity, we produced recombinant pyocins in complex with their cognate immunity proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Pyocin SX1-ImSX1 and pyocin SX2-ImSX2 were isolated by Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinity chromatography (via a C-terminal His6-tag on their respective immunity proteins) and gel filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Both purified pyocins displayed potent killing activity against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> P7, using an overlay spot plate method on LB agar, with a minimum killing concentration of 0.051 μg/ml (0.6 nM) for SX1 and 0.457 μg/ml (5.3 nM) for SX2. Interestingly, pyocin SX2 also displayed efficacy in a <italic>Galleria mellonella P. aeruginosa</italic> infection model although pyocin SX1 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Further analysis indicated that pyocin SX1 is relatively rapidly inactivated on administration to <italic>G. mellonella</italic> whereas SX2 retains its biological activity over an extended time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To determine if pyocins SX1 and SX2 displayed their predicted nuclease activity against DNA, we separated the pyocins from their respective immunity proteins and tested their DNAse activity in a plasmid nicking assay. Similar to other HNH-DNase type pyocins, pyocin SX1 displayed a metal-dependent DNase activity. Pyocin SX1 was highly active in the presence of magnesium and nickel and able to completely degrade plasmid DNA, while in the presence of zinc a lower level of activity was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, pyocin SX2 did not display DNase activity under any of the tested conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). This result is surprising given the reported DNase activity of carocin D and carocin S3, which possess a cytotoxic domain homologous to that of pyocin SX2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). To probe the activity of pyocin SX2 further, we tested its ability to inhibit protein synthesis in an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription-translation assay. In this experiment, 200 ng of immunity protein-free pyocin SX2, colicin D, a tRNase used as a positive control, or pyocin S5, a pore-forming pyocin, used here as a negative control, were added to the transcription-translation assay. Pyocin SX2 and colicin D significantly lowered the production of the reporter protein, Renilla luciferase, by 50% and 97%, respectively, when compared with the untreated control. The negative control, pyocin S5, had little effect on luciferase production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, the effect on luciferase production with pyocin SX2 treatment was shown to be dose dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). These data indicate that the cytotoxic effect of pyocin SX2 is due to interference with either transcription or translation ultimately leading to reduced protein synthesis. However, the exact molecular target of pyocin SX2 remains unknown.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Identification of the receptor and transporter of pyocins SX1 and SX2</title><p id="P11">To date, all known S-type pyocins for which import mechanisms have been determined require a specific TBDT for translocation across the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> outer membrane.

The colonies grown after incubation were then picked and re-screened for pyocin sensitivity. In total, thirty spontaneous mutants isolated after pyocin SX1 or SX2 treatment were tested using spot tests for sensitivity against 4 pyocins: SX1, SX2, SD2 and L1 at 1 mg/ml. Testing against SD2 and L1 was performed to determine which isolates were likely to carry mutations that deplete or abolish CPA synthesis because both of these pyocins utilize the CPA as an outer membrane receptor(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Since both SX1 and SX2 appear to carry a CPA binding domain, it was hypothesized that mutant strains resistant or tolerant to all 4 pyocins were likely to be deficient in CPA production whereas mutant strains only resistant or tolerant to SX1/SX2 were putative SX1/SX2 transporter mutants.</p><p id="P12">Consistent with this strategy, genome sequencing of 4 putative CPA production mutants showed these strains carried mutations in either the <italic>gmd</italic> gene encoding GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) or <italic>PA5455</italic> coding for a putative glycosyltransferase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).

To examine the effect of Fe(III) concentration on PA0434 expression, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 was treated with pyocins SX1, SX2 or SD2, which utilizes the ferripyoverdine transporter FpvAI, under iron-rich (with 50 μM FeCl<sub>3</sub>) and iron-limiting (with 200 μM 2,2’-bipyridine) conditions. Iron availability had little effect on sensitivity of PAO1 to pyocins SX1 and SX2 whereas sensitivity to pyocin SD2 was as expected inhibited by FeCl<sub>3</sub> and improved by bipyridine reflecting expression of the FpvAI transporter under these conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). These results suggest that the expression of PA0434 is independent of iron availability and so PA0434 likely does not play a role in iron uptake. Consistent with this, <italic>PA0434</italic> lacks an upstream Fur box (5’-GATAATGATAATCATTATC-3’) which acts as the recognition sequence for the ferric uptake regulator (Fur)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). In <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, Fur controls both metabolism and virulence in response to iron availability including iron uptake via iron-siderophores(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Thus, PA0434 may be involved in the uptake of a molecule other than an iron-siderophore. To determine if pyocin sensitivity can be suppressed by other metal ions, reflecting repression of PA0434 expression, the effect of Zn(II), Mn(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) ions on sensitivity of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 to pyocins SX1 and SX2 was determined using the overlay spot plate assay. From the metal ions tested, only the presence of CuSO<sub>4</sub> decreased sensitivity of PAO1 to pyocins SX1 and SX2 while the addition of other metals did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To confirm the specificity of the inhibitory effect of Cu(II), sensitivity of PAO1 to pyocins SX1 and SX2 was tested under a number of conditions. Pyocin SD2 and pyocin AP41 were selected as controls since pyocin SD2 utilizes the iron transporter FpvAI and sensitivity to pyocin AP41 is largely independent of iron availability(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). In these experiments, sensitivity to pyocins SX1 and SX2 was reduced when 1 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> was added to the medium. Conversely, the killing activity of both pyocins was increased in the presence of triethylenetetramine (TETA), a high-affinity Cu(II) chelator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5BC</xref>). FeCl<sub>3</sub>, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, the Fe(III)-chelator bipyridine and the Zn(II)-chelator N,N,N’,N’-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) had little effect on the sensitivity of PAO1 to pyocins SX1 and SX2 suggesting that expression of the TBDT PA0434 transporter is specifically dependent on Cu(II) availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). In addition, sensitivity to pyocin SD2 was decreased by the addition of FeCl<sub>3</sub> and increased by the addition of bipyridine. The addition of CuSO<sub>4</sub> and ZnCl<sub>2</sub> did not affect sensitivity to pyocin SD2, reflecting the highly specific effect of iron availability on the expression of the iron-siderophore transporter FpvAI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The killing activity of pyocin SD2 was modestly increased in the presence of TETA or TPEN. TETA and TPEN are recognized as selective copper and zinc chelators, respectively, although both chelators bind iron with a lower affinity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Sensitivity to pyocin AP41 was not affected by the presence of any metal ions or metal ion chelators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The pyocin AP41 transporter has not been identified but sensitivity to the pyocin is known to be independent of iron availability(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To confirm that the expression of <italic>PA0434</italic> gene is regulated by Cu(II), <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 was grown in liquid medium with different metals or metal-chelators for 8 h and the expression level of <italic>PA0434</italic> gene was determined by qPCR. The expression of <italic>PA0434</italic> decreased by 2.5-fold in the presence of 0.5 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> and increased by 5.4-fold in the presence of 2 mM TETA. We also found that FeCl<sub>3</sub> and ZnCl<sub>2</sub> did not affect the expression of this gene suggesting that <italic>PA0434</italic> expression is specifically responsive to Cu(II) availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). A small increase in <italic>PA0434</italic> expression was observed in the presence of bipyridine and TPEN; however, the change in expression level was relatively small compared to TETA treatment (1.2- and 1.8-fold for bipyridine and TPEN, respectively). Expression of <italic>fptA,</italic> which is the gene coding for the outer-membrane transporter for Fe(III)-pyochelin and pyocin S5 was down-regulated in the presence of Fe(III) and up-regulated in the presence of bipyridine demonstrating the response of <italic>fptA</italic> expression to the presence of Fe(III).

These results indicate the effect of non-specific chelation by the metal chelators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).

This is a surprising result since carocin D and S3, which carry cytotoxic domains homologous to pyocin SX2 have been reported to display DNase activity. Well characterized bacteriocins, including colicin E3 are known to know kill through a targeted nuclease activity against the 16S rRNA and others, such as colicin D and E5, through cleavage of specific tRNAs. Both these activities ultimately act to inhibit protein synthesis and it remains to be determined if pyocin SX2 also targets rRNA, tRNA or acts against a different component of the RNA or protein synthesis machinery.</p><p id="P19">Both pyocin SX1 and SX2 were found to utilize CPA as a cellular receptor and a novel TBDT, CrtA (PA0434) to target <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and cross the outer membrane. Interestingly, expression of CrtA was found to be regulated by the availability of copper, suggesting that in contrast to other identified pyocin transporters, which invariably target iron-containing siderophores or heme, CrtA likely plays a role in copper uptake. Based on these results and previous studies on pyocins S2, S5 and G, a model for the transport of pyocins SX1/SX2 across the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cell envelope is proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). To illustrate this mechanism, the structure of the pyocin SX2-ImSX2 complex was predicted using AlphaFold-multimer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). The predicted structure shows a highly elongated complex with the immunity protein bound to the cytotoxic domain, features typically associated with nuclease-type bacteriocins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). For pyocin SX2 the transporter and CPA binding domains consist of tandemly repeated kinked 3-helix bundles, as is observed in pyocin S5, and these lie N-terminal to an inner membrane translocation and cytotoxic domains. The predicted structure of the cytotoxic domain shares no similarity with other bacteriocin cytotoxic domains for which the structures are known. The mechanism we propose for pyocin SX1 and SX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>) is a composite of the findings of this research and current knowledge derived from a variety of bacteriocins including pyocins S2, S5, G and the nuclease-type colicins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). For pyocin SX1 and SX2, the translocation process is initiated by binding of the CPA binding domain to the CPA on the cell surface to localize the pyocin and allow the N-terminal unstructured domain and transporter binding domain to locate the PA0434 transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Binding of pyocin SX2 to the PA0434 transporter signals for release of the TonB-box of the transporter from the membrane spanning β-barrel enabling binding of this epitope to TonB1 in the periplasm. TonB1 is able to actively induce partial unfolding of the transporter plug domain by utilization of energy from the PMF transduced by the TonB1–ExbB–ExbD complex which utilizes the proton motive allowing the N-terminal to translocate through the PA0434 barrel and present its own TonB binding epitope (TonB-box) in the periplasm. Next, TonB1 interacts with the pyocin TonB-box and mediates pyocin translocation into the periplasm. The immunity protein is released during translocation. Finally, the pyocin molecule present in periplasm is actively transported across the inner membrane via FtsH. The pyocin is likely cleaved during translocation and only the cytotoxic domain is imported into the cytoplasm, as observed for <italic>E. coli</italic> colicins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). In addition, a recent study on pyocin G transportation across the inner membrane demonstrated that TonB1 is also required for pyocin G import into cytoplasm(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). TonB1 interaction may be to localize the pyocin close to the inner membrane from where the inner membrane translocation domain either interacts directly with the membrane or even with FtsH itself for transfer across the membrane and proteolytic processing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p><p id="P20">CrtA is a novel pyocin transporter that has not been characterized previously. Several studies have demonstrated that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is able to utilize different siderophores produced by other microorganisms called xenosiderophores(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). A recent study on siderophore piracy showed that transcription of <italic>crtA</italic> gene is increased when <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was grown in metal-limited media, suggesting that CrtA likely plays a role in metal homeostasis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Furthermore, this study also showed the induction of <italic>crtA</italic> gene expression by two xenosiderophores including ferric-vibriobactin and ferric-yersiniabactin produced by <italic>Vibrio</italic> and <italic>Yersinia,</italic> respectively(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). In <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> ferric-vibriobactin is transported by a TBDT called FvbA. Even though the expression of <italic>crtA</italic> is induced by ferric-vibriobactin, the level of expression is relatively low when compared to the expression of <italic>fvbA</italic>. Moreover, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is not able to utilize Fe(III) from ferric-yersiniabactin suggesting that ferric-vibriobactin and ferric-yersiniabactin are not the specific target for CrtA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). However, these xenosiderophores may share some structural characteristics with the genuine target and partially trigger the expression of <italic>crtA</italic> gene. In addition, a study on the uptake of siderophore-drug conjugates indicated that the overexpression of CrtA in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 increase susceptibility to several siderophore-drug conjugates including BAL030072, MC-1 and cefiderocol(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Thus, the results obtained from this study and from previous reports suggest that the target of CrtA is likely to be a xenosiderophore involved in Cu(II) transport.</p><p id="P21">Due to the spread of MDR <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the development of novel therapeutic approaches to treat <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection has become essential.
