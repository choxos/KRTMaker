How NF2 conformation is regulated and how NF2 conformation influences tumor suppressor activity is a largely open question. Here we systematically characterized three NF2 conformation-dependent protein interactions utilizing deep mutational scanning interaction perturbation analyses. We identified two regions in NF2 with clustered mutations which affected conformation dependent protein interactions. NF2 variants in the F3 subdomain and the α3H helix region substantially modulated NF2 conformation and homomerization. Mutations in the F3 subdomain altered proliferation in three cell lines and matched patterns of disease mutations in neurofibromatosis. This study highlights the power of systematic mutational interaction perturbation analysis to identify missense variants impacting NF2 conformation and provides insight into NF2 tumor suppressor function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>protein interaction perturbation</kwd><kwd>deep scanning mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>MAVE</kwd><kwd>yeast two-hybrid</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">NF2 (Neurofibromine 2, Merlin) is a member of the band 4.1 superfamily of proteins and is closely related to ERM (Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin) proteins, which functions as links between the cell membrane and actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. While the other ERM protein family members do not have activities directly linked to cancer, NF2 tumor suppressor activity was initially characterized in flies and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], and later confirmed in mammalian cell models. NF2 links signals from the cell membrane to growth-related gene expression and acts in cell-cell contact inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], a function defined as one of the hallmarks of cancer. In contrast to the other ERM family members, NF2 lacks an F-actin binding domain. It also binds to phosphatidylinositol lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. NF2 is found at the cell membrane in contact with CD44, where it organizes cell junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] and growth factor receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. As an important regulator of cell growth, NF2 impacts proliferation associated pathways such as MAPK, AKT and Rac signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. It also directly modulates transcription cofactor regulation, via AMOT/LATS or DCAF1, in the YAP/TAZ-hippo pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. More recently, NF2 was found to be an upstream factor of nucleic acid sensing, suppressing cGAS-STING-initiated antitumor immunity in cancer cell models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Genetics also defines a prominent role of <italic>NF2</italic> loss of function in cancer. Genetic mutations or deletion of <italic>NF2</italic> cause neurofibromatosis type 2, an autosomal dominant disease predisposing to the formation of benign tumors. Biallelic <italic>NF2</italic> mutations cause tumor formation in the nervous system represented by vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas, frequently accompanied by hearing loss, dizziness, and neuropathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. <italic>NF2</italic> mutations are also commonly found in aggressive malignant mesothelioma, and frequently observed in other cancer types such as melanoma, breast, prostate, liver, and kidney cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. <italic>NF2</italic> is a general tumor suppressor and cancer driver gene affected by mutations (tumor suppressor gene score 89% in pan cancer analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]).</p><p id="P4">NF2 protein is expressed in various splice-isoforms with the canonical isoform 1 being the longest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S1a</xref>). Isoform 2 has the same N-terminal part as isoform 1 and differs from isoform 1 only at the C-terminus through including exon 16 instead of exon 17. Ending with amino acid sequences from exon 16, the C-terminus of isoform 2 and 7 is five amino acids shorter than in isoform 1. In comparison to isoform 1 and 2, isoform 7 skips exons 2 and 3 and therefore lacks N-terminal amino acids 39-121 corresponding to most of the F1 and the initial amino acids of the F2 FERM subdomain.</p><p id="P5">The isoform 1 has tumor suppressor activity while this activity was not demonstrated for all other NF2 isoforms including isoforms 2 and 7. Expression of isoform 2 was insufficient to impair growth in RT4-D6P2T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], however in HEI-193 cells stable expression of isoform 2 resulted in a reduction in relative BrdU-levels that was comparable to isoform 1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. It was shown that deletion of exon 2 or exons 2-3 resulted in a dislocation of NF2 from the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. A transgenic mouse model revealed promotion of Schwann cell proliferation by a NF2 mutant lacking amino acids 39-121, which was not observed for a C-terminal truncated NF2 isoform 1 protein version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. In D. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, deletion of a seven amino acid long stretch in F2 (AA 177-183 in HsNF2) was dominant negative for NF2 growth control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] and a mutant construct with these seven amino acids replaced to alanine resulted in transformation and uncontrolled proliferation of cultured murine fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. A splice isoform lacking exons 2-4 detected in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines was unable to suppress cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Based on the literature, we conclude that isoform 1 has tumor suppressor activity, while isoform 7 likely represents a version lacking tumor suppressor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S1</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The importance of protein conformation for the tumor suppressor function of NF2 was recognized in early experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Analogous to other ERM proteins, conformational rearrangements within NF2 are associated with functional changes, which are presumably triggered by post-translational modifications (PTMs), lipid- and protein-binding. NF2 can switch between an open and a closed conformation by self-association. The C-terminal residues of NF2 and a fully folded FERM domain are thought prerequisite for the formation of the head-to-tail interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], membrane localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] and tumor suppressor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. However, alternative conformations have been proposed as well and the exact mechanism how NF2 conformation is regulated and how NF2 conformation influences tumor suppressor activity remains elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p id="P7">For example, S518 is a critical phospho-site in NF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] and was suggested to influence signaling activity, localization, protein interaction and NF2 conformation. Most of the data suggest reduced tumor suppressive function caused by S518 phosphorylation. For example, in one study the phosphorylation mimicking S518D mutation in the full length and the C terminal construct prevented association with the N terminal construct, and the WT and S518A mutations allowed interaction with the N terminal part [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Conversely, in another study C-terminal NF2 constructs containing S518 phosphorylation mimicking mutations S518D and S518E increased the binding to N-terminal protein fragments while the S518A amino acid exchange abolished an intra-molecular interaction in co-IP experiments in HEI 193 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Alternative models considering various degrees of conformational open- and closeness, are put forward to reconcile a series of apparently contradicting results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. The interpretation of the data is complicated by experimental difficulties to monitor protein conformation and to clearly distinguish intra- and inter- NF2 interactions. NF2 homodimerizes at various degrees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], and recently it was shown that gain of function mutations can even promote the formation of NF2 cellular condensates in conjunction with IRF3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Elucidating NF2 conformation and its effect on interaction partners and protein function remains a pivotal research task to better understand NF2 tumor suppressor activities.</p><p id="P8">Mutational scanning (DMS) has emerged as a powerful approach to systematically map amino acid residue-activity landscapes of proteins under defined readouts, yielding insights into protein function, structure, and evolution. At the same time these data assist computational variant effect prediction and clinical variant interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Physical interactions between proteins are critical to perhaps all biological processes and as such PPIs are basic cellular functional units that can be assayed universally for, in principle, all proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. We developed a deep mutational scanning protein interaction perturbation screening technique based on reverse yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Here we used this method to scan a comprehensive set of single amino acid NF2 variants using four conformation dependent protein-protein interactions as readout. This allowed to investigate the mutational impact on NF2 protein conformational regulation and thus revealed amino acid residues critical for NF2 function.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Conformation dependent NF2-protein interactions</title><p id="P9">We tested tumor suppressive NF2 isoform 1 and the shorter non-tumor suppressive isoform 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>) for protein interactions and found three isoform-specific NF2 protein-protein interactions in a phospho-Y2H screen. Phospho-Y2H assays involve an active protein kinase delivered on a third plasmid in addition to bait and prey proteins, to also detect protein interactions that are modulated by phosphorylation of one of the interaction partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. The Y2H experiments revealed that Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A, KDM1A, elastin microfibril interfacer 1 protein, EMILIN1, and phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 3, PIK3R3, interacted with NF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). The NF2-KDM1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>] and NF2-EMILIN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>] interactions were listed in other systematic large scale PPI studies, however were not characterized any further. KDM1A equally interacted with NF2 isoform 1 and isoform 7, EMILIN1 interacted strongly with NF2 isoform 7, but not with isoform 1. Both PPIs were not affected by the presence of an active or a kinase dead version of non-receptor tyrosine kinase ABL proto-oncogene 2 (ABL2). In the case of PIK3R3, co-expression of active ABL2 was required for the interaction with NF2 isoform 7. PIK3R3 formed homodimers, and notably this PIK3R3 homodimerization was a pY-dependent interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1b</xref>). Therefore, the requirement of an active tyrosine kinase for the NF2-PIK3R3 interaction may be explained through a requirement for PIK3R3 dimerization. The NF2-PIK3R3 interaction was not observed with isoform 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We narrowed the NF2 binding site for the three interactions partners by using constructs that represented the N-terminal halves of isoform 1 (AA 1-K332, Iso1N) and 7 (AA 1-K249, Iso7N) and the C-terminal halves of isoform 1 (AA M308-595, Iso1C) and 7 (AA M225-507, Iso7C). EMILIN1 and KDM1A bound to the C-terminal half irrespective of the actual C-terminal ex17 or ex16 sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1</xref>). In contrast PIK3R3 interacted with the N-terminal part of NF2 isoform 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S1</xref>). In summary, we found three isoform-specific protein interaction partner for NF2 through Y2H analyses - KDM1A, EMILIN1 and PIK3R3. When divided into two halves, the C-terminal part of NF2 protein interacted with KDM1A and EMILIN1, while PIK3R3 bound to a construct covering the isoform 7 N-terminal half of NF2. Because the longer isoform 1 contained all amino acids present in isoform 7, but does not interact with two of the three partners, we conclude that the protein interactions are sensitive to the NF2 conformation.</p><p id="P11">The very C-terminal residues of isoform 1 are thought to be necessary for the formation of a closed conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Hence, we mutually exchanged the C-termini in isoform 1 and 7 and tested isoform 1 with an exon 16 derived - C-terminus (Iso1-ex16, identical to isoform 2) as well as isoform 7 with an exon 17 derived C-terminus (Iso7-ex17) for Y2H protein interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1a</xref>). Except for a weak increase in growth observed with Iso7-ex17 and PIK3R3 in the absence of active ABL2, NF2 protein interactions with mutually exchanged C-termini were the same as their wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). This suggests that the isoform-dependent interaction specificity is not dictated by the very C-terminal part of NF2. Moreover, since EMILIN binds to the C-terminal half of NF2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1b</xref>), the PPI pattern suggest that isoform specificity of the interaction is due to features in the FERM domain.</p><p id="P12">When we tested NF2 for homomeric interaction in the Y2H assay we found that full-length isoform 7 but not isoform 1 interacted with the C-terminal half of NF2 independently of whether the very C-terminal amino acids of the NF2 fragments or the full length NF2 partner resembled isoform 1 (ex17) or isoform 7 (ex16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). The NF2 N-terminal constructs (Iso1N and Iso7N), when used as prey, did not show any interaction with full-length NF2. The NF2-Iso7N bait construct, while it interacted with PIK3R3, did not interact with either the Iso1C or Iso7C. In conclusion, this suggested, that the homo-dimeric interaction observed with the full length NF2 isoform 7 is mediated by the C-terminal part. Secondly, the isoform specificity had to be explained by the N-terminal part of NF2, because isoform-specific differences in the C-terminal amino acid sequence did not influence the NF2-NF2 interaction. Therefore, the NF2-Iso1 N-terminal FERM domain apparently causes the inhibition of a C-terminally mediated NF2-NF2 interaction, consistent with the hypothesis that isoform 1 adopts a protein conformation distinct to isoform 7.</p><p id="P13">As mentioned above different sets of experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], linked the phosphorylation of S518 to altered NF2 homomeric interaction and conformation using S518D phospho-mimicry and S518A phospho-null NF2 mutations. We tested the S518D and S518A mutant NF2 versions in Y2H assays for interactions with KDM1A, EMILIN1, PIK3R3 and NF2 itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). The KDM1A interaction with NF2 was not substantially affected by changing S518 to either D or A. We observed a weak signal for the EMILIN - NF2-Iso1-S518D interaction and reduced growth for the PIK3R3 - NF2-Iso7-S518D pair in comparison to wild-type NF2. Interestingly, while the NF2 isoform 7 S518A mutant NF2 version, just as wild-type NF2-Iso7, did show homomeric NF2 interaction, S518D perturbed the NF2 interaction between mutated full-length isoform 7 and the NF2 C-terminal part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Apparently phenocopying the isoform 1 FERM domain in NF2 in our assay, we concluded that the S518D phospho-mimicry mutant version negatively affects the PIK3R3 interaction and the NF2 isoform 7 homo-dimerization.</p><p id="P14">In summary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>), our Y2H studies revealed that KDM1A interacted with NF2 isoforms 1 and 7, and EMILIN1 and PIK3R3 interacted with NF2 isoform 7 only. The PIK3R3 interaction was promoted through pY-dependent PIK3R3 homodimerization. We observed a homo-dimeric interaction between full-length isoform 7 and the C-terminal part of NF2 which was inhibited through either an isoform 1 FERM domain or a S518D phospho-mimicry mutation in full length NF2. It is important to emphasize that isoform 1 was active in the Y2H assay and contained all features of the shorter isoform 7. Since only the shorter isoform interacted with EMILIN and PIK3R3 and formed homomeric interactions, the isoform differences must be explained by indirect effects such as intra- or inter-molecular interactions of NF2. We hypothesized that the conformation of NF2 is critical for the isoform specific protein interactions patterns. Therefore, the binding status of KDM1A, EMILIN and PIK3R3 reflects different NF2 conformations. Single amino acid point mutations that are critical for NF2 conformation may therefore be reflected in alterations of protein interaction patterns.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Deep mutational scanning interaction perturbation analysis of NF2</title><p id="P15">We developed reverse Y2H strains that can be used to select non interacting protein variants from complex genetic libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. The NF2-Y2H interactions gave robust growth repression on media lacking adenine, prerequisite for stringent reverse selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure S2a</xref>). We performed deep mutational protein interaction perturbation analysis with NF2 isoform 7 and its four wild-type interacting proteins: KDM1A, EMILIN1, PIK3R3 and NF2 C-terminal domain. A mutagenic library of NF2 isoform 7 containing all possible single amino acid exchanges to alanine (A::GCT), lysine (K::AAA), glutamic acid (E::GAA) and leucine (L::TTG) was generated using a multi-step PCR-based deep mutagenesis approach with on-chip-synthesized oligonucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. The NF2 mutagenic pool was subcloned in the bait Y2H vector and used for transformation of the reverse-Y2H strains, mated in duplicates with the four prey strains in the presence of ABL2 and ABL2-KD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure S2b</xref>).

The mutant NF2 libraries did not show a mutation selection bias during the cloning and strain preparation procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>) and covered the whole NF2 sequence uniformly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). Efficient enrichment of programmed AKEL mutants through interaction selection with the rY2H system was observed, when comparing the input library to sequences obtained from the mutant library tested against a wild-type interaction partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). For all NF2 interaction pairs, we observe a clear deviation from the codon and position specific linear models for the AKEL mutations but very little deviation for all other sequenced mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Enrichment values were normalized across the interactions and expressed as Z-score. Even though we located the respective interaction sites of the interaction partners differently to the N- or C-terminal halves of NF2, disrupting mutants were found spread over large parts of NF2 for all four interaction partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). This result likely reflected both, mutations that disrupt folding as well as mutations linked to conformational constraints of NF2. However, three hotspot regions emerged from the interaction perturbation patterns of the interactions. Amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal half were selected perturbing the interactions in an area in the F3 part of the FERM domain. In the C-terminal half of NF2, we found a region with clustered mutations in the α2H helix (around AA 310 in isoform 7), and a second region in the α3H helix (proximal to AA 350-400 in isoform 7). The interaction perturbation profiles of the four tested interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>) showed substantial overlap in three critical regions located in the N-terminal and in the C-terminal half of NF2.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Assessing single site mutations in NF2-interactions</title><p id="P18">We next validated the deep mutational scanning results in order to identify mutations that selectively alter protein interactions without affecting overall protein folding and stability. 60 amino acid positions were selected and mutations were individually introduced in both NF2 isoform 1 and 7. Constructs were confirmed through sequencing and used for individually testing each interaction with the WT interaction partner proteins in a pair-wise Y2H colony spot matrix assay. 16 of the single-site mutations caused a selective change of interaction patterns compared to interactions observed in their WT isoform counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). We observed distinct patterns of loss and gain of interactions with the two NF2 isoforms and its four interaction partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). 5 single amino acid point mutations altered the NF2 interaction with KDM1A, 4 with EMILIN, 15 with PIK3R3 and three substitutions modulated the NF2-NF2 interaction.</p><p id="P19">The largest class of mutants behaved like WT NF2 in the Y2H assay which can be explained by the different sensitivity in the deep scanning screen compared to pair wise spot testing. Four mutations, Q147E, S265L, R346E and W258E (isoform 1 numbering used throughout), showed unique patterns of interaction perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>) where W258E impacted all three PPIs. Q147E reduced PPIs with EMILIN and PIK3R3, R346 resulted in a selective loss of EMILIN interaction and the Iso1-S265L variant increased the EMILIN interaction. Interestingly, L241A, Y244L, E260L and S265L reduced the KDM1A interaction selectively with the isoform 7, while the substitutions did not affect the PPIs with isoform 1. PIK3R3 did not interact with these variants any more, but the interaction of the four isoform 7 variants with EMILIN was not altered.</p><p id="P20">A large group of variants represented specific PIK3R3 interaction disrupting mutations distributed across the whole protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>, magenta). As defined in the rY2H-seq screen, the majority (A416K, E450A, L458E, Y481L) localized in the C-terminal clusters α2H and α3H. In the colony assay, the interaction of NF2 with PIK3R3 and with NF2-Iso1C appeared generally weaker. This allowed the observation that three α3H mutations, A441L, K471A and P482E strengthened the PIK3R3 interaction rendering it independent of ABL2 dependent PIK3R3 dimerization. The same NF2 variants also resulted in a strengthened homomeric interaction of NF2 isoform 7 with the NF2 isoform 1 C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>, green). Comparable to S518D, which negatively affected both the interaction with PIK3R3 and the NF2-NF2 interactions, the three α3H mutations also showed a coupled phenotype promoting both the PIK3R3 interaction and the NF2-NF2 homomerisation.</p><p id="P21">Notably, in the colony assay, all five KDM1A interaction perturbing mutations were clustered in the F3-FERM subdomain. This is intriguing given the fact that our Y2H experiments showed that the C-terminal half of NF2 was sufficient to interact with KDM1A. The result can be explained by an indirect, conformation driven perturbation of the interaction caused by the F3-FERM domain mutants. In summary, we identified at least two novel regions important for NF2 regulation of its protein interactions and conformation. The N-terminal F3 region in the FERM domain is a key determinant to isoform interaction specificity and the α3H in the C-terminal half of the protein is involved in NF2-NF2 interactions.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Structural impact of FERM domain mutations</title><p id="P22">Mapping the C-terminal mutations in α3H which enhanced the NF2-NF2 interaction (A441L, K471A, P482E) to a structural prediction model of full length NF2 isoform 1 (AF-P35240-F1) revealed a localization of the residues in extended alpha helical rod-like structures of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure S3</xref>), providing limited information for interpretation. However, we mapped the mutations in the N-terminal half of NF2 to a 3D atomic structure of the FERM domain solved in a closed NF2 protein state (PDB: 4zrj, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]). FERM domain structures contain three subdomains (F1, F2, F3) forming a cloverleaf structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). The F1 subdomain resembles ubiquitin, F2 has similarities to the acyl-CoA binding protein and the F3 subdomain has structural similarities to phospho-tyrosine binding, pleckstrin homology, and Ena/Vasp Homology 1 (EVH1) signaling domains. We note that this closed 3D structure also includes a peptide from the NF2 C-terminal part with two A585W/S518D stabilizing mutations (chain B, 506-595) where the tryptophan 585 inserts into the F3-FERM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). In silico mutagenesis (BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2020) allowed to model potential effects of mutations on the conformation of NF2. For example, Q147A, which had a uniquely altered interaction pattern, is located in the F2 part of the FERM domain. The wild-type Q147 formed four hydrogen bonds (&lt;3.4 Å), two of them connected to E152 and R198 in other helixes within the F2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). Upon replacing Q with A in the structure, the hydrogen bonds to neighboring alpha helices were disrupted and weak hydrophobic interactions formed.</p><p id="P23">We propose that the mutations at positions Y244, L241 and W258, which spatially clustered in the central part of the F3 lobe of the FERM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>), may perturb positioning of the large alpha helix (α1F3) in the F3-F1 interface thereby affecting overall NF2 conformation. Residue Y244 was located very central in the F3 subdomain and had a hydrogen bond with amino acid L233 (~3 Å) and one hydrophobic interaction with P252 (4.2 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). A Y244F mutation did affect these bonds, yet added weak hydrophobic interactions to Y221 (5.2 Å) and R249/L250 (4.7 Å) were observed. Modeling a Y244L mutation added weak hydrophobic interactions with R249 (5.5 Å) and L233 (5.0 Å).</p><p id="P24">The intramolecular interactions of L241 involved one hydrogen bond to F256 and four additional hydrophobic interactions with amino acids L234, V236, I273, C300 (≥ 4.7 Å). The model with a L241A exchange lacks all hydrophobic interactions except L234(5.4 Å, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>). The loss of contacts affected interactions with the neighboring β4F3-sheet and the α1F3-helix, the helix connecting the F3 subdomain with the central helical domain. We made a similar observation when modeling the W258E substitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>). In the 3D structure W258 forms hydrogen bonds to residues D237, A238, L239 and I261 (~3.0 Å), hydrophobic interactions with N303/H304, L239/G240, L241, I261 and a Pi-Sulfur interaction with C300. A glutamic acid at position 258 lost all contacts that connected the W258-β-sheet with the α1F3-helix. The structural analysis suggested that mutations at both positions, L241 and W258, perturb the F3 domain interaction with the α1F3-helix. The α1F3-helix was shown to undergo a large structural rearrangement upon PIP2 and LATS binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>).The structural modeling of mutations, although not dynamic, can provide hypotheses which address these NF2 sites within the F3 domain as key residues influencing the conformational state of NF2.</p><p id="P25">E260 spatially clusters with the other interaction perturbation F3-FERM domain residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>), however it does not point towards α1F3-helix, but in the opposite direction. E260 is actually at the contact interface of the F3-FERM subdomain and the C-terminal end of NF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>). E260 forms a strong salt bridge to R588 localized in the C-terminus of NF2 (2.7 Å). Upon modeling a mutation to leucine at the position, this salt bridge was perturbed and replaced with a 4.9 Å hydrophobic contact. Hydrogen bonds between E260 and P257 and L276 within the F3 domain were hardly affected. For modeling the E260L mutation, the Alphafold protein structure prediction (AF-P35240-F1) had to be utilized as E260 is in close proximity of the A585W stabilizing mutation in the 3D Xray structure (4zrj) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). The tryptophan at 585 sterically interferes with modelling the E260L exchange, hence this further suggests that E260 is at an important place for contacts across NF2 to the C-terminal part.</p><p id="P26">In summary, the structural analysis of NF2 variants with altered interaction patterns showed that these substitutions affected contacts to regions distant in the primary sequence, either within the FERM domain or to the C-terminal part of NF2. This observation supports the hypothesis that the sites are critical for the structural dynamics of NF2 and defines the F3-FERM domain, in particular through positions, L241, W258, and E260, as critical structure for the overall NF2 protein conformation.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Effect of NF2 variants on cell proliferation</title><p id="P27">We examined NF2 variants for their cellular effects on proliferation in mammalian cell culture.

Using transient transfection of YFP fused-NF2 mutant constructs in HEK293T cells, we did not observe pronounced differences with respect expression levels and subcellular localization compared to the wild-type NF2. NF2 was mainly found at the plasma membrane, especially at cell-to-cell contact sites, and also in the cytosol. Partial membrane localization was observed for all variants. Iso1-W258E, which was expressed to similar levels as wild-type and the other mutant NF2 proteins, however was more concentrated in the perinuclear region.</p><p id="P28">We next assayed the effects of the single amino acid substitutions on cell proliferation, a key feature of the tumor suppressor function of NF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>].

Both cell lines allowed for a relative high rate for transient transfection and are frequently used for proliferation assays.</p><p id="P29">HEK293 and A549 showed differences in their overall response to NF2 transfection. While the fraction of HEK293 wild-type NF2 transfected cells (YFP positive) decreased over time, this was not observed in the A549 cell line. However, we investigated every cell line separately and assessed the effect of mutant NF2 transfection versus the wild-type protein. Across the 15 NF2 variants tested (S518A and S518D included) three FERM domain substitutions had the strongest and best reproducible effect on the fraction of YFP positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). In HEK293, Y244F showed a relatively lower YFP-positive cell number, Q147A and W258E had a relative higher YFP-positive cell fraction compared to the group of all NF2 variants. Although the A549 cell line had a higher inter-experiment variation in the FACS quantifications, Q147A, Y244F, W258E and S265L significantly affected proliferation. Q147A, W258E showed opposite effects in the two cell lines, which may be attributed to the different genetic background and cell line specific proliferation requirements. Consistently across the two cell lines, our analysis showed that mutations altering NF2 conformation, specifically Q147A, Y244F, W258E in the F3 region, affected cell proliferation.</p><p id="P30">To confirm the FACS analyses, we monitored cell proliferation of YFP-tagged NF2 variants through live cell imaging using a Incucyte phase and fluorescence imaging analysis system.

In five experiments, relative cell proliferation was normalized to the average cell proliferation of all NF2 transfected cells. Confirming the results from FACS analysis with HEK293, wild-type NF2 reduced cell proliferation and Q147A and W285E significantly perturbed this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>).

Rather, both N- and C-terminal NF2 parts appeared as critical determinants for the NF2 interactions in line with your hypothesis that the PPIs reflect NF2 conformation. We observed multiple signals in the N-terminal part of NF2 when probed with EMILIN and KDM1A for which the C-terminal part was sufficient for binding.

The C-terminus is alternatively spliced and includes exon 16 derived sequences which are 5 amino acid shorter (iso-1 580-590: LTLQSAKSRVA → PQAQGRRPICI, iso-1 590-595 missing), Isoform 7 lacks the majority of the F1 FERM subdomain and the beginning of the F2 subdomain encoded in exons 2 and 3, amino acids 39-121. Tumor suppressor activity has been demonstrated for isoform 1 but not for isoform 7.</p><p><bold>b.</bold> Y2H protein interaction results.

Schematic of NF2-Iso7 protein, domain structure with structure (helix/sheet), disorder prediction (DIS) and solvent accessibility predictions (RSA). Aligned, combined enrichment profiles of the four interactions are shown. Sequence position interfering with the NF2-Iso7 interaction are color coded (Z-score). The PIK3R3 profile represents a combination of two biological replicas assayed in the presence of ABL2, the NF2 C-term profile combines two experiments with ABL2KD. KDM1A and EMILIN1 profiles contain a combination of four biological replicas (each two with ABL2 and two with ABL2KD).
