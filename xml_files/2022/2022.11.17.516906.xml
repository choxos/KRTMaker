Here through time-resolved scRNA-Seq, matched <italic>in vivo</italic> functional analysis and the use of a reversible <italic>in vitro</italic> system of early G<sub>1</sub> arrest, we define the sequence of transcriptional and functional events occurring during the first <italic>ex vivo</italic> division of human LT-HSCs. We demonstrate that contrary to current assumptions, loss of long-term repopulation capacity during culture is independent of cell cycle progression. Instead it is a rapid event that follows an early period of adaptation to culture, characterised by transient gene expression dynamics and constrained global variability in gene expression. Cell cycle progression however contributes to the establishment of differentiation programmes in culture.

This impressive output is achieved by rare haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with the unique capacity to drive production of all blood cell types (differentiation), while maintaining a functional HSC pool (self-renewal). Owing to this extensive regenerative capacity, HSCs are the key functional units of HSC transplantation, used in clinical setting for more than 40 years, and of HSC gene therapy (GT). HSC GT promises to be the only long-term treatment option for more than 10 monogenic diseases, including immunodeficiencies, hereditary anemias and metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). HSC GT, as well as other potential clinical applications of HSCs, currently require an <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture step, which by yet mostly uncharacterized mechanisms, is associated with a strong reduction in HSC functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Minimising HSC functional attrition during <italic>ex vivo</italic> protocols would provide patients with larger numbers of functional HSCs. This would not only improve treatment efficacy and safety in current HSC GT indications, but also open the way for new therapeutic applications.</p><p id="P3">Long-term blood formation post-transplantation is driven by highly quiescent long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Quiescence (G<sub>0</sub>) is defined as the reversible absence of cell cycling and is characterised by decreased cell size, reduced protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), high autophagic recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), an elevated basal expression of cell stress response pathways such as the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), and a relatively inactive glycolytic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) maintained <italic>in vivo</italic> by the hypoxic bone marrow niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Upon receiving a mitogenic stimulus, HSCs undergo quiescence exit (G<sub>0</sub> to end of early G<sub>1</sub>) and progressively phosphorylate Retinoblastoma (Rb) until the restriction point (boundary of early − late G<sub>1</sub>), where commitment to division occurs and subsequent cell cycle progression (late G<sub>1</sub> − S − G<sub>2</sub>− M phases) ensues. CDK6 is a master regulator of HSC quiescence exit kinetics, whose differential regulation within the HSC pool guarantees long-term maintenance of HSC pool size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). An emerging body of work has demonstrated further heterogeneity within the quiescent state of LT-HSCs associated with distinct lineage preferences and kinetics of reconstitution post-transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Current GT protocols target the CD34<sup>+</sup> fraction (a heterogeneous mix of HSCs and progenitor cells), but there is currently a limited understanding of how these <italic>ex vivo</italic> protocols impact the underlying biology unique to the LT-HSC population.</p><p id="P4">In current <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture systems, HSCs inevitably exit quiescence and undergo cell cycle progression. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> culture increases protein synthesis rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), remodels the mitochondria to an activated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) with increased oxidative metabolism and ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), disrupts optimal proteostasis programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) and reduces the dependency on lysosomal recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). These changes are all associated with a net decline in long-term repopulation capacity. It has been presumed from literature based on <italic>in vivo</italic> models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) that cell cycle progression itself drives loss of HSC function in culture. Early studies show that it is exclusively haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the G<sub>0</sub> phase of the cell cycle before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) and following culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) that engraft, but not their cycling counterparts. However, to date no study has formally addressed this question in human LT-HSCs undergoing clinically relevant culture. In addition, a number of strategies have been developed to maintain or expand HSCs <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), some of which are extremely promising in both research and clinical settings. Despite these advances, we are still lacking a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between division and maintenance of self-renewal <italic>ex vivo.</italic></p><p id="P5">In this study, by pairing scRNA-Seq with <italic>in vivo</italic> functional analysis in a time-resolved manner, we dissect the transcriptional and functional changes occurring in highly purified human LT-HSCs over their first division in culture. Our data globally identify an early time window of adaptation to the culture conditions, during which human LT-HSC transcriptional programmes are deeply remodelled and which precedes and sets the stage for successive loss of HSC function and initiation of differentiation. In addition, by pharmacologically preventing human LT-HSCs from progressing into the late G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle, we demonstrate that cell cycle progression does not contribute to the decline in LT-HSC long-term repopulation capacity observed <italic>ex vivo</italic> but facilitates the establishment of lineage priming programmes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Loss of HSC function occurs early during <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture</title><p id="P6">HSC functional attrition <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) severely hampers the efficacy of clinical protocols reliant on culture prior to transplantation. Loss of HSC function is commonly thought to be driven by quiescence exit and subsequent cell cycle progression, with dynamics that, to our knowledge, have not been reported to date. We therefore sought to study the kinetics of HSC functional attrition using purified human LT-HSCs, choosing early timepoints of culture (≤ 72 h), corresponding to key transitions of cell cycle progression. Here we opted to study two distinct <italic>ex vivo</italic> systems. In the first, we sought to mimic GT conditions and therefore used mobilized peripheral blood (mPB) LT-HSCs (flow sorted as CD34<sup>+</sup> CD19<sup>-</sup> CD38<sup>-</sup> CD45RA<sup>-</sup> CD90<sup>+</sup> CD49f<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>)) cultured in a 62 h ex <italic>vivo</italic> GT protocol including two hits of transduction with a lentiviral vector (LV) expressing GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). In the second, we aimed to examine conditions commonly used in experimental settings (“EXPER” conditions). Cord blood (CB) LT-HSCs, isolated using the same markers above, were cultured for 72 h in differentiation facilitating media promoting cell cycle progression and lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). We first characterised the cell cycle kinetics of LT-HSCs in our two distinct <italic>ex vivo</italic> conditions. We used phosphorylation of Rb at the serine residue 807-811 as a marker of the transition through the restriction point from early to late G<sub>1</sub>, determining the time at which quiescence exit is complete (G<sub>0</sub> − early G<sub>1</sub>) and cells have entered cell cycle progression towards division (late G<sub>1</sub>-S-G<sub>2</sub>-M). LT-HSCs cultured in either GT or EXPER conditions both entered cell cycle progression (late G<sub>1</sub>) at approximately 24 h post culture initiation (EC<sub>50</sub> of 24.7 h for GT and 23.9 h for EXPER) as assessed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A-B</xref>). Concurrently, the proportion of cycling cells (S-G<sub>2</sub>-M phases) increased within the 24-72 h window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C-D</xref>) as determined by pRb/DAPI cell cycle analysis. LT-HSC's time to first division at single cell resolution was estimated at 62.0 h ± 6.5 h for GT conditions and 53.4 h ± 6.5 h for EXPER conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E-G</xref>). Taken together these data demonstrate that independently of HSC source and culture conditions, LT-HSCs complete quiescence exit by approximately 24 h and their first division in culture by 72 h.</p><p id="P7">Next, to quantify how long-term repopulating frequency is affected by <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture, we performed limiting dilution analysis (LDA) xenotransplantation assays with NSG immunocompromised mice. To this end, we transplanted fixed numbers of i) mPB CD34<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>-</sup> cells cultured in GT conditions for 0 h (G<sub>0</sub>), 6 h, 24 h (end of early G<sub>1</sub>), or 62 h (time of infusion into patients in HSC GT protocols); ii) CB LT-HSCs cultured in EXPER conditions for 0 h (G<sub>0</sub>), 6 h, 24 h (end of early G<sub>1</sub>), or 72 h (post first division). Human engraftment was analysed by flow cytometry 18 weeks post-transplantation. Of note, in the GT conditions, almost all animals displayed grafts with GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data S1</xref>). This broadly indicates that our <italic>in vitro</italic> culture system is robustly recapitulating a GT protocol and that transduced cells contribute to long-term engraftment. LDA showed that the frequency of long-term repopulating cells (% LTRC) within the transplanted LT-HSC population was unchanged for the first 6 h of culture (GT: <italic>p</italic>= 0.568 ; EXPER: <italic>p</italic>=0.938). By 24 h, the time at which LT-HSCs have completed quiescence exit, the % LTRC dropped conspicuously (GT: ~3 fold, p= <italic>0.0539</italic>; EXPER: ~5 fold, <italic>p=0.00148</italic> compared to 6 h). An additional decrease in the % LTRC was observed past 24 h in EXPER conditions (~2 fold, <italic>p=0.0129</italic> compared to 24 h), when LT-HSCs are progressing through the cell cycle and entering mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1H-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data S1</xref>).To verify if the significant decrease in the % LTRC observed between 6 and 24 h post-culture initiation is due to cell death, we measured apoptosis via Annexin-V/7-AAD staining. A decrease in viable cells was observed between 6 h and 24 h <italic>ex vivo</italic> with no further decrease at later time points in both GT and EXPER culture systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1J-K</xref>). Interestingly, the loss in LTRC observed between 6 h and 24 h <italic>ex vivo</italic> largely outnumbered the loss in viability measured in the same time window. We therefore conclude that HSC loss <italic>ex vivo</italic> occurs predominantly before cells enter the late G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle, with kinetics that cannot be primarily explained by cell death.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>LT-HSCs' transcriptome dynamics over the first cell cycle <italic>ex vivo</italic></title><p id="P8">To better understand the kinetics of LTRC loss <italic>ex vivo</italic>, we next investigated the transcriptional changes associated with the first cell division of LT-HSCs in culture. Flow-sorted CB LT-HSCs were cultured for 0 h, 6 h, 24 h and 72 h in EXPER medium before scRNA-seq via an adapted Smart-Seq2 protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). 666 cells were sequenced over 2 independent experiments and 429 cells (64%) passed quality control. Cells from both experiments were integrated via 2 distinct pipelines (ScanPy and Seurat 4; see Methods), which yielded highly concordant results. Dimensionality reduction was performed following selection of highly variable genes through the 2 independent packages. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> cultured LT-HSCs group by culture duration in UMAP visualisations, independently of the batch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>), of whether cell cycle regression was applied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>) and of the integration pipeline used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>).</p><p id="P9">An increasing body of work is identifying transcriptional and functional heterogeneity within the human LT-HSC pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), indicating the potential presence of multiple subpopulations at the 0 h time-point. 0 h LT-HSCs were therefore further split into 2 clusters by k means clustering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>). Differential gene expression was performed with DESeq2, followed by GSEA and GSVA analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data S2</xref>). One cluster expressed significantly higher levels of genes involved in hypoxia regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1E</xref>) than the other and displayed enrichment for the most dormant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) and multipotent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) LT-HSCs gene signatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1F</xref>). This cluster was denoted “0 h-early” and was subsequently used as pseudotime origin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1G</xref>). In the other cluster, named “0 h-late”, we found higher levels of oxidative phosphorylation genes than in “0 h-early” LT-HSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1H</xref>; p=0.0580) and significant enrichment of gene signatures related to a myelo-lymphoid restricted self-renewing HSC subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1F</xref>). In summary, our scRNA-seq strategy could identify transcriptional heterogeneity within the quiescent human LT-HSC fraction, in line with recent literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Following the 0 h time-point, pseudotime ordering largely recapitulated chronological time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1I</xref>) and in agreement with functional analysis, transcriptional assignment of cell cycle status showed an increasing proportion of LT-HSCs allocated to S-G2-M phases as culture progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). LT-HSCs therefore progress through distinct transcriptional states over time in culture. To better determine transcriptional kinetics over the 72 h time-course, we first performed differential gene expression for all pairwise comparisons in the dataset using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data S3</xref>). <italic>Ex vivo</italic> culture has an extensive and rapid effect on the transcriptome with 10,010 genes changing over the time-course (all genes differentially expressed in at least one pairwise comparison, hereafter termed "ex <italic>vivo</italic> modulated genes", <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data S4</xref>). Interestingly, 75% of gene expression change from 0 h to 72 h is observed within the first 6 h of culture (4460 / 5980 genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), before the vast majority (&gt;90%) of cells have undergone quiescence exit in these culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>). We then used the degPatterns package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) on <italic>ex vivo</italic> modulated genes to define gene expression patterns over the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A, Data S5</xref>). In parallel, Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) was performed on the <italic>ex vivo</italic> modulated genes to identify biological pathways changed during culture, and pathways were again clustered by DEG Report (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B, Data S5</xref>). Similar dynamic patterns of upregulation and downregulation were observed at the gene and pathway level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2A-B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">GSVA scores of pathways linked to transcription, RNA splicing, translation and oxidative phosphorylation related processes increased cumulatively with time in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2F</xref>). Conversely, GSVA scores of pathways related to integrin signalling, extracellular matrix (ECM) generation and matrix metalloproteinase activation which are important for HSC <italic>in vivo</italic> niche maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) were continuously downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). This suggests a gradual remodelling of HSC cell adhesion properties upon <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture. In contrast, the AP-1 transcription factors JUN and FOS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>) dropped dramatically by 6 h, pinpointing early loss of the quiescent network.</p><p id="P12">We also observed a number of transient patterns of expression over the first 72 h of culture. Particularly abundant were genes/pathways which show upregulation from 0 h to 6 h and are then decreased at 24 h (27.3 % of total genes; % 76.3 of “Transient UP genes”). GSVA scores of transiently upregulated pathways include sphingolipid <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis, TNF signalling and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2H</xref>). Genes with maximum levels of expression at the 6 h timepoint included key cell stress and apoptotic regulators such as the dual regulators of apoptosis <italic>CFLAR</italic> and <italic>BIRC2</italic>, the master regulator of the unfolded protein response <italic>ATF4</italic> and the ceramide biosynthesis enzyme <italic>DEGS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2D</xref>). We also observe transient downregulation of retinoic acid and bile acid biosynthesis pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). Collectively, these transient patterns of expression early in the time-course suggest that HSCs initiate a cell stress response to adapt to the instructive signals of culture.</p><p id="P13">Another expression pattern of interest, which encompasses 14.8% of all genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2E</xref>), is marked upregulation of expression after the 6 h timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2K</xref>). MYC targets, cell cycle progression, iron uptake and activation of HSF1 pathway genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2J</xref>) follow this pattern in addition to <italic>MYC</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2E</xref>).

These data were integrated with 0 h and 6 h cells in a unique embedding via the Seurat4 pipeline for a total of 954 cells (n=6 independent experiments).

While long-term repopulation capacity is fully preserved at this stage, these early gene expression dynamics reflect the drastic change in environmental factors that the cells are exposed to and set the stage for later loss of HSC function. Interestingly, the subsets of quiescent LT-HSCs with distinct transcriptional cell cycle priming and oxidative metabolism observed at 0 h, and previously reported by other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) were no longer readily identifiable at 6 h of culture. In addition, the number of maximally variable genes, an indirect measure of intercellular heterogeneity, was lowest at 6 h post culture initiation. We conclude that all LT-HSC subsets adapt to the culture conditions similarly.</p><p id="P25">Globally our data support a model in which adaptation to <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture is followed by a cell fate decision, whereby LT-HSCs either undergo apoptosis, lose long-term repopulation capacity or rarely, maintain their LT-HSC function. This occurs around the time at which LT-HSCs phosphorylate Rb and enter late G<sub>1</sub>, here estimated between 6 and 24 h post culture initiation in two independent culture settings. Several observations support LT-HSC fate decisions occurring in this time window. First, scEntropy scores, a measure previously reported to track the multiplicity of cell fate potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), significantly decreased between 6 and 24 h. Second, in this same timeframe, we observed transient dynamics of expression and/or high intercellular variability in gene sets linked to both HSC survival (ATF4, BIRC2, CFLAR genes and TNF signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>)) and HSC culling (UPR). High basal levels of stress response pathway expression sets superior "quality control" thresholds for LT-HSCs, resulting in preferential apoptosis in response to oxidative, genotoxic and proteostatic damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>).
