Elevated PODXL expression is also associated with metastasis and poor clinical outcome in multiple tumour types. How PODXL presents this duality in effect remains unknown. We identify an unexpected function of PODXL as a decoy receptor for Galectin-3 (GAL3), whereby the PODXL-GAL3 interaction releases GAL3 repression of integrin-based invasion. Differential cortical targeting of PODXL, regulated by ubiquitination, is the molecular mechanism controlling alternate fates. Both PODXL high <italic>versus</italic> low surface levels occur in parallel subpopulations within cancer cells. Orthotopic intraprostatic xenograft of PODXL-manipulated cells or those with different surface levels of PODXL define that this axis controls metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Clinically, interplay between PODXL-GAL3 stratifies prostate cancer patients with poor outcome. Our studies define the molecular mechanisms and context in which PODXL promotes invasion and metastasis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The cellular glycocalyx is comprised of a network of glycoproteins and proteoglycans that coat all cells and that modulates cell interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). An altered, bulky glycocalyx in cancer cells contributes to tumour progression and metastasis by mechanical regulation of cell-ECM interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). A conundrum in cancer cell glycocalyx constituents influencing ECM interaction is that a number of these are mucins, such as MUC1 or Podocalyxin (PODXL), which in normal tissues are not localised to ECM-abutting domains but are instead apically localised and required for apical domain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). This suggests a duality in mucin function, promoting normal tissue development at the apical domain or invasion and metastasis when alternately located to ECM-abutting membranes.</p><p id="P3">The duality of glycocalyx-associated mucins is particularly evident for the sialomucin PODXL. PODXL’s role in promoting apical lumen formation across tissues can be converted to inducing collective apical membrane-driven invasion by interfering with signals that control PODXL removal from ECM-abutting membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Such ‘inverted polarity’, apical proteins localised at the periphery of clusters of epithelial cells rather than at the lumen, is a defining feature of micropapillary cancers that are associated with poor clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Apical membrane-driven inverted polarity has been proposed as a mechanism for metastasis in colorectal carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Indeed, elevated PODXL levels are an independent prognostic indicator of disease aggressiveness in several cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Germline mutations in <italic>PODXL</italic> result in alternate phenotypes; some PODXL mutations are associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and nephrotic syndrome affecting apical membrane function of PODXL in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), whereas other <italic>PODXL</italic> variants are associated with familial prostate cancer aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). This highlights that the functional contribution of mucins to the glycocalyx, whether it be to normal tissue function or disruption to this function and induction of metastatic features, must be regulated in a context-specific fashion, such as alternate subcellular targeting to the apical domain or to the ECM-abutting surface.</p><p id="P4">That PODXL is a transmembrane protein and that its elevated expression is associated with poor clinical outcome in tumours has led to suggestion of it as a targetable biomarker of metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Given that the function of PODXL in normal tissues is also required, it is essential to identify the tumour-specific contexts regulating PODXL function. PODXL expression alone modestly stratifies outcome in some cancers but becomes a potent predictor of poor outcome when comparing cortical to intracellular levels of PODXL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Moreover, tumour-restricted glycosylation patterns have allowed the development of tumour cell-selective therapeutic anti-PODXL antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). This emphasises that mucins such as PODXL require contextual modulation to form part of the tumour-associated, pro-metastatic bulky glycocalyx. Here, we determine the molecular mechanisms that control the switch of PODXL towards a pro-metastatic glycocalyx component. We identify an unexpected function of PODXL as a decoy receptor that relieves the invasion-inhibiting effect of the glycocalyx component Galectin-3 and demonstrate that the levels of this switch identify prostate cancer patients with high metastasis and poor outcome.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>PODXL promotes invasive tunnel formation inside the ECM</title><p id="P5">We identified breast and prostate cancer cell lines with high PODXL expression, as PODXL has been associated with invasion and metastasis in these cancers. Non-tumorigenic prostate lines PREC-LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) and RWPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) minimally expressed <italic>PODXL</italic> mRNA. In contrast, highly metastatic prostate PC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) and breast MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) lines displayed highest <italic>PODXL</italic> mRNA with minimal change to gene copy number (dashed lined square, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We therefore explored PODXL function in PC3 and MDA-MB-231 cells.</p><p id="P6">The predicted molecular weight of PODXL is 58 kDa but likely due to glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) several bands of PODXL were detected in western blots in both cell lines, most prominently <sup>~</sup>150 kDa and 55-65 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S1A</xref>). Depletion of PODXL via shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S1A,B</xref>) or sgRNA-mediated knockout (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S1C,D</xref>) largely abolished both PODXL bands.</p><p id="P7">We examined the phenotype of PODXL depletion. PODXL-depleted cells were impaired in collective cell invasion specifically when ECM was involved. In scratch-wound assays wherein cell monolayers were plated on, and overlayed with, ECM control cells from PC3 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines invaded via leader cells forming tunnels that were used by follower cells to invade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S1E-K</xref>, yellow arrowheads; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movies 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">2</xref>), similar to previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). PODXL-depleted cells failed to form leader cell-induced tunnels in both cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S1F,H</xref>), resulting in decreased invasion of the overall population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S1G, I</xref>), suggesting a common motility defect. In contrast to invasion defects in 3D, PODXL-depleted PC3 cells displayed no defect in 2D migration in scratch-wound migration assays without ECM addition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S1J-M</xref>). No defect was detected in PC3 proliferation in either in 2-dimensional (2D) culture or when embedded into ECM gels to form 3-dimensional (3D) acini (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S1N,O</xref>). PODXL is therefore required for invasion into ECM.</p><p id="P8">To determine whether PODXL was essential for tunnel-inducing cells or movement of follower cells into tunnels we embedded single PC3 cells into ECM to induce 3D acinus formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). We examined these using wide-field multi-day timelapse imaging, allowing detection of how clonal outgrowth of a single cell can progress to alternate 3D phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). By overlaying the outlines of acini over defined time intervals into a single image (outline composite), three phenotypes that occurred in parallel in the control PC3 cells (Scramble, non-targeting shRNA) could be observed: non-motile, round acini (Round); those that only invade locally (Local spreading); and those that move back and forward through a seeming conduit in the ECM (Tunnel-forming) that was reminiscent of leader cells at the front of invasion assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I,J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Movie 3</xref>). We emphasised the ECM in phase-contrast images (‘Emphasize track’; see methods), which revealed a tunnel in the ECM.</p><p id="P9">We developed a method for quantitative assessment of these phenotypes over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S2A</xref>). While round and local-spreading phenotypes could potentially be distinguished by their shape-changes at a given static timepoint, tunnel-forming cells shared many of these shapes but instead moved along conduits in the ECM. By creating outline composites of cells imaged every hour for several days into 12h time intervals and converting composites into single objects, we could train a Gentle Fast Boosting machine learning model with high fidelity (92-98% accuracy) to user defined classification to detect the three aforementioned phenotypes. The application of this method to large-scale parallel live imaging of thousands of acini allowed robust statistical analysis of phenotypes, which could be presented in heatmaps that displayed how parameters of interest changed in 12h intervals along with statistical analysis across multiple replicates and experiments.</p><p id="P10">Quantitative assessment revealed that while PODXL-depleted PC3 cells could display modest elongation, they were devoid of the tunnel-forming phenotype, the local-spreading phenotype was unchanged, and switched to a round phenotype modestly upon PODXL knockdown (shRNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I,J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Movie 3</xref>) or significantly upon PODXL knockout (sgRNA; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig S2B,C</xref>). Modest effects were observed on total area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I,J</xref>; S2B,C), corroborating a lack of effect of PODXL depletion on proliferation in 3D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S1N</xref>). When MDA-MB-231 cells are embedded into ECM, these initially become highly motile and elongated, also moving back and forwards through apparent ECM tracks before developing into a branched multicellular network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Movie 4</xref>). Quantitative analysis revealed this as an increase in local-spreading and tunnel-forming activity over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S2E</xref>). Upon PODXL depletion, MDA-MB-231 cells at early timepoint lost this initial motility and instead switched to a robust local-spreading phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S2D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Movie 4</xref>). The analysis of tunnel-forming objects in MDA-MB-231 cells upon PODXL depletion was complicated by the extreme elongation of non-motile cells in this condition, resulting in a lack of significant reduction in the tunnel-forming phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S2D,E</xref>). Therefore, we directly examined the mean invasion speed of elongating PC3 and MDA-MB-231 cells in 3D culture, rather than using tunnel-forming classification as an indirect proxy for motility. In PC3 acini, PODXL depletion resulted in a decreased mean invasion speed specifically in the Tunnel-forming population of acini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S2F</xref>). A reduction in mean invasion speed was also observed in MDA-MB-231 cells upon PODXL depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S2G</xref>). This suggests that while PODXL depletion can have varying effects on acinus shape, across cell types there is a consistent reduction of motility in a 3D context. This is further supported by a common reduction of invasion in orthogonal ECM invasion assays in both PC3 and MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S1F-I</xref>). As this motility in PC3 cells results in formation of a tunnel, we therefore use tunnel formation in PC3 cells as method to identify movement over time from static images.</p><p id="P11">Expression of extracellularly GFP-tagged PODXL (isoform A; hereforth described as wild-type, WT) in PC3 cells stimulated the tunnel-forming phenotype to occur earlier at the expense of local spreading compared to GFP alone (GFP-PODXL; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S3A-D</xref>). Intriguingly, the round phenotype was unaffected by PODXL depletion or overexpression despite stable viral manipulation of both conditions. Labelling of endogenous surface PODXL in non-permeabilized acini revealed ECM-adjacent labelling in tunnel-forming, but not round, acini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1L-N</xref>). In GFP-PODXL-expressing acini, anti-GFP antibody staining to extracellular GFP revealed heterogeneity in surface GFP-PODXL presence, despite similar levels of total GFP-PODXL expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S3E</xref>). This suggests that the specificity of PODXL effects on tunnel formation is not due to lack of PODXL expression in other phenotypes (round, local-spreading), but rather the existence of a specific context that facilitates cortical PODXL localisation to promote motility in the tunnel-forming population.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Differential cortical localisation of PODXL controls invasiveness</title><p id="P12">We examined the context in which PODXL can promote invasive tunnel formation and whether this was related to cortical presentation of PODXL. Three rounds of serial sorting for endogenous surface PODXL levels allowed recovery of cell populations with surface PODXL at high or low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). Strikingly, cells with altered surface levels of PODXL displayed different frequencies of local-spreading and tunnel-forming 3D phenotypes; low-surface PODXL cells lost the ability to form tunnels while high-surface PODXL cells were highly tunnel-forming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Movie 5</xref>). Consequently, high-surface PODXL cells formed elongated tunnels that allowed rapid invasion of the cell population in ECM invasion assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S4A</xref>, yellow arrowheads; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Movie 6</xref>), while wounded monolayers of low-surface PODXL cells lacked invasive chains and were poorly invasive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S4A-C</xref>). No proliferation differences were detected between high-surface and low-surface PODXL expressing cells in either 2D or 3D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S4D,E</xref>), similar to effects of PODXL depletion on parental cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S1N,O</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The contrast in surface levels between high-surface versus low-surface PODXL cells was not reflected in major mRNA or total protein level changes of either PODXL or its known major binding partners (Ezrin, <italic>SLC9A3R1</italic>/NHERF1, <italic>SLC9A3R2</italic>/NHERF2); only a small reduction in <italic>EZRIN</italic> mRNA, but not protein, occurred (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S5A-C</xref>) while total PODXL protein levels showed a modest difference between high-surface versus low-surface stable lines (1.68-fold change; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S5B,C</xref>). Robust overexpression of GFP-PODXL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S4F,G</xref>) in low-surface stable lines did not increase tunnel formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S4H</xref>), similar to a lack of effect in the round population in GFP-PODXL-overexpressing parental PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S3A-D</xref>). This supports the notion of a cellular context that promotes surface PODXL and invasion, rather than a difference in PODXL complex expression between high-versus low-surface PODXL cells.</p><p id="P14">Analysis of RNA-seq of parental, high-surface and low-surface PODXL lines revealed significant enrichment of pathways associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) between sublines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S5D</xref>). Low-surface PODXL cells presented an epithelial profile with enrichment of epithelial transcripts (<italic>CDH1</italic>, <italic>ESRP1/2</italic>), whereas high-surface PODXL cells presented a mesenchymal profile (VIM, ZEB1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), data confirmed at protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G,H</xref>). This trend was maintained in both 2D and 3D culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S5E,F</xref>). This suggested that an EMT provides the context that promotes increased cortical levels of PODXL, independent of regulating the total levels of PODXL or major known PODXL binding partners. This raised the possibility that cortical PODXL might simply be a functionally irrelevant passenger event that nonetheless could be used to select for a mesenchymal mode of invasion. However, depletion of PODXL in high-surface PODXL cells attenuated the ability of these to form tunnels and the entire population of cells to invade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S5G-K</xref>). This confirms a functional role of PODXL in mesenchymal-type invasion.</p><p id="P15">Despite reports that PODXL expression is increased and required for full EMT effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), we saw variable contribution of PODXL to EMT status. PODXL overexpression in low-surface PC3 cells increased epithelial characteristics (E-cadherin levels; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S4F,G</xref>), while PODXL depletion in PC3 high-surface PODXL cells also increased E-cadherin levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S5L,M</xref>). In contrast, in MDA-MB-231 cells, PODXL depletion increased epithelial, and decreased mesenchymal, markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S5N,O</xref>) This reveals a complex contribution of PODXL the EMT status of cells, which differs in different contexts. In PC3 cells, invasion is related to increased cortical levels of PODXL, not only the EMT status of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ubiquitination controls cortical levels of PODXL</title><p id="P16">As cell populations sorted for different PODXL surface levels possessed similar PODXL mRNA and total protein levels, we focused on ubiquitination as a potential mechanism to control PODXL abundance at the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Endogenous PODXL ubiquitination was significantly altered between cells with different surface levels of PODXL; cells with low-surface PODXL levels showing strong ubiquitination of PODXL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). Publicly available datasets indicated ubiquitination occurs on all four cytoplasmic lysine residues of PODXL (K431/525/526/547; phosphosite.org). Mutation of these four residues in GFP-PODXL (K431/525/526/547R; 4K&gt;R, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S6A</xref>) resulted in a strong attenuation of ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C,D</xref>). Ubiquitination-deficient PODXL (GFP-PODXL 4K&gt;R) cortical levels were enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S6B,C</xref>) and invasive capacity increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G,H</xref>) compared to wild-type PODXL (GFP-PODXL WT). This reveals that low levels or a lack of PODXL ubiquitination are associated with an EMT, which facilitates high cortical expression of PODXL. Notably, ubiquitination-deficient PODXL (GFP-PODXL 4K&gt;R) was able to drive invasion in the absence of an EMT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S6D-G</xref>), suggesting that the ubiquitination status of PODXL is a major target of EMT processes, and PODXL is an amplifier of mesenchymal invasion, not a passenger molecule.</p><p id="P17">To determine, conversely, if ubiquitination drives low surface levels of PODXL we created an experimentally inducible PODXL ubiquitination system based on rapalogue-induced FKBP-FRB oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). We inserted an FKBP dimerization domain into the cytoplasmic domain of non-ubiquitinatable 4K&gt;R mutant PODXL immediately after the transmembrane domain followed by the cytoplasmic tail. We co-expressed a TagBFP-tagged FRB dimerization domain fused to ubiquitin (FRB-Ub-BFP) or a dimerization domain lacking ubiquitin as a control (FRB-BFP). Only the combination of FRB-Ub-BFP and dimeriser robustly induced PODXL ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J-L</xref>), decreased surface level of PODXL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S6H-I</xref>), and reduced the invasive ability of the cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3M,N</xref>). These manipulations altered PODXL localization without change to total GFP-PODXL expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J,K</xref>).

The core PODXL complex was the strongest interaction group, but notably these interactions were unchanged between GFP-PODXL versus GFP-PODXL sorted for high expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, top clustered group). This excludes changes in the core complex underpinning differential cortical localisation.</p><p id="P20">We noted robust induction of association of glycocalyx-associated Galectins with high-surface GFP-PODXL, while these were low in GFP-PODXL alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B,C</xref>). LGALS1/GAL1 and LGALS3/GAL3 are beta-galactoside-binding lectins and components of the tumour-associated bulky glycocalyx that regulate function and structure of glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). GAL1 has been indicated to promote pro-metastatic function of the glycocalyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Whereas GAL3 has been reported as promoter of several kinds of cancer, data from prostate cancer is controversial(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>); GAL3 is higher in benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower in adenocarcinoma compared to control patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Of this Galectin interaction group, GAL3 was the strongest interactor of high-surface GFP-PODXL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).

We mapped the interaction site of GAL3 on PODXL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S7A-G</xref>). GAL3 association with PODXL was maintained with both isoforms of PODXL (PODXLa, PODXLb), upon mutation of binding sites for Ezrin (Ferm-binding motif; FBM*) or NHERF1/2 (DPDZ motif) either alone or together, or upon fusion of Ezrin in place of the PDZ motif (DPDZ + Ezr). This suggests that GAL3 association is independent to core complex association. Indeed, deletion of the entire PODXL cytoplasmic domain (GFP-PODXL DIC) still resulted in robust association of GAL3 with PODXL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S7F,G</xref>), revealing that the association is extracellular. We were unable to recover stable expressers of PODXL with the extracellular domain deleted (GFP-PODXL DEC). In contrast to the lack of effect of the mutants above, mutation of N-linked glycosylation sites in PODXL (5N&gt;Q mutant; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>)) abolished GAL3 interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S7A-C</xref>). Reciprocally, mutation of the GAL3 carbohydrate recognition binding domain (CRD) to uncouple association of N-acetyllactosamine carbohydrate glycoprotein motifs (R186S; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S5H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) abolished the association of GAL3 with PODXL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S7I,J</xref>).

This initially suggested that GAL3 might be required for cortical function of PODXL.

Extracellular levels of GAL3 protein were also robustly increased in low-surface PODXL cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S7O, P</xref>). This suggests that extracellular GAL3 might repress PODXL function. We investigated whether GAL3 was a positive or negative invasion regulator.</p><p id="P23">GAL3 depletion induced extreme tunnel-forming activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-D</xref>). Addition of recombinant extracellular GAL3 (reGAL3) to the ECM strongly suppressed tunnel formation in high-surface PODXL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E,F</xref>). As expected from the heterogenous invasion context of parental cells, overexpression of GFP-PODXL alone failed to induce tunnel formation across most 3D acini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G-J</xref>). However, combining this with GAL3 depletion resulted in most 3D structures becoming tunnel-forming. Restoration of GAL3 WT expression (RNAi-resistant TagRFP-T-GAL3), but not non-PODXL-binding GAL3 mutant (R186S), repressed tunnel-forming activity at late timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G-J</xref>; note lack of significance in tunnel formation from 60-96h). This was related to PODXL surface levels as GAL3 depletion increased surface PODXL levels in parental PC3 cells and low-surface PODXL cells, but not high-surface PODXL cells that already expressed lowered levels of GAL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K,L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S7N</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S8A,B</xref>). Similarly, stimulation with reGAL3 was sufficient to decrease surface levels of PODXL both in parental and high-surface PODXL expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S8C-E</xref>). This suggests that GAL3-PODXL is a mutually antagonistic ligand-receptor pair, wherein GAL3 triggers internalisation of PODXL from the surface, but in doing so PODXL reduces extracellular GAL3 levels. Accordingly, depletion of PODXL resulted in an increase specifically of the extracellular pool of endogenous GAL3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S8F,G</xref>). In cells depleted for endogenous GAL3, addition of reGAL3 resulted in its rapid internalisation, but not when PODXL was co-depleted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S8H-J</xref>). Therefore, GAL3-PODXL is a ligand-receptor pair that triggers co-internalisation of both molecules.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>GAL3-PODXL binding prevents GAL3 repression of integrin-dependent invasion</title><p id="P24">Experimental manipulations that removed the ability of PODXL to be ubiquitinated (4K&gt;R; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>) enhanced association of GAL3 with PODXL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S7D-G</xref>), yet these cells were uncoupled from the inhibitory effect of GAL3 on invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">S7K-M</xref>). Conversely, expression of a non-GAL3-binding PODXL mutant (N-linked glycosylation-deficient; 5N&gt;Q) uncoupled GAL3 association (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S7A-C</xref>) but was unable to restore invasion and tunnel-forming activity to PODXL-depleted cells, as could be seen when knockdown cells were rescued with WT PODXL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S7Q</xref>). This contrasts with depletion of GAL3 strongly inducing tunnel-forming activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-D</xref>). This suggests that GAL3 is inhibitory to invasion, and this inhibition is relieved by binding to PODXL. Therefore, PODXL may be a decoy receptor to relieve a repressive extracellular function of GAL3; uncoupling GAL3 from PODXL does not relieve the repression GAL3 confers on other invasion-regulating pathways.</p><p id="P25">Our PODXL-interactome analysis revealed association of PODXL with cell-ECM interactors (Integrins, Collagen) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-C</xref>), in particular the enhanced association of bl-integrin with high-surface level PODXL. A previous report indicated that PODXL repressed surface levels of ⍰1-integrin in ovarian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).

We speculated that GAL3-PODXL co-internalisation might act to relieve GAL3-dependent integrin internalization, therefore promoting integrin function in invasion.</p><p id="P26">We used flow cytometry to measure steady state surface levels of total and active integrins. Despite equivalent total ⍰1-integrin levels between parental and sublines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S9A</xref>), low-surface PODXL cells display a strong reduction in the ratio of active:total ⍰1-integrin steady state surface levels, whereas high-surface PODXL cells have robust levels of cortical active:total ⍰1-integrin ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S9B-F</xref>). Accordingly, overexpression of GFP-PODXL WT or 4KR mutant increased the active: total surface ratio of ⍰1-integrin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S9G-L</xref>). PODXL depletion decreased the surface levels of active ⍰1-integrin (p=0.0845; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S9M-Q</xref>). In contrast, GAL3 depletion did not affect the active:total surface ⍰1-integrin ratio, but rather increased the absolute levels of ⍰1-integrin on the cell surface and consequently the absolute levels of active surface ⍰1-integrin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S9M-P</xref>). This reveals that surface PODXL is associated with ⍰1-integrin activation on the cell surface, while GAL3 controls total ⍰1-integrin cell surface levels.</p><p id="P27">We used a quantitative biochemical approach (capture-ELISA) to directly measure whether altered surface levels of integrin may be related to its internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>).

Ubiquitin-deficient PODXL (GFP-PODXL 4K&gt;R), which has increased association with GAL3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S7D,E</xref>), exacerbated this effect, displaying slowed internalisation of PODXL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E,F</xref>) and robust inhibition of a5⍰1-integrin internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G,H</xref>). This suggests that GAL3-PODXL interaction may control invasion by regulating integrin surface levels and association with the ECM. Accordingly, cells sorted for endogenous high-surface PODXL levels, or expressing GFP-PODXL (WT or 4K&gt;R) showed enhanced association with Matrigel and Collagen-I, but not Fibronectin or Laminin-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S10A-D</xref>). Moreover, while cells depleted for PODXL and expressing control GFP alone formed round acini surrounded by Collagen-IV, rescue with RNAi-resistant GFP-PODXL WT or 4K&gt;R expression resulted in cells forming tunnels lined by Collagen-IV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S10E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary movie 7</xref>). As this Collagen-IV antibody detects mouse Collagen-IV provided by the Matrigel, this reveals that one function of ECM-adjacent PODXL is to promote the organisation of the ECM to form collagen-lined invasion tunnels.</p><p id="P28">We tested whether ⍰1-integrin was a key effector of surface PODXL-driven matrix alteration to form ECM tunnels. ShRNA-mediated stable depletion of ⍰1-integrin (ITGB1) did not affect expression of PODXL or GAL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I-L</xref>) but rather enhancedd the GAL3-PODXL interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6M,N</xref>).

Using Podocalyxin as a model for the duality of these proteins, our data indicate that an additional context is required to control localisation of these components to the ECM interface.</p><p id="P37">Although PODXL has been implicated in the aggressiveness of multiple cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), the cellular mechanisms by which PODXL confers this function have remained largely unclear. Interaction of PODXL with a number of cytoplasmic proteins, such as Ezrin/EBP50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>), Dynamin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>), gelsolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>), cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>), and ARHGEF7/Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) suggested a function of PODXL in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics. Key work from the Roskelley and McNagny labs indicated that in breast cancer cells, PODXL drives an Ezrin-dependent collective migration and tumour budding phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). This Ezrin-dependence was further corroborated in breast cancer cells when studying the role of PODXL in tumour cell extravasation, which curiously reported the PODXL extracellular domain as dispensable for extravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). This is in contrast to blocking antibodies to the PODXL extracellular domain showing a decrease in tumour burden and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). In our system, we find that the entire cytoplasmic domain of PODXL is dispensable for invasive activity. This suggests that there are key differences in how PODXL is contributing to tumourigenesis in different cell types. In prostate cancer cells, at least, we identify that at the surface, the major function of PODXL resides in its extracellular domain, acting as a rheostat on the integrin-repressing activity of the glycocalyx component GAL3.</p><p id="P38">Our findings allow us to present a model of how this GAL3-PODXL complex controls integrin-based invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8M</xref>). Expression of PODXL alone is insufficient to stimulate invasion and instead requires PODXL retention mechanisms at the ECM-interacting membrane domain. Indeed, even in polarised epithelia where PODXL is normally apically localised, a pool of PODXL is delivered to the basolateral domain before retrieval in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). Experimental mimicking of these phosphorylation events in PODXL induces PODXL localisation to the ECM-abutting membrane and drives invasion We here identify that ubiquitination is antagonistic to such retention. In the glycocalyx, GAL3 normally acts to repress integrin-driven invasion by triggering integrin internalisation. Retention of PODXL at ECM-abutting membrane relieves this integrin inhibition where PODXL acts as a decoy receptor for GAL3, controlling extracellular GAL3 uptake. Concomittantly, GAL3 acts to trigger PODXL internalisation. The balance of PODXL-GAL3 modifies the glycocalyx to tune the invasion capacity of cells. A PODXL<sup>HI</sup>-GAL3<sup>LO</sup> combination therefore allows for high-level integrin-based invasion, which we demonstrate occurs along collagen-lined invasion conduit tunnels. We report that differential ubiquitination of PODXL is a key event during EMT to control invasion.</p><p id="P39">The identity of the ubiquitin ligase and proteases that regulate PODXL ubiquitin directly remain unclear. The E3 ligase Nedd4-2 has been reported to control PODXL complex stability by regulating the ubiquitination of PODXL complex component Ezrin, but not PODXL itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). Counterintuitive to this model, we detected Nedd4-2 association only with high-surface PODXL interactome. Similarly, we do not yet know how ubiquitination affects PODXL fate. The Rab35 GTPase has been proposed to regulate tethering of PODXL in intracellular vesicles to the cell surface to promote surface PODXL retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>), but whether ubiquitination modulates Rab35 association is unknown. Once internalised, a pool of PODXL can be delivered to exosomes and the correct level of PODXL in exosomes is essential for the ability of these extracellular vesicles to confer invasive behaviours onto recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). The release of PODXL in exosomes <italic>in vivo</italic> can also prepare the pre-metastatic niche for cell arrival by controlling ECM organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). Notably, this PODXL-regulated phenotype transfer also involves modulation of integrin trafficking and consequent remodelling of extracellular matrix, mirroring our findings. Ubiquitination of PODXL may therefore be a mechanism to fine-tune cell autonomous invasive activity versus paracrine signalling to the stroma via exosomes, regulating a permissive ECM organisation for invasion and metastasis. Whether PODXL also plays a role in matrix secretion remains unknown.</p><p id="P40">A key finding from our studies is that although all cells expressed PODXL, only some of these were able to undergo invasion. We identify that this context depends on the surface delivery of PODXL for its ability to modulate GAL3. The identification of GAL3-PODXL as a mutually repressive ligand-receptor pair, the balance of whose interplay impacts on integrin signalling, was unexpected as GAL1 association with the glycocalyx promotes ECM-integrin signalling in glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) and PODXL represses surface levels of Ē1-integrin in ovarian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Moreover, GAL3 has been reported as a positive regulator of tumourigenesis in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Our findings revealed, contrastingly and in prostate cancer at least, that GAL3 is an inhibitor of integrin-dependent invasion with PODXL acting as a decoy to release GAL3-mediated repression of integrins. Why GAL3 may have opposing functionality in different tumour types is not known but may relate to whether PODXL presentation on the surface is required for tumourigenesis in all contexts. Indeed, targeting of PODXL to extracellular vesicles is one mechanism to influence metastasis in a non-cell autonomous fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). Unravelling these key differences will be important to understanding how inhibition of PODXL could be used for clinical intervention.</p><p id="P41">Synder et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) demonstrated the first proof-of-concept that systemic treatment with PODXL-blocking antibodies is both tolerated and can reduce both primary tumour and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 in murine xenografts. The requirement for surface PODXL presentation for metastasis further supports PODXL an excellent target for therapeutic intervention with such antibodies. The identification of an interplay with GAL3 controlling whether PODXL contributed to invasion is clinically important. This provides a molecular mechanism for why high surface-to-cytoplasm ratio of PODXL in tumours is a superior indicator of disease aggressiveness than PODXL levels alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), and we now add that examination of transcript levels of the GAL3-PODXL axis identifies prostate cancer patients with advanced, recurrent, metastatic disease.

Libraries were then prepared using manufacturers standard procedures (Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA). Libraries were then sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument, on a High-Output 75 cycle run with paired-end 36bp read length.</p><p id="P60">For data analysis, quality checks and trimming on the raw RNA-seq data files were done using FastQC version 0.11.8, FastP version 0.20 and FastQ Screen version 0.13.0. RNA-seq paired-end reads were aligned to the GRCm38 version of the human genome and annotation using HiSat2 version 2.1.0. Expression levels were determined and statistically analysed by a combination of HTSeq version 0.9.1, the R environment version 3.6.1, utilizing packages from the Bioconductor data analysis suite and differential gene expression analysis based on the negative binomial distribution using the DESeq2 package version 1.22.2. Pathway Analysis was preformed using MetaCore from Clarivate Analytics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.genego.com/">https://portal.genego.com/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Mass spectrometry (MS): Sample preparation</title><p id="P61">For evaluation of SILAC labelling, 20 mg of total lysates from cells grown in SILAC medium were used for in-solution protein digestion. Proteins were reduced using 1 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h, RT and alkylated using 5.5 mM of iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min, RT protected from light. A pre-digestion step was performed with Lys-C (Alpha Laboratories) for 3 h, RT. Then, peptides were diluted 4-fold with ABC buffer (Ammonium bicarbonate 50 mM pH8) and digested with Trypsin MS grade (Promega) overnight, RT. The next day, samples were acidified to pH &lt;4.0 using 1% TFA (Sigma-Aldrich). Peptides were desalted and concentrated using C18 Stage Tips.</p><p id="P62">For the interactome analyses of PODXL, SILAC mixtures were loaded onto 4-12% SDS polyacrylamide gels for electrophoretic separation of proteins.

Proteins were digested into peptides using the filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). Subsequently, 50 mg of peptides was fractionated using strong anion exchange (SAX) chromatography on Stage Tips.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>MS data acquisition</title><p id="P64">Purified tryptic peptides were injected on an EASY-nLC system coupled online to an LTQ-Orbitrap Pro Elite, through a nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An active background ion reduction device (ABIRD, SmartSource Solutions, LLC) was used to decrease air contaminants. Peptides were separated on a 20 cm fused silica emitter (New Objective) packed in-house with reverse-phase Reprosil Pur Basic 1.9 mm (Dr. Maisch GmbH). The emitter was heated to 35° C using a column oven (Sonation). The peptides were eluted with a two-steps gradient at a flow rate of 200 nl/min, with buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The gradient length for in-gel digestion bands was of 150 min, and for the SAX fractions was of 255 min. MS data were acquired in a positive ion mode using data-dependent acquisition with XCalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mass range acquired for the full MS scan was 300 to 1650 m/z, with a resolution of 120,000 at 400 m/z. Only multiply charged ions from two to five charges were selected for fragmentation. For PODXL IP samples, higher-energy collision dissociation fragmentation was triggered for the 10 most intense ions, using a maximum injection time of 150 ms or a target value of 40,000 ions, at a resolution of 15,000. For PODXL proteome samples, collision-induced dissociation fragmentation was triggered for the 10 most intense ions, using a maximum injection time of 25 ms or a target value of 5,000 ions. A dynamic exclusion window of 60 s was used for ions that had already been selected for MS/MS.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>MS data analysis</title><p id="P65">The MS .raw files were processed with the MaxQuant software version 1.5.0.36. The Andromeda search engine performed the search against the human UniProt database (release 2013, 88847 entries). The multiplicity was set accordingly to the SILAC labels of each experiment, and remainder parameters included: minimal peptide length of 7 amino acids; variable modifications acetyl (protein N-term) and oxidation (M); fixed modification carbamidomethyl (C); specificity for trypsin cleavage; and maximum two missed cleavages allowed. For the search of the parent mass and fragment ions, an initial mass deviation of 4.5 and 20 ppm, respectively, was required. The re-quantify parameter was enabled, and match between runs was used between similar fractions. The false discovery rate at the protein and peptide level were set to 1%. Unique peptides with at least two ratio counts were used. The MaxQuant output table “ProteinGroups.txt” was uploaded in Perseus version 1.5.2.11 for downstream analysis. Datasets were filtered to remove contaminants, reverse peptides that match a decoy database and proteins only identified by site. Proteins with at least one unique peptide were used for analyses. Normalized SILAC ratios were log2-transformed and intensities were log<sub>10</sub>-transformed. To organize PODXL-interacting proteins into functional cluster we used Cytoscape v3.9.0 with integrated STRING network analysis (0.7 confidence score).</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Internalization assay by capture ELISA</title><p id="P66">Protein internalization was measured as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>).
