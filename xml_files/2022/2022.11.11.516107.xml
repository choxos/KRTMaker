The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive target due to its sequence conservation and critical role in the replication and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. PLpro also plays very important role in modulation of host immune responses by deubiquitinating (DUBs) or deISGylating host proteins. Thus, targeting PLpro serves as a two-pronged approach to abate SARS-CoV-2. Due to its structural and functional similarities with the host DUB enzymes, an <italic>in-house</italic> library of DUB inhibitors was constituted in this study. Five promising compounds exhibiting high binding affinities with the substrate binding site of PLpro were identified from a library of 81 compounds with <italic>in silico</italic> screening, docking, and simulation studies. Interestingly, lithocholic acid, linagliptin, teneligliptin, and flupenthixol significantly inhibited the proteolytic activity of PLpro. Each of these compounds abrogated <italic>in vitro</italic> replication of SARS-CoV-2 with EC<sub>50</sub> values in the range of 5-21 μM. In addition, crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and its complex with inhibitors have been determined that revealed their inhibitory mechanism. The findings of this study provide the proof-of-principle that the DUB inhibitors hold high potential as a new class of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, this is the first study that has opened a new avenue towards not only targeting PLpro active site but also simultaneously directing towards restoration of antiviral immune response of the host for deterring SARS-CoV-2.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2">

Precedent studies on SARS-CoV-2 highlight that the catalytic site of certain non-structural proteins (nsP) of SARS-CoV-2, such as papain-like protease (PLpro), 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro or Mpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and helicase display high levels of sequence similarity with their corresponding SARS and MERS counterparts and represent attractive antiviral targets against SARS-CoV-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">[10]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, due to the high degree of conservation of these nsPs among other coronaviruses, the probability of emergence of new mutations in these proteins is presumably low compared to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">[13]</xref>. Remdesivir, a RdRp inhibitor, has already been approved, while few Mpro inhibitors are currently in the phase of clinical trials (NCT04627532, NCT04535167) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">[15]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">[16]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">[17]</xref>. PLpro presents to be a more challenging and potentially promising druggable target of SARS-CoV-2, for which effective inhibitors are yet to be discovered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">[18]</xref>.</p><p id="P5">The genome of SARS-COV-2 comprises a single-stranded positive-sense RNA of ~ 30kb, which is translated to produce structural, non-structural, and accessory viral proteins, essential for carrying out replication, maturation, and genome packaging of SARS-CoV-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">[19]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">[20]</xref>. The genomic RNA gets translated to produce two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (formed after -1 ribosomal frameshifting mechanism), that are proteolytically cleaved and processed into 16 nsPs by two virus-encoded cysteine proteases, the PLpro and the Mpro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">[21]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">[22]</xref>. These nsPs form the replication and transcription complex (RTC) responsible for directing the process of transcription, replication, and maturation of the viral genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">[19]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">[20]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">[23]</xref>. SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, a domain within nsP3 protein, is a cysteine protease that recognizes the P4-P1 consensus LXGG sequence and cleaves the peptide bond between nsP1/nsP2 (LNGG↓AYTR), nsP2/nsP3 (LKGG↓APTK), and nsP3/nsP4 (LKGG↓KIVN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">[9]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">[24]</xref>.

As an evasion mechanism against the host innate immune response, PLpro possesses deubiquitination and deISG15ylation activities that cleave off ubiquitin and ISG15 (ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene 15) post-translational modifications from host proteins by recognizing the C-terminal RLRGG sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">[26]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">[27]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">[28]</xref>. SARS-COV-2 PLpro exhibits a different preference for host substrate, cleaving ISG15 more preferentially, whereas PLpro of SARS-CoV predominantly cleaves off ubiquitin chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">[21]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">[26]</xref>. Interestingly, the multifunctional PLpro inactivates TBK1, a kinase required to activate transcription factor interferon responsive factor 3 (IRF3), prevents dimerization and translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus, and blocks NF-κB signaling pathway, eventually attenuating the type I interferon response of the host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">[21]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">[27]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">[29]</xref>. Due to the role of PLpro in replication and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, targeting PLpro may have an advantage in not only suppressing viral infection but also impeding the dysregulation of signaling cascades in infected cells that may lead to cell death in the surrounding, non-infected cells. GRL0617, a naphthalene-based molecule, is the only inhibitor reported to inhibit replication of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 by targeting PLpro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">[30]</xref>.</p><p id="P6">Of note, PLpro has a right-handed “thumb-palm-finger” architecture which is similar to that of host deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP), despite very low sequence similarity between them (~10%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">[21]</xref>. SARS-CoV-2 PLpro has two domains, the “thumb-palm-finger” catalytic domain at the C-terminus and a small N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">[21]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">[29]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">[31]</xref>. The active site of PLpro is made up of a canonical cysteine protease triad of Cys111, His272, and Asp286 residues, located at the interface of thumb and palm sub-domains. The most complex architecture is of the fingers subdomain, as it is made up of two α-helices, six β-strands, and a zinc-binding loop that is indispensable for maintaining structural integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">[21]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">[32]</xref>. An important flexible β-turn/loop, blocking/binding loop 2 (BL2 loop) that recognizes the P2-P4 of the LXGG motif of the substrate and closes upon binding of substrate/inhibitor, is located between <italic>β</italic>11–12 strands spanning the residues from 267–271, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">[26]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">[32]</xref>.</p><p id="P7">PLpro shares a strikingly similar USP fold like the cellular DUBs, with a structurally conserved active site fold and orientation of catalytic triad residues Cys-His-Asp/Asn.

These drugs effectively inhibited SARS-CoV after interacting with the residues of the substrate binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">[34]</xref>. Therefore, repurposing USP inhibitors is an attractive alternative strategy that can assist in quickly identifying potentially effective molecules against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro due to the structurally conserved active site fold. Moreover, inhibitors with a cyanopyrrolidine warhead are reported to initiate a β-elimination reaction in the active site of USPs, resulting in irreversible inactivation of active site cysteine to dehydroalanine after desulfhydration reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">[36]</xref>. Cyanopyrrolidine forms a covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex in which the inhibitor can bind the active site of the enzyme and dissociate very slowly, which will result in prolonged inhibition of the enzymatic activity even after the free drug has been cleared off from the circulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">[37]</xref>. Gliptins, a class of cyanopyrrolidine derivatives, are already in clinical use as an antidiabetic compound inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), a serine protease and a possible receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">[37]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">[38]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">[39]</xref>.

Repurposing gliptins and DUB inhibitors is hypothesized to serve a dual mode of action in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2; firstly by the possible inhibition of enzymatic activity of PLpro and secondly, via restoration of host innate immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">[43]</xref>.</p><p id="P8">The present study aims to identify and repurpose currently available DUB inhibitors and cyanopyrrolidine ring containing compounds against PLpro of SARS-CoV-2.

High-throughput virtual screening and docking experiments predicted five of these compounds with docking scores comparable to known PLpro inhibitor, GRL0617, suggesting their potentiality as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Of these, lithocholic acid, linagliptin, teneligliptin, and flupenthixol were able to significantly inhibit protease activity of PLpro as elucidated from FRET-based enzymatic assay and were able to display strong antiviral action in cell-based assays with half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values in the range of 5-21 μM. In addition, crystal structure of PLpro and its complexes with inhibitory compounds have also been determined in this study that revealed unique binding allosteric sites and inhibitory mechanisms.

Reminiscent of the overall architecture of DUBs of the USP family, PLpro shares a similar active site architecture with host USP7 (also known as HAUSP) and USP2 proteins, including the signature catalytic triad (Cys-His-Asp/Asn) at the interface of its thumb and palm domains. A detailed structural comparison of the PLpro with UPS7 and USP2 proteins was carried out using the PDBeFold (SSM: Secondary Structure Matching) and multiple sequence alignment was performed with ESPript3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Although these proteins share a very low percentage of sequence identity with an alignment of only 187 residues of PLpro with USP7 and USP2 proteins, the structural superimposition topologies are reasonably similar with an overall RMSD value of 1.68Å and 1.24 Å for USP7 and USP2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Briefly, the palm subdomain of PLpro, USP7, and USP2 comprises of 6 β-sheets and includes the conserved catalytic triad (Cys-His-Asp/Asn) of the active site. Beyond the catalytic residues, USPs contain N and C-terminal extensions that aid in substrate recognition and binding. The BL2 of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (residues 267–272) that provides floor to ubiquitin tail, also superimposes well with the BL2 loops of USP7 and USP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">[55]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">[56]</xref>. Interestingly, the zinc-binding domain located in the thumb region of SARS-CoV-2 comprises of 4 cysteine residues (Cys189, Cys192, Cys224, and Cys226) and the same pattern is observed for USP2 as well (Cys334, Cys337, Cys381, and Cys384) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">[57]</xref>.

Importantly, few residues of the substrate binding or proteolytic cleft formed near the BL2 loop occupying the S3/S4 pocket are also conserved.

Therefore, there continues to be a need for preemptive strategies and drug modalities to treat COVID-19 and PLpro is considered a valuable target for it. Drug repurposing provides an alternative approach for quick identification of potential drugs to combat COVID-19, and targeting viral proteases offers additional advantages owing to their druggability and highly conserved substrate-binding pocket. Given that the substrate-binding pocket is highly similar among variants of SARS-CoV-2, the present study focused on identifying several bonafide inhibitors that might prove to be effective against different strains of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to the protease activity, PLpro possesses DUB and deISGylating activities as an evasion mechanism against the host antiviral immune response.

A dysregulated interferon mediated antiviral response could lead to pro-inflammatory cytokine storm in the COVID-19 patients, a major cause of mortalities among infected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">[63]</xref>. Thus targeting PLpro might serve as a dual target that could avert SARS-CoV-2 infection either by inhibition of its proteolytic activity or by upregulation of innate immune response.</p><p id="P39">In light of previous studies, we sought to determine whether an inhibitor of DUBs could potentially be active against PLpro. For this purpose, a structural alignment of PLpro with USP2 and USP7 was done. The structural comparison revealed a very less percentage of conservation among the three selected DUBs. However, the structurally conserved active site fold and orientation of catalytic triad residues Cys-His-Asp/Asn provided a hint to repurpose available USP inhibitors against PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Encouraged by structural and functional similarities among these DUBs, an <italic>in-house</italic> library of DUB and cyanopyrrolidine-ring inhibitors was constituted. A total of five compounds were finally selected after comprehensive virtual screening, docking study, and MD simulation studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 1, and Figure 2</xref>). The enzymatic assays, SPR binding kinetic studies, and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies against SARS-CoV-2 show that lithocholic acid, linagliptin, teneligliptin, and flupentixol hold tremendous promise as a target to generate new class of antivirals against PLpro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Each of these compounds displayed biochemical inhibition of PLpro and also inhibited the virus and significantly reduced the infectious virus titer in cell-based assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Concentration-dependent reduction in viral copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and infectious viral titer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 5</xref>) well below their cytotoxic concentration highlights the effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of compounds in the present study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Interestingly, ligand-binding experiments using SPR were in line with the enzymatic inhibition and cell-based studies with observed <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> values in the micromolar range (lithocholic acid-PLpro: 79.3 μM; linagliptin-PLpro: 72.6 μM; flupenthixol-PLpro: 258.1 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Though teneligliptin failed to discern binding with PLpro in SPR assay, its antiviral data suggested significant inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2, proposing a hint for other possible off-targets that could be explored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 5</xref>). The superimposition of docked complexes of these identified compounds on PLpro demonstrated the occupancy of the same substrate-binding pocket and similar interactions with the active site as were reported for a small molecule inhibitor GRL0617 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The cytotoxicity profile in Vero cells showed a CC<sub>50</sub> value of &gt; 50 μM marking them safe for use (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p id="P40">Previous studies on lithocholic acid report it to be a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">[64]</xref>. In another study, lithocholic acid is reported to exert antiviral action on replication of porcine delta coronavirus replication (PDCoV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">[65]</xref>. Recent clinical and experimental data on COVID-19 provides evidence for reduced mortality in infected patients with or without type 2 diabetes, after the use of gliptins (e.g., sitagliptin, alogliptin, etc.). Gliptins, a class of DPP4 inhibitors, antagonize SARS-CoV-2 virulence either by enhancing GLP-1 anti-inflammatory activity or by reducing overproduction of cytokines and downregulating the activity of macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">[66]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">[67]</xref>. These classes of inhibitors may halt the disease progression to a hyperinflammatory state after viral infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">[68]</xref>. Flupenthixol, an anti-depressant and antipsychotic drug, is reported to significantly inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV and MERS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">[69]</xref>.</p><p id="P41">In conclusion, the compounds identified in this study offer new perspectives for treatment of COVID-19. However, the need for clinical studies cannot be ruled out to validate these <italic>in vitro</italic> findings. Because PLpro is a highly conserved protein among coronaviruses, these top leads appear as strong therapeutic candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 infection or its emerging variants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>supplementary file updated</label><media xlink:href="EMS157016-supplement-supplementary_file_updated.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d37aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was funded by Science and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science &amp; Technology, the Government of India (Proj. ref no.
