It remains unclear, however, if and how they affect gene expression. Here, we disrupted the formation of two prominent endogenous transcription bodies that mark the onset of zygotic transcription in zebrafish embryos and analysed the effect on gene expression using enriched SLAM-Seq and live-cell imaging. We find that the disruption of transcription bodies results in downregulation of hundreds of genes, providing experimental support for a model in which transcription bodies increase the efficiency of transcription. We also find that a significant number of genes are upregulated, counter to the suggested stimulatory effect of transcription bodies. These upregulated genes have accessible chromatin and are poised to be transcribed in the presence of the two transcription bodies, but they do not go into elongation. Live-cell imaging shows that the disruption of the two large transcription bodies enables these poised genes to be transcribed in ectopic transcription bodies, suggesting that the large transcription bodies sequester a pause release factor. Supporting this hypothesis, we find that CDK9, the kinase that releases paused polymerase II, is highly enriched in the two large transcription bodies. Importantly, overexpression of CDK9 in wild type embryos results in the formation of ectopic transcription bodies and thus phenocopies the removal of the two large transcription bodies. Taken together, our results show that transcription bodies regulate transcription genome-wide: the accumulation of transcriptional machinery creates a favourable environment for transcription locally, while depriving genes elsewhere in the nucleus from the same machinery.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and transcription factors are often concentrated in specialized transcription bodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and it has been suggested that these can bring together multiple genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. This has led to the hypothesis that transcription bodies increase the efficiency of transcription by promoting the biomolecular interactions underlying gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Analysis of gene expression in artificially induced condensates supports this model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. To understand how transcription bodies affect gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, however, it is necessary to analyse endogenous transcription bodies. This has been difficult because transcription bodies are often small, short-lived, and numerous. Here, we use the onset of transcription in zebrafish embryos to overcome this problem. In zebrafish embryos, development is initially driven by maternally loaded RNA and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Transcription gradually begins during a process called zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Before transcriptional activity can be seen throughout the nucleus, it is confined to two micron-sized transcription bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, nucleated by the <italic>mir430</italic> locus, which contains multiple copies of the <italic>mir430</italic> gene <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. These bodies are enriched for RNAPII Serine 5 and Serine 2 phosphorylation (Ser5P, Ser2P), which mark the initiating and elongating form of RNAPII, respectively, as well as the transcription factors Nanog and Sox19b <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">To investigate the role of transcription bodies in transcription, we generated a fish line in which the <italic>mir430</italic> locus is deleted <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, resulting in the specific disruption of the two <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies, as observed by the loss of Ser2P signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). <italic>miR430</italic> is required for downregulating maternally loaded transcripts, and its absence results in severe developmental phenotypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Thus, effects on gene expression and development in the <italic>mir430</italic> mutant may be caused by the loss of the <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies, or the loss of the mature microRNA MiR430. To uncouple these two components and allow us to focus on the first, we supplemented mutant embryos with the mature form of microRNA MiR430 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, which restored degradation of mRNAs containing MiR430 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). This rescued the delay in epiboly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-g</xref>) and the aberrant expression pattern of <italic>goosecoid</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>), which are characteristic for the loss of MiR430 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Embryos supplemented with mature microRNAs appeared normal, with the appearance of the Kupffer’s vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>), and overall developmental progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>) being indistinguishable from wild type (WT) and heterozygous siblings, and embryos developed into fertile fish. Thus, the disruption of two large transcription bodies does not result in obvious developmental defects, and we can use it to analyse the effect of transcription bodies on gene expression.</p><p id="P4">To assess the effect of the specific disruption of <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies on transcriptional activity, we developed eSLAM-Seq, which uses a combination of protocols to label, enrich, and detect nascent transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref> and Methods), because the large amounts of maternally loaded RNA in early embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) masks nascent RNAs in total RNA sequencing approaches. We used eSLAM-Seq to compare gene expression between WT and <italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430 embryos at the 256-cell stage, when transcriptional activity is largely restricted to the <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies in WT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). We observed a significant number of genes that were downregulated in the absence of the <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies (242) and a higher number of genes that were upregulated (716) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). Plotting the genomic distribution of genes that were up- and downregulated showed that both classes of genes are distributed across the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We conclude that the absence of two large transcription bodies has a widespread effect on transcription.</p><p id="P5">The identification of hundreds of up- and downregulated genes in <italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430 <italic>vs.</italic> WT embryos at the 256-cell stage contrasts with the observation that these embryos develop normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). To reconcile these two observations, we generated eSLAM-Seq data for WT and <italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430 embryos at the 1024-cell, Oblong, and Sphere stage and compared it with the data obtained at the 256-cell stage. The expression levels of genes that are misregulated in <italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430 embryos at the 256-cell stage (with a median of 3.5 log<sub>2</sub> fold difference with WT for the upregulated genes, and 2.9 log<sub>2</sub> fold for the downregulated genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>) gradually recover during consecutive developmental stages, reaching WT expression levels at Sphere stage (with a median of 0.03 log<sub>2</sub> fold difference with WT for the upregulated genes, and 0.07 log<sub>2</sub> fold for the downregulated genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Looking at all genes, we find that overall fewer genes are misregulated at later stages, from 716 up and 242 down at 256-cell to 51 up and 30 down at Sphere stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). We conclude that in the absence of <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies, gene expression is misregulated, but that this effect is short-lived as expression levels return to WT levels in a timeframe of a couple of cell cycles. This likely explains the lack of obvious developmental defects in <italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430 embryos.</p><p id="P6">We then further analysed the genes that are misregulated at the 256-cell stage. The downregulation of genes suggests that transcription bodies facilitate transcription of genes other than <italic>mir430</italic> itself, consistent with work in which transcribed genes were shown to colocalize <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, as well as the proposed role of transcription bodies in increasing transcriptional efficiency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that the genes that are downregulated in <italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430 embryos localize to the <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies in WT embryos and are positively affected by this localization. The observation that downregulated genes return to WT expression levels over time suggests that transcription bodies that form during later stages in <italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>) may compensate for the loss of <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies. Here, we focus on the upregulated genes. Their high number suggest that the <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies sequester components of the transcriptional machinery, preventing genes elsewhere in the nucleus from being transcribed.</p><p id="P7">To investigate this sequestration model, we characterized the genes that are upregulated in response to <italic>mir430</italic> transcription body removal. We first asked when these genes are induced in WT embryos. We analysed their expression at the 1024-cell, Oblong, and Sphere stages, and compared this to their expression at the 256-cell stage. We found that most of the genes (81%) are activated during genome activation in WT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), indicating that loss of the <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies specifically activates the expression of genes that are about to be activated, with 62% (446/716) being advanced by 30 minutes (at the 1024-cell stage in WT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). When focusing on the genes that are advanced by 30 minutes, we observe a good correlation between their degree of upregulation between <italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430 and WT at 256-cell stage, and between 1024-cell and 256-cell stage in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). This further supports the notion that the effect on transcription activation is specific.</p><p id="P8">We then investigated the chromatin accessibility state of the genes that are upregulated. We analysed an ATAC-Seq dataset we had previously generated in WT embryos <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and found that the transcription start sites of genes that are upregulated in the <italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430 are highly accessible in WT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), being as accessible as those of the most highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c-d</xref>), even though they are hardly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). This suggests that potentially sequestered factor(s) function downstream of transcription-factor binding and chromatin opening. Consistent with this, motif analysis of the promoters of upregulated genes did not identify transcription factor motifs that were both sufficiently enriched compared to unexpressed genes and present in a sufficiently high fraction of the upregulated genes to explain our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). Even motifs of Nanog, Pou5f3 and Sox19b, transcription factors that have been shown to be required for the activation of transcription during ZGA in zebrafish <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> did not fulfil these two requirements. Taken together, our results suggest that the presence of the <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies prevents a significant number of genes that are poised for activation from going into elongation.</p><p id="P9">This reminded us of the observation that WT embryos from the 256-cell stage onward, in addition to the <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies in which both transcription initiation and elongation can be observed, display transcription bodies that are positive for transcription initiation, but not elongation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. We were previously unable to explain this observation but now hypothesized that the <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies might sequester a pause release factor, causing genes in these transcription bodies to be arrested at the initiation phase. If this were true, these transcription bodies would be predicted to acquire elongation signals in nuclei of <italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430 embryos. To investigate this, we injected 1-cell WT and <italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430 embryos with fluorescently labelled antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) recognizing RNAPII-Ser5P (transcription initiation) and RNAPII-Ser2P (transcription elongation), as described before <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Consistent with our hypothesis, we saw more Ser2P-positive transcription bodies in <italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430 than in WT embryos during the 512- and 1024-cell stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">10</xref>). Quantification of initiation-only, initiation/elongation, and elongation-only transcription bodies confirmed that more transcription bodies go into productive elongation in <italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430 than in WT embryos (with a maximum of 15% elongation-positive transcription bodies in WT versus 33% in <italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430 at the 256-cell stage, and a comparable difference at the 1024-cell stage; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Thus, the removal of the <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies causes transcription bodies that are arrested in the initiation phase to transition to the transcription elongation phase.</p><p id="P10">Our data suggests that transcription bodies sequester a pause release factor. Pause release is regulated by the pTEFb complex of which CDK9 is the catalytic subunit. We visualized CDK9 in WT embryos by immunofluorescence and found that it is strongly enriched in the two <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>). If the amount of CDK9 in the nucleus were limiting and its sequestration in <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies would hamper transcription elongation elsewhere in the nucleus, it would be predicted that overexpression of CDK9 in WT embryos would induce the formation of ectopic transcription bodies. To directly test this, we compared the occurrence of ectopic transcription bodies between WT embryos with and without injected <italic>cdk9</italic> mRNA. We visualized RNAPII Ser2P to detect transcription bodies. To distinguish transcription bodies that are nucleated by the <italic>mir430</italic> locus from ectopic transcription bodies, we also visualized <italic>miR430</italic> transcripts using Morpholino Visualization of Expression (MOVIE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>). At the 128-cell stage, we detected two prominent <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies in nuclei of WT embryos, as well as in WT embryos that were injected with <italic>cdk9</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 11</xref>). In the latter, however, we detected additional transcription bodies. Because these lack <italic>miR430</italic> MOVIE signal and we do not detect them in uninjected WT embryos, we consider these to be ectopic transcription bodies. The ectopic bodies are small and limited in number at the 128- and 256-cell stage, and more prominent at the 512- and 1024-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 11</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">14</xref>). The abundance of ectopic transcription bodies in WT embryos in which CDK9 is overexpressed, phenocopies the abundance of ectopic transcription bodies seen in <italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430 embryos. The quantification of ectopic transcription shows that at all four examined stages, ectopic transcription bodies are significantly more abundant in nuclei in which CDK9 is overexpressed (WT + inj <italic>cdk9</italic> mRNA), or in which the large <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies are disrupted (<italic>mir430</italic><sup>-/-</sup> + inj MiR430), than in WT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This supports our hypothesis that CDK9 is sequestered in <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies, limiting CDK9 availability elsewhere in the nucleus.</p><p id="P11">Taken together, we show that the removal of the <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies results in a genome-wide misregulation of gene expression. Many genes are downregulated, consistent with a model where the bodies facilitate transcription by promoting the biomolecular interactions underlying gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Unexpectedly, we also observed many genes that are upregulated upon disruption of the <italic>mir430</italic> transcription bodies. We show that transcription bodies sequester the pause release factor CDK9, preventing genes that are not present in the transcription bodies from being transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F19">Extended Data Fig. 15</xref>). Factor sequestration regulating biological processes has been described before <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and a recent study showed that the loss of the transcription factor Zelda in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos caused RNAPII to relocate from Zelda-containing transcription bodies to the histone locus body <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. More generally, work in mouse embryos has shown that CDK9 abundance is an important factor in the timing of zygotic genome activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

We therefore developed a method to sensitively detect nascent transcripts. Methods to enrich nascent transcripts have previously been described. Typically, an uracil/UTP analog (EU/s<sup>4</sup>UTP) is injected at the 1-cell stage and is incorporated into newly made RNAs. Such labelled transcripts can then be biotinylated and enriched by pull-down <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. SLAM-Seq is another approach in which nascent transcripts are labelled by s<sup>4</sup>UTP incorporation, but here the label is used to convert 4-thio-uracils to carboxyamido-methylated 4-thio-uracils, which will be misread as a cytosine during reverse transcription, introducing specific point mutations that enable the identification of reads derived from labelled transcripts by sequencing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.
