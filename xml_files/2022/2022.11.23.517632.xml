There is good evidence for the role of AS in plant stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Duque 2011</xref>), including temperature stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Capovilla et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Huertas et al. 2019</xref>), salt and nutrient stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lee et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Nishida et al. 2017</xref>), response to abscisic acid (ABA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Zhu et al. 2017</xref>) or other environmental cues such as circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cui et al. 2017</xref>); and in plant development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Szakonyi and Duque, 2018</xref>). However, while more than 300 genes encoding proteins putatively involved in splicing have been identified in Arabidopsis by homology searching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Reddy et al. 2013</xref>), very few have been tested experimentally for tissue-specific activities or in relation to the control of gene expression in response to external factors.</p><p id="P4">We previously identified the <italic>MDF</italic> gene (At5g16870) in an expression screen in the developing Arabidopsis embryonic root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Casson et al., 2005</xref>).

A very recent paper has shown that MDF is a likely splicing factor with a similar function to hSART-1 and mediates responses to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">de Luxan-Hernandez et al., 2022</xref>). Here we show that MDF is itself spliced, different isoforms are differentially expressed under cold and osmotic stress, and its function on cell patterning is mediated at least in part through control of splicing of the meristem regulators <italic>RSZ33</italic> and <italic>ACC1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results And Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>MDF/DOT2 is a component of the plant spliceosome</title><p id="P5">The predicted 820 amino acids MDF/DOT2 protein shares 41% identity with hSART-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). hSART-1 and the yeast homologue Snu66 are key components of the maturing spliceosome, involved in recruiting the tri-snRP during B complex formation, with secondary roles in cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Makarova et al. 2001</xref>).

This analysis provided additional information on the biological pathways in which MDF plays a role, and also compared patterns of splicing isoform profiles in comparison with a wildtype control by analysing the data output from RMAts for alternative splicing (AS) events. We hypothesized that, if MDF/DOT2 acts as an essential splicing factor, we would see both altered patterns of RNA isoforms for some genes, and changes in the abundance of other, non-spliced, transcripts that may be targets of mis-spliced regulatory RNAs.</p><p id="P7"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">de Luxan-Hernandez et al.

Unbiased gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was carried out and treemaps were generated using data from REVIGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Supek <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Both <italic>mdf-1</italic> and <italic>mdf-2</italic> transcriptomes exhibit upregulation of stress-related genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B-F</xref>), and enriched GO terms include ‘response to stress’, ‘defence response’, ‘response to other organism’, ‘immune response’, ‘reactive oxygen species metabolism’ and ‘response to ethylene’. In both tree maps, ‘aging’ and ‘programmed cell death’ were also shown to be significantly upregulated. This suggests that MDF plays a negative regulatory role in different stress response pathways.</p><p id="P8">The majority of the downregulated GO terms are related to signalling and development, including ‘auxin signalling pathway’, ‘protein phosphorylation’, and ‘tissue development and growth’. We previously showed altered auxin distribution in <italic>mdf</italic> mutant root tips, associated with defective PIN protein localization (which is dependent on correct <italic>PLT</italic> expression; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Casson et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Santuari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aida et al. 2004</xref>) and potentially accounting for misexpression of auxin-regulated <italic>WOX5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Sarkar et al., 2007</xref>).

Therefore MDF function is required for the correct expression and biological activity of a number of essential meristem genes. The PLT and SCR/SCR pathways that contribute to stem cell niche formation function independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aida et al. 2004</xref>), but our results show that both are regulated by the MDF/DOT2 pathway. These transcriptome data are in agreement with RT-qPCR analysis of <italic>PLT</italic>, <italic>PIN</italic>, <italic>SCR</italic> and <italic>SHR</italic> genes in <italic>mdf-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Casson et al. 2009</xref>), and further validation of the RNA-seq data by RT-qPCR was revealed as the corresponding reduction of expression of cell cycle-related genes and upregulation of stress-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). The RNA-seq analysis, in the context of the phenotypic analysis, therefore suggests a role for MDF/DOT2 in promoting auxin-mediated and other signalling pathways to promote meristem function and stemness, while suppressing pathways associated with stress response and differentiation pathways.</p><p id="P9">Alternative splicing analysis was initially performed by comparing the RNA-seq data to the Arabidopsis reference transcriptome AtRTD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). This identified 4706 genes that were spliced differentially compared with wildtype with a false detection rate (FDR) of 0.01 and a 10% inclusion difference minimum (Supplementary MATS files). The most frequently detected mis-splicing events in <italic>mdf-1</italic> were retained introns, both increased (1028 events) or decreased (1597 events) frequencies compared with wildtype, followed by alternative 5’ splice site use (477 increased, 333 decreased events) and alternative 3’ splice site use (412 increased, 451 decreased events), skipped exons (279 increased, 110 decreased events), and least frequent were other, multiple exon events (11 increased, 8 decreased events) (Fig. S4H). Gene enrichment analysis of the 2015 alternative splicing events identified by RMATs analysis showed that the most common pathways affected were ‘mRNA metabolic process’, ‘vegetative to reproductive phase transition of meristem’ and ‘RNA splicing’ (p&lt;0.05) (Fig. S4I). These results are consistent with MDF being required for correct gene expression control via splicing, and we aimed to identify other root meristem genes that may be spliced by a MDF-dependent mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>MDF controls meristem activity through RSZ33 and ACC1</title><p id="P10">Sixty-five alternatively spliced gene transcripts were identified associated with the ‘meristem’ GO category (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4I</xref>). One such gene is <italic>RSZ33</italic> (AT2G37340), which encodes a mRNA that is alternatively spliced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Palusa et al., 2007</xref>). It is strongly expressed in the root meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Birnbaum et al., 2003</xref>), with 4 RNA isoforms identified across leaf, root and flower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Simpson et al., 2008</xref>), of which 3 isoforms are found in the root meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Li et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). <italic>RSZ33</italic> encodes a plant-specific member of the SR protein family, and so is itself potentially a splicing factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>). A second gene, <italic>ACC1</italic> (AT1G36160) is required for fatty acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Baud et al. 2004</xref>) and the RNA has 3 isoforms following splicing in the 5’ UTR in different tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-E</xref>). Interestingly, defective expression of each gene (namely in transgenic overexpressers of <italic>RSZ33</italic> and in the <italic>acc1</italic> allelic mutants <italic>gurke</italic> and <italic>pasticcino3’</italic>)leads to root growth defects similar to those seen in <italic>mdf</italic>, such as a short root and other embryonic and postembryonic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Baud et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kalyna et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F-H</xref>; = <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>).

These results show that their correct splicing is dependent on MDF activity.</p><p id="P11">To investigate the functional relationship between MDF, RSZ33 and ACC1, we transformed the <italic>mdf-1</italic> mutant with non-spliceable (i.e. correctly and fully spliced) versions of either <italic>RSZ33</italic> or <italic>ACC1</italic> under the control of the <italic>MDF</italic> promoter, to determine whether either gene could rescue the <italic>mdf</italic> mutant root phenotype. The results show that each introduced gene can partially rescue both primary and lateral root development in the <italic>mdf-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I-Q</xref>), indicating that both genes are downstream of MDF splicing control and are required for MDF function in root development.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Splicing factor SR34 is a target of MDF and mediates specific abiotic stress responses</title><p id="P12">SR34 (AT1G02840) is a general splicing factor with at least seven different splice isoforms, resulting in protein variants differing in their RS domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lopato et al., 1996</xref>).

In the <italic>mdf-1</italic> mutant, the <italic>SR34</italic> transcript is mis-spliced compared with wildtype, with alternative 3’ splice site selection and a retained intron event (Supplementary RMATS files). A SALK T-DNA insertion mutant <italic>sr34</italic> was identified and confirmed as homozygous for insertion in, for phenotypic comparison with wildtype and <italic>mdf</italic> under standard and abiotic stress conditions. Under control conditions, WT and <italic>sr34</italic> seedlings exhibited no discernable difference in primary root length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). A similar result was seen with seedlings grown in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, which induces salinity stress and a shorter primary root compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). However, root lengths were significantly differentially reduced when seedlings were grown on media supplemented with 300 mM mannitol and 1% sucrose, which confer osmotic stress, 0.5 μM ABA, which is a hormone signal activated upon osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rowe et al., 2016</xref>), showing that <italic>sr34</italic> mutants are more sensitive than WT to these specific conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-E</xref>).

This supports a role for MDF in maintaining meristem pathways and suppressing cell death/differentiation under stress conditions. Similarly, under cold stress, we found (using transcriptional data described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Calixto et al. 2018</xref>) there is also isoform switching, with the retained intron transcript accumulating from a low level within 30 min of treatment, while the fully spliced isoform declines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Retained introns can influence the intracellular partitioning of transcripts between nucleus and cytoplasm, as a mechanism to avoid NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Rausin et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Naro et al. 2017</xref>), and intron retention is a potential mechanism to ensure transcripts are retained in the nucleus and may be released following splicing in response to environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jia et al., 2020</xref>). To determine whether the retained intron (RI) isoform of the <italic>MDF</italic> transcript is differentially partitioned, we purified nuclei and cytoplasm from Arabidopsis roots, isolated RNA and quantified the RI isoform in each fraction by RT-qPCR. The results show that at both 6 h and 12 h after osmotic stress, the RI isoform was relatively abundant in the cytosol (and presumably available for translation to preserve meristem function), while in the nucleus its abundance was reduced under osmotic stress, compared to non-stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E,F</xref>). This suggests that there is differential partitioning of the RI isoform of <italic>MDF</italic> between nucleus and cytosol in response to osmotic stress, though further work is required to determine what, if any, biological role the retained intron might play.</p><p id="P16">Our results show that MDF regulates the growth of roots by controlling the splicing of regulatory mRNAs and the levels of other regulatory gene transcripts that comprise a network to determine the balance between stemness and meristem activity on the one hand, and cell division arrest and cell differentiation on the other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). This balance is determined by the level of MDF, which itself is regulated by stress responses that modulate RNA isoform ratios to regulate growth responses through the network.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p id="P17">T-DNA insertion mutant lines <italic>mdf-1</italic>, <italic>mdf-2</italic>, <italic>acc1</italic> and <italic>sr34</italic> were obtained from Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC).
