Since the pioneering work by Ernst Abbe 150 years ago, many engineering innovations have drastically improved their performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, application domains exist, for which better and more cost-efficient objectives still are highly desirable. One of these domains is imaging samples processed with tissue clearing techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> which render entire organs or organisms transparent while retaining fluorescent labeling. Given that over the course of the past decade, clearing of entire mouse brains (<bold>≈</bold> 1 cm<sup>3</sup>) has become routine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and that clearing of entire mice and human organs is feasible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, there is a need for microscope objectives that are suitable for imaging large cleared samples at high resolution. This demand poses a challenging optical engineering problem: In microscopy, imaging at high resolution requires increasing the NA, which complicates the correction of aberrations and necessitates more lens elements. Beyond that, the large size of cleared samples requires objectives with long working distances while at the same time large FOVs are necessary to allow imaging with high throughput. The most challenging engineering problem by far is, however, that published clearing protocols require immersion media with a diversity of the index of refraction (n), ranging from water (n=1.33) for expansion microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> to typical organic solvents such as dibenzyl ether<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> (DBE) or ethyl cinnamate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> (ECI) with n=1.56. Some commercial objectives have a correction collar that moves an internal lens group to minimize index-dependent aberrations, but for high-NA objectives, designers often opt for narrowing the index range to keep the costs under control. For example, the Olympus XLSLPLN25XGMP combines NA=1.0 with 8-mm WD, but is restricted to n = 1.41 - 1.52. Covering a larger index range is possible at the expense of resolution (e.g. the Olympus XLPLN10XSVMP has NA 0.6, 8-mm WD, and n=1.33 - 1.52). Such objectives typically have 13-15 lenses and are expensive (<bold>≈</bold> 25-30 k$). In addition, despite this considerable effort, indices around 1.56 cannot be reached with satisfactory image quality. And not least, media such as DBE, ECI, or benzyl alcohol / benzyl benzoate (BABB) can dissolve lens cements so that chemically resistant dipping cap designs are required. Few such options are available, of which one is an ASI/Special Optics objective (54-12-8) that covers the entire range from 1.33 to 1.56 with good chemical compatibility, featuring 10-mm WD at NA 0.7. However, scaling this design up to higher NA, longer WD, and a FOV beyond 1 mm has not been achieved so far.</p><p id="P4">To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach for designing a multi-immersion objective based on a mirror instead of lenses. The underlying idea is that the reflection of a light ray by a mirror is independent of the index of refraction of the medium the mirror is in contact with. Consequently, if we submerge a curved mirror inside a liquid-filled chamber and use it to focus light, the ray paths and location of the focus do not change when changing the bulk index of the immersion medium. An invariant ray path means that any monochromatic aberrations such as spherical aberration or coma stay constant even though the numerical aperture of the objective scales with the refractive index of the medium. This is drastically different compared to lens-based multi-immersion designs where any medium change causes additional aberrations that need to be accounted for. In addition, reflective objective designs often have a longer WD than refractive designs at comparable NA. This combination of features means that reflective optical systems are excellent templates for long-WD multi-immersion objectives. Although to our knowledge such design has not been previously applied in bioimaging, it is found in nature, where each of the hundreds of eyes of scallops contains a curved mirror to form an image<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Each mirror is in direct contact with the liquid-filled space containing the photoreceptors. Each eye also contains a lens, which is not, however, the primary image-forming element<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. This combination of a lens and a mirror is reminiscent of the optical design of the Schmidt telescope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, a mirror-based wide-field telescope design commonly used in astronomy since the 1930s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). A Schmidt telescope is based on a spherical mirror which as a standalone element would create a heavily aberrated image due to spherical aberration. By adding a refractive aspherical correction plate in the center of curvature of the mirror, Bernhard Schmidt (1879-1935) created a telescope design that corrects the spherical aberration and provides excellent image quality over a large FOV. Owing to this wide-field capability, such telescopes are exceptionally well suited for surveys of the night sky. For example, the Kepler space telescope is a Schmidt telescope optimized for exoplanet detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>.</sup> Most Schmidt telescopes share the characteristic that due to the rotational symmetry of the spherical mirror, the image surface of a Schmidt telescope is curved as well. The usage of an aspherical correction plate in combination with curved mirrors forms a general solution that can be applied to a wide variety of optical design problems. Indeed, shortly after the Schmidt telescope became widely known, it was recognized that this principle could be useful to build microscope objectives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>.</sup> However, apart from non-imaging flow cytometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, there is no application of the Schmidt principle in modern biophotonics.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Turning a Schmidt telescope into an immersion objective</title><p id="P5">We reasoned that it is possible to turn a Schmidt telescope into an immersion microscope objective by a series of conceptual steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Video 1</xref>): <list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P6">Downscaling the design from the meter-sized apertures common in astronomy to a cm-sized aperture suitable for a microscope;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P7">Replacing the detector in the focus of the telescope with a fluorescently labeled sample; Focusing and scanning an excitation beam, e.g., a near-infrared ultrafast pulsed laser beam for two-photon microscopy, instead of focusing light from stars;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P8">Filling the entire inner space between the mirror and the correction plate with an immersion liquid.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="P9">We noted that this approach results in objective designs with excellent simulated image quality, however, the optimal shape of the aspherical surface correcting for spherical aberration needs to be tailored specifically to each immersion medium. Such designs with simple Schmidt correction plates thus are immersion objectives, but not multi-immersion-capable. The reason is that refraction at the interface between correction plate and immersion medium introduces additional index-dependent spherical aberration. To circumvent this problem, we make use of an edge case of the law of refraction: No matter how big the index difference at a refractive interface is, a ray at normal incidence is not refracted, i.e., it does not change its propagation direction. Therefore, we additionally shape the inner surface of the correction plate such that at all locations the passing rays are at normal incidence. In other words, the first aspherical surface of the correction plate deforms the incoming parallel wavefront to counteract the spherical aberration of the spherical mirror and the second surface is then shaped exactly like this deformed wavefront. As the wavefront passes the interface unchanged, no additional (index-dependent) aberrations are introduced. We refer to this interface as a “minimally refractive” surface because it does not have any net refractive power. Because in typical laser scanning microscopes the scan angles at the objective are usually only a few degrees, even off-axis ray bundles strike the minimally refractive surface at near normal incidence, which allows the design to have mm-sized FOVs. We term the resulting multi-immersion Schmidt-telescope-turned-microscope-objective a “Schmidt objective”.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Design of a multi-photon Schmidt objective</title><p id="P10">Whereas our concept can be used to design objectives for a wide variety of imaging modalities, we opted to demonstrate the design as a multi-photon objective. The reason is that many multi-photon techniques such as two-photon microscopy require only a single laser source and the excitation spectrum is so narrow that no color correction is necessary. Consequently, the design can be kept extremely simple: Our multi-photon objective design has only two optical elements and can be used with a tunable excitation laser in the 750-1000 nm range. Owing to the reflective geometry, the sample sits in between the mirror and correction plate. Therefore, we define the working distance as the axial spacing between the focus and the outer rim of the mirror because this is the feasible z-range before a sample holder would collide with the mirror (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Figure 1a</xref>). For our Schmidt objective this working distance is 11 mm.</p><p id="P11">As the on-axis ray path is independent of the refractive index of the immersion medium, the NA scales linearly with n and no correction collar is required. In air and using 800-nm excitation light, the design has an NA of 0.69 and a diffraction-limited field of view (dFOV) of 1.6 mm diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Figure 1b</xref>). The system has an index-independent entrance pupil diameter of 22 mm. As a result, the etendue (or optical invariant of the system) is constant and the product of NA and FOV is invariant as well. Consequently, in a higher-index medium such as water, the NA increases to 0.92 but the dFOV decreases to 1.4 mm. For typical organic solvents such as ECI, DBE, or BABB with an index of 1.56, the NA reaches 1.08 and the dFOV is 1.1 mm. The focal surface of the Schmidt objective is curved with a radius of 15.68 mm. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref> provides an overview of the theory underlying our design approach.</p><p id="P12">To turn this design into a prototype, we designed an immersion chamber around the optical components of the objective and integrated it into a custom horizontal multi-photon microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a-c</xref>). We chose a horizontal setup as it makes the exchange of immersion media and samples straightforward. In our prototype, the mirror is attached to a motorized XYZ stage and needs to be aligned relative to the correction plate. We opted for this approach because initially it was unclear how often the mirror would require cleaning and possibly replacement due to damaged coatings. In practice, however, we did not observe any coating damage even after prolonged immersion of the mirror in imaging media such as DBE, BABB or ECI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). This means that future Schmidt objectives can be designed with a mirror that is fixed in the immersion chamber.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Characterization of the multi-photon Schmidt objective</title><p id="P13">We characterized the optical resolution of the objective by imaging 200-nm fluorescent beads at 800-nm excitation wavelength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d,e</xref>). In air (NA=0.69), we measured an on-axis point-spread-function (PSF) with a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.56 ± 0.01 μm in X (mean ± s.e.m.), 0.49 ± 0.07 μm in Y, and 1.93 ± 0.01 μm in Z (n=8 beads). In water, the PSF size decreased to 0.42 ± 0.04 μm in X, 0.43 ± 0.03 μm in Y and 1.65 ± 0.1 μm in Z (n=8 beads). When filling the objective with an immersion oil with n=1.45, the PSF size further decreased to 0.36 ± 0.01 μm in X, 0.33 ± 0.01 μm in Y, and 1.33 ± 0.09 μm in Z (n=8 beads). Further increasing the index to n=1.51 led to PSF size of 0.36 ± 0.02 μm in X, 0.32 ± 0.02 μm in Y, and 1.36 ± 0.01 μm in Z (n=8 beads). Across the index range, the on-axis PSF sizes were comparable to diffraction-limited values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Imaging parameters are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. According to our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Figure 1b-d</xref>), our objective supports a diffraction-limited FOV of 1.7 mm in air, 1.4 mm in water, and 1.1 mm at n=1.56. Due to additional off-axis aberrations introduced by our scan and tube lens, the whole system is diffraction-limited only up to a maximum scan angle of ±1.75° which corresponds to a dFOV of 0.74 mm in air, 0.68 mm in water, and 0.54 mm at n=1.56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Figure 1e-g</xref>). Therefore, we characterized the PSFs at a scan angle of ±1.75° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figure 2</xref>) and found that the off-axis PSFs are in good agreement with our simulations.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Imaging examples using the Schmidt objective</title><p id="P14">To demonstrate the imaging capabilities of our Schmidt objective, we imaged both cleared and living samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In cleared samples, we first acquired low-resolution overview datasets with a mesoSPIM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> single-photon light-sheet microscope before transferring the sample into the Schmidt objective for high-resolution imaging. To showcase that the objective can be used in air, we imaged a pollen pellet composed of many individual pollen grains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). At higher zoom levels, surface features on individual pollen grains become readily apparent. Because the Schmidt objective is a multi-immersion objective, we could then fill the immersion chamber with ECI (n=1.56) and image the same pollen grains in this high-index medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Next, we placed a 5-day old larval zebrafish expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP6s in neurons in the Schmidt objective and filled it with fish water (n=1.33). We acquired stacks of the entire zebrafish brain and were able to record neuronal activity in the tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). To illustrate that the objective can be used for imaging cleared samples, we imaged <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> tadpoles in BABB (n=1.56), visualizing their developing peripheral nervous system and their eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Video 2</xref>). It was also possible to perform second-harmonic generation (SHG) imaging of muscle fibers in a tadpole tail, resolving individual sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 4</xref>). We also applied the Schmidt objective to image larger cleared embryos in BABB, for example a 4-day old chicken embryo, which is about 6 mm in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 5</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Video 3</xref>). Next, we replaced the immersion medium with DBE (also n=1.56) and inserted a 4-mm thick coronal slice of a iDISCO-processed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> Thy1-YFP-H mouse brain. In this sample, we were able to visualize spines along apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). We also successfully imaged dopaminergic neurons in a sample from a mouse brain stained for Tyrosine Hydroxylase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figure 6</xref>). Finally, we acquired a dataset from a MASH-processed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> 5×7×4 mm<sup>3</sup> piece of human neocortex in ECI, enabling us to visualize neuronal somata and the dense neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">Taken together, these examples illustrate how a single Schmidt objective, due to its extreme index range, covers a range of applications that would usually require several objectives. Most importantly, <italic>despite</italic> having only three optical surfaces, our design outperforms all existing commercial multi-photon microscope objectives for cleared tissue within the parameter space of WD, index range, maximum NA, and FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figure 7</xref>). Whereas our mirror-based design provides multi-immersion capability basically for free, the reflective ray path means that the objective surrounds the sample which is similar to light-sheet microscopes for which custom sample holders and mounting techniques are often necessary. In addition, the bigger the sample is, the more it obstructs the excitation path. In principle, it is possible to design unobstructed off-axis Schmidt objectives to ameliorate these disadvantages. Similar to a Schmidt telescope, we allow the focal surface to be curved, which did not turn out to be an issue when imaging three-dimensional samples because the z-shift across the FOV is small (i.e. Δz = 1.2 μm across a 400 μm FOV).</p><p id="P17">A more important concern is that the long path length inside the immersion medium means that the image quality depends on the homogeneity of the liquid. For us, this meant that whereas imaging in organic solvents was straightforward, we could not achieve satisfactory image quality in CLARITY samples because the required refractive index matching solutions were not homogeneous enough. This property is not specific to the Schmidt objective, however: Any immersion objective with long WD and high NA will show similar behavior. We foresee that the ongoing development of clearing techniques for larger and larger samples will naturally converge towards highly homogeneous imaging media as they provide the best imaging results independent of the microscopy modality. We believe that our work opens up a previously unexplored design space for building immersion microscope objectives. In principle, our concept can be extended to any imaging modality, including widefield, confocal, and light-sheet microscopy. The underlying simplicity of the concept makes it well suited for low-cost objectives that can be mass-produced for diagnostic applications. Additionally, in optical design, simplicity begets scalability: Our approach will likely allow the design of “mesolenses” - objectives that perform high-resolution (NA&gt;1) imaging across cm-scale FOVs and are capable of extremely high-throughput imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Beyond that, our development of the Schmidt objective shows that astronomers and microscopists might benefit from closer interactions.

The capillary tube was clamped into a sample holder and inserted into the Schmidt objective. For imaging at an index of n=1.45, the immersion chamber was filled with a fused-silica-matching liquid (50350, Cargille). Type A immersion oil (16482, Cargille) was used for measurements at n=1.51. The liquids were chosen such that the fluorescent beads did not dissolve; other immersion media such as BABB, DBE, and ECI rapidly dissolved Fluoresbrite beads. For each immersion medium and FOV location, 8 beads were measured and the resulting point spread functions (PSF) fitted with Gaussian profiles in XYZ.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Imaging pollen grains</title><p id="P21">We glued a pollen granule sold as nutritional supplement (Morga Bluetenpollen, Morga AG) to a 2-mm borosilicate glass tube (TG200-4, Harvard Apparatus) with Super RTV Silicone Transparent (Wuerth). The dried granules were usually composed of a single type of pollen grain and could be preselected for shape and fluorescence under a widefield microscope. We selected a pollen granule with spikes (echinate sculptures). Immersing pollen granules in water or other polar solvents dissolves them into single pollen which is why we used ethyl cinnamate to image pollen granules in high refractive index medium in addition to imaging them in air.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Functional imaging of larval zebrafish</title><p id="P22">We generated larvae by incrossing adult transgenic elavl3:GCaMP6s fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.

For best staining and clearing results, the embryo was kept in constant, gentle motion throughout the staining procedure. Incubation was at 4°C. The tissue was permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for one hour, followed by an incubation in 20 mM lysine in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.3 for one hour. In a next step, the embryo was rinsed with five changes of PBS. Non-specific binding was blocked using 10% FCS (fetal calf serum) in PBS for one hour. The primary antibody mouse anti-neurofilament (1:2’000, RMO270, Invitrogen 13-0700) was added for 48 hours. The primary antibody was removed and the tissue rinsed with ten changes of PBS and an additional incubation overnight.

Accordingly, a handwritten and signed codicil from the donor posed when still alive and well, is kept at the Department of Anatomy and Embryology Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands. The samples were obtained from a female patient (82 years) diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, aphasia, and depression. Brains were first fixed in situ by full body perfusion via the femoral artery. Under a pressure of 0.2 bar the body was perfused by 10 l fixation fluid (1.8 vol% formaldehyde, 20% ethanol, 8.4% glycerine in water) within 1.5–2 hours. Thereafter the body was preserved for at least 4 weeks for post-fixation submersed in the same fluid.

A second inspiration is the Schmidt telescope, a mirror-based wide-field telescope design that consists of a spherical mirror and an aspherical correction plate. <bold>b</bold>, We synthesize both concepts into a multi-immersion objective design that provides a sharp image in any homogeneous medium (center). Reflection off the mirror does not depend on the refractive index n of the immersion medium (right). To avoid additional refraction at the inner surface of the correction plate, we deform this surface such that all passing rays are close to normal incidence (bottom left).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS155880-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Setup and characterization.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Overview of the setup. In our prototype, the position of the spherical mirror needs to be aligned relative to the correction plate for optimum image quality. This design allows for straightforward cleaning of the mirror when switching immersion media. To create a z-stack, the sample is moved along the optical axis. <bold>b</bold>, The prototype objective consists of an immersion chamber and a mirror. <bold>c</bold>, Assembled microscope objective. <bold>d</bold>, XYZ views of point spread function (PSF) measurements of 200-nm fluorescent beads imaged at refractive indices ranging from n=1.00 (air), n=1.33 (water), n=1.45 (Cargille fused silica matching oil), to n=1.51 (Cargille oil type A). Because NA) is proportional to n, an increase in n leads to higher NA and thus a smaller PSF. <bold>e</bold>, PSF uniformity over the field of view: PSF measurements were carried out on axis and at a scan angle of 1.75°, which was simulated to be the maximum theoretical diffraction-limited scan angle for the total system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Figure 1</xref>). As the magnification of the objective is proportional to n, the FOV diameter decreases with increasing index. Diffraction-limited theoretical values are indicated by the red dashed lines.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS155880-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Example two-photon datasets acquired with the Schmidt objective.</title><p>Fixed samples were first imaged with a mesoSPIM light-sheet microscope before the sample was transferred to the Schmidt objective. <bold>a</bold>, A pollen pellet composed of many individual pollen grains imaged in air. <bold>b</bold>, Functional imaging in a 5-day old elavl3:GCaMP6s zebrafish larvae in vivo. <bold>c</bold>, BABB-cleared <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> tadpole stained for Atp1a1 (Alexa 594, orange) and nuclei (DAPI, greyscale).
