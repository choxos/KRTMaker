Herbal medicines have been used for years and played a tremendous role in several epidemics of respiratory viral infections. Thus, they are considered as a promising platform to combat SARS-CoV-2. Previously, we reported that common dandelion (<italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic>) leaf extract and its high molecular weight compounds strongly suppressed <italic>in vitro</italic> lung cell infection by SARS-CoV-2 Spike D614 and Delta variant pseudotyped lentivirus. We now here demonstrate that <italic>T. officinale</italic> extract protects against the most prominent Omicron variant using hACE2-TMPRSS2 overexpressing A549 cells as <italic>in vitro</italic> model system. Notably, compared to the original D614, and the Delta variant, we could confirm a higher efficacy. Short-term interval treatment of only 30 min was then sufficient to block the infection by 80% at 10 mg/mL extract. Further subfractionation of the extract identified compounds larger than 50 kDa as effective ACE2-Spike binding inhibitors. In summary, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus to the highly transmissible Omicron variant did not lead to resistance, but rather increased sensitivity to the preventive effect of the extract.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd><italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic></kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2 prevention</kwd><kwd>Omicron variant</kwd><kwd>herbal medicine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">By November 2022, 634 million COVID-19 cases with 6.6 million deaths were confirmed worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], wherein, approximately 43 per cent of all infected patients experienced long term effect of infection (i.e. long COVID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Approximately 69% of the world’s population is vaccinated, meaning they have received the first dose, 60% are fully vaccinated (both doses), and a total of over 12 billion vaccine doses have been administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Although complete vaccination significantly reduces the likelihood of severe infection with SARS-CoV-2, some risk of viral transmission persists. Since the spike protein of the original D614 Wuhan strain has been used for the development of most currently available vaccines, the emergence and worldwide spreading of new SARS-CoV-2 variants with significant antigenic differences quickly resulted in a limited vaccine efficacy. The spike protein of the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) has over 30 mutations with 15 mutations in the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) in comparison to the Wuhan strain. As a consequence, even fully vaccinated individuals are more frequently being diagnosed with COVID-19 as a result of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Herbal medicines have been used for centuries to treat epidemics and have generally been shown to be safe. Due to their distinct antiviral properties against various viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, they are being explored as interesting agents for complementary prevention and treatment of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. It has been suggested that the active compounds in these extracts could act through different modes of action, for instance, inhibition of protein-protein interaction as determined using computational screening assay, disrupting nuclear import and replication, or strengthening the immune system with reduced hyper-inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. However, the exact underlying mechanisms by which herbal medicines block viral infections remain to be investigated, as a number of active compounds with different molecular interactions are involved. To a certain extent, there have been some clinical trials using herbal medicines in combination with conventional therapies, which showed better results in terms of COVID-19 symptom relief and remission duration with higher lymphocyte counts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Moreover, intranasal or intraoral administration of antiviral agents could be an important additional approach to prevent infection and spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses at their entry sites, i.e., the nose and throat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Recently, we demonstrated that the mechanism of action of <italic>T. officinale</italic> is to prevent the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 with human cells at the level of interaction of its spike proteins with the specific human cell surface enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The potential use of monoclonal antibodies and the use of convalescent (antibody-rich) plasma in COVID-19 patients is also based on this mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Due to major concerns about immune evasion by the new viral variants and declining efficacy of available vaccines, we aimed to determine whether <italic>T. officinale</italic> extract could still provide efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 Spike Omicron variant infection. We also determined extract application times and further defined the active extract fraction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results | discussion" id="S2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="P5">For the original SARS-CoV-2 virus utilization of the ACE2 receptor and other proteins has been confirmed as host cell entry, and this mechanism is still key for most emerging variants. Therefore, targeting Spike RBD – ACE2 binding is a promising approach to block virus entry. Our previous study showed that <italic>T. officinale</italic> extract could significantly suppress the binding between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein D614 as well as its four mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Interestingly, the main bioactive chemicals responsible for the plant extract’s effects were in a high molecular weight fraction (≥ 5 kDa) based on our findings in both, a cell-free and cellular assay. Consequently, we further subfractionated the HMW fraction by using molecular weight cut-off filters of 5-10 kDa, 10-30 kDa, 30-50 kDa, and over 50 kDa. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows that in line with our previous study, the plant extract significantly reduced the Spike – ACE2 interaction already at 2 mg/mL by 24% and reached 54% at 50 mg/mL. Similarly, active compounds presented in the &gt; 50 kDa HMW fraction showed a significant inhibition by 26% and 45% at the concentration equivalent to 2 and 50 mg/mL dried leaf extract, respectively. Whereas the other sub-fractions (5-10 kDa, 10-30 kDa, and 30-50 kDa) showed only minimal inhibition with less than 8%. This suggests that the effect is mainly caused by the &gt; 50 kDa HMW fraction, but extensive research is still needed to identify the active compounds. We and others showed that the aqueous extract of <italic>T. officinale</italic> contains a variety of bioactive constituents, including more than 30 different phenolic compounds, sesquiterpene lactones, and polysaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. For example, polyphenols have been attributed with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities, including anti-SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. In a cell-free assay, polyphenols from hydroalcoholic pomegranate peel extract were shown to interfere with the spike-ACE2 interaction by binding to these proteins with a 10-fold higher affinity for the RBD domain. Among the polyphenolic compounds, punicalagin and ellagic acid were found to be the most active chemicals, and synergistic effects may exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. However, using NMR analysis, we could confirm the absence of low molecular weight compounds in the HMW fraction. For sulfated polysaccharides (RPI-27 with a molecular weight of around 100 kDa derived from fucoidans), marked reduction of SARS-CoV-2 – ACE2 interaction at a non-cytotoxic concentration (IC<sub>50</sub> of 8.3 ± 4.6 μg/mL) was demonstrated in Vero cells, and this may be due to multivalent binding to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Using a docking model, the authors suggested that molecule binding to the S protein RBD was tighter with a larger oligosaccharide as compared to a lower molecular weight oligosaccharide</p><p id="P6"><italic>T. officinale</italic> extract was shown previously by us to have a strong inhibitory effect on infection by SARS-CoV-2 Spike D614 and Delta (B.1.617.2) variant pseudotyped lentivirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Therefore, we here studied the efficacy of the extract to block B.1.1.529 Omicron variant transduction in A549-hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells using the same virus titer. Pre-treatment with the plant extract significantly inhibited viral transduction at 0.15 mg/mL by 24% and reached a peak (99%) inhibition at 2.5 mg/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). With this, the plant extract showed a much higher potency towards the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Omicron variant compared to the D614 (85 % inhibition at 20 mg/mL) and Delta variant (72% at 20 mg/mL), as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Anti-hACE2 antibody (100 μg/mL) diminished viral infection by 82%, which was also slightly more effective compared to the results on the Delta variant (73%). Commonly, the standard test procedure normally provides test compound exposure for a few hours or even throughout the virus infection duration (up to 72 h) in cell-based models to identify a maximum possible treatment effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. However, these treatment times are technically difficult or impossible to achieve in the clinical setting. A post-exposure prophylaxis that can be practiced on a daily basis would rather take place in several short treatment cycles. Based on these considerations, we repeated the experiment without <italic>T. officinale</italic> extract post-incubation. As a result, we still observed a substantial preventive effect against virus transduction, albeit with a lower inhibition efficacy (58% at 1.25 mg/mL, 99% at 5 mg/mL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This encouraged us to further test, whether only two rounds of short (30 min) extract treatment still could work. Interestingly, a preventive effect was already evident then at 2.5 mg/mL extract; 80% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 Spike Omicron particle infection was reached at 10 mg/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). As expected, extract efficacy (the half maximal effective concentration, EC<sub>50</sub>) of virus infection prevention increased with extension of extract treatment from EC<sub>50</sub> of 5 mg/mL (30 min incubation before and after infection with washing in between), to 0.9 mg/mL (30 min pre-incubation prior 24 h transduction), to 0.5 mg/mL (30 min pre-treatment followed by 84 h incubation).</p><p id="P7">According to the German Commission E and the European Scientific Cooperative for Phytotherapy (ESCOP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], the recommended daily intake of the plant is up to 8 g (i. e. 20 – 30 mg/mL). This makes it interesting for an intervention in the oral cavity, as it would be realistic and safe to conduct short, 30 min interval treatments in expectation or after potential Sars-CoV-2 virus exposure. In our previous experiments we already demonstrated at least 30 min stability of the bioactive compounds in human saliva at body temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. The oral cavity, as an essential part of the upper digestive tract, plays a key role in the transmission and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the new Omicron virus variants appear to infect the gastrointestinal tract in addition to the respiratory tract. Gastrointestinal symptoms sometimes occur before respiratory symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], and compared to the lung, even higher expression levels of the ACE2 receptor were found in the gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S4"><title>Plant material and extraction</title><p id="P8"><italic>T. officinale</italic> dried leaves were purchased from Achterhof (Uplengen, Germany; batch number B370244).

After filtration with a suction filter, the resulting extract was subjected to a sequential ultrafiltration procedure using a crossflow system (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Göttingen, Germany). Filtration was carried out with four molecular weight cut-off filters (50 kDa, 30 kDa, 10 kDa, and 5 kDa) resulting in the following fractions: &gt;50 kDa, 30–50 kDa, 10–30 kDa, and 5–10 kDa. Purification of HMW fractions was achieved by flushing with water (5 L each) to remove low molecular weight compounds from the extract.
