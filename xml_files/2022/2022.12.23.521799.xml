Modulation of cortico-striatal circuits has been suggested as a mechanism of action. To gain mechanistic insight, we monitored neuronal activity in cortico-striatal regions in a mouse model for compulsive behavior, while systematically varying clinically-relevant parameters of internal-capsule DBS. DBS showed dose-dependent effects on both brain and behavior: An increasing, yet balanced, number of excited and inhibited neurons was recruited, scattered throughout cortico-striatal regions, while compulsive grooming decreased. Such neuronal recruitment did not alter basic brain function such as resting-state activity, and only occurred in awake animals, indicating a dependency on network activity. In addition to these widespread effects, we observed specific involvement of the medial orbitofrontal cortex in therapeutic outcomes, which was corroborated by optogenetic stimulation. Together, our findings provide mechanistic insight into how DBS exerts its therapeutic effects on compulsive behaviors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Electrical deep-brain stimulation (DBS) is used to treat a growing list of neurological and psychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.

In contrast, several studies point to dysfunctional activity in distal cortico-striatal circuits in OCD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and DBS is thought to correct such dysfunction via recruitment of cortical regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.

Animals were tested in an open-field apparatus after implanting DBS electrodes into the IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). All mice were stimulated across three different experiments (on different days) to examine the effects of different intensities (no DBS, low-, medium-, and high-intensity DBS) of clinically relevant DBS parameters (current, pulse width, and frequency) on brain and behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). Consistent across experiments, SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> spent approximately 20% of the open-field session grooming at baseline (no DBS), whereas WT groomed only for 5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f,h</xref>). For each of the three DBS-parameter experiments, SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> grooming was not reduced during the lowest DBS-intensity condition (pre-DBS baseline vs DBS; green, 100 μA: t(26)=1.78, p=0.087; 40 μs: t(27)=0.52, p=0.608; 60 Hz: t(25)=1.31, p=0.203;). However, both medium- (yellow) and high-intensity (red) DBS conditions showed immediate and robust reductions in excessive grooming (pre-DBS baseline vs DBS; 200 μA: t(26)=2.34, p=0.040; 300 μA: t(26)=4.44, p=0.003; 80 μs: t(27)=2.35, p=0.039; 160 μs: t(27)=4.18, p=0.005; 120 Hz: t(25)=2.27, p=0.048; 180 Hz: t(25)=2.94, p=0.014) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Excessive grooming rapidly reinstated upon DBS offset. Both current and pulse-width experiments exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in grooming (current: F(3,78)=7.82, p&lt;0.001; pulse width: F(3,81)=7.02, p&lt;0.001), whereas increasing frequency beyond 120 Hz did not improve efficacy further (frequency: F(3,75)=1.97, p=0.126) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Importantly, DBS did not alter WT grooming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>) or general locomotion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1f,g</xref>). DBS-electrode location (two-dimensional anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral position) did not correlate with grooming reduction, indicating that precise electrode positioning within the IC did not change effectiveness of DBS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). Exploring novel DBS parameters (low frequency and “cyclic” stimulation) did not result in grooming reduction, in line with recent patient findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1h,i</xref>). Taken together, IC-DBS reduced excessive grooming in SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> and, similar to clinical practice, the effectiveness of DBS was improved by adapting current and pulse width, but not frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>IC-DBS modulates the entire dorsal cortex, with an emphasis on the frontal cortex</title><p id="P6">DBS is thought to recruit cortical regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. To assess widespread cortical effects of IC-DBS, we employed wide-field calcium imaging across the entire dorsal cortex in <italic>Thy1</italic>-GCaMP6f mice (<italic>n</italic>=5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. The skull was made transparent for calcium imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and IC-DBS electrodes implanted, targeted at the ipsilateral hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). After motion correction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b,c</xref>), the Allen-brain atlas was used to map neuronal activity onto specific brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Similar to the dose-dependent reduction in grooming during varying current and pulse-width experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), we found dose-dependent suppression of the entire dorsal cortex (current: F(3,12)=4.38, p=0.027; pulse width: F(3,12)=7.20, p=0.005), which was absent in the frequency experiment (frequency: F(3,12)=0.31, p=0.845) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Analyzing brain regions independently, we found increased activity in all recorded regions immediately upon DBS onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). However, within a few seconds activity diminished and sustained suppression of activity was found in a subset of regions. In the frontal cortex (FC), we found suppression across current (F(3,12)=8.77, p=0.005) and pulse-width (F(3,12)=9.64, p=0.005) experiments, and in the somatosensory cortex (SS) only during pulse-width manipulations (F(3,12)=6.41, p=0.023). We found no significant suppression in retrosplenial cortex (RSP) nor visual cortex (VIS), suggesting a rostral-caudal gradient of suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Direct comparison between regions revealed prominent suppression in FC during current (F(3,12)=4.20, p=0.023; post-hoc: FC vs RSP p=0.043, FC vs VIS p=0.034) and pulse-width (F(3,12)=3.51, p=0.040; post-hoc: FC vs VIS p=0.040) experiments, but not frequency (F(3,12)=2.95, p=0.065) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). These data indicate that IC-DBS sustainedly suppresses the entire dorsal cortex with a rostral-to-caudal gradient.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Single-cell recruitment in cortical and striatal regions by IC-DBS</title><p id="P7">Wide-field imaging captures a large part of the brain, but lacks single-cell resolution and is limited to superficial cortical layers in head-fixed mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. To overcome these limitations and elucidate DBS effects on grooming in OCD-relevant circuits, we used miniaturized fluorescent microscopes (miniscopes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Consistent with literature, our wide-field data indicated a role for the FC in IC-DBS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, we used miniscopes to record from pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortical regions (lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC, mOFC), prelimbic cortex (PL), and premotor cortex (M2)) and medium-spiny neurons in their striatal projection targets (dorsal and ventral striatum (DS, VS)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). During open-field experiments with freely-behaving SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> and WT, we recorded fluorescence in hundreds of neurons per region and found complex dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b,c</xref>). A subset of neurons exhibited immediate, transient effects (either excitatory or inhibitory) upon DBS onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>), resembling cortex-wide increases in activity at DBS onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Other neurons showed sustained excitation or inhibition of their activity during DBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>), resembling the sustained suppression we found in the FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In all recorded brain regions, DBS recruited single cells (i.e., modulated their activity) dose-dependently by exciting or inhibiting their activity (Factor intensity, lOFC: F(3,40)=5.53, p=0.003; mOFC: F(3,32)=12.72, p&lt;0.001; PL: F(3,32)=11.27, p&lt;0.001; M2: F(3,32)=14.54, p&lt;0.001; DS: F(3,24)=2.57, p=0.077; VS: F(3,32)=8.75, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3g</xref>).</p><p id="P8">However, mOFC and DS predominantly recruited neurons by exciting their activity, independent of genotype (Factor direction, mOFC: F(3,32)=14.77, p&lt;0.001; DS: F(3,24)=7.68, p=0.011). Neurons that were recruited by DBS showed consistency in duration (transient or sustained) and direction (excited or inhibited) across different DBS intensities in SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>) and WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>) (e.g., a sustainedly excited recruited neuron during one DBS intensity is likely to be recruited as sustainedly excited again during another DBS intensity), suggesting that DBS affects neurons similarly across different stimulation parameters. Since behavioral DBS effects were restricted to periods of stimulation, we hypothesized that the sustained neurons were driving the recorded reduction in grooming in SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup>. To investigate whether the sustained activation is driven by direct antidromic stimulation or underlying network activity, we imaged mice under both awake and anesthetized (diminished network activity) conditions in the same session<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Under anesthesia, we found no sustained neurons (either excited or inhibited), nor transient inhibited neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>), demonstrating that sustained recruitment is dependent on network activity in the awake state. Similar to the consistent recruitment of neurons (direction and duration), we found that transient excited neurons recruited under anesthesia were more likely to be recruited as transient excited neurons in awake recordings (bootstrap, p=0.002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>), suggesting antidromic stimulation of their axons. Together, DBS modulated neurons’ activity in a dynamic, yet consistent fashion that was dependent on network activity.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Unaffected basic brain function during IC-DBS</title><p id="P9">To examine if DBS alters all aspects of neuronal activity, we quantified proxies of “basic brain function”: we calculated the baseline activity of neurons (a form of resting-state activity)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> and examined how anatomical distance between neurons affected the synchrony of their activity (spatiotemporal correlations)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. First, we compared averaged regional baseline activity during the “no-DBS” block with baseline activity during the high-intensity DBS block. The cumulative density function of calcium events and the average frequency of calcium events were combined into a cell-activity index measure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The cell-activity index during the high-intensity DBS block was not different from the “no-DBS” block in SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), nor WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), indicating that resting-state activity was not affected by DBS. Next, we tested whether spatiotemporal correlations (i.e., distance between neuron pairs correlated with their activity)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> were preserved during DBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Local spatiotemporal correlations between recorded neurons were found in all regions during the “no-DBS” block and were preserved during DBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Since DBS strongly modulated neurons’ activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>), we reasoned that preserved local spatiotemporal correlations would likely be achieved by scattered recruitment of neurons (i.e., lack of spatial clustering). To properly assess anatomical organization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>), we calculated the anatomical distance of each recruited neuron to its closest recruited neighbor (to avoid averaging out short and long distances between neuron pairs), tested to chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), and did not find clustering of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Together, these data indicate that, although DBS recruits neurons widespread throughout brain regions, it does not compromise basic brain function.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Dose-dependent recruitment of similar neuron populations</title><p id="P10">Next, we focused our analyses on neurons that were recruited sustainedly throughout the stimulation epoch, because their activity change paralleled the duration of grooming reduction and was dependent on network activity (in the awake state). Sustained neurons (both excited and inhibited) were found throughout the miniscope’s field-of-view in each DBS-intensity block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In all regions, we found dose-dependent recruitment of sustained neurons that amounted to a maximum of approximately a quarter of all imaged neurons in both SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> (lOFC: F(3,15)=7.93, p=0.002; mOFC: F(3,12)=16.56, p&lt;0.001; PL: F(3,12)=8.93, p=0.002; M2: F(3,12)=31.37, p&lt;0.001; DS: F(3,9)=4.32, p=0.038; VS: F(3,12)=5.27, p=0.015) and WT (lOFC: F(3,12)=31.24, p&lt;0.001; mOFC: F(3,12)=11.5, p&lt;0.001; PL: F(3,12)=6.59, p=0.006; M2: F(3,9)=5.5, p=0.020; DS: F(3,12)=7.77, p=0.004; VS: F(3,9)=13.13, p=0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Importantly, when comparing SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> with WT, we found stronger recruitment in mOFC in SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> in each DBS-parameter experiment (current: F(1,16)=4.61, p=0.048; pulse width: F(1,16)=9.96, p=0.018; frequency: F(1,16)=7.26, p=0.032) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>), suggesting that the mOFC in SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> was affected more robustly by DBS than WT and potentially drove the suppression of compulsive-like grooming. Since DBS recruited overlapping transient-neuron populations in awake and anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>), we tested whether DBS would also recruit overlapping sustained neuron populations across DBS-intensity blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Neurons recruited during medium- and high-intensity overlapped above chance level in both SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> (bootstrap - lOFC: p=0.003; mOFC: p=0.003; PL: p=0.003; M2: p=0.003; DS: p=0.012; VS: p=0.024) and WT (bootstrap - lOFC: p=0.003; mOFC: p=0.002; PL: p=0.003; M2: p=0.005; DS: p=0.003; VS: p=0.003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>). These data are consistent with our behavioral results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>) - only medium- and high-intensity DBS reduced grooming. Since neurons can be excited or inhibited by DBS modulation, we investigated whether a computed excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance observed at baseline was maintained during DBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). In most regions, we found preserved E/I balance, as demonstrated by similar number of neurons recruited as excited and inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>). However, during DBS, mOFC and DS neurons were predominantly excited in SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> (mOFC: F(3,16)=3.46, p=0.041; DS: F(3,12)=6.18, p=0.009) and WT (mOFC: F(3,16)=3.92, p=0.028; DS: F(3,16)=5.33, p=0.010), providing more evidence for involvement of mOFC in DBS effects. Together, these data demonstrate “global” DBS effects (which were independent of genotype and brain region): dose-dependent recruitment of neuron populations that partially overlap at therapeutic intensities, while maintaining E/I balance in most regions. These global effects were accompanied by “regional” DBS effects (which were dependent on brain region): the mOFC recruitment in SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup>, primarily by means of excitation, suggests that mOFC potentially drives the DBS-induced suppression of grooming in SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>mOFC in SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> controls compulsive-like grooming</title><p id="P11">Since DBS reduced grooming specifically, we searched for neurons that were modulated specifically during grooming using Bayesian ANOVAs (Bayes factor&gt;3 to obtain substantial evidence for the presence and absence of effect) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Even using relatively strict Bayesian identification criteria (see Methods), we identified such neurons in all recorded regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). For sake of simplicity, we refer to them as grooming-associated neurons. Similarly, we refer to neurons that were not modulated during periods of grooming, locomotion, or behavioral inactivity as not-associated neurons. In the mOFC of SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup>, we found a trend to dose-dependent recruitment of grooming-associated neurons (mOFC: F(3,16)=3.21, p=0.051) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, top row). In contrast, in all cortical regions, we found dose-dependent recruitment of not-associated neurons (lOFC: F(3,20)=4.74, p=0.012; mOFC: F(3,16)=3.37, p=0.045; PL: F(3,16)=8.25, p=0.002; M2: F(3,16)=12.86, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, bottom row), suggesting that DBS does not recruit neurons based on their “cell identity”, which was supported by a lack of overlap between behavior-associated and DBS-recruited neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b,c,d,e</xref>). We hypothesized that DBS reduces grooming by diminishing the number of grooming-associated neurons. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the number of grooming-associated neurons in mOFC was consistently reduced during DBS across DBS-parameter experiments (mOFC - current: t(4)=4.21, p=0.041; pulse width: t(4)=2.8, p=0.049; frequency: t(4)=3.88, p=0.036) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>), suggesting that the activity of mOFC neurons contributes to grooming frequency. To test whether these neurons causally contribute to reduced grooming, we expressed the excitatory opsin ChETA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> in mOFC (<italic>n</italic>=7) to mimic regional excitatory DBS effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6f</xref>). Photostimulation was delivered for 60 s (to mimic the activity of sustainedly recruited neurons). Indeed, grooming diminished and re-emerged at photostimulation on- and off-set, respectively (473 nm, 5 mW, 10 ms pulse-duration) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>), at 5, 15 and 120 Hz (5Hz: t(6)=3.86, p=0.033; 15Hz: t(6)=4.17, p=0.029; 120: t(6)=3.58, p=0.035). In contrast, 60 s photostimulation at 1 Hz or photostimulation at 15 Hz for 5 s (to mimic the activity of transiently recruited neurons) had no effect on grooming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>). Photostimulation, regardless of protocol, did not affect general locomotion or the relationship between grooming and locomotion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6g,h</xref>). Changes in grooming were abolished when light was prevented from entering the mOFC by blocking the implanted fibers. Importantly, control animals (<italic>n</italic>=5), expressing only the stable fluorophore mCherry in mOFC, and animals expressing ChETA in lOFC (<italic>n</italic>=5) or M2 (<italic>n</italic>=5) did not exhibit reduced grooming. Taken together, mOFC neurons exhibit grooming-related information that is altered by DBS and tightly linked to compulsive-like grooming behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P12">Although DBS is widely used for the treatment of otherwise therapy-resistant OCD patients, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. In particular, DBS-induced electrical artifacts have hampered the electrophysiological investigation of the brain during DBS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Here, we overcame this limitation by using electrical-noise-resistant calcium imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> in SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup>, a well-established mouse model for OCD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, to monitor cortex-wide population dynamics and single-cell activity in cortical and striatal regions, while systematically varying clinically relevant DBS parameters. We identified several “global” and “regional” effects of DBS. The DBS effects occurring uniformly across genotype and brain region, the “global” effects, were: Both direction and duration of recruitment of individual neurons were stable across different DBS-parameters and were dependent on network activity in the awake state; recruited neurons were scattered throughout brain regions and their numbers increased with DBS intensity; DBS recruited overlapping yet distinct neuron populations at therapeutic DBS intensities; and the relative balance between the number of neurons excited or inhibited by DBS (E/I balance) was generally preserved. The “regional” effects of DBS, those that varied depending on genotype and brain region, were: DBS modulated more mOFC neurons in SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> (compared to WT); the E/I balance in mOFC leaned toward excitation; and DBS reduced the number of grooming-associated neurons specifically in mOFC of SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup>. Furthermore, optogenetically mimicking DBS in the mOFC of SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup>, but not lOFC nor M2, was sufficient to reduce compulsive grooming, providing insight into how DBS exerts its anti-compulsive effects.</p><p id="P13">Although DBS induced strong effects on brain and behavior, it did not alter basic brain function. For example, baseline activity (akin to resting-state activity) was not altered by DBS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In addition, we found robust correlations between distance and activity of pairs of neurons (spatiotemporal correlations) in all recorded regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, which were preserved during DBS. In contrast to unaltered basic brain function, compulsive grooming was reduced dose-dependently by alterations of current and pulse width, but not frequency, validating clinical practice of focusing on current and pulse width in search of optimal DBS parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Clinical procedures employ chronically applied high-frequency continuous stimulation to treat patients, but recent work on DBS in Parkinsonian mice has suggested improved efficacy during cyclic (periodic DBS on and off) stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. However, we found no effect of cyclic stimulation on compulsive-like behavior, which is consistent with a lack of therapeutic effect in a recent study in OCD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In addition, we examined low-frequency stimulation, which also lacked neuronal and behavioral effects. Together, we conclude that chronically applied continuous high-frequency DBS effectively reduces compulsive-like behaviors without compromising basic brain function.</p><p id="P14">It has been suggested that IC-DBS exercises its efficacy via modulation of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, predominantly via recruitment of cortical regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Consistent with studies in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, we report IC-DBS neuronal recruitment in cortical and striatal regions in mice. We identified a number of global effects of DBS: 1) sustained neuronal recruitment was absent in anesthetized animals, illustrating that recruitment of sustained neurons is not simply a product of antidromic stimulation of IC white-matter, but instead depends substantially on network activity in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits present only in awake animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The small percentage of neurons that were nonetheless recruited in anesthetized mice (transiently excited neurons) did overlap with recruited neurons in awake mice, suggesting that transient neurons might be recruited by direct, antidromic stimulation of IC white-matter. 2) Neurons were recruited in a consistent fashion: the direction (excitation or inhibition) and duration (transient or sustained throughout DBS epoch) of modulation of individual neurons was consistent across different DBS intensities, suggesting that neurons have a predisposition to being recruited in a particular manner. 3) DBS recruited neurons did not cluster spatially but were randomly scattered throughout the imaged regions. 4) Similar to the intensity-dependent reduction in grooming, the number of neurons recruited was dose-dependent, suggesting the extent of neuronal recruitment relates to the behavioral effects. 5) Contrary to the ‘inhibition hypothesis’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, which states that the mechanism of DBS is a functional lesion that results in local inhibition, we found both DBS-induced excitation and inhibition. Remarkably, in most regions, excitation and inhibition were relatively balanced (i.e., equal numbers of excited and inhibited neurons). Consistent with a recent study that reported DBS-evoked membrane depolarization that interfered with somatic action potentials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, this questions the DBS ’inhibition hypothesis’. 6) At therapeutic intensities (i.e., medium- and high-intensity DBS), only partially overlapping neuron populations were recruited. Taken together, we speculate that the therapeutic efficacy of IC-DBS in multiple psychiatric disorders (e.g., addiction, anorexia nervosa, and mood disorders)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> is associated with the aforementioned global effects of DBS. Thus, IC-DBS might modulate dysfunctional activity by exerting widespread effects recruiting neurons scattered throughout multiple frontal cortico-striatal circuits, without over-exciting neural tissue due to the maintained E/I balance. This rather non-specific recruitment of neurons and network nodes may reduce compulsivity as well as potentially alleviate symptoms associated with other psychiatric disorders.</p><p id="P15">The mOFC has been implicated in compulsive behavior in OCD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, and therapeutic IC-DBS alters mOFC activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and its projections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Consistently, we identified a number of regional effects of DBS in SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> that indicate an exceptional role for the mOFC in anti-compulsive effects of DBS: in comparison to all other recorded regions: 1) mOFC was predominantly recruited in SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup>, 2) recruited mOFC neurons were more likely to be excited by DBS than inhibited, and 3) DBS reduced the number of grooming-associated neurons specifically in mOFC. Our optogenetic experiments demonstrate that excitation of mOFC neurons (mimicking DBS effects), but not lOFC nor M2 neurons, reduced excessive grooming (similarly to DBS). Previous rodent studies have linked subregions of the OFC to compulsive-like behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Ahmari et al report that repeated photostimulation of mOFC terminals in striatum in WT induced long-term enhanced grooming (but not during stimulation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> and Burguière et al demonstrate that photostimulation of the lOFC and its striatal terminals reduced compulsive grooming in SAPAP3<sup>-/-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. However, in contrast to our work, these studies applied optogenetic stimulation for extended durations (five and three min, respectively) and the target subdomains of the OFC were different to ours. These subdomains are functionally heterogeneous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, which may explain the modest discrepancy in results. In addition, a recent study reports ketamine-induced changes in dorsomedial prefrontal-cortex projections to the striatum in SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup> and direct photostimulation of this pathway resulted in reduced grooming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. This suggests that different therapeutic interventions and targets might normalize behavior via distinct prefrontal-cortex sub-circuits, where our data outlines a specific role for mOFC neurons in the therapeutic effects of DBS in compulsive behavior.</p><p id="P16">Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanism of action of DBS. We identified a large number of DBS effects which may be relevant for OCD as well as other psychiatric disorders treated with IC-DBS. These findings pave the way for further investigations into which effects are associated with what type of therapeutic utility. Our mOFC findings could inspire further clinical exploration of mOFC activity as a readout for DBS parameter optimization in OCD and other compulsivity disorders, and eventually may be used as a biomarker for closed-loop DBS. Such a biomarker has the potential to significantly shorten DBS-parameter optimization periods and improve DBS efficacy overall.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Experimental animals</title><p id="P17">Male and female SAPAP3 mutant mice (SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>n</italic>=30) and their wild-type littermates (WT, <italic>n</italic>=28) were used for deep-brain stimulation (DBS) and imaging experiments, and Thy1-5.17 GCaMP6f mice (<italic>n</italic>=5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> for DBS and wide-field experiments.

We trained a Janelia Automatic Animal Behavior Annotator (JAABA) classifier to detect grooming in animals tethered to miniscopes. In short, animal behavior was video-taped and locomotion extracted using Bonsai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. Next, we extracted detailed frame-by-frame position information using the open-source software Mouse Tracker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>, which was fed as input to the JAABA classifier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. A human expert observer trained the JAABA grooming classifier on 39.090 frames (19.133 grooming frames and 19.957 not-grooming frames) from eight short videos of SAPAP3<sup>-/-</sup>, which provide sufficient amounts of grooming frames. 1/7 Folding cross-validation showed that the classifier was able to reliably detect grooming with 82.3% sensitivity and with 74% specificity. To improve accuracy, we introduced a minimum bout length of 10 frames and set a higher threshold of 0.5 to detect grooming (to reduce false positives). Together, this resulted in 87.2% sensitivity and 92.1% specificity to detect grooming events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 1a,b,c</xref>). Grooming data were binned into 1 s bins and transformed into percentages. To examine whether DBS and photostimulation affected grooming, we used paired t-tests to compare grooming during DBS with grooming before DBS application. In order to explore the relationship between reduction in grooming and DBS electrode location, we calculated relative change in grooming [(grooming during DBS / grooming before DBS) -100] and correlated that with averaged electrode locations in both hemispheres [AP coordinates * DV coordinates].</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Wide-field calcium-imaging analyses</title><p id="P31">Images were binned into 800x800 pixels and converted to a 16-bit format. Images were spatially downsampled by a factor of 2 and registered to the first frame of that session or to the previous session. Subsequently, data were motion corrected within a session by first computing the 2D cross-correlation between the first frame and the remaining frames. Next, frames were rigidly shifted to achieve maximum correlation and inspected manually. Next, we smoothed the data using a Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of two pixels. Per pixel, we calculated relative DF/F, where DF is the activity at a given time and F is the mean activity per trial at 9 to 8.5 s before DBS application. Frames were aligned to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework using Bregma, Lambda, and suture lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Regions were frontal cortex (FC), somatosensory cortex (SS), Visual cortex (VIS), and retrosplenial cortex (RSP). Pixels were averaged within these regions. Data were z-scored per region across the entire recording using the following formula: <disp-formula id="FD2"><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>÷</mml:mo><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where <italic>Z</italic> is the standard score DF/F, <italic>x</italic> is the observed value, <italic>μ</italic> is the mean of the region, and <italic>σ</italic> is the standard deviation of the region. Sustained DBS-induced suppression was examined by statistically comparing z-scored DF/F signals during DBS (last 30 s of the DBS period) across DBS parameters. In addition, to compare between regions, we applied post-hoc tests corrected for multiple comparisons (Tukey’s HSD). Finally, we averaged signals across all regions to explore dose-dependent responses across the entire cortex.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Miniscope calcium-imaging analyses: Preprocessing</title><p id="P32">Calcium-imaging videos were stored as uncompressed AVI files at a rate of 15 frames per s and binned per 1000 frames, and FIJI was used for raw-data inspection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>.

Concatenated TIFF files were motion corrected using NoRMCorre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup> and neuronal footprints and signals extracted using CNMF-E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. Data were spatially downsampled by a factor of 2 and we used the following CNMF-E parameters: gSig = 7, gSiz = 17, merge_thr = [1e-1, 0.85, 0], min_pnr = 7.4 (range 4 - 30), min_corr = 0.8 (range 0.8 - 0.95) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/w7qte/">https://osf.io/w7qte/</ext-link>). After footprint and signal extraction, we manually cleaned the data using a custom-written user interface that showed spatial footprints of region-of-interests (ROIs) and temporal traces per ROI, calculated distance and correlation between ROIs, and provided the options to delete or merge ROIs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/w7qte/">https://osf.io/w7qte/</ext-link>). ROIs with artificially small (~half the size of average ROI) or large (~twice the size of average ROI) spatial footprint were discarded as noise or background signal. ROIs with strong overlap (distance &lt;15 pixels, correlation &gt;0.8) were averaged and merged into a single ROIs. We generally used DF/F (C_raw), except for the isoflurane baseline-activity, and behavior-associated neuron analyses. For these analyses, we deconvolved each neuron’s DF/F using OASIS to get denoised traces, which were used to estimate calcium events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. Using the recorded time stamps, we aligned imaging data to DBS periods, as well as grooming periods. Data were z-scored per neuron across the entire recording session (see above for formula).

Neurons were classified as responders (recruited neurons) if signal during DBS significantly differed from the pre-DBS baseline signal (paired t-test across trials). For transient neurons, only the early DBS period differed from pre-DBS baseline. For sustained neurons, all three DBS periods differed from pre-DBS baseline.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Miniscope calcium-imaging analyses: Consistency of modulation</title><p id="P34">Single-cell recruitment by DBS varied in duration (transient or sustained) and direction (excited or inhibited) of activity. To examine whether DBS would recruit neurons likewise across stimulation parameters (e.g., 100, 200, and 300 μA), we calculated the consistency of recruitment: We defined consistency of modulation as “neurons in one cluster” divided by “total neurons in that cluster”. “Neurons in one cluster” were all the neurons in a given functional cluster that do not fall into another functional cluster across DBS intensities, and “total neurons in that cluster” were all neurons across DBS intensities that were identified as such (e.g., the number of transient excited neurons not found to be sustained excited, or transient or sustained inhibited across other stimulation parameters divided by the total number of transient excited neurons found during DBS). We compared to chance using bootstrapping: From all recorded neurons, we randomly selected the number of neurons as found in the actual data, calculated consistency of modulation, repeated this 1000 times, and calculated summary statistics to compare to the true data.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Miniscope calcium-imaging analyses: Overlap of neurons</title><p id="P35">We employed venn diagrams to express overlap of neuron populations. For two overlapping neuron populations, we employed conditional probability to assess the percentage of neurons recruited in condition B, given that they have been recruited in condition A (e.g., the percentage of neurons recruited by DBS under anesthesia, given they have been recruited by DBS in the awake state). Probability can be expressed using the following formula: <disp-formula id="FD3"><mml:math id="M3"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>P</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>B</mml:mtext><mml:mo>∣</mml:mo><mml:mtext>A</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>P</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>B</mml:mtext><mml:mo>∩</mml:mo><mml:mtext>A</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mtext>P</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>A</mml:mtext><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where P (B | A) are the neurons recruited in condition B, given that they have been recruited in condition A, P (B ∩ A) is the overlap of condition A and B, and P (A) are all neurons recruited in condition A. The overlap of neuron populations was compared to chance level using bootstrapping: From all DBS-recruited neurons across the DBS intensities, we randomly selected the number of neurons as found in each DBS intensity, calculated the overlap between intensities, repeated this 1000 times, and calculated summary statistics to compare to the true data.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Miniscope calcium-imaging analyses: Regional baseline activity</title><p id="P36">To test whether DBS induced changes in regional baseline activity, we combined the cumulative density function (CDF) of calcium events and the frequency of activity into a single cell-activity index. We used the size of the calcium events (as used by CDF) but averaged across neurons and binned into one-minute bins (as used to calculate frequency of activity). Per animal, all single-cell deconvolved calcium events were summed up and averaged across neurons to compute the mean number of events per animal during the “no-DBS” block and the high-intensity DBS block. We did this for all animals to compare activity between the “no-DBS” block and the high-intensity DBS block.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Miniscope calcium-imaging analyses: Clustering of recruited neurons</title><p id="P37">Miniscope imaging provides the spatial location of recorded neurons. To test whether DBS-recruited neurons would cluster (or maximally dispersed), we measured distance to the closest recruited neuron for each recruited neuron. Distance to the closest recruited neuron is important to avoid averaging out short (potential clusters) and long distances (potentially maximally dispersed), which would make the analysis unable to identify any spatial organization. To draw statistical conclusions about spatial modulation, we compared the true distance to chance level (bootstrap: from all recorded neurons, we randomly selected a subset equal to the number of DBS-recruited neurons, measured distance to the closest neuron, averaged over all neuron pairs, repeated this procedure 1000 times, and computed summary statistics to compare to the true closest distance). To validate this analysis method, we ran the analysis on simulated data and were able to identify different forms of clustering (single, multiple, and small clusters), a ring structure, maximally dispersed recruitment, and random recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Miniscope calcium-imaging analyses: Behavior-associated neurons</title><p id="P38">Grooming, locomotion (extracted from Bonsai tracking data), and deconvolved data (calcium events, “S”) were binned into 333-ms bins (5 bins) to improve estimates of the neurons’ activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. Per session, we forced periods of grooming to have no locomotion (set value to 0 in the locomotion vector). Remaining locomotion values were split by their median: All values below median were considered stationary and all values above locomotion. Per neuron, we ran a Bayesian ANOVA with three categories of behavior: grooming, stationary, or locomotion. If the ANOVA was significant and Bayes factor &gt; 3, we ran post-hoc tests, corrected for multiple comparisons (Tukey’s HSD), to compare activity during the three different behaviors.
