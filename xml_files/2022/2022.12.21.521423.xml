These specialized functions are thought to rely on features that distinguish the human brain from other species, in particular at the level of the cerebral cortex. Distinctive properties of the human cortex include an increased number of cortical neurons, an increased proportion of specific neuronal classes (such as cortical pyramidal neurons, (CPNs) populating the upper layers and the prefrontal areas), as well as increased numbers of synapses between cortical neurons, or cortico-cortical connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buckner and Krienen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Herculano-Houzel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Schmidt and Polleux, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sousa et al., 2017</xref>). These changes have been linked to the evolution of developmental mechanisms controlling the generation and specification of cortical neurons and circuits, which start to be unravelled by convergent work of human genomics, genetics and embryology, as well as pluripotent stem cell-based modelling (reviewed in (Bae et al., 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Libé-Philippot and Vanderhaeghen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sousa et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In addition to these global changes, the evolution of human brain circuits may also be linked to divergent features at the level of individual neurons, as described in other species (Roberts et al., 2022). Human CPNs have long been known to display distinctive morphological properties, including larger and more branched dendritic arbours (Sherwood et al., 2003) and increased numbers of synapses per neuron compared to all other primates (Sherwood et al., 2020). Moreover, recent work using electrophysiological recordings of live <italic>ex vivo</italic> human and non-human brain sections has uncovered functional properties of human CPNs that distinguish them from other species. These include specialized synaptic features leading to stronger synapses (Molnár et al., 2008, 2016), displaying higher levels of plasticity (Szegedi et al., 2016) or recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Testa-Silva et al., 2014</xref>). Some classes of human CPNs also display distinct biophysical and intrinsic properties, which have been linked to the unusually large size of their dendritic arbors, but also differences in membrane properties, including distinct distribution and density of ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Deitcher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Eyal et al., 2016</xref>; Geirsdottir et al., 2019; Gidon et al., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kalmbach et al., 2018, 2021</xref>; Schwarz et al., 2019).</p><p id="P6">These electrophysiological differences characterizing similar neuronal subtypes between species have been proposed to have significant consequences on neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Deitcher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Eyal et al., 2016</xref>; Geirsdottir et al., 2019; Gidon et al., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kalmbach et al., 2018, 2021</xref>; Schwarz et al., 2019) and circuit processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Itoh et al., 2022</xref>; Woodman et al., 2007). Interestingly, they could account for specialization of neuronal intrinsic excitability, which is indeed decreased in some classes of human CPNs compared with other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">2021</xref>). Excitability is a critical regulator of neuronal and circuit function, as it determines how neurons integrate external synaptic influences, or input, to generate specific action potential trains at the axonal level, or output. Input/output relationship can critically affect information processing and neural circuit plasticity, for instance through neuronal gain modulation, by which neurons adapt to changing inputs, through Hebbian or homeostatic mechanisms (Beck and Yaari, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Ferguson and Cardin, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The recently uncovered changes in neuronal intrinsic properties could thus contribute in an important fashion to the enhanced memory and information processing that characterize our species, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain essentially unknown.</p><p id="P8">At the cellular level, the input/output function is known to be modulated at the level of all neuronal compartments, from dendrites to soma and axon, and at the level of the axon initial segment (AIS), the specialized axonal compartment site of action potential generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Debanne et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, the size and location of the AIS, the density and modulation of ion channels concentrated at its level, such as voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC), are critical components of neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Grubb and Burrone, 2010</xref>; Kole et al., 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Leterrier, 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, while the changes of human CPNs have been so far essentially linked to synaptic and dendritic features, whether and how the AIS contributes to human neuron specialization remains unknown.</p><p id="P9">At the molecular level, the specialization of human cortical neurons could be driven by evolutionary changes in the gene regulatory networks underlying their identity (Lein et al., 2017; Tosches, 2021). Evolutionary novelties in human neurons could also emerge from new genes arising through recent gene duplication in the human lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dennis and Eichler, 2016</xref>). Some of these hominid-specific (HS) gene duplicates were previously identified as human-specific modifiers of human brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Libé-Philippot and Vanderhaeghen, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Here we focus on <italic>LRRC37B</italic>, a member of the HS family of Leucine Rich Repeat (LRR) orphan receptors <italic>LRRC37</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Giannuzzi et al., 2012</xref>). We find that LRRC37B protein is uniquely displayed at the level of the AIS in human CPNs. LRRC37B negatively regulates intrinsic excitability following overexpression in the mouse, and endogenous expression of LRRC37B in human CPNs controls neuronal excitability. Molecularly, LRRC37B acts as a co-receptor for FGF13A and SCN1B, and thereby inhibits the function of voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically at the AIS level. Our data identify a hominid-specific receptor and its interactors that regulate human neuronal properties in a human-specific fashion, thereby shedding light on the molecular mechanisms of human neuronal evolution.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>LRRC37</italic> gene family is selectively expressed in human cortical neurons</title><p id="P11">We previously identified &gt;30 HS genes expressed during human corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Suzuki et al., 2018</xref>), among which the <italic>LRRC37</italic> (Leucine-Rich Repeat-containing protein 37) gene family that encodes putative membrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Giannuzzi et al., 2012</xref>). LRRC37 receptors have no known function or ligands, but interestingly they belong to the larger structural group of Leucine-Rich Repeat (LRR) receptors, previously implicated in key aspects of neuronal development and connectivity (De Wit et al., 2011).</p><p id="P12">The number of <italic>LRRC37</italic> genes increased dramatically in simian species leading to many paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Giannuzzi et al., 2012</xref>). Among them, the chimpanzee and human genomes carry at least 4 protein-encoding genes, compared to 2 in the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Giannuzzi et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>LRRC37</italic> genes encode two types of proteins, A and B. Both A- and B-types are transmembrane proteins contain a Leucine-Rich Repeat (LRR) domain in the extracellular core, but the B-type carries an additional specific domain, hereafter referred to as LB domain, located near the N-terminal part of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>LRRC37B</italic> emerged in the simian genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Alignment of the amino acid sequences of <italic>LRRC37B-type</italic> genes found in primates revealed strong conservation between human and chimpanzee, especially at the level of the LB and LRR domains (96-100%). On the other hand the macaque <italic>LRRC37B</italic>-type gene (LRRC37-M2) only displays lower levels (63-80%) of homology, and its LRR domain contains only three LRR, instead of six in human and chimpanzee (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). The <italic>LRRC37B</italic> gene studied here thus appears to be present only in human and chimpanzee genomes. Finally and importantly, when examining copy-numbers (CN) of <italic>LRRC37</italic> human paralogs predicted to encode proteins using whole-genome sequencing read depth (Shen and Kidd, 2020), <italic>LRRC37A</italic> and <italic>LRRC37A2</italic> exhibit polymorphism (diploid CN between 0 and 5) while in contrast <italic>LRRC37A3</italic> and <italic>LRRC37B</italic> are near fixed (diploid CN = 2) across thousands of diverse humans from the 1000 Genomes Project (Auton et al., 2015) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Inspection of bulk RNAseq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cardoso-Moreira et al., 2019</xref>) and quantifying expression using an approach sensitive to duplication genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Suzuki et al., 2018</xref>) revealed that all <italic>LRRC37</italic> paralogs are robustly expressed in the human and macaque developing and adult cerebral cortex, while no <italic>LRRC37</italic> transcripts are detected in the mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Human <italic>LRRC37B</italic> is expressed at higher levels at the RNA level than the <italic>LRRC37B-type</italic> gene in macaque cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) in line with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Giannuzzi et al., 2012</xref>). Inspection of scRNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Velmeshev et al., 2019</xref>) revealed that <italic>LRRC37</italic> genes are expressed in most classes of CPNs and interneurons, but only in a subset of neurons in each subclass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C-D</xref>). The proportion of LRRC37B-positive CPNs is very low at birth, and then gradually increases during the first two decades of life to reach a plateau, variable for each subclass, in the adult human cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>LRRC37B is displayed at the axon initial segment of human cortical pyramidal neurons</title><p id="P14">We next focused on LRRC37B, as it constitutes the most recent genomic event in the hominid lineage, and its copy number appears to be nearly fixed in the human population, suggesting conservation and functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). We first examined LRRC37B at the protein level, using a specific antibody raised against the LB domain. This antibody recognizes LRRC37B-type proteins encoded in human, chimpanzee and macaque, but not the LRRC37A-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E-F</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Using this antibody, we confirmed that LRRC37B can be targeted to the cellular membrane with the expected topology in heterologously transfected HEK-293T cells, using immunostaining before permeabilization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). We next examined the pattern of endogenous LRRC37B expression in the adult human cerebral cortex. Remarkably, this revealed that LRRC37B is mostly localized at the level of the axon initial segment (AIS, marked with ankyrin-G) in a subset (&gt;50%) of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The AIS subcellular compartment is the main site of generation of action potentials (AP) through the opening of VGSC alpha subunits (NAVα) concentrated at this location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Leterrier, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, similar immunostaining on adult cerebral cortex of mouse, macaque and chimpanzee with the same antibody failed to reveal any detectable expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). Time-course analysis at several stages from early postnatal ages to &gt;60 years old human specimens, revealed that the proportion of neurons displaying LRRC37B at the AIS sharply increased from birth until childhood to stabilize at puberty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), in good concordance with the RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Overall these data identify LRRC37B as a novel LRR membrane-anchored protein selectively expressed at the AIS of human cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>LRRC37B negatively regulates cortical pyramidal neuron excitability</title><p id="P17">In order to probe the function of LRRC37B, we next performed sparse gain-of-function in mouse pyramidal neurons through sparse in utero electroporation in the cortex (at embryonic day 15.5, thereby targeting mostly cortical layer 2-3 pyramidal neurons). We thereby electroporated vectors leading to a cre-dependent bicistronic expression of LRRC37B and EGFP, or EGFP alone as a control, followed by analysis at P28 (see Methods). We found that the LRRC37B protein was enriched at the AIS, as in human neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>), while control neurons displayed no LRRC37B immunoreactivity, as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). Notably we detected no differences in the AIS length and localization in LRRC37B-expressing neurons, compared with control neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B-C</xref>). Interestingly, ectopic expression of the more ancestral gene LRRC37A2 did not reveal a selective localization at the AIS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>), further pointing to novel properties of the <italic>LRRC37B</italic> paralog.</p><p id="P18">Given the prominent role of the AIS in controlling neuronal excitability, we next compared the electrophysiological properties of control and LRRC37B-expressing mouse cortical CPNs, using patch-clamp recordings in <italic>ex vivo</italic> cortical slices of electroporated mice at P24-P32. Remarkably, <italic>LRRC37B</italic> gain-of-function led to a sharp decrease in neuronal excitability, characterized by a lower AP firing rate and a higher rheobase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>), while sodium currents remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F</xref>). It also led to a decreased input resistance and an increased capacitance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>), which could in principle account for changes in the firing rates. However, LRRC37B-expressing neurons also displayed specific changes in two critical features of AP, risetime and width, pointing to changes in intrinsic excitability of the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). This was confirmed by phase plot analyses of single AP, which revealed that LRRC37B-expressing neurons display a decrease in the AIS compartment of the AP generation (-27.7%), while the somatic compartment remained largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Phase plots also revealed a decrease in the repolarization phase that occurs after the peak of the AP in LRRC37B-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We next examined the synaptic properties of LRRC37B-expressing neurons using whole-cell voltage clamp recordings, which revealed no obvious difference in frequency or amplitude of spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents compared with control-electroporated neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2G</xref>). As the AIS is the synaptic target of chandelier GABAergic interneurons that thereby regulate CPN output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Gallo et al., 2020</xref>), we quantified GABAergic synapses at the level of the AIS.

We first performed an ELISA-based unbiased interactome screen (Ozgul et al., 2019; Ranaivoson et al., 2019). For this approach, we used as a bait the predicted extracellular sequence of LRRC37B (LRRC37B_ECTO) fused with alkaline phosphatase (AP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Apóstolo et al., 2020</xref>). Using LRRC37B_ECTO-AP immobilized in each well of 384-well plates, 920 transmembrane or secreted proteins (including 23 proteins enriched at the AIS or in chandelier interneurons, see Methods), fused to an Fc domain, were used as preys. The screen led to a single reproducible hit from three independent experiments: FGF13 isoform 1 (hereafter named FGF13A) (uniprot ID: Q92913-1). This result came first as a surprise, as FGF13 was previously described as a member of the FHF non-canonical FGF family, thought to encode non-secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Dover et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Smallwood et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).

We tested this using heterologous expression in HEK cells of all major FGF13 isoforms, followed by analysis of cell lysates vs. medium.

Finally, and importantly, similar binding results were obtained with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the first exon of FGF13A (ExonS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that the ExonS-encoded domain alone is sufficient to bind to LRRC37B.</p><p id="P24">Collectively these data indicate that FGF13A is an extracellular ligand of LRRC37B, to which it binds to through its isoform-specific N-terminal domain.</p><p id="P25">In order to identify the domains of LRRC37B receptor responsible for the interaction with FGF13A, we generated a series of LRRC37B constructs containing deletions in the extracellular domain of LRRC37B, fused at the N-terminal with the prolactin leader peptide and an HA tag, and at the C-terminal with the transmembrane domain of PDGF-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). We performed immunoprecipitations of the different LRRC37B deletion mutants transfected in HEK-293T cells, following application of FGF13A to the culture medium. This revealed that the LRR domain (amino acids 468 – 841) is necessary and sufficient to bind to FGF13A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Similar co-immunoprecipitations were observed following co-transfection of LRRC37B and FGF13A cDNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). We also compared the molecular properties of human LRRC37B with macaque and chimpanzee LRRC37B proteins.

Similarly, human LRRC37A2, which displays an LRR domain very similar to LRRC37B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>), could bind to FGF13A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). To assess the specificity of the interaction between LRRC37 proteins and FGF13A, we performed the same approach with the extracellular domains of other membrane receptors, including several LRR receptors (GPR158, SLITRK2, LRRTM1 and CD4). None of them co-immunoprecipitated FGF13A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Collectively these data indicate that LRRC37B binds to FGF13A through its LRR domain. To estimate the affinity of the interaction between FGF13A and LRRC37B, we performed binding assays using a biotin-labelled FGF13A-ExonS-peptide and HEK-293T cells expressing LRRC37B and deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). This revealed an apparent high affinity specific binding of FGF13A-ExonS-peptide to the extracellular domain of LRRC37B (Kd:2.291+/- 1.038 nM) and to the LRR domain alone (Kd:1.181 +/- 0.718nM), while no binding was detected with LRRC37B mutant devoid of its LRR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p id="P27">FGF13 was previously reported to modulate the function of VGSC NAVα subunits, but through binding of its core domain to an intracellular domain of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Barbosa et al., 2017</xref>; Goetz et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; Wittmack et al., 2004). Given our data above, we hypothesized that FGF13A could potentially bind to NAV channels extracellularly. We first tested whether FGF13A and its ExonS could bind to NAV channel alpha subunit NAV1.6, a major NAV alpha subunit that initiates AP at the AIS of pyramidal neurons (Hu et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Leterrier, 2016</xref>; Lorincz and Nusser, 2008). Strikingly, we found that FGF13A, or its ExonS only, when applied in the medium of HEK cells transfected for NAV1.6, could be immunoprecipitated with NAV1.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). We next tested the relevance of these observations to LRRC37B by co-transfecting the three proteins in HEK-293T cells.

This revealed that LRRC37B co-localizes with NAV1.6 and FGF13A at the AIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, following LRRC37B transfection, FGF13A was found to be significantly more abundant at the AIS, in distinct patches, co-localized with LRRC37B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Together, these observations indicate that LRRC37B colocalizes with FGF13A and NAV1.6 at the AIS, and concentrates FGF13A at the AIS in vivo.</p><p id="P31">We next tested whether and how FGF13A may affect the physiology of the neurons.

This revealed a dose-dependent effect of FGF13A on neuronal excitability at 10-50 nM, leading to decreased AP firing rate, increased rheobase, increased AP risetime and width, thus strikingly mimicking the effects of LRRC37B gain of function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4A-D</xref>). Notably, FGF13A addition had no effect on membrane resistance and capacitance. Phase plot analyses of single AP revealed that FGF13A extracellular application led to a decrease in the AIS compartment (-17.8%) and repolarization phase, as observed following LRRC37B gain of function. Interestingly, it also led to a decrease in the soma compartment (-9.4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>) and to a global decrease in sodium currents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4E</xref>), two effects not seen following LRRC37B overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Collectively these data indicate that FGF13A alone can affect AP generation also at the soma, beyond the AIS, while the effects of LRRC37B overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) are restricted to the AIS level.

Several membrane proteins of the AIS were detected at low levels, including the NAV channel alpha subunit SCN1A, confirming our data, but also the regulatory NAV beta subunit SCN1B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A</xref>). AIS proteins are resistant to detergents, which makes their extraction and identification challenging (Hamdan et al., 2020), hence the general low number of spectral counts.</p><p id="P35">Beta-subunits can directly bind to and positively regulate the trafficking and function of NAV channels, and are thereby critically involved in neuronal excitability and epilepsy (Namadurai et al., 2015).

We next tested for the interaction of SNC1B with several LRRC37B deletion mutants. We found that the LB domain (amino acids 133-186 of LRRC37B), present only in LRRC37B and not in other LRRC37 paralogs, was necessary to mediate the binding between LRRC37B and SCN1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-B</xref>). Consistent with the importance of the LB domain for SCN1B interaction, we detected no interaction between SCN1B and LRRC37A receptors that lack this domain, while macaque and chimpanzee LRRC37B receptors both displayed binding to SCN1B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6B</xref>).

Given the known positive impact of SCN1B on NAV function (Namadurai et al., 2015), the ability of LRRC37B to compete for binding to NAV1.6 could lead to inhibitory influence on NAV function. On the other hand, as SCN1B promotes the targeting of NAVs to the AIS (O'Malley and Isom, 2015), the binding of SCN1B to LRRC37B could enable similarly the targeting of LRRC37B to the AIS, consistent with our observations that LRRC37A2, which lacks the B-domain and therefore does not bind to SCN1B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6B</xref>), is not targeted to the AIS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>LRRC37B regulates human cortical pyramidal neuron excitability</title><p id="P37">Could LRRC37B interactions with NAV1.6 regulators FGF13A and SCN1B be relevant in the human cerebral cortex?</p><p id="P38">By examining scRNAseq databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>) we found that FGF13, SCN1B and SCN8A (NAV1.6) and LRRC37B, are co-expressed in most types of human cortical neurons, with FGF13A expressed at higher levels in interneurons, and LRRC37B/SCN1B in pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A</xref>).

Interestingly, SCN1B was previously shown to interact with other transmembrane or extracellular proteins at the AIS (McEwen and Isom, 2004; Xiao et al., 1999) with potential impact on NAV channel function (Xiao et al., 1999). On the other hand, SCN1B promotes the targeting of NAV alpha subunits to the AIS (O’Malley and Isom, 2015), suggesting that it could similarly contribute to the specific AIS targeting of LRRC37B.

Another intriguing question that remains to address concerns the mechanisms that underlie the species-specific localization of LRRC37B at the AIS of human neurons, and whether this constitutes a uniquely human specialization. Indeed while LRRC37B proteins could not be detected in chimpanzee neurons in the samples that we probed, it remains to be determined whether it is expressed at other stages, ages or brain areas.</p><p id="P50">We identify FGF13A as an extracellular ligand for LRRC37B and NAV1.6. This is unexpected since FHF non-canonical FGFs (FGF11-13) were reported to encode non-secreted proteins, based on the absence of a predicted signal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Smallwood et al., 1996</xref>). Notably however, proteins lacking N-terminal signal peptides, among them FGF2, can still be secreted trough non-canonical mechanisms (Rabouille, 2017). Inhibitory effects of intracellular FGF13A on NAVα subunits were suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abrams et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Barbosa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Dover et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Effraim et al., 2019</xref>, 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Yang et al., 2016</xref>).

Our data thus indicate that FGF13A acts mostly extracellularly to decrease neuronal excitability, while not excluding that other isoforms of FGF13 or its core domain could act intracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Barbosa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Effraim et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P51">FGF13-like genes are found in all metazoans and are the ancestors of all vertebrate FGF proteins (Itoh and Ornitz, 2008).

FGF13 has been found at the level of the AIS of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus (Pablo et al., 2016) and we find it similarly located in cortical CPNs, suggesting that the regulation by FGF13A could be autocrine, at least in part. Interestingly, <italic>FGF13</italic> is also expressed in chandelier interneurons (ChC), which are key regulators of CPN excitability through their axo-axonic inhibitory synapses targeting the AIS of CPNs (Favuzzi et al., 2019). FGF13A could thus be secreted by ChC and thereby modulate NAV channel activity, and this interaction could be enhanced by the presence of LRRC37B at the AIS. Moreover and interestingly, <italic>FGF13</italic> was previously found to be necessary for the level of innervation of the AIS of mouse CPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Favuzzi et al., 2019</xref>). While we did not detect any effect of LRRC37B on the patterns of inhibitory innervation of the AIS, it will be interesting to determine whether LRRC37B and FGF13A modulate other aspects of CPN-ChC interactions. From scRNAseq data, LRRC37B is also expressed in all classes of interneurons, although at lower levels than in CPNs, and could also act there to modulate neuronal excitability, in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. Finally, an intriguing finding is that LRRC37B is expressed in only in a subset of all cortical neuron subtypes, independently of their identity. This suggests that the levels of expression of this receptor could depend on cell context and state, such as the levels of neuronal activity, which will be important to explore.</p><p id="P53">The discovery of LRRC37B as a co-receptor for FGF13A and SCN1B regulating NAV channels at the AIS has potentially important implications for brain diseases, in particular epilepsy.

In this respect our finding that the copy number of LRRC37B is nearly fixed in the normal human population strongly suggests its importance for normal human physiology. While no evidence for germ-line mutations can be found in databases, the possibility of somatic mutations (Zhang and Vijg, 2018) is an interesting possibility that remains to be explored.</p><p id="P54">On the other hand, given its strong impact on neuronal intrinsic properties, LRRC37B is likely to play important roles during normal cortical circuit function. The potential consequences of human-specific changes in neuronal properties on circuit function remain poorly known, but the identification of LRRC37B as a human-specific modulator of neuronal excitability opens new avenues to study this experimentally. LRRC37B could affect information processing through neuronal gain modulation, by which neurons adapt to changing inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Ferguson and Cardin, 2020</xref>) or amount of information transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Testa-Silva et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, while neuronal gain modulation relies largely on the regulation of synaptic inputs, it can also be modified by output modulation, including at the level of the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Debanne et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, neuronal plasticity and learning involve modulation of the neuronal gain including the output site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Ferguson and Cardin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Jamann et al., 2021</xref>). The modulation of excitability by LRRC37B could thus influence neuronal information processing and plasticity, at least in part through gain modulation and amount of information transfer, and thereby contribute to human-specific properties of cortical circuits.</p><p id="P55">While LRRC37B is likely to be unique among LRRC37 receptors for its ability to bind to SCN1B, as it is mediated by the LB domain found only in this LRRC37 paralog, other LRRC37A-type receptors are also expressed in cortical neurons and have the ability to bind FGF13A. It will be interesting to test their function, which could involve modulation of different types of voltage-gated ion channels at other subcellular compartments, such as cell body and dendrites. Similarly, it will be important to test whether and how <italic>LRRC37B,</italic> as well as other members of the <italic>LRRC37</italic> family, are expressed in other brain areas and tissues, where they may act as human-specific modifiers of neuronal excitability or other cellular features selected throughout recent evolution. For instance, LRRC37A2 was recently found to interact with alpha-synuclein in astrocytes (Bowles et al., 2022).</p><p id="P56">Several HS gene duplicates were linked previously to the control of corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Charrier et al., 2012</xref>; Fiddes et al., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Florio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Van Heurck et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Schmidt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Suzuki et al., 2018</xref>), but so far none have been linked to specific functional features of human neurons. While <italic>LRRC37B</italic> is the first example of a gene duplicated controlling adult human neuron function, another set of human-specific genes, <italic>SRGAP2B/C,</italic> were found to control the development of cortical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Charrier et al., 2012</xref>). A mouse model displaying expression of <italic>SRGAP2C</italic> in pyramidal neurons leads to hyper-connectivity of the mouse neurons and as a result enhanced processing ability and improved behavioural performance of the transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Schmidt et al., 2021</xref>). It will be interesting to test whether and how the emergence of <italic>LRRC37</italic> and <italic>SRGAP2</italic> genes evolved together or separately to control excitability and connectivity of human cortical neurons.</p><p id="P57">In conclusion we identified a new molecular pathway regulating membrane excitability at the level of the AIS in human cortical neurons, targeting the highly conserved NAVs, but modulated in a species-specific and multimodal fashion by LRRC37B and its interactors. These data provide unexpected molecular links between the subcellular regulation of neuronal excitability and human brain evolution, with important implications for our understanding of human brain function, and diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>STAR Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="S13"><title>Human tissue collection and preparation</title><p id="P58">The study on research involving human subjects was approved by the Ethics Committee Research of University Hospitals Leuven (UZ Leuven) (reference S61186).

Afterward, slices were transferred to 32 °C cutting solution for 45 min to recover and finally maintained at room temperature until used for recordings.</p><p id="P90">Human cortical samples were collected at the time of surgery, immerged in ice-cold ACSF (NaCl 126 mM, NaHCO3 26mM, D-glucose 10mM, MgSO4 6mM, KCL 3mM, CaCl2 1mM, NaH2PO4 1mM, 295-305mM, pH adjusted to 7.4, with 5% CO2/95% O2) and transferred immediately into the laboratory, with processing (slicing for electrophysiology or protein extraction) in an interval of 5-10 minutes. Slicing solution contained choline chloride 110mM, NaHCO3 26mM, Na-ascorbate 11.6 mM, D-glucose 10mM, MgCl2 7mM, Na-pyruvate 3.1 mM, KCl 2.5 mM, NaH2PO4 1.25mM, CaCl2 0.5 mM; 300–315 mOsm, pH adjusted to 7.4, with 5% CO2/95% O2 and was ice-cold. Recovery solution was the same than the ACSF used for the transfer from hospital. Slicing was performed with a vibrating blade microtome or using a comprestome, and 300-μm slices were incubated for around 30 min at 32 °C in ACSF. Slices were then stored at around 20 °C until use for electrophysiological recordings.</p><p id="P91">For recordings, mouse and human brain slices were continuously perfused (32-34°C) in a submerged chamber (Warner Instruments) at a rate of 3–4ml/min with (in mM): 127 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 glucose at pH 7.4 with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub>. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were done using borosilicate glass recording pipettes (resistance 3.5–5 MΩ, Sutter P-1000), using a double EPC-10 amplifier under control of Patchmaster v2 x 32 software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). The following internal medium was used (in mM): 135 K-Gluconate, 4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>-GTP, 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phospocreatine, 3 biocytin (pH 7.3). Cell intrinsic properties were recorded in current clamp, while sEPSCs and sIPSCs were recorded in voltage clamp at -70 mV and 0 mV, respectively. Currents were recorded at 20 Hz and low-pass filtered at 3 kHz when stored. The series resistance was compensated to 75-85%. Cell intrinsic properties were analyzed using Fitmaster (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany), spontaneous input was analyzed using Mini Analysis program (Synaptosoft). For protein/peptide bath application experiments we used consecutive repeats of recordings (control followed by recordings 3 to 16 minutes after application), 10 minutes application is plotted.</p><p id="P92">For initial intracellular application experiments, 50 nM FGF13A were added to the intracellular pipette solution and standard approach procedures were used. Next, to minimize FGF13A exposure of the slice, a fluorescent dye was added to the intracellular medium (Alexa568, 5 μΜ) to visually regulate minimal outflow of intracellular solution from the pipette during the approach and cell-attached phase of recordings. In both experiments (no application versus application), recordings were started 3 minutes after establishing whole-cell configuration, to allow infusion of FGF13A into the cell.</p><p id="P93">Phase plot analysis compares the rate of change (first derivative) in voltage during APs (y-axis) to the membrane voltage (x-axis). The first current step (1 sec) to initiate AP(s) was used for phase plot analysis. The AIS, somatic and repolarization voltages were determined as the absolute membrane potential measured at the respective peaks.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Elisa assay</title><p id="P94">An ELISA-based assay (Ozgul et al., 2019) was used to identify the interaction between ectodomain (as defined in the Uniprot database) of 920 cell surface or secreted proteins cloned in frame with an Fc domain against LRRC37B-ECTO-AP fusion as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Apóstolo et al., 2020</xref>).

LRRC37B (aa 28-905, containing the entire ectodomain) ecto-FC protein was produced by transient transfection of HEK293T cells using PEI (Polysciences). Six hours after transfection, media was changed to OptiMEM (Invitrogen) and harvested 5 days later. Conditioned media was centrifuged, sterile-filtered and run over a fast-flow Protein-G agarose (Thermo-Fisher) column. After extensive washing with wash buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl and protease inhibitors), the column was eluted with Pierce elution buffer. Eluted fractions containing proteins were pooled and dialyzed with PBS using a Slide-A-Lyzer (Pierce) and concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal units (Millipore).
