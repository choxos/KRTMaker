Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are a central component of self-related navigation but whether they also track others’ movement is unclear. Here, we propose that entorhinal grid-like codes make an essential contribution to socio-spatial navigation. Sixty human participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while observing and re-tracing different paths of a demonstrator that navigated a virtual reality environment. Results revealed that grid-like codes in the entorhinal cortex tracked the other individual navigating through space. Further, the activity of grid-like codes was time-locked to increases in co-activation and entorhinal-cortical connectivity that included the striatum, the hippocampus, parahippocampal and right posterior parietal cortices, altogether modulated by accuracy when subsequently re-tracing the paths. This suggests that network dynamics time-locked to entorhinal grid-cell-related activity might serve to distribute information about the ‘socio-spatial map’ throughout the brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Grid cells</kwd><kwd>entorhinal cortex</kwd><kwd>socio-spatial navigation</kwd><kwd>brain networks</kwd><kwd>functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Maneuvering a crowded sidewalk or coordinating with one’s team members to move towards the goal on a soccer field not only requires the planning of one’s own movement through space, but depends upon the ability to track the location of conspecifics. Such socio-spatial navigation was recently tied to neuronal processes similar to self-related spatial navigation. For instance, work using intracranial recordings from the human medial temporal lobe revealed representations that coded for environmental boundaries when participants or others moved through space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Stangl et al., 2021</xref>), and hippocampal social place cells were found to code for the location of others in bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Omer et al., 2018</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Danjo et al., 2018</xref>). A central component of navigation is the integrity of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex that express periodic firing fields arranged along the vertices of regular hexagons, tessellating the environment and providing a spatial map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Jacobs et al., 2013</xref>). In humans, it has been shown that the neural firing signature of grid cell populations can be measured non-invasively using fMRI, in the form of so-called “grid-like codes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Doeller et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, these grid-like codes were shown to support spatial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Doeller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Stangl et al., 2018</xref>) as well as mental self-related navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bellmund et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Horner et al., 2016</xref>), but whether they also track others’ movement through space is unclear. Here, we propose that entorhinal grid cells (and related grid-like codes) make an essential contribution to socio-spatial navigation in humans.</p><p id="P3">Similar to the joint actions of different spatial cell types such as place and grid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bush et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fyhn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Moser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), flexible navigation relies on the orchestration of a set of regions including medial temporal, posterior-medial, parietal, striatal and prefrontal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chersi and Burgess, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ekstrom et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Epstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Maguire et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Patai and Spiers, 2021</xref>). Beyond the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit, the parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortices are regarded as key players involved in the visuospatial processing of scenes and their orientation in the broader spatial environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Epstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Maguire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Vann et al., 2009</xref>). The retrosplenial cortex specifically was proposed to translate information between allocentric (as supported by the hippocampus; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Danjo, 2020</xref>) and egocentric reference frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ekstrom et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Epstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Vann et al., 2009</xref>), interacting with the (right) posterior parietal cortex to guide the visuospatial coordination of locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ciaramelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">McNaughton et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Whitlock et al., 2008</xref>) and the coding of spatial routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Nitz, 2006</xref>). Similar aspects of navigation such as goal-directed behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chersi and Burgess, 2015</xref>) and route following (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hartley et al., 2003</xref>) were linked to dorsal striatal processes. Presumably, the dorsal striatum contributes to navigation via associative reinforcement and thus functions in parallel to the hippocampal system that rapidly encodes new experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chersi and Burgess, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Doeller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Iaria et al., 2003</xref>). Interactions between these two systems appear mediated by the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Doeller et al., 2008</xref>), which also regulates the top-down control of navigation via planning and goal tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Patai and Spiers, 2021</xref>). Since socio-spatial navigation also involves tracing others’ movement through space, it likely engages additional brain regions concerned with biological motion processing, such as the posterior superior temporal sulcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Herrington et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Sokolov et al., 2018</xref>). Altogether, this suggests a complex interplay of multiple brain regions, but it remains elusive how they interact with the putative “spatial map” hosted by entorhinal grid cells. We thus asked whether the activity of entorhinal grid-like codes is coupled to functional connectivity changes with medial temporal, parietal, striatal, and prefrontal areas and whether such network dynamics may explain differences in navigation performance.</p><p id="P4">To tackle these questions, we built upon the design of previous animal work that investigated social place cells in bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Omer et al., 2018</xref>) and translated it into the human context. Sixty healthy participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our modified navigation task projected them into a first-person perspective within a virtual reality (VR) environment while they were asked to observe different paths of a demonstrator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1AB</xref>). The paths had to be held in memory and needed to be re-traced after a short delay. Crucially, participants were positioned at a fixed viewpoint during observation, allowing us to dissociate potential grid-like codes between other- and self-related movements. Behavioral performance was quantified as cumulative distance error in virtual meters (vm) indicating the deviation from the demonstrator’s paths. We reasoned that if underlying grid cells supported the tracking of others, we should observe increased grid-like codes in the entorhinal cortex during observation of the demonstrator moving through VR-space. Furthermore, we expected entorhinal grid-like codes to be dovetailed by entorhinal-cortical connectivity changes with regions typically involved in spatial navigation and visuospatial processing, altogether modulated by behavioral performance.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Participants are successfully able to re-trace the demonstrator’s paths</title><p id="P5">Participants completed a single MRI session that started out with an initial task familiarization period, followed by four runs of the modified navigation task, each involving different paths. Across the four task runs, participants reached an average cumulative distance error of 17.57 ± 0.54 vm (mean ± standard error of the mean, s.e.m.; calculated as the average distance between the demonstrator’s and the participant’s endpoints across the three different segments of a given path, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), significantly below the threshold of 20 vm which determined the feedback that participants received [i.e., happy emoji, cumulative distance error =&lt; 20 vm; sad emoji, cumulative distance error &gt; 20 vm; one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>N</italic> = 58 (2 participants were excluded from this and all following analyses, <bold>Materials and Methods</bold>); <italic>t</italic>(57) = - 4.49, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = -0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [16.5, 18.7], <italic>p</italic><sub>two-tailed</sub> &lt; 0.0001]. Performance was stable throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), showing that participants were successfully able to re-trace the demonstrator’s paths, and providing us with a solid basis for investigating grid-like codes during both observation and navigation.</p><p id="P6">We next took a closer look at navigation performance on individual segments of a given path (each path consisted of three segments). We found that across-run performance was significantly better when participants re-traced the first path segment (6.86 ± 0.16 vm) compared to the second (23.3 ± 0.32 vm) or third (22.64 ± 0.37 vm; as indicated by the path segment-wise distance error; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). This pattern was evident in each of the four runs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>) and was likely due to the fact that the observer’s viewpoint was directly fixed behind the demonstrator’s starting position at the beginning of each trial.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Observation is associated with increased activation in the hippocampus and striatum</title><p id="P7">We then turned towards the fMRI data and started out by investigating changes in brain activation when participants tracked and re-traced the paths of others, irrespective of potential grid-like codes. We hypothesized largely overlapping activation profiles during both observation and navigation periods, involving regions typically engaged in spatial navigation and visuospatial processing, such as medial temporal, posterior-medial, parietal, striatal, and prefrontal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chersi and Burgess, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ekstrom et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Epstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Maguire et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Patai and Spiers, 2021</xref>). Additionally, we expected that observation of the demonstrator’s paths would be associated with increased activation in brain areas associated with biological motion processing, including the posterior superior temporal sulcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Herrington et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Sokolov et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P8">While participants observed the demonstrator’s paths, a set of regions showed increased activation, including a large cluster centered on the bilateral hippocampus and adjacent structures of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), extending towards the anterior temporal pole, the caudate nucleus, pre- and post-central gyri, as well as the ventromedial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices (one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>N</italic> = 58, contrast observation &gt; navigation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).

Activation was also increased in the bilateral caudate nucleus and putamen, the insula, as well as the adjacent inferior prefrontal cortex. Notably, the general effect of navigation (contrast navigation &gt; baseline) was also associated with increased activation in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2, Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Altogether, observing the demonstrator’s paths rather than re-tracing them was associated with stronger brain activity in a set of regions that included the hippocampus and adjacent MTL structures, the striatum, anterior and posterior midline regions, as well as superior and inferior temporal areas.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Increased activation in the right posterior parietal cortex during observation is associated with better performance</title><p id="P11">To investigate whether brain activation during observation and navigation scaled with individual performance, we went on to test the cross-participant relationship between whole-brain activity during observation/navigation periods and the average cumulative distance error when re-tracing the demonstrator’s paths. Results showed an activation increase within the right posterior parietal cortex (<italic>x</italic> = 44, <italic>y</italic> = -78, <italic>z</italic> = 24, <italic>z</italic>-value = 4.68, 297 voxels) during observation that negatively correlated with the individual cumulative distance error [linear regression, <italic>N</italic> = 58, contrast observation &gt; baseline, cumulative distance error added as a covariate of interest; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 family-wise-error (FWE) corrected at cluster level using a cluster-defining threshold of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, cluster size = 80 voxels; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>]. In other words, stronger activation in this region was coupled to better subsequent performance as participants observed the demonstrator’s paths (and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Results S1</xref> for additional analysis). We did not find a significant relationship between behavioral performance and brain activation during navigation periods.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Entorhinal grid-like codes when observing the demonstrator’s paths</title><p id="P12">Central to our analyses was the question whether grid-like codes supported the tracking of others. We were motivated by findings of place cells in animals that were recently shown to signal the location of conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Danjo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Omer et al., 2018</xref>), as well as by previous work probing entorhinal grid cell activity (or grid-like codes) during spatial (and mental) self-navigation in both animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bellmund et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Doeller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Horner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Stangl et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, we expected to find a significant hexadirectional modulation (i.e., a 6-fold periodicity) of the fMRI signal in the entorhinal cortex during observation and possibly also during navigation periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To test this, we split the fMRI data of each task run into independent sets and estimated/tested individual grid orientations using a 12-fold cross-validation regime (for a detailed description, please see <bold>Materials and Methods</bold>). We used 11 trials (each trial included one observation and navigation period) to estimate individual grid orientations based on the demonstrator’s (or the participant’s) movement trajectories through VR-space using a General Linear Model (GLM1; note that grid orientations were estimated separately for observation and navigation periods). The grid orientations’ fit was then tested on the path segments of the remaining trial, which served to quantify the magnitude of grid-like codes in the left-out data set (GLM2). This procedure was repeated for each cross-validation fold and the resulting grid magnitudes were averaged across the different iterations. Note that grid analyses were based on a reduced participant sample (entorhinal cortex: automatic segmentation, <italic>N</italic> = 49; manual segmentation, <italic>N</italic> = 51; control regions: <italic>N</italic> = 58; <bold>Materials and Methods</bold>).</p><p id="P14">We found significant grid-like codes in the entorhinal cortex as participants were observing the demonstrator’s paths.

To circumvent this issue, we designed our task such that each segment of an individual path was oriented along one of 36 directions that could be divided into 6 directional bins, spanning the 360°-VR-space with 10° angular resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Doeller et al., 2010</xref>).

Our key findings advance current knowledge in several ways: We found that entorhinal grid-like codes supported the tracking of another individual’s movement through space. Crucially, these signals were decoupled from self-movement as participants’ viewpoint remained stationary while observing the demonstrator. Fluctuations in grid magnitudes were associated with the co-activation of striatal regions during observation and these results appeared stronger the less accurate participants performed when subsequently re-tracing the demonstrator’s paths. This profile of co-activation was paralleled by entorhinal connectivity increases with the striatum and the hippocampus, parahippocampal, right posterior parietal and lateral prefrontal cortices when participants observed the demonstrator walking aligned with their internal grid orientations, and this pattern was again more pronounced the worse participants performed. These findings are thus the first to demonstrate that grid-like signaling in the human entorhinal cortex is related to the spatial tracking of others, that this is linked to network dynamics, and modulated by individual task performance.</p><p id="P33">The main goal of our research was to probe whether grid-like codes in the entorhinal cortex supported the tracking of others, potentially yielding insights into human socio-spatial navigation. Confirming our hypothesis, results showed a significant increase in grid magnitudes (a proxy for putative grid-cell-related activity) while participants were observing the demonstrator’s paths from a stationary viewpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). This was specific to hexadirectional coding (i.e., a 6-fold, grid-like modulation of the fMRI signal), specific to the entorhinal cortex where grid cells were previously detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>), and specific to spatial information rather than being driven by eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Julian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Killian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Nau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Staudigl et al., 2018</xref>). Several recent findings suggest that socio-spatial navigation relies on neuronal substrates similar to those that process self-related spatial navigation. For instance, Stangl and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Stangl et al., 2021</xref>) used intracranial recordings from the human MTL to reveal boundary-anchored representations during self-navigation as well as during the observation of others moving through space, highlighting a neural mechanism that signals an individual’s vicinity to environmental borders. Further evidence comes from animal work with bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Omer et al., 2018</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Danjo et al., 2018</xref>) showing so-called “social” place cells in the hippocampus that were specifically tuned to the location of others in space. In contrast, separate subpopulations of CA1 pyramidal cells exclusively coded for self-location or showed a conjoint firing pattern for both self- and other-related location information. Besides hippocampal place cells, grid cell activity (or grid-like coding) is considered central to spatial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Doeller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Jacobs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Stangl et al., 2018</xref>) and mental navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bellmund et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Horner et al., 2016</xref>) but was so far not discussed in the context of socio-spatial navigation.

Thus, we revealed a profile of brain regions specifically concerned with tracking others’ complex and goal-directed movements through space.</p><p id="P35">Evidence on how such macro-scale activation profiles might interact with the putative “spatial map” supported by entorhinal grid codes is sparse. The entorhinal cortex is located at the interface of the hippocampal-neocortical information processing system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Muñoz and Insausti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">van Strien et al., 2009</xref>). Its medial entorhinal division, which houses grid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>), receives anatomical projections from the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">van Strien et al., 2009</xref>), the parahippocampal (or postrhinal cortex in rodents; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Burwell and Amaral, 1998</xref>), retrosplenial and posterior parietal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kerr et al., 2007</xref>), as well as from prefrontal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Garcia and Buffalo, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kondo and Witter, 2014</xref>). In turn, output from the medial entorhinal cortex is routed back towards the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Brun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cholvin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Remondes and Schuman, 2004</xref>) and to a distributed set of cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Insausti et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Muñoz and Insausti, 2005</xref>). As such, the entorhinal cortex seems ideally positioned to integrate information and to communicate the current layout of the “spatial map” to the brain-wide navigation network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Gerlei et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we attempted to characterize whether the activity of entorhinal grid-like codes was time-locked to co-activation of and to communication with regions involved in spatial navigation and visuospatial processing. Results indeed yielded increased co-activation of the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) when participants observed the demonstrator walking aligned with their individual entorhinal grid orientations and this effect was stronger the lower participants performed when subsequently re-tracing the paths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4BC</xref>). Going further, we next tested for functional interactions and found increased entorhinal connectivity with the caudate nucleus and hippocampus, the parahippocampal, posterior parietal and left lateral prefrontal cortex at larger grid magnitudes during observation, again negatively scaling with performance across participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Chen and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>) recently investigated the relationship between grid-like codes in the entorhinal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex using human intracranial recordings during virtual, self-related spatial navigation. The authors could show that prefrontal theta oscillations exhibited a hexadirectional signal modulation similar to theta power in the entorhinal cortex and that both types of grid-like codes revealed a comparable grid orientation. These results resonate with our findings of increased co-activation and entorhinal-cortical connectivity as participants observed another individual walking aligned with their internal grid orientation. Altogether, this suggests a mechanism of time-locked network dynamics that are triggered by the activity of grid-like codes in the entorhinal cortex, potentially coordinating information transfer about the current “socio-spatial map” across the brain, informing the observer about how to navigate space either by recalling their own movements, or by learning through observation, as shown here.</p><p id="P36">Our analyses revealed several surprising findings as well. For instance, we found that entorhinal grid-like codes, as well as their co-activation and entorhinal-cortical connectivity patterns, were positively, rather than negatively, associated with performance (i.e., distance error) in the modified navigation task. In other words, participants with higher grid magnitudes during observation performed worse when re-tracing the demonstrator’s paths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). We speculate that accurate performance might go hand-in-hand with neuronally efficient processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Neubauer and Fink, 2009</xref>), which would be indexed by lower entorhinal grid magnitudes and a reduced need to employ additional co-activation of and connectivity with other brain regions. To provide an example, memory training was shown to decrease brain activity during memory processing while increasing performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Wagner et al., 2021</xref>). Individual inability to accurately memorize and re-trace paths might thus be coupled to higher grid-like signals as there was increased need for support through the cognitive map provided by the entorhinal cortex. Notably, previous research reported mixed results, showing increased grid-like codes at better spatial memory performance (measured by a smaller drop-error when trying to place objects at their correct locations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Doeller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kunz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Stangl et al., 2018</xref>), or not showing any significant association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Horner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Nau et al., 2018</xref>). Understanding the behavioral implications as well as the exact mechanistic contributions of grid-like codes for observation and navigation thus requires further scrutiny. Moreover, our grid-independent analyses showed that increased activation levels in the right posterior parietal cortex during observation were related to better performance when re-tracing the paths thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The posterior parietal cortex was implicated in converging information about target location, movement, and the position of body parts to be able to plan or make movements towards a target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Whitlock et al., 2008</xref>), as well as in tracking spatial routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Nitz, 2006</xref>). This activation cluster was only partly overlapping with grid-modulated voxels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>) but highlights a possible dissociation between overall activation levels and grid-like codes within an anatomical region, and how those signals support performance.</p><p id="P37">Contrary to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bellmund et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Doeller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Horner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kunz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Stangl et al., 2018</xref>), we did not find significant entorhinal grid-like codes during self-navigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref> for significant grid-like coding in the anterior thalamus). The spatial stability of entorhinal grid-like codes was significantly decreased during navigation compared to observation periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating that grid orientations in the entorhinal cortex were less clustered towards a specific direction. Grid orientations hence displayed larger variability across voxels, which might have resulted in an overall decrease in grid magnitude values during navigation. The finding might also be explained by the specific setup of our modified navigation task since participant’s viewpoints were directly placed behind the demonstrator’s starting positions (but note that these randomly varied across trials). This design aspect could have enforced egocentric (striatal) rather than allocentric (hippocampal) processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chersi and Burgess, 2015</xref>), and could explain the striatal co-activation and connectivity time-locked to observation-related entorhinal grid-like codes. We speculate that decoupling the participant’s viewpoint from the starting position might have rendered the task more hippocampal dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Morris et al., 1982</xref>). In contrast to this argument, however, it appears that participants formed an allocentric representation since we detected entorhinal grid-like codes during observation, and since results showed generally increased activation levels in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex during navigation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). Future research might resolve this issue by expanding our current task-setup and decoupling view-and starting points.</p><p id="P38">On a final note, we would like to discuss two potential limitations of the present study. First, the design of the modified navigation task did not allow us to disentangle the tracking of others through space from participants planning their own future paths. Prior work demonstrated that entorhinal grid-like codes could be detected as participants imagined movement through space while they remained stationary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bellmund et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Horner et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that participants were imaging their own movements while observing the demonstrator and that this mental navigation caused elevated grid-like codes during observation. However, we consider this an unlikely explanation of the results. Participants completed a post-MRI interview regarding their individual strategies that they had adopted during observation periods. From the 47 participants that were included in the main grid analysis, only one person reported to have imagined the demonstrator’s perspective. We excluded this participant from the sample and repeated the main analysis which left the results unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Results S5</xref>, and also see this section for a general description of the reported strategies). We acknowledge that this does not fully preclude that processes related to planning and mental navigation contributed to our findings. Future studies might adjust our task design to disentangle potential grid-like processes related to planning, mental navigation, and observation.</p><p id="P39">Second, while it is plausible that entorhinal grid-like codes support socio-spatial navigation, we would like to emphasize that we are unable to make claims about the social specificity of our results. Entorhinal grid-like codes during observation might also be triggered by non-social features that need to be tracked (such as moving cars when crossing the road) and might be related to feature relevance (keeping an eye on the moving car is important to cross the road safely). While such results would speak for a general role of entorhinal grid-like codes in tracking moving features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Wilming et al., 2018</xref>), the debate on the social specificity of brain processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lockwood et al., 2020</xref>) is fueled by initial evidence for “social” and “non-social” place cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Omer et al., 2018</xref>). Omer and colleagues dissociated signals by either presenting another individual (a demonstrator bat) or an object (a football) moving through space while the observer bat remained stationary. A similar task design might be helpful to resolve this issue in follow-up work with humans. Hence, we cannot draw firm conclusions regarding the involvement of entorhinal grid-like coding specifically in socio-spatial navigation but consider our work an important first step in this direction.</p><p id="P40">To summarize, we found that grid-like codes in the human entorhinal cortex track other individuals that navigate through space. Grid signals were tied to increases in co-activation and entorhinal-cortical connectivity with an ensemble of regions, including the striatum, hippocampus, parahippocampal and right posterior parietal cortices, altogether modulated by accuracy when subsequently re-tracing the paths. These findings suggest that grid-like codes might be involved in socio-spatial navigation, concerned with tracking others’ complex and goal-directed movements through space. We suggest that grid-like codes and their associated network dynamics could serve to distribute information about the “socio-spatial map” throughout the brain, laying the foundation for an internal “compass” that enables us to maneuver through crowded and dynamically changing (social) environments as we encounter them in everyday situations.</p></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S17"><title>Participant sample</title><p id="P41">Sixty participants volunteered for this study (aged 18-29 years, mean = 22 years, 45 females, 7 right-handed).

Our task projected participants into a first-person perspective within a virtual reality (VR) environment and asked them to observe a demonstrator moving through a circular arena. The path had to be held in memory and had to be re-traced after a short delay (for an example video, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/mhtgp/?view_only=ff7038b65c0345cd9ffa4ccd3813d7ba">https://osf.io/mhtgp/?view_only=ff7038b65c0345cd9ffa4ccd3813d7ba</ext-link>; <italic>note that the OSF project website is currently set to private and will be made publicly available upon publication of the manuscript</italic>).</p><p id="P44">The VR environment depicted a desert scene with landmarks (sandstone towers, Joshua trees, cacti and other desert plants) and objects (railway wagons, car wrecks, an old gas station, wooden sheds, barrels, water towers, and wind turbines) that were randomly placed around a circular arena. The sandy ground was contrasted by a blue sky filled with clouds, while the sun was fixed at the circular arena’s zenith. The circular arena consisted of a movement area inside which the avatar (i.e., the demonstrator) and the participants could walk (radius = 60 virtual meters, vm; marked in red), as well as an observation area surrounding it (radius = 90 vm, marked in white; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). All landmarks, objects, and avatars were retrieved from the Unity asset store (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://assetstore.unity.com">https://assetstore.unity.com</ext-link>) and Sketchfab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sketchfab.com">https://sketchfab.com</ext-link>). Movement speed of both the demonstrator and participant was set to 15 vm/sec and it was not possible to make rotational and translational movements at the same time (it was only possible to walk straight lines but not curves). The rotation speed was set to 50 deg/sec and the participant’s camera height was fixed to 1.7 vm. The VR environment and task were developed using Unity (software version 2019.4.5f1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://unity.com">https://unity.com</ext-link>).</p><p id="P45">Each trial consisted of an observation and a navigation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Starting out, a cue signaled participants to pay attention to the demonstrator’s upcoming path (2 seconds, “Please pay attention to the person and copy the path afterwards!”). To be able to visually follow the demonstrator’s path throughout the entire movement area, the observer (i.e., the participant) was projected onto the border of the surrounding observation area, directly placed behind the demonstrator’s starting point. The observer remained stationary during the entire observation period (i.e., the observer could not move or rotate but was able to see the entire movement area) since our goal was to disentangle potential grid-like codes supporting the tracking of others from those associated with self-related spatial navigation. A path consisted of three path segments between successive locations, each segment with a random length between 60-120 vm. Thus, single segments could be walked within 4-8 seconds and an entire observation period could last between 18-30 seconds (consisting of three consecutive segments, the rotation periods, plus a 1.5 s duration before/after the path was started/concluded). This was followed by a jittered delay during which a fixation cross was presented on the computer screen (ranging between 2-7 seconds, mean = 5 seconds).</p><p id="P46">At the start of the navigation period, the participant (i.e., the former observer) was projected onto the demonstrator’s starting point and was asked to re-trace the path. Using an MR-compatible button box, participants could adjust their orientation and, once confirmed through button press, automatically walked to the opposite border of the movement area (it was not possible to pause and re-adjust inside the movement area). Participants were instructed to follow the previously observed path as close as possible without spending too much time on orientation adjustments. After 30 seconds, a time warning appeared (a red frame was shown around the screen), signaling that participants needed to reach the path’s end point within the next 10 seconds.</p><p id="P47">Once the border of the movement area was reached for the third time, performance was quantified as (Euclidian) cumulative distance error (vm) averaged across all three points that were visited along the circumference of the movement area (thus, the average difference between the correct and actually visited points). Participants then received feedback about their navigation performance (1 second; happy emoji, distance error =&lt; 20 vm; sad emoji, distance error &gt; 20 vm). This was followed by another jittered delay (fixation cross presented on computer screen, duration ranging between 2-7 seconds, mean = 5 seconds), and a new trial started.</p><p id="P48">Participants engaged in four task runs of 12 trials each (i.e., consisting of 12 observation and 12 navigation periods).

To estimate individual grid orientations in unbiased fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Doeller et al., 2010</xref>), we maximized the distance walked (vm) across the different directional bins in two steps.</p><p id="P50">First, a complete path within one trial consisted of three consecutive path segments. To evenly sample directions from the different directional bins, each individual segment was drawn from a different directional bin (thus, a trial included three path segments sampled from three different directional bins). Across the 12 trials per run (3 path segments per trial), we thus sampled from each directional bin 6 times (6 × 6 = 36 segments per run). Participants completed a total of four runs of the navigation task; each directional bin thus appeared 24 times throughout the experiment. Second, to maximize the distance walked per path segment, we divided the movement area into six equally-sized sectors. Consecutive segments were randomized so that transitions between directly neighboring sectors were prohibited, enforcing a minimum path segment length of 60 vm (the length of a given path segment could vary between 60-120 vm). Starting points of paths were randomly generated within a sector and each sector hosted a start position twice within the same run.</p><p id="P51">Based on these restrictions, we created two trial sequences that were counter-balanced across the full sample of 60 participants. Overall, there was no significant difference in the distance walked across the 6 directional bins [one-way ANOVA, <italic>N</italic> = 48 (each data point indicating the trial-wise distance walked in each of the directional bins and in each of the four task runs), no significant main effect of directional bin, <italic>p</italic><sub>two-tailed</sub> = 0.896, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>).

Prior to each recording, raw eye movement data was mapped onto screen coordinates by means of a calibration procedure. Participants sequentially fixated on nine fixation points on the screen, arranged in a 3 × 3 grid. This was followed by a validation procedure during which the nine fixation points were presented once more while the differences between the current and previously obtained gaze fixations (from the calibration period) were measured. If these differences were &lt; 1° of visual angle, the calibration settings were accepted and the eye tracker recording was started. During recording, the data was digitized at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz and a potential drift in eye movements was corrected for every four trials (i.e., approx. every 1.4 minutes). Due to technical problems eye tracking was only possible in a subsample of 47 participants.</p><p id="P53">Data was corrected for eye blinks by removing samples for which the pupil size deviated more than one standard deviation (s.d.) from the mean across the entire time series. To determine saccadic eye movements, vertical and horizontal eye gaze was transformed into velocities (implemented using Fieldtrip’s “ft_detect_movement”, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org">https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org</ext-link>). In brief, velocities exceeding a threshold of 6 × the s.d. of the velocity distribution and exceeding a duration of 12 ms were defined as saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Engbert and Kliegl, 2003</xref>). Saccade onsets during individual path segments (while observing or navigating, excluding any standing or rotation periods) were extracted. To avoid potential artifacts from other eye movements, and since eye movements typically occur every 200-300 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Rayner et al., 2009</xref>), only events free of saccades and blinks in a 200 ms-interval prior to saccade onset were included (in other words, only events with a pre-saccadic fixation period were considered). We detected a total of 8720 saccades across all participants, across the four task runs, and across both observation and navigation periods (<italic>N</italic> = 47, mean number of saccades ± s.d., overall: 181.7 ± 57.7; observation periods: 97.2 ± 36; navigation periods: 85.45 ± 27.9).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Imaging parameters</title><p id="P54">All imaging data were collected at the Neuroimaging Center of the University of Vienna, using a 3T Skyra MR-scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 32-channel head coil. During each of the four task runs, we acquired on average 474 (± 7, s.d.) T2*-weighted blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) images, using a partial-volume echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2.029 s, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, number of slices = 30 axial slices, slice order = interleaved acquisition, field of view (FoV) = 216 mm, flip angle = 90°, slice thickness = 3mm, in-place resolution = 2 × 2 mm, using parallel imaging with a GRAPPA acceleration factor of 2.

Additionally, to facilitate the co-registration of anatomical entorhinal cortex masks to the partial-volume EPI images, we acquired 10 whole-brain EPI images with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2.832 s, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, number of slices = 42 axial slices, slice order = interleaved acquisition, field of view (FoV) = 216 mm, flip angle = 90°, slice thickness = 3mm, in-place resolution = 2 × 2 mm, using parallel imaging with a GRAPPA acceleration factor of 2. This sequence was thus similar to the partial-volume EPIs (but had a longer TR to allow for whole-brain coverage).

The first six volumes were excluded to allow for T1-equilibration. The remaining volumes were slice-time-corrected to the middle slice and realigned to the mean image calculated across the four task runs. Potential image distortions were corrected by applying FSL’s “topup” command: we calculated the mean image based on the additional volumes acquired (phase-encoding direction reversed). Together with the original fMRI data, this image was then used to estimate and correct susceptibility-induced distortions. Since grid-like codes were analyzed in the participant-specific image space, we refrained from normalizing the data but applied a 3D Gaussian smoothing kernel (5 mm full-width at half maximum, FWHM).</p><p id="P58">For the whole-brain group analyses, the distortion-corrected data was additionally normalized into standard space.

Using a Generalized Linear Modeling (GLM) approach, the BOLD response during the modified navigation task was modeled using separate task regressors, time-locked to the onsets of the respective events (cues, observation periods, navigation periods, feedback). All events were estimated as boxcar functions of specific durations and were convolved with the SPM default canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). Cue and Feedback periods were modelled with a duration of 2 and 1 seconds, respectively. The duration of observation and navigation periods varied depending on the path length and the participant’s behavior, and was defined through the on- and offsets of the VR environment on the computer screen (ranging between 18-40 seconds; see above). This included events such as orientation adjustments (rotations), walked path segments (translation periods), and time periods during which no movement occurred (short standing periods in-between). To account for noise due to head movement, we included the six realignment parameters, their first derivatives, and the squared first derivatives into the design matrix. A high-pass filter with a cutoff at 128 s was applied. The four runs of the modified navigation task were combined into one first-level model and contrasts were created ([observation ∩ navigation] &gt; implicit baseline, observation/navigation &gt; implicit baseline, observation &gt; navigation and vice versa), collapsing across the different runs. To test for group effects, these contrast images were submitted to one-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p><p id="P60">Additionally, we were interested in whether activation changes during observation and/or navigation scaled with individual performance.

First, ROIs were automatically generated using Automated Segmentation of the Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS, software version 1.0.0, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/hipposubfields/">https://sites.google.com/site/hipposubfields/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Yushkevich et al., 2015</xref>). Second, to verify the ASHS-based segmentation, we also performed manual delineation of the entorhinal cortex by tracing its anatomical borders on the structural image.

These masks were then binarized and transformed into the participant-specific space of the functional images. Since the functional images were only partial-volume slabs, co-registration was aided by an additional intermediate step that involved the mean whole-brain functional image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Stangl et al., 2018</xref>). First, each participant’s T2-weighted structural image (together with the individual entorhinal mask) was co-registered to match the orientation of the mean whole-brain functional image. Second, the mean whole-brain functional image (together with the co-registered individual entorhinal mask) was co-registered to match the orientation of the mean partial-volume functional image (mean ± s.d.; ASHS, 56 ± 13 voxels; ITK-SNAP, 104 ± 23 voxels).</p><p id="P63">The quality of co-registration was confirmed through visual inspection of each mask’s overlap with the individual (co-registered) structural and functional data. The entorhinal cortex lies in close proximity to the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. Such tissue borders are often associated with lower signal-to-noise ratio, which is also what we experienced in a subsample of participants. To circumvent this issue, we only considered voxels that exceeded a signal-to-noise threshold of 0.8, leading to the fact that voxels along the anterior-medial entorhinal cortex border were partly dropped from the analyses (participants were excluded if there were less than 5 voxels left in the mask, and two participants were fully excluded from all grid code analyses involving the entorhinal cortex). After applying these restrictions, the final participant sample for which entorhinal cortex data was available comprised 49 (ASHS; 23 ± 13 voxels) or 51 (ITK-SNAP; 38 ± 25 voxels) participants.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Control ROIs</title><p id="P64">To test whether grid-like codes were also detectable in other regions, we chose several control ROIs known to be involved in spatial navigation and visual processing but for which no significant grid-like coding was reported so far.

Both the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex masks were defined using the ASHS algorithm (the hippocampus was defined by merging the hippocampal subfields cornu ammonis (CA) 1-4 and the subiculum). To delineate the anterior thalamus, we used the stereotactic mean anatomical atlas provided by Krauth and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Krauth et al., 2010</xref>)(© University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Axel Krauth, Rémi Blanc, Alejandra Poveda, Daniel Jeanmonod, Anne Morel, Gábor Székely), which is based on histological, cytoarchitectural features defined <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Morel, 2007</xref>).

Translational events (i.e., individual path segments observed by the participant/walked by the demonstrator, and path segments walked by the participant) were modelled from the start of the movement until the next point was reached (thus, the duration was depended on the path segment length). To obtain the direction of each segment (i.e., translational event <italic>t</italic>), we calculated the translation angle (α<sub>t</sub>) based on the path segment coordinates within the movement area and referenced them to an arbitrary zero coordinate on the horizontal VR plane. The translational direction was then modelled using two parametric modulators, defined as sin(α<sub>t</sub>*6) and cos(α<sub>t</sub>*6). Orientation adjustments (rotations) and time periods during which no movement occurred (standing periods) were not explicitly modelled as these durations were typically very short (&lt; 2 seconds).

Results remained stable when basing calculations on the full data set (i.e., not excluding any outliers, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>) and the raw data is publicly provided (see below).</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Representational stability: spatial and temporal stability of grid orientations</title><p id="P72">Grid-like codes might be affected by variations in spatial and temporal signal stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Stangl et al., 2018</xref>). In the case of high spatial instability, the estimated grid orientations might differ across the voxels within a ROI, resulting in random mean grid orientations and decreased grid magnitudes of grid-like codes. In the presence of low temporal stability, decreased grid magnitudes could be caused by varying grid orientations over time (for example, different grid orientations present in the estimation vs. test set).</p><p id="P73">To estimate the extent to which such stability aspects affected our results, we repeated the abovementioned analysis (GLM1, which served to quantify voxel-wise grid orientations) but partitioned each run into data halves (this way, we were able to estimate temporal stability in equally-sized data parts which would not have been possible with the CV-regime). To obtain a metric of spatial stability, we then calculated the coherence of estimated voxel-wise grid orientations between all voxels within the ROI using Rayleigh’s test for non-uniformity of circular data. Higher <italic>z</italic>-values were associated with higher spatial stability (thus, significantly clustered grid orientations within the ROI). To obtain a metric of temporal stability, we compared the voxel-wise grid orientation between the first and second data half. A voxel was classified as “stable” if the differences in grid orientations was within ± 15° and temporal stability was quantified by the proportion (%) of ‘stable’ voxels within the ROI.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Brain activation and connectivity time-locked to grid-like codes</title><p id="P74">Next, we asked whether the activity of entorhinal grid-like codes was time-locked to voxel-wise changes in cortical activation and entorhinal-cortical connectivity, and whether such dynamics were modulated by individual performance. To obtain a value of grid-like codes for each path segment observed or walked, we leveraged GLM2 (which was estimated in each of the 12 CV-folds) and extracted the grid magnitudes from the parametric modulation regressor for each path segment (i.e., relying on the difference between each event’s translational direction and the mean grid orientation of the participant, whereby a smaller difference should be associated with a stronger grid-like signal within the entorhinal cortex ROI that was automatically segmented with ASHS). Data was then modelled similar to above (GLM1, GLM2) but translational events were modulated by the path segment-specific grid magnitudes. To perform group-level analyses, the GLM3 was estimated based on fMRI data in MNI standard-space.</p><p id="P75">We contrasted the parametric modulation regressors that the captured path segment-wise fluctuations in entorhinal grid magnitude against baseline (entorhinal grid magnitude during observation/navigation &gt; implicit baseline) and tested for group effects by submitting the individual contrast images to separate one-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests. Additionally, to test whether activation changes time-locked to fluctuations in entorhinal grid magnitude scaled with performance, we ran linear regression analyses and added the cumulative distance error (vm, obtained during navigation periods and averaged across all three points of a path) as a covariate of interest.</p><sec id="S33"><title>Generalized Psychophysiological Interaction (gPPI) analysis</title><p id="P76">Moreover, our goal was to probe whether fluctuations in entorhinal grid magnitude (i.e., the strength of the grid-like signal during each path segment) would be associated with entorhinal-cortical functional connectivity changes. To achieve this, we used the abovementioned model (GLM3) and performed generalized psychophysiological interaction analysis (gPPI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">McLaren et al., 2012</xref>). We took the anatomical boundaries of the bilateral posterior-medial entorhinal cortex as a seed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Maass et al., 2015</xref>), extracted the first eigenvariate of its functional timecourse and adjusted for average activation levels using an <italic>F</italic>-contrast. The timecourse was then deconvolved to estimate the putative neural activity of the seed region (i.e., the physiological factor) and was multiplied with boxcar functions that defined the specific task events (i.e., the psychological factor). The resulting vectors were convolved with the canonical HRF, yielding one psychophysiological interaction regressor per condition-of-interest (i.e., for parametric modulation regressors that captured fluctuations in entorhinal grid magnitude during path segments of observation/navigation periods), and were contrasted against the implicit baseline.</p><p id="P77">Group-level connectivity analyses were performed using a set of one-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests. Again, linear regression analysis was used to test for connectivity changes time-locked to fluctuations in entorhinal grid magnitude that potentially scaled with performance by adding the cumulative distance error as a covariate of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Statistical analyses and thresholding</title><sec id="S35"><title>Statistical analysis of behavioral data and ROI-based fMRI results</title><p id="P78">Analyses of navigation performance (distance error, vm) and ROI-based fMRI results (magnitude of grid-like codes, directional bins and representational stability) were carried out using R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link>), using a set of <italic>t</italic>-tests and ANOVA models.
