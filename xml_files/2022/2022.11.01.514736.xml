Given these constraints, models predict that long range regulatory systems must exist to maintain flat forms. Juxtaposed microRNA (miR-NA) networks could serve as one of these regulatory systems. One of these miRNAs, miR319 is thought to be expressed from the base of leaves and to promote growth by degrading class II TCP transcription factor mRNAs. A miR319 overexpression mutant, <italic>jagged and wavy (jaw-D)</italic> exhibits rippling and undulating leaves, consistent with biomechanical predictions that without genetic spatial coordination, tissues will deform. It has been theorized that <italic>jaw-D</italic> rippling results from overgrowth at the margins, however this does not fully address how miR319 expression from the base of wild-type (WT) leaves allows them to flatten. Here, we track the growth, cell division and cell maturation in live WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves to ask how miR319 expression in WT promotes flattening. This data revealed the importance of spatially distinct growth, division and differentiation patterns in WT leaves, which are missing in <italic>jaw-D.</italic> We propose that WT leaf cells respond to differentiation cues to dynamically re-orient growth in specific tissue locations and regulate flattening.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In nature, leaves exhibit a myriad of shapes and sizes. Yet, all leaves initially begin as a few cells recruited from the shoot apical meristem (SAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Rodriguez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Sarojam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Reinhardt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Caggiano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Nakata et al., 2012</xref>). Understanding how these few initial cells create recognizable forms in nature requires a rich combination of biophysical principles and genetic pathways. Imaging at multiple scales has revealed that development and growth in leaves is highly spatially and temporally dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Armon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Avery, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kuchen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Fox et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Derr et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Poethig and Sussex, 1985</xref>). In most species, leaf organs exhibit a dynamic progression from fast to slow growth with a gradient of slow growth initiating from the tip and progressing downward. The slowing of growth from the tip corresponds with a wave of cellular differentiation that initiates at the tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Avery, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Remmler and Rolland-Lagan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Das Gupta and Nath, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Poethig and Sussex, 1985</xref>). Biomechanical principles predict that juxtaposition of different growth rates within a tissue would result in tissue deformations including leaf curling and ruffling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Boudaoud, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hamant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Sharon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Marder et al., 2003</xref>). Further, the juxtaposition of different growth rates has been posited as a mechanism to fold and shape floral organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Rebocho et al., 2017</xref>). Yet leaves are usually flat, which is optimal for their physiological functions of photosynthesis and gas exchange. To obtain their flat form, leaves must be able to coordinate their growth at large spatial scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Marder et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p id="P3">A few signals have been proposed to function along the leaf length to guide leaf differentiation and coordinate growth in flat leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kazama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Sauret-Güeto et al., 2013</xref>). Pertinent to this study are a pair of microRNAs (miRNAs), miR319 and miR396, with complementary spatial patterns. miRNAs have been proposed to act as mobile signals to guide organ-level processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Skopelitis et al., 2012</xref>). Members of the miR319 family have shown promoter expression at the base of leaves (miR319c) and floral organs (miR319a, c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Challa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Nag et al., 2009</xref>). miR319 targets the class II <italic>TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1, CYCLOIDEA, PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN FACTOR 1 AND 2 (TCP)</italic> transcription factors which have been shown to repress growth and activate tissue differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Schommer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Efroni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bresso et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Sarvepalli and Nath, 2011</xref>). miR319 targets, especially <italic>TCP4</italic> are thought to regulate cell growth and differentiation through <italic>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDONS 2 (CUC2)</italic> and the <italic>CUC</italic> regulator miR164 as well as auxin and cytokinin networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Rubio-Somoza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Koyama et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Challa et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">2021</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Complementarily, miR396 is expressed from the tips of growing leaves and targets the <italic>GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR (GRF)</italic> family of transcription factors for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Debernardi et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">2014</xref>). This likely creates a gradient of <italic>GRF</italic> with a maximum at the base of leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Rodriguez et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>GRFs</italic> promote growth and their overexpression can lead to overall increases in leaf size, though not curling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Beltramino et al., 2018</xref>). miR396 has also been shown to repress expansion promoted by the <italic>GRFs</italic> in roots, where miR396 exclusion of <italic>GRFs</italic> seems important for maintaining the meristematic nature of transit-amplifying cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Rodriguez et al., 2015</xref>). There is a direct interaction between TCP4 and the regulatory sequence of miR396 so crosstalk between these contrasting pathways is likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Schommer et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that the restriction of <italic>GRF</italic> expression to the base by miR396 and restriction of <italic>TCPs</italic> to the tip by miR319 could establish the characteristic leaf growth gradient, but does not clarify how this juxtaposition of fast and slow growth is resolved by the leaf to flatten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Avery, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Remmler and Rolland-Lagan, 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P5">miR319 was discovered in an activation tagging screen, where the mutant, named <italic>jagged and wavy (jaw-D)</italic> was found to overexpress the miR319 hairpin locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Palatnik et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Weigel et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>jaw-D</italic> exhibits curly and wavy leaves. This curling has previously been attributed to extended growth from an over-active marginal meristem, although these studies have relied on cell cycle reporters as a proxy for assessing tissue material addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Avery, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alvarez et al., 2016</xref>). Tissue augmentation involves both cell divisions and growth by expansion, processes with distinct regulation and developmental timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Traas and Doonan, 2001</xref>). Serrations and lobing – distinct from the curling and rippling in <italic>jaw-D</italic> – have also more directly been attributed to differential growth repression and activation along the margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Blein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kierzkowski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Chuck et al., 1996</xref>). However, the presence and importance of a marginal meristem in shaping leaves has long been equivocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Donnelly et al., 1999</xref>). Further, it remains to be established how WT expression of miR319, graded along the proximal-distal axis, would laterally guide the formation of simple margins and flat leaves. Biomechanical models predict wavy deformations will occur where spatial coordination of heterogeneous leaf growth is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Armon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Marder et al., 2003</xref>). We wondered if we could link disruptions in the genetic regulatory capacity in <italic>jaw-D</italic> with faulty growth heterogeneity regulation and thus infer how WT leaves flatten properly.</p><p id="P6">The regulation of TCPs by miR319 is well-conserved within angiosperms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Warthmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Palatnik et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, the insights gained from studies of this pathway could have broad implications for the flattening of leaves throughout the angiosperms. Notable homologs in other model species include the class II- defining member <italic>CINCINNATA (CIN)</italic> in snapdragon and <italic>Lanceolate</italic> in tomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Nath et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Crawford et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ori et al., 2007</xref>), both of which when mutated or downregulated yield rippling and undulating leaves like the miR319 overexpression mutant <italic>jaw-D.</italic> Increased curvature in <italic>cin</italic> leaves was attributed to decreased perception of a tip-derived differentiation signal and thus an escape from leaf margin growth regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Nath et al., 2003</xref>). Still, the connection between a proximal-distal differentiation signal and marginal growth remains to be resolved.</p><p id="P7">To understand how leaf shape emerges from and reconciles spatially distinct cellular growth, divisions and differentiation, we have tracked the growth, cell division and cell maturation in real time in living wild type and <italic>jaw-D</italic> mutant leaves. Because <italic>jaw-D</italic> overexpresses miR319, we expected to see an expansion of growth and delay in tissue maturation corresponding with expanded miR319 presence. Only our tissue maturation hypothesis proved correct. Growth and cell division were spread more distally in <italic>jaw-D</italic>, but had a lower maximum value than WT. Our live imaging results allowed us to explore the relationship between growth rate, growth orientation, and differentiation. Based on our results, we propose that <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves fail to dynamically re-orient growth leading to growth conflicts and resulting in increased curvature. Our data suggests that a distal differentiation signal, that cannot be perceived in <italic>jaw-D</italic> may be required to induce growth re-orientation in WT. Thus, we help resolve how a proximal-distally oriented signaling network can orchestrate leaf flattening medio-laterally.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Features of leaf form emerge soon after primordia initiation</title><p id="P8">To understand how the three dimensional form of the leaf arises from cellular growth patterns, we repeatedly imaged living wild-type (WT) and <italic>jaw-D</italic> mutant first leaves from 3 days after sowing (DAS) to 8 or 9 DAS (n = 3 leaves for each genotype; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cell boundaries were marked with a fluorescent plasma membrane marker. To increase the surface of the leaf that could be imaged, the cotyledons were dissected off. We used confocal microscopy to image nearly the entire abaxial (bottom) epidermis of the leaf at cellular resolution so that we could make cellular and organ scale measurements. Then we used MorphoGraphX 2.0 image analysis software to represent the confocal stacks as 2.5D curved mesh surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Strauss et al., 2022</xref>). We segmented the epidermal cell signal projected on this mesh and tracked each of the cellular lineages over time.</p><p id="P9">In all samples we observed rapid cellular and organ-wide morphology changes characteristic of early leaf growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplemental Figures 10-15</xref>). Notably, at 4 DAS stomata begin to initiate at the distal end of the leaf and at 5 DAS a cylindrical fold in the proximal base of the leaf begins to differentiate the petiole (stalk that attaches the leaf to the stem) from the lamina (the flat leaf surface) in WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves. While at 5 DAS pavement cells in WT leaves begin initiating their characteristic puzzle shape, <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves produce more modest lobing. Note, while the <italic>jaw-D</italic> sample leaf may appear left-right asymmetric, this is an artifact of viewing the mesh in two dimensions due to the position it was imaged in and, other samples have positions that lack this visual skew (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplemental Figure 12</xref>). Organ-wide morphological features of the 3-8 DAS leaves, including length, area, cell number and cell density, were not statistically different between WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> (paired Student’s t-tests with Bonferroni correction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-F</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves could be considered at the same stage for each day in the experiment. However, the enhanced curvature of <italic>jaw-D</italic> prevented cell segmentation in some of the proximal regions, so it is likely that proximal <italic>jaw-D</italic> cells are undercounted. While leaf area and leaf length continued to increase exponentially throughout the experiment (log(leaf area) ~ time, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.93, p &lt; 2.2e-16; log(leaf length) ~ time, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.94, p &lt; 2.2e-16, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplemental Figure 1F-G</xref>), cell number began to plateau (three parameter log-logistic Lack of fit p-value = 0.95) around 6 DAS, suggesting that we captured the transition of leaves from growth associated with cell division to growth predominately through cell expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Rodriguez et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, the density, the number of cells per area, stayed mostly linear, but was approaching a negative exponential curve in the last two time points in WT, suggestive of a more complete transition to expansion-based growth in WT (cell density ~ time, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.92, p &lt; 2.2204e-16).</p><p id="P10">To relate the phenotypes we captured early in leaf development to phenotypes of fully developed leaves, we scanned WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves at maturity (at least 31 DAS). By measuring paired leaves from &gt;15 plants each (WT n = 34 leaves, <italic>jaw-D</italic> n = 36 leaves), we observed that leaves undergo approximately a 400-fold increase in area from 8 DAS to maturity, yet the gross morphology is established by 8 DAS. Generally, the first two leaves of <italic>jaw-D</italic> form two ripples and these ripples are established in the live imaging experiment window, while WT leaves never form ripples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplemental Figure 1H-I</xref>). WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves have the same median size at maturity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>, Wilcox test p &gt; 0.05). Other measurements of organ size between WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> are likewise comparable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplemental Figure 1B-E</xref>). We calculated the relative area of the first and second leaves of WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> plants to ask how variable within a single plant the leaf size could be. While the median value was not statistically significant between WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> plants (1.09 WT versus <italic>jaw-D</italic> 1.10, Wilcox test p &gt; 0.05), <italic>jaw-D</italic> exhibited a greater spread of potential relative areas, with more extreme values and statistically higher coefficient of variation (Feltz and Miller Asymptotic test p = 3.051466e-05), indicative of higher size variability induced by the <italic>jaw-D</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). Also remarkable, we found that the petiole of <italic>jaw-D</italic> is shorter than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>, Wilcox test p &lt; .0001). The petiole grows through anisotropic expansion, so this agrees with previous work that suggests differentiation-driven expansion is promoted by TCPs (and thus would be lacking in <italic>jaw-D)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Efroni et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We were curious how leaves with approximately the same starting and ending tissue material could have such distinct shapes, namely flattened in WT and curved in <italic>jaw-D</italic>. When we measured the first true leaves of WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> plants grown until maturity, <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves could not be flattened and therefore small tears at the margin had to be induced to measure leaf characteristics, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G-J</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bresso et al., 2018</xref>). In our live imaging, starting at 6 DAS tissue curving becomes evident in <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref> red arrows, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">5</xref>). This tissue curving continues throughout the experiment and is accompanied by ruffling along the margin at 8 DAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B, G</xref>, black arrows). We thus aimed to associate the spatial and temporal initiation of this curvature with cellular growth, division and differentiation patterns.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>While WT leaves progressively flatten, jaw-D leaves exhibit a proximal-distal distribution of curvature</title><p id="P12">To quantify the magnitude and direction of tissue curvature, we calculated the Gaussian curvature for live imaged WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). The type of curvature is represented by the sign, indicating a hill or valley (positive) or saddle (negative) structure. Therefore, values of Gaussian curvature further from zero indicate greater curvature in a region and changes in sign between regions indicates a change in the nature of the curving shape and greater tissue complexity. Extreme values in curvature at the curved leaf margin do not suggest differences between WT and <italic>jaw-D.</italic> In comparing early time points (3-5 DAS), WT leaves exhibit a larger spread of curvature values. This is perhaps due to the more pronounced formation of the petiole in these samples. At 6 DAS, however, the curvature of <italic>jaw-D</italic> samples spread distinctly between positive and negative values between proximal and distal halves, respectively, and show a large spread along the medial-lateral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). At the same time, WT curvature values along the length and width tighten around 0, as the leaf flattens. We conclude that <italic>jaw-D</italic> curvature enhances throughout the leaf, not just at the margin and that this is initiated at 6 DAS.</p><p id="P13">We wondered if enhanced curvature in <italic>jaw-D</italic> might reflect the inability of <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves to reconcile contrasting cellular growth and division along the lamina.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Growth variability is nearly indistinguishable between WT and jaw-D locally, but is much higher globally across WT organs</title><p id="P14">We chose to quantify growth heterogeneity locally and globally to test our hypothesis that distinct organ-wide regions of growth in WT are essential for the leaf flattening that is lacking in <italic>jaw-D.</italic> We first quantified local growth variability within cell lineages (temporal variability) or for each cell and its neighbors (spatial variability) using established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hong et al., 2016</xref>). We found that WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> are largely indistinguishable in their local spatial and temporal growth variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-D</xref>). Stomata have recently been suggested as the source of most growth heterogeneity in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Le Gloanec et al., 2022</xref>). However, our analysis was largely unaffected when stomata were excluded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). We next applied a cellular Fourier analysis to quantify the heterogeneity in growth of the tissue across all length scales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E-F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Fruleux and Boudaoud, 2021</xref>). This analysis verified our observations that <italic>jaw-D</italic> exhibits a slightly more homogenous distribution of growth across the leaf. Our cellular Fourier analysis also emphasized that the globally heterogeneous growth present in WT and lacking in <italic>jaw-D</italic> is only prevalent at 4-6DAS, when the curvature in <italic>jaw-D</italic> is established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref> black boxes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Given this co-occurrence, we hypothesized that organ-wide growth heterogeneity was responsible for flattening the WT leaf. We wondered if this early growth heterogeneity was developmentally regulated.

To explore the relationship between cell division and growth in tandem, we represent each of these parameters for each cell in its normalized proximal-distal and medial-lateral position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-D</xref>). During 3-4 DAS, in both WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic>, cells throughout the leaf lamina grow and divide rapidly so there is an even distribution of big, yellow points. At 4-5 DAS, cells at the distal tip of the WT leaf slow their growth and division (black boxes). Still, high growth and cell division rates are coupled near the proximal leaf base. Darker regions in the lower half of WT plots are evident, representing the proximal region of growth and division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, top row). This proximal distal pattern of growth and division becomes more distinct between the proximal and distal halves in WT leaves through 8-9 DAS (compare boxed to unboxed regions). In contrast, this proximal-distal pattern is reduced in <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves. The area where cell divisions and areal expansion occur is expanded distally starting at 4-5 DAS (boxed regions are more similar to unboxed). The distally expanded growth and division throughout the lamina in <italic>jaw-D</italic> is evident in the greater spread of dark colors and big sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, bottom row). Unlike the leaf blade, the petioles of all samples show more uniform growth and smaller number of divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).

To explore how contrasting spatial growth profiles for WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> genotypes can lead to overall similar leaf length dynamics, we created a simple one-dimensional model to capture the length of the leaf over time. In the model, we assume growth is initially exponential in both WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic>. As the leaf dynamics exit this initial exponential phase, growth becomes a function of both time and spatial location and also becomes different between WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic>. For WT, we implement a growth curve in which growth decreases with increasing distance from the leaf base (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplemental Figure 4E</xref>). We also assume that the growth at the leaf base decreases over time; this decrease is essential to eventually stop all growth as the leaf length approaches its steady-state value. We simplify the <italic>jaw-D</italic> growth profile to be a constant moderate growth rate along the leaf length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplemental Figure 4E</xref>).

There is a greater spread in the relative medial-lateral growth in WT than in <italic>jaw-D</italic> (broader contour shape, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>). Along the medial-lateral axis, both WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> exhibit a slight lateral tilt in magnitude while <italic>jaw-D</italic> shows a narrower distribution of growth values starting at 4-5 DAS. The growth in lateral <italic>jaw-D</italic> regions is equal to or less than WT growth, suggesting overgrowth of the margin is not the major cause of curvature, at least in leaf 1. Cell divisions largely cease at 5-6 DAS and are less distinguishable medio-laterally between WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplemental Figure 4A-B</xref>). So, we reasoned that growth, rather than divisions, was a major driver in creating the curvature differences in <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves.

We also note that we use the term ripple, because the phenotype is not just at the margin, but curvature that extends across the whole leaf. We do not exclude the possibility that later developing leaves with more ruffles additionally exhibit overgrowth of the margins. However, our analysis shows that the rippling leaf curvature of <italic>jaw-D</italic> can occur in the first two leaves without growth at the leaf margins distinct from WT.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Growth variability is nearly indistinguishable between WT and jaw-D locally, but is much higher globally across WT organs</title><p id="P21">We chose to quantify growth heterogeneity locally and globally to test our hypothesis that distinct organ-wide regions of growth in WT are essential for the leaf flattening that is lacking in <italic>jaw-D.</italic> We first quantified local growth variability within cell lineages (temporal variability) or for each cell and its neighbors (spatial variability) using established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hong et al., 2016</xref>).

Then their locations at 8 DAS were compared. 4 DAS proximal regions had a much greater contribution to 8 DAS leaves in WT (darker purple coloring in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> or steeper curve in 6B) than <italic>jaw-D</italic> (more even coloring and shallower curve in 6A,B).

The proximal-distal patterns still largely held, however the medial-lateral differences were much less pronounced.

This comparison revealed how differentiation signals are more acutely experienced by WT leaves as the pavement cell lobing increased starting at 5 DAS in the distal lineage and 6 DAS in the proximal lineage. Whereas, lobing in the <italic>jaw-D</italic> lineage began at 6 DAS, never became as elaborate as WT lobing, and further, was more similar between distal and proximal lineages. From this specific example, we wanted to expand our focus to tissue-wide differentiation.</p><p id="P24">The differences in pavement cell lobing observed in single lineages motivated us to measure global changes in the distribution of cellular differentiation relative to the growth front we measured in WT versus <italic>jaw-D.</italic> We measured pavement cell lobing and stomatal characteristics to understand how two different types of differentiation proceed in the cells of WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The Lobeyness measure in MorphoGraphX allows us to ascertain the level of lobing present in segmented cells throughout the epidermis of a given leaf. We used this measure to ask how patterns of differentiation present along the proximal-distal and medial-lateral axes change with leaf development. We found that in WT leaves, lobing begins to increase in the distal quarter of the leaf at about 5 DAS. Over subsequent days, the lobeyness of many of these distal cells continues to increase and lobeyness initiation propagates from tip to base. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A-B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaf cells initiate lobing 6 DAS or later, to a lesser extent and more evenly along the length of the leaf, suggesting differentiation is reduced in <italic>jaw-D.</italic> Along the medial-lateral axis, the differences in absolute magnitude of cell lobing are especially clear between WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>). This suggests that important differentiation signals at 5 DAS that are perceived in WT, perhaps to reinforce and structure the growth directions, are lacking in <italic>jaw-D.</italic></p><p id="P25">Stomata also initiate as leaf tissue matures, so we wanted to investigate if stomatal production was also impaired in <italic>jaw-D.</italic> In contrast to pavement cell lobing, we did not see such stark differences between WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> in stomatal density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C-D</xref>). We measured stomatal density by labeling each stomate (labeled as one cell) in each leaf and then calculated the distance from any pavement cell to the nearest stomate. At 4 DAS the spacing curve is nearly the same between WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> as the first stomata are initiated at the tip. There is a slight lag in the flattening of this curve in <italic>jaw-D</italic> as stomatal initiation waves down the growing lamina at 5 and 6 DAS. Yet, by 7 and 8 DAS both WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> have evenly spaced stomata. We hypothesize this indicates the physiological importance of properly spaced stomata and the independence of this process from tissue and organ-wide shape regulation. However, we found that though evenly spaced, stomata in <italic>jaw-D</italic> were smaller and rounder, while WT stomata begin to grow anisotropically and increase exponentially in size along the proximal-distal axis, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>). This suggests that while stomatal initiation is maintained in <italic>jaw-D</italic>, stomatal maturation is also perturbed. Since cellular differentiation appears perturbed in <italic>jaw-D</italic> and <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves are not flat, we concluded that a proper cellular differentiation gradient could be important for leaf organ flattening. It has been observed that pavement cell lobeyness can mediate tissue stresses imposed by isotropic growth. We propose that this pavement cell maturation pattern could be important for permitting dynamic growth coordination in WT.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>WT cells can dynamically polarize their growth to shape early leaves; this control is lacking in jaw-D</title><p id="P26">To assess how regions of growth and differentiation might guide organ flattening in WT leaves, we measured the relative growth difference between maximal and minimal directions of each cell, a version of anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). We calculate this by determining the cellular junctions between which the maximal growth occurs and the growth in the perpendicular (inherently minimal) direction. We then subtract these values to get a measure of anisotropy, i.e. if a cell is growing isotropically these measures are equal, so isotropic cells have a value of 0. We found that the distribution of WT anisotropy mimics the WT growth gradient pattern with a graded pattern starting at 4-5 DAS until 7-8 DAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A-B</xref>). As cell growth and division slows from the tip, anisotropy decreases in magnitude in WT. At 8-9 DAS growth in WT leaves exhibits the same level of anisotropy throughout the lamina (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplemental Figure 9</xref>). Anisotropy in <italic>jaw-D</italic> also follows its respective growth pattern. It is spread from 0 (isotropic) to around 1 along the length of laminas. As with growth, there is a maxima of anisotropy located in the center of the leaf length at 4-5 DAS and 5-6 DAS with a return to a more WT-like distribution from 6-7 DAS onwards. Anisotropy is generally lower in <italic>jaw-D</italic> than wild type. This could help explain the shorter petiole phenotype we observed in mature <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves, since petioles invoke anisotropic growth to elongate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>). We computed the anisotropy over spatial scales as before with a cellular Fourier analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8E</xref>). This analysis concurs with our observations that WT heterogeneity in anisotropy is greater at large spatial scales than <italic>jaw-D</italic>, especially from 4-6DAS.</p><p id="P27">We then wondered if the orientation of the anisotropy relative to the leaf axis was important for flattening. We calculated the difference between the growth oriented along the proximal-distal axis minus the growth orthogonal to this axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C-D</xref>). With this calculation values of 0 indicate isotropic growth between proximal-distal and medial-lateral axes, positive values indicate alignment of maximal growth with the proximal-distal axis and negative values indicate alignment of maximal growth in the medial-lateral direction. This confirmed that the alignment of growth is dynamic in WT with a gradient of aligned anisotropy localized at the base from 3-5 DAS. It also highlighted a notable period of nearly isotropic growth with respect to the proximal-distal axis at 6-7 DAS only present in WT. In <italic>jaw-D</italic>, aligned relative growth hovers between -.05 and 1 for nearly all time points suggesting a preference towards alignment with the proximal-distal axis along the length of the leaf through 6-7 DAS. Further, at 7-8 DAS some anisotropy flips to orthogonal alignment in the same proximal-distal sectors which might enhance growth conflicts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P28">We turned to finite element method (FEM) simulations to simulate how each of these patterns of anisotropic growth affect curvature. We followed previous models by dividing the leaf into small elements and using gradients of growth factors and tissue polarity to control the growth of individual elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kuchen 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kierzkowski 2019</xref>), but without confining the simulation to a plane. The FEM was then used to resolve the conflicts that arise due to the differential expansion of individual elements, leading to the emergent shape of the leaf structure. Both WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaf primordia initiate with proximal-distal growth alignment across the leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A-B</xref>). We created a model with low anisotropic growth (along the proximal-distal axis) at the midrib and higher anisotropic growth at the margins. Simulation of this model created a leaf primordium that arches back (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Video 6</xref>), similar to the way the young leaf primordium arches slightly back from meristem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> 4 DAS). Next the WT leaf growth anisotropy rearranges dynamically to generate a fan pattern from the base of the lamina, while growth slows at the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A</xref>). We simulated this pattern with anisotropic growth in the basal portion, but the direction rotating in cells nearer the margins. Simulation of this model produced a relatively flat expanding leaf until the growth conflicts pushed the tip out of plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Video 7</xref>). In contrast to WT, <italic>jaw-D</italic> maintains a strong band of anisotropic growth in the middle of the leaf during this phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9B</xref>), as if <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves persist in the earlier phase of growth longer. We created a model that has strong anisotropic growth at the midrib, and low anisotropic growth near the margins. Simulation of this model produced a strongly curved slightly cupped leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Video 8</xref> at 5 sec). When the simulation was allowed to run longer, the leaf curled over on itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Video 8</xref> at 11 sec). Without the cover slip used for imaging, <italic>jaw-D</italic> leaves curl over on themselves (data in pending manuscript). In this model, the whole leaf curls, not just the margins, which is consistent with our images of the jaw-D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In the third phase both leaves grow isotopically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A-B</xref>).

By conducting live cellular imaging on the same leaves from first initiation through a 400-fold increase in area and 100-fold increase in cell number over six days, we have captured an immense level of detail of this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We found that disruptions in tissue curvature in <italic>jaw-D</italic> become evident at 6 DAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This curvature increase immediately follows a growth program disruption, wherein <italic>jaw-D</italic> exhibits a pattern of medium growth broadly extending along most of the length of the leaf. Whereas, WT exhibits a proximally localized maxima and slowing growth gradient towards the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It is also at 5-6 DAS that important shifts in cellular differentiation become obvious in WT leaves with pavement cells in the distal quarter of the leaf increasing greatly in their lobing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Just before these tissue maturation transitions, a notable juxtaposition of proximal-distally aligned anisotropic growth in the proximal half and isotropic growth in the distal half exists in WT laminas – and is missing in <italic>jaw-D</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Based on this information, we propose a model wherein, WT leaves perceive and propagate distal differentiation signaling to initiate and maintain two different growth alignments between proximal and distal halves. These cellular behaviors combine to allow WT leaves to remain flat while rounding along the margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). Our model complements recent observations that spatially specific reinforcement of tissue stresses may occur in three dimensions to promote organ flattening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Our data clarifies how the <italic>jaw-D</italic> mutant can have dramatic phenotypic changes along the margin and in three dimensions while the underlying genetic players function along the proximal-distal axis of the lamina.

Since <italic>jaw-D</italic> over-expresses miR319, and should therefore further decrease the presence of TCPs in the leaf, we expected there to be an increase in the size of the fast growth and division zone seen in WT. However, we were surprised to find that the change was more nuanced. Instead the growth rates were more moderate in <italic>jaw-D</italic> and distributed further along the proximal-distal axis. We noted that cell divisions followed the altered growth pattern in <italic>jaw-D</italic>, and that their contribution to the organ ends earlier than growth. We think that the distribution of contrasting growth along the medio-lateral axis in WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> could induce conflicts between tissue regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).

So, TCPs could also be crucial in reinforcing differential growth patterns by supporting the transition to differentiated cell identity that enables dynamic growth re-alignment from anisotropic to isotropic.

The areal growth rate of each cell is defined as the relative difference of their surface areas at successive time steps divided by the time delay between two time steps. The deformation is a symmetric matrix summarizing the two principal directions of growth, and the ratios to apply in these two directions to deform a cell’s contour at a preceding time step to the same cell’s contour at a following time step.</p><p id="P53">We then perform the spectral analysis consisting by representing the spatial variation of the areal growth or of the deformation matrix as a linear combination of harmonics. Each harmonic is associated to a frequency characterizing its spatial variation scale. Performing our analysis we obtain the Cellular Fourier Transforms of the areal growth rate and of the deformation. These are the amplitudes with which the different harmonics decompose the areal growth rate and the deformation matrix. For a tissue, the first harmonic is a constant associated to the spatial frequency 0, and the corresponding CFT for the areal growth rate is the whole tissue’s areal growth. The two following harmonics vary at the scale of the tissue and the associated CFTs for the areal growth rate give the average growth gradient at the tissue scale. The higher the rank of the harmonics is, the higher the spatial frequency and the smaller the considered space scale are. The deformation being described by a matrix, its CFTs are also matrices. The first CFT will for example be the average tissue deformation. We notice that, although a cell’s deformation is 2D and contained in its tangential plane, if it is not flat, the overall tissue deforms in 3D. The CFTs of the deformation matrix depend therefore on the tissue geometry. To analyze growth anisotropy, we considered the difference between the two first eigenvalues of the CFTs of deformation which we divided by the time delay between two time steps. It quantifies the deviation from isotropic deformation.</p><p id="P54">The spectra we finally considered are those of the areal growth rate and the deviation from isotropic growth. These spectra have been smoothed to be comparable among different tissues. In these spectra the y-axis represent the CFTs and the x-axis spatial frequencies.

Nearly all 4 DAS sector bins have different mapping to 8 DAS positions between WT and <italic>jaw-D</italic> representing more prominent contributions of WT proximal and medial regions than disbursed and lateral contributions in <italic>jaw-D</italic> (p&lt;.0001, paired Student’s t-test and Bonferroni correction). (E) Tracing the same proximal (bottom) and distal (top) cell lineages (red outlines) for the entire experiment for WT (left) or <italic>jaw-D</italic> (right) sample leaves.

Represented as heatmaps (A) on sample WT (top) or <italic>jaw-D</italic> (bottom) leaf meshes for each day of the imaging experiment. Black scale bars = 200 μm. (B) Lobeyness versus position along the proximal-distal axis for each cell in all three WT (top, squares, solid lines) or <italic>jaw-D</italic> (bottom, circles, dotted lines) lamina replicates. Lobeyness is initiated at the distal tip of WT cells at 5 DAS and increases while propagating down to the leaf base. Increases in lobeyness are subtler, later and more disbursed in <italic>jaw-D</italic> samples. (C-D) Stomatal spacing (the distance in μm to the nearest stomate from any pavement cell, the inverse of stomatal density) (C) represented as heatmaps on sample WT (top) or <italic>jaw-D</italic> (bottom) meshes for each day of the imaging experiment. (D) Quantification of stomatal spacing across laminas with plotting as in (B). Note, stomata first initiate at 4 DAS. Stomatal spacing quickly tapers in WT as stomata are initiated and become evenly distributed through the lamina. There is a slight proximal lag in this process in <italic>jaw-D</italic>, though much less pronounced than lobeyness suggestive of separable patterning processes.

Magnitude of growth along and orthogonal to the proximal-distal axis is indicated with lines as in (A). (D) Quantification of difference in aligned growth in laminas with plotting as in (B).

(A) In WT, this signal is reinforced through the permissiveness towards isotropy that distal differentiation permits. Meanwhile, the initial alignment of growth along the proximal-distal axis becomes progressively restricted to the petiole region. This allows leaf widening and expansion, while remaining flat. (B) <italic>jaw-D</italic> exhibits a weaker response to this signal; growth remains aligned with the entire length of the leaf. This fails to resolve growth conflicts between the slower growing leaf center and faster growing leaf edge which, coupled with anisotropy patterns cause of the curvature to increase and ripples to form in the lamina.

(C-E) FEM simulations of leaf mesh growth with different spatial distributions of anisotropic growth. Color indicates growth ratio, lines indicate anisotropy direction.
