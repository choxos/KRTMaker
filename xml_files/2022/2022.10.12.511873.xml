We have shown recently that human serum triggers daptomycin tolerance in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, but it was not clear if a similar phenotype occurred in other major infective endocarditis pathogens. We found that <italic>Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gordonii</italic> or <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> grown under standard laboratory conditions were efficiently killed by daptomycin, whereas bacteria pre-incubated in human serum survived exposure to the antibiotic, with &gt;99% cells remaining viable. Incubation of enterococci or streptococci in serum led to peptidoglycan accumulation, as shown by increased incorporation of the fluorescent D-amino analogue HADA. Inhibition of peptidoglycan accumulation using the antibiotic fosfomycin resulted in a &gt;10-fold reduction in serum-induced daptomycin tolerance, demonstrating the important contribution of the cell wall to the phenotype. We also identified a small contribution to daptomycin tolerance in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> from cardiolipin synthases, although this may reflect the inherent susceptibility of cardiolipin-deficient mutants.

It is relatively rare, affecting 3-10 per 100,000 people annually, but it is fatal if left untreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Despite advancements in medical and surgical treatments for IE, the in-hospital mortality is 15-20%, rising to 40% after one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. People at greatest risk of IE are those with pre-existing heart disease, a prosthetic heart valve, cancer, diabetes, the elderly or intravenous drug users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].</p><p id="P3">IE occurs when bacteria enter the blood via medical or dental procedures including toothbrushing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Bacteria then colonise the heart valves, particularly when they are damaged or have been replaced by a prosthetic device, triggering the formation of sterile platelet-fibrin microthrombi, to which bacteria can easily adhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Over 80% of cases of IE are caused by Gram-positive cocci, with one cohort study including 2781 participants revealing that <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, viridans group streptococci (VGS), and enterococci accounted for 31%, 17% and 10% of cases respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Leading VGS species include <italic>Streptococcus gordonnii</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], whilst <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> is the most common enterococcal cause of IE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Host survival depends on several weeks of antibiotic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], most commonly with a beta-lactam, in combination with gentamicin if an enterococcal species is involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Even with this duration of antibiotics, surgery is often required to completely eradicate infection and repair the damaged valve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Added to the challenges of IE treatment, the emergence of antibiotic resistance requires the use of less efficacious antibiotics. For example, vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, has long been used to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. However, 30% of enterococcal isolates in the USA are resistant, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifying VRE as a serious threat to public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The rise in multi-drug resistant VGS is also a growing threat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], with the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program estimating that approximately 31% are not fully susceptible to penicillin.</p><p id="P7">Since its approval for clinical use in 2003, the calcium-dependent cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic daptomycin has become an increasingly used option against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, including VRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Daptomycin demonstrates excellent <italic>in vitro</italic> bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria via a mechanism that disrupts both the membrane and cell wall biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, while the emergence of resistance to daptomycin has been reported in enterococci and streptococci, it is rare, with over 99% of enterococcal and streptococcal clinical isolates susceptible to the lipopeptide antibiotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. However, despite the low incidence of resistance to daptomycin and the antibiotic’s potent <italic>in vitro</italic> activity, daptomycin treatment fails to cure 14-24% of patients with enterococcal infection, resulting in poor patient prognoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p id="P9">The reasons behind the disparity between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacies are poorly understood, but there is increasing evidence that the host environment induces stress responses in bacteria that reduces their susceptibility to antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. For example, we have recently shown that human serum induces daptomycin tolerance in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> via changes to the cell wall and membrane, mediated in part via the induction of the GraRS two component system by the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].

Exposure to daptomycin was carried out in serum to control for binding of daptomycin by plasma proteins and to keep the calcium concentrations consistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>].
