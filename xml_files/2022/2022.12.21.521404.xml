Hence, inhibition of folate-mediated one carbon (1C) metabolism, which is required for nucleotide synthesis, has been successfully exploited in anti-cancer therapy. Here, we reveal that mitochondrial folate metabolism is upregulated in patient-derived leukaemic stem cells (LSCs). We demonstrate that inhibition of mitochondrial 1C metabolism through impairment of <italic>de novo</italic> purine synthesis has a cytostatic effect on chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cells. Consequently, changes in purine nucleotide levels lead to activation of AMPK signalling and suppression of mTORC1 activity. Notably, suppression of mitochondrial 1C metabolism increases expression of erythroid differentiation markers. Moreover, we find that increased differentiation occurs independently of AMPK signalling and can be reversed through reconstitution of purine levels and reactivation of mTORC1. Of clinical relevance, we identify that combination of 1C metabolism inhibition with imatinib, a frontline treatment for CML patients, decreases the number of therapy-resistant CML LSCs in a patient-derived xenograft model. Our results highlight a novel role for folate metabolism and purine sensing in stem cell fate decisions and leukaemogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Rapidly dividing cells require building blocks to sustain growth and proliferation. Folate metabolism, through a series of complementary cytosolic and mitochondrial reactions, provides 1C units for biosynthetic processes including nucleotide synthesis and the methionine cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.

In parallel, activated 1C units are carried via folate molecules, allowing their assembly in different oxidative states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">In agreement with its key role for nucleotide synthesis, mitochondrial SHMT2 and the immediately downstream 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD2), are consistently overexpressed in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Furthermore, serine catabolism to formate is increased in intestinal adenomas and mammary carcinomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Reinforcing of the requirement for folate metabolism in cancer, antifolates have proven highly effective as chemotherapeutic agents. Methotrexate, the most recognised antifolate, has been used in the treatment of a variety of neoplasms and inflammatory diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Importantly, antifolates have found a wide application in haematological malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, the role of folate metabolism in LSCs remains undescribed.</p><p id="P4">CML is a stem cell-driven myeloproliferative disorder that arises in a single haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) with the introduction of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. BCR-ABL, through activation of several molecular pathways including RAS, MYC and PI3K/AKT/mTOR, is the main driver of leukaemia initiation and progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. As exemplified in CML, increasing evidence suggests that stem cells, but not fully differentiated cells, are a major driver of neoplasms and therapy resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Oncogenic stem cells evade standard therapy due to their quiescent/slow-cycling status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. To maintain tissue homeostasis, stem cells, including HSCs, are characterised by their capacity to self-renew and their ability to differentiate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, identification of vulnerabilities that when targeted, can stimulate differentiation of stem/progenitor cell population can have potent anticancer effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Strikingly, slow-growing CML LSCs have been found to resist treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), even when BCR-ABL1 kinase activity is fully inhibited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. It has been established that BCR-ABL1 rewires metabolic programmes such as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and the tricarboxylic acid cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, targeting OXPHOS in combination with standard therapy was found to eradicate persistent LSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it was recently demonstrated that exogenous serine controls the cell fate of epidermal stem cells during tumour initiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. These studies highlight how metabolic rewiring of oncogenic stem cells might affect tumour initiation and persistence. In the present study, we describe deregulation of mitochondrial folate metabolism in leukaemic stem and progenitor cells. We demonstrate that inhibition of mitochondrial folate metabolism through impairment of <italic>de novo</italic> purine synthesis drives differentiation of CML cells. Mechanistically, we show that the differentiation following nucleotide depletion depends on suppression of mTORC1 activity through decreased purine sensing. Moreover, we uncover that inhibition of 1C metabolism sensitises human LSCs to standard CML therapy. Collectively, our results provide novel insight into the role of folate metabolism in critical cell fate decisions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mitochondrial folate metabolism is deregulated in LSCs and necessary for tumour formation <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P6">To assess whether folate metabolism is deregulated in primitive CML cells, we carried out differential gene expression analysis of a transcriptomic dataset generated from CML LSCs (CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-</sup>) and normal HSCs (CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that folate metabolism is upregulated in LSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Specifically, there was an upregulation of gene transcripts encoding enzymes involved in mitochondrial 1C reactions such as <italic>ALDH1L2</italic>, <italic>SHMT2</italic> and <italic>MTHFD2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). The upregulation of mitochondria-related genes supports the observation that most cancer cells produce 1C units exclusively in the mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. To confirm that folate metabolism is deregulated in primitive CML cells, we functionally determined the activity of folate metabolism in patient-derived CML CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and normal counterparts. To this end, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GS-MS) we assessed formate overflow as a proxy for the rate of serine catabolism. CML CD34<sup>+</sup> cells had an increased formate exchange rate and extracellular formate concentration compared to normal CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, confirming a higher rate of folate metabolism in CML cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We next analysed the consequences of 1C metabolism inhibition in CML K562 cells. We used the pharmacological SHMT1/2 inhibitor SHIN1 (which inhibits cytosolic and mitochondrial arms of the pathway)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, in parallel with a genetic knockout (KO) of mitochondrial SHMT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). Due to the reversibility of the cytosolic compartment of folate metabolism, mitochondrial 1C metabolism is believed to be dispensable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. As such, single deletions of mitochondrial enzymes do not consistently block cancer cell growth in nutrient rich conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Strikingly, we observed a proliferation halt following either pharmacological (cytosolic/mitochondrial) or genetic (mitochondrial) inhibition of 1C metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1f,g</xref>). Furthermore, SHIN1 treatment or SHMT2 KO resulted in accumulation of K562 cells in the S phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1h</xref>). Formate supplementation was sufficient to restore growth, indicating that 1C units are the limiting factor for proliferation and cell cycle progression of CML cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1f-h</xref>). To assess whether purine or thymidylate depletion caused the proliferation arrest following inhibition of 1C metabolism, we supplemented cells with the purine salvage precursor hypoxanthine, thymidine or a combination of both. While hypoxanthine rescued proliferation, thymidine did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1f-h</xref>). These data are consistent with the fact that purine biosynthesis requires a higher flux of 1C units compared to thymidylate synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. It is likely that in the short-term, residual 1C units can sustain thymidylate synthesis. Our findings support that nucleotide impairment following pharmacological or genetic inhibition of folate metabolism has a cytostatic effect on CML cells.</p><p id="P8">CML KCL22 cells form extramedullary tumours when transplanted in immunocompromised mice. To test whether loss of the folate cycle impairs tumour formation <italic>in vivo</italic>, KCL22 SHMT2 KO cells were transplanted via tail vain injection into non-irradiated immunocompromised mice. Loss of SHMT2 significantly prolonged tumour-free survival of xenografted mice, when compared with mice receiving SHMT2 competent control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). This correlated with a significant decrease in tumour burden in mice transplanted with KCL22 SHMT2 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). Together, these results suggest that mitochondrial 1C metabolism sustains proliferation of CML cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and cytosolic 1C metabolism does not compensate for the loss of SHMT2 in CML cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Inhibition of mitochondrial serine catabolism disrupts <italic>de novo</italic> purine synthesis and glycolysis in CML cells</title><p id="P9">Following the observation that mitochondrial 1C metabolism inhibition results in proliferation arrest due to impairment of purine biosynthesis, we sought to investigate the downstream metabolic effects of folate cycle suppression. As expected, metabolic analysis revealed that SHIN1 treatment or SHMT2 deficiency led to reduction of the glycine pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Moreover, formate supplementation resulted in a further decrease of glycine levels, as it restores the 1C unit pool and drives <italic>de novo</italic> purine synthesis bypassing SHMT1/2 activity. Notably, we observed a dramatic increase in the purine biosynthetic intermediate 5′-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR), and a corresponding reduction in purine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). Changes in purine nucleotide pools were reversed by formate. Surprisingly, we observed a reduction in the ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) pool, which is upstream of a step requiring glycine. R5P, apart from being an intermediate of purine/pyrimidine synthesis, is a product of the non-oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). Prompted by this reduction, we decided to investigate the effect of 1C metabolism inhibition on glycolysis related metabolites. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of 1C metabolism resulted in increased intracellular glucose levels and decreased pyruvate and lactate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). Subsequently, quantitative analysis of the media from SHIN1-treated or SHMT2 KO cells confirmed a significant reduction in glucose uptake and lactate secretion, when compared with media from 1C metabolism competent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Fig. 2e</xref>). To confirm the decrease in glycolytic flux, we measured the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) following suppression of 1C metabolism. SHIN1 treatment or SHMT2 ablation reduced both glycolysis and glycolytic capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2f,g</xref>). Of note, formate supplementation reversed the decrease in glycolytic flux, suggesting that impaired glycolysis was linked to reduced nucleotide levels. This is in agreement with our previous work where we applied theoretical modelling to indicate that 1C metabolism promotes glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Suppression of mitochondrial folate metabolism leads to differentiation of CML cells in an AMPK-independent manner</title><p id="P10">Since AICAR and purine nucleotides can directly or indirectly signal to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, we next sought to investigate the effect of mitochondrial folate metabolism inhibition on AMPK activity. Indeed, SHIN1 treatment and SHMT2 KO induced AMPK activity, measured by increased phosphorylation of AMPK on threonine-172, and increased phosphorylation of the two AMPK effectors, acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC) and Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Increased ULK1-dependent phosphorylation of the autophagy related 13 (ATG13) protein suggests activation of the autophagy initiation complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Concurrently, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of folate metabolism reduced phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6), a target of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Treatment with AICAR resulted in a similar pattern of AMPK signalling activation and mTORC1 suppression, while combination of AICAR with folate metabolism inhibition did not have any additive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Additionally, formate supplementation reversed the effect on AMPK and mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P11">In addition to being an activator of AMPK, AICAR has been shown to promote differentiation of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Thus, we next assessed whether inhibition of mitochondrial folate metabolism induces differentiation of CML K562 cells. These cells have been shown to be a suitable model to study differentiation, as they undergo erythroid maturation when treated with differentiation-inducing compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Macroscopic examination revealed that cell pellets appeared with a strong red colour following inhibition of mitochondrial serine catabolism, which suggests a higher haemoglobin production and, ultimately, an increase in erythroid maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data 3b</xref>). To confirm initiation of erythroid maturation, we stained K562 cells for erythropoiesis markers: Glycophorin A (GlyA), a sialoglycoprotein found in the membrane of erythrocytes, and transferrin receptor 1 (CD71), a transmembrane glycoprotein necessary for iron import inside the cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. SHIN1 treatment resulted in enhanced levels of GlyA and CD71 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Similarly, expression of GlyA and CD71 increased following loss of SHMT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). Of note, AICAR treatment promoted expression of GlyA and CD71 to the same extent as SHIN1, while we did not observe any additive effect when combining AICAR with SHIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Restoration of the 1C unit pool through formate supplementation was sufficient to reverse expression of erythroid markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). To further assess the role of folate metabolism in differentiation of CML cells, we cultured patient-derived CML CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with low concentration (3U/ml) of erythropoietin, required to sensitise cells to erythroid commitment. As observed with K562 cells, SHIN1 treatment increased levels of GlyA and CD71 in four separate CML CD34<sup>+</sup> patient samples, while formate supplementation reversed enhanced expression of erythroid markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). As AICAR was found to induce differentiation of AML cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, we hypothesised that folate metabolism inhibition would elicit a similar effect on AML cells. To address this, we took advantage of two monocytic AML cell lines, THP1 and MOLM13, which express monocytic surface markers such as CD11b. Increased expression of CD11b correlates with differentiation into the myeloid lineage. Pharmacological inhibition of 1C metabolism resulted in increased expression of CD11b, indicating that SHIN1 treatment induces myeloid differentiation in AML cells, and, therefore, the effect is not specific to K562 cells and erythroid differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Maturation of progenitor cells has been associated with increased oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore, we measured levels of mitochondrial superoxide following SHIN1 treatment. Surprisingly, SHMT1/2 inhibition resulted in decreased mitochondrial ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Moreover, addition of the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) did not reverse the enhanced expression of GlyA and CD71 in SHIN1 treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). These data suggest that initiation of differentiation following inhibition of folate metabolism is not a result of increased ROS production. We next sought to investigate whether AMPK activation was playing a role in differentiation of CML cells. We generated AMPKα1 AMPKα2 double-knockout (DKO) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3e</xref>), and measured levels of erythroid markers following incubation with either SHIN1 or AICAR. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in expression of erythroid markers between SHIN1-treated control and AMPKα DKO cells, indicating that initiation of differentiation is not dependent on AMPK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Intriguingly, inhibition of folate metabolism suppressed mTORC1 activity in AMPKα DKO cells, measured by decreased phosphorylation of ULK1 on serine-757 and RPS6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). The effect of AICAR on mTORC1 activity was reversed in AMPKα DKO cells, suggesting that AMPK signalling is required for AICAR-induced mTORC1 suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>).</p><p id="P13">mTORC1 and AMPK integrate energy signals to balance anabolic and catabolic pathways, including autophagy. When assessing levels of autophagy markers in AMPKα DKO cells, we observed that SHIN1 promoted reduction in the autophagy cargo receptor sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) and accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B-II), indicating induction of the autophagic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). To assess whether autophagy inhibition could reverse the SHIN1-driven differentiation, we utilised two autophagy inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which blocks the fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, and a recently developed inhibitor of ULK1, MRT403<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. HCQ and MRT403 were sufficient to reverse SHIN1-driven differentiation in control and AMPKα DKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>). Furthermore, SHIN1 treatment did not significantly induce expression of GlyA and CD71 in autophagy deficient, ULK1 KO and autophagy related 7 (ATG7) KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data Fig. 3f,g</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that inhibition of mitochondrial 1C metabolism induces differentiation of CML cells in an AMPK independent manner, while autophagy inhibition reverses such effect.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Impairment of purine biosynthesis drives differentiation of CML cells through inhibition of mTORC1 signalling</title><p id="P14">Having established that suppression of mitochondrial folate metabolism drives differentiation and suppression of mTORC1 activity independently of AMPK, we asked whether there is a link between mTORC1 signalling and differentiation. It has been previously described that mTORC1 senses acute changes in purine nucleotide levels, and more specifically adenylates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. To determine if this is the case in CML cells, we supplemented hypoxanthine in SHIN1-treated or SHMT2 KO cells and assessed mTORC1 activity. As expected, SHIN1 treatment decreased phosphorylation of the direct mTORC1 kinase target S6 (S6K) and RPS6, while hypoxanthine rescued mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). Importantly, short-term (1 h) supplementation of hypoxanthine was sufficient to reverse mTORC1 signalling, supporting the notion that mTORC1 can acutely sense changes in purine levels. As anticipated, mTORC1 was not reactivated following thymidine supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). Furthermore, long-term (24 h) hypoxanthine supplementation repressed AMPK signalling in SHIN1-treated cells, whereas short-term hypoxanthine had a modest effect on AMPK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). The pattern of mTORC1 signalling strongly correlated with expression of erythropoiesis markers, with hypoxanthine reversing enhanced levels of GlyA and CD71 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In addition to hypoxanthine, adenine treatment restored mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). Long-term guanine supplementation partially reactivated mTORC1, whereas short-term supplementation did not have any effect on mTORC1 signalling. Moreover, only adenine, but not guanine supplementation, repressed increased levels of erythroid maturation markers following 1C metabolism inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Similarly, while long-term adenine supplementation fully restored mTORC1 signalling and reversed differentiation in AMPKα DKO, guanine partially reactivated mTORC1, which was not sufficient to reverse differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>). To further assess whether mTORC1 inhibition was sufficient to induce differentiation, we treated CML cells with rapamycin and measured levels of erythropoiesis markers. Rapamycin enhanced levels of GlyA and CD71 to the same extent as SHIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>). Of note, combination of SHIN1 with rapamycin modestly increased levels of GlyA and CD71 compared to SHIN1 monotherapy, however this did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>). Ultimately, to confirm the role of mTORC1 activity in CML differentiation, we generated tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). TSC2 is part of the tumour suppressor TSC complex that maintains mTORC1 inactive through the regulation of Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb). Additionally, TSC2 has been shown to be required for purine sensing by mTORC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, loss of TSC2 diminished the effect of SHIN1 on mTORC1 signalling and differentiation in CML cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g,h</xref>). As expected, rapamycin suppressed mTORC1 activity and induced expression of erythroid maturation markers in TSC2 KO cells in line with Fig. S4D. Together, these data uncover that mitochondrial 1C metabolism inhibition mediates differentiation through modulation of the mTORC1 pathway.</p><p id="P15">Having determined a link between inhibition of folate metabolism, purine sensing through mTORC1 and differentiation, we sought to further explore the mechanism behind AICAR-induced differentiation. Metabolomic analysis revealed that AICAR treatment significantly decreased the pyrimidine nucleotide pool, while it did not have any significant effect on purine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4e</xref>). It is also worth noting that SHIN1 did not alter levels of pyrimidine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>). These findings are in agreement with previous literature suggesting that AICAR induces differentiation through pyrimidine depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. To further examine whether impairment of <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine synthesis results in differentiation of CML cells, we treated K562 cells with the uridine analogue 6-azauridine. 6-azauridine blocks the conversion of orotate to uridine monophosphate (UMP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j</xref>). Strikingly, impairment of pyrimidine biosynthesis enhanced expression of erythropoiesis markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4k</xref>). Uridine supplementation reversed differentiation, supporting that 6-azauridine treatment induced maturation through depletion of pyrimidine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4k</xref>). Moreover, 6-azauridine had a minimal effect on mTORC1 activity, measured by decreased phosphorylation of RPS6, although not to the same extent as SHIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4l</xref>). Pyrimidine depletion through 6-azauridine treatment mediated erythroid maturation in TSC2-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4m</xref>), suggesting that differentiation following pyrimidine impairment is not dependent on mTORC1 modulation. Overall, these results reveal that impairment of <italic>de novo</italic> nucleotide synthesis results in differentiation of CML cells.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>SHIN1 selectively targets LSCs in combination with standard CML therapy</title><p id="P16">As previously highlighted, CML is a paradigm for stem cell driven malignancies, as it originates in a single HSC following the generation of the BCR-ABL1 fusion oncoprotein. While the introduction of TKIs such as imatinib has significantly improved response rates of CML patients, disease initiating LSCs are insensitive to TKI therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, having established that folate metabolism is deregulated in LSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), we sought to investigate the combinatory effect of SHIN1 and imatinib treatment on 1C metabolism and survival of primitive CML cells. First, we used stable isotope labelled <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub><sup>15</sup>N<sub>1</sub>-serine to determine the effect of imatinib on serine metabolism in K562 cells. Due to SHMT reversibility, serine’s labelling pattern consists of a mixture of m+1, m+3, m+4 isotopologues, reflecting the different recombination events with labelled and unlabelled glycine and 1C units derived from methylene-THF. As expected, SHIN1 treatment increased the abundance of m+4 serine isotopologue, while it dramatically decreased m+1 and m+3 fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Additionally, it resulted in decreased abundance of m+3 glycine isotopologue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Of note, imatinib did not alter the serine and glycine labelling pattern, suggesting that SHMT activity was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Through generation of glycine, folate metabolism contributes to glutathione (GSH) production, the most abundant antioxidant in the cell. Strikingly, serine incorporation into GSH and its oxidised form (GSSG) persisted in TKI-treated K562 cells, while SHIN1 completely abrogated the contribution of extracellular serine to GSH and GSSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). It should be mentioned that imatinib, similarly to SHIN1, reduced serine labelling into the purine nucleotide pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). Furthermore, serine contribution to glycine, GSH and GSSG was maintained in imatinib-treated primary CML CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, while SHIN1, and consequently, combination of SHIN1 with imatinib, significantly reduced levels of relevant labelled fractions in GSH and GSSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5d</xref>). These data suggest that TKI therapy does not affect the incorporation of serine into GSH, implying a sustained ability for TKI treated CML cells to maintain redox defence.</p><p id="P17">Given the antiproliferative effect observed following mitochondrial folate metabolism inhibition in K562 cells and <italic>in vivo</italic>, we labelled CML CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with a fluorescent tracer of cell division (CTV) and treated them with imatinib, SHIN1 or a combination of both. Simultaneously, we supplemented SHIN1-treated cells with formate, to assess whether we could recapitulate the findings obtained in K562 cells. SHIN1, alone or in combination with imatinib, impaired the proliferation of primary CML CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, even to a greater extent than imatinib alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). Formate supplementation restored proliferation in SHIN1 treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). Furthermore, SHIN1 and imatinib single treatments reduced the colony formation potential of patient-derived CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (n=7) in colony-forming cell (CFC) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). Moreover, SHIN1 sensitised CD34<sup>+</sup> cells to TKI treatment.

In contrast, neither single agent nor combination treatment affected the colony forming potential of normal CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Encouragingly, using two separate primary CML samples, a combination of folate metabolism inhibition with TKI therapy reduced colony formation in a long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assay, the most stringent <italic>in vitro</italic> stem cell assay, suggesting that 1C metabolism is critical for the survival of CML LSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To further examine the clinical relevance of our findings, we utilised a robust CML xenotransplantation model.

A significant decrease in the relative number of human LSCs was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6d</xref>). Notably imatinib increased the total number of LSCs, supporting literature that suggests that TKI therapy enriches for the most primitive population of LSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6j</xref>). Together these data highlight that 1C metabolism inhibition sensitises therapy resistant LSCs to targeted therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">Our findings demonstrate an undescribed role for mitochondrial folate metabolism in CML, a malignancy with a well-established cancer stem cell hierarchy. Previous work from our lab highlighted the importance of mitochondrial metabolism, and particularly OXPHOS, in therapy resistant LSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it has been reported that increased serine catabolism to formate is a hallmark of oxidative cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, while targeting folate metabolism is an active area of research in cancer, the role of 1C metabolism in CML LSCs is unexplored. We show that folate metabolism is deregulated in human stem and progenitor cells. This deregulation is mainly driven by the differential expression of three mitochondrial-specific enzymes, ALDH1L2, SHMT2 and MTHFD2. Moreover, we found that mitochondrial folate metabolism, primarily through its contribution to purine biosynthesis, is essential for CML cell proliferation and tumour formation in mice. Specifically, we demonstrate that inhibition of mitochondrial 1C metabolism through loss of SHMT2 inhibits tumour formation capacity of CML cells. This is in contrast to work from Ducker <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> which showed that HCT-116 colon cancer cells, engineered with mitochondrial 1C enzyme deletions, form xenograft tumours by generating cytosolic 1C units from serine via the enzyme SHMT1.</p><p id="P20">Additionally, our work demonstrates that depletion of 1C units and purine nucleotides results in differentiation of CML K562 cells and patient-derived progenitor cells. We show that the differentiation is not a consequence of increased ROS, one of the main drivers of differentiation in HSCs. We also conclude that initiation of differentiation does not depend on AMPK activity but is linked to purine sensing through mTORC1 signalling. Recent work has described that impairment of purine biosynthesis leads to inactivation of mTORC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it has also been reported that mTORC1 promotes serine catabolism to formate and purine biosynthesis through induction of the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, supporting the existence of a positive feedback loop between folate metabolism, <italic>de novo</italic> purine synthesis and mTORC1 signalling. Here, we observe that while pharmacological inhibition of 1C metabolism leads to suppression of mTORC1 activity, this can be rescued either by reconstitution of 1C units or purine nucleotides, preferably adenine. These findings are consistent with the study of Hoxhaj <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> which demonstrated that mTORC1 acutely senses changes in adenylates rather than guanylates. Furthermore, our data support that reactivation of mTORC1 correlates with suppression of differentiation. Ultimately, we found that purine depletion fails to suppress mTORC1 activity and induce erythroid maturation in TSC2-deficient cells, supporting that purine sensing through the mTORC1 network mediates differentiation of CML cells. Additionally, we described that pyrimidine depletion initiates differentiation of CML cells, while it only modestly affects mTORC1 activity. These data suggest that impairment of pyrimidine biosynthesis induces differentiation through a separate mechanism, independently of mTORC1 signalling. Indeed, in agreement with our data, it has been recently suggested that pyrimidine depletion alters cell fate of AML cells through DNA replication stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup></p><p id="P21">In terms of clinical relevance, we found that folate metabolism inhibition synergises with TKI treatment to target therapy insensitive LSCs. Resistance of LSCs to standard therapy has been associated with their undifferentiated and quiescent state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Thus, we propose that LSCs upregulate folate metabolism to drive leukaemogenesis, without significantly deregulating the normal differentiation process. Intriguingly, Dohla <italic>et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup></italic> uncovered that in stem-like human mammary epithelial cells, purine synthesis was upregulated in daughter cells that were destined to maintain stemness. We suggest that inhibition of folate metabolism through impairment of purine biosynthesis can prime LSCs out of quiescence and thereby sensitise them to TKI therapy, which preferentially targets more differentiated cells. Notably, TKI therapy was found to maintain serine incorporation to GSH and GSSG, suggesting that the synergistic effect with folate metabolism inhibition might be related to impeded antioxidant defence. Serine metabolism contributes to the maintenance of the GSH pool in two ways. Firstly, serine-derived glycine combines with cysteine and glutamate to form GSH. Secondly, serine catabolism contributes to generation of mitochondrial NADPH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, which is consumed during the reduction of GSSG to GSH. Whether alterations of the GSH pool sensitises cells to TKI therapy requires further investigation.</p><p id="P22">Lastly, it has been shown that suppression of MTHFD2 leads to differentiation of AML cells. Pikman <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> demonstrated that formate supplementation did not restore proliferation following suppression of MTHFD2, implying that the antiproliferative effect of MTHFD2 ablation was not a result of 1C unit depletion. In the present study, we describe that folate metabolism inhibition initiates differentiation of AML cells, and this can be reversed by addition of formate. Moreover, together these data indicate that mitochondrial 1C metabolism is a targetable vulnerability for myeloid leukaemias and suggest that folate metabolism-driven differentiation may have a broader application to related malignancies of stem cell origin. Given that <italic>SHMT2</italic> and <italic>MTHFD2</italic> are overexpressed in cancer, mitochondrial 1C metabolism inhibitors might be more selective than cytosolic antifolates like methotrexate. Methotrexate inhibits the activity of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), but has affinity for folate-dependent enzymes such as thymidylate synthase (TYMS) and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.

For the analysis, 5 μl of metabolite extracts were injected into the system, and metabolites were separated over a 15 min mobile phase gradient decreasing the acetonitrile content to 20%, at a flow rate of 200 μl/min and a column temperature of 45°C. Metabolites were then detected using the mass spectrometer operating in polarity switching mode. All metabolites were detected across a mass range of 75 – 1000 m/z at a resolution of 35,000 (at 200 m/z), and with a mass accuracy below 5 ppm. Data were acquired using Thermo Xcalibur software. The peak areas of different metabolites were determined using the TraceFinder 4.1 software (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Metabolites were identified by accurate mass of the singly charged ion and by known retention times on the pHILIC column.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Stable isotope enrichment analysis using <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub><sup>15</sup>N<sub>1</sub>-serine</title><p id="P36">For tracing experiments, K562 cells and primary CML cells were cultured in Plasmax, a physiological cell culture medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, containing 140 μM <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub><sup>15</sup>N<sub>1</sub>-serine (catalogue no.
