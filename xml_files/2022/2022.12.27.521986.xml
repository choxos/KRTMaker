Our phylogenetic analyses suggested that XBB emerged by recombination of two co-circulating BA.2 lineages, BJ.1 and BM.1.1.1 (a progeny of BA.2.75), during the summer of 2022 around India. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments revealed that XBB is the most profoundly resistant variant to BA.2/5 breakthrough infection sera ever and is more fusogenic than BA.2.75. Notably, the recombination breakpoint is located in the receptor-binding domain of spike, and each region of recombined spike conferred immune evasion and augmented fusogenicity to the XBB spike. Finally, the intrinsic pathogenicity of XBB in hamsters is comparable to or even lower than that of BA.2.75. Our multiscale investigation provided evidence suggesting that XBB is the first documented SARS-CoV-2 variant increasing its fitness through recombination rather than single mutations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Omicron</kwd><kwd>XBB</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd><kwd>transmissibility</kwd><kwd>immune resistance</kwd><kwd>pathogenicity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is the current variant of concern since the end of 2021 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>). As of December 2022, recently emerging Omicron subvariants are under convergent evolution: recently emerging variants acquired substitutions at the same residues of the spike (S) protein, such as R346, K444, L452, N460, and F486<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. For instance, Omicron BQ.1.1 variant, which is a descendant of Omicron BA.5 and is currently becoming predominant in the Western countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, possesses all convergent substitutions, such as R346T, K444T, L452R, N460K, and F486V. Recent studies including ours suggested that L452R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, N460K<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and R346T<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> increase the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for viral infection, while R346T<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, K444T<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and F486V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> contribute to evade antiviral humoral immunity induced by vaccination and natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar to the observations in BA.5 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>) and BA.2.75 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>), combinational substitutions in S protein (1) to evade antiviral humoral immunity in exchange for the decrease of ACE2 binding affinity (e.g., F486V) and (2) to enhance ACE2 binding affinity to compensate the decreased affinity by immune evasion substitution (e.g., L452R and N460K) has been frequently observed in recently emerging Omicron subvariants including BQ.1.1. These observations suggest that acquiring these two types of substitutions in the S protein is a trend for recently emerging Omicron subvariants to spread more efficiently than prior ones.</p><p id="P3">In addition to the diversification and subsequent convergent evolution of emerging Omicron subvariants (e.g., BQ.1.1), a recombinant variant, called XBB, has recently emerged. The Omicron XBB variant likely originated by the recombination of two BA.2 descendants, BJ.1 and BM.1.1.1 (a progeny of BA.2.75)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. While the BQ.1 lineage is becoming predominant in Europe, XBB has become predominant in India and Singapore and is spreading several countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. As of October 28, 2022, the WHO classifies XBB as an Omicron subvariant under monitoring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.

Of these, highly diversified BA.2 subvariants, such as BA.2.75 and BJ.1, have emerged in South Asia and are referred to as the second-generation BA.2 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Recently, the XBB variant emerged as a recombinant lineage between the second generation BA.2 variants, BJ.1 and BM.1.1.1 (BA.2.75.3.1.1.1; a descendant of BA.2.75)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).

To trace the recombination event that led to the emergence of the XBB variant, we retrieved all SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited to GISAID (as of October 3, 2022) with PANGO lineage designation matching BJ.1, BM.1, XBB, and all their descendant lineages (including BM.1.1, BM.1.1.1, and XBB.1). Recombination analysis on the aligned set of sequences, using RDP5 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>), robustly picks up a single recombination breakpoint unique to all XBB sequences at the genomic position 22,920 (matching the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). No evidence of recombination was found in the BJ.1 and BM.1 sequences in the dataset. Consistent with the result of the RDP5 analysis, the visual inspection of the nucleotide differences between the consensus sequences of XBB, BJ.1, and BM.1 (including BM.1.1 and BM.1.1.1) clearly illustrates that the XBB identity to BJ.1 ends at the genome position 22,942 and the XBB identity to BM.1 starts after position 22,896 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Together, our recombination analysis suggests that the recombination breakpoint is between positions 22,897 and 22,941, within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein (corresponding to amino acid positions 445-460) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P5">We then split the sequence alignment at position 22,920 to determine the evolutionary history of each non-recombinant segment of the XBB genomes.

Using the longer 5’ end non-recombinant part of these genomes, we estimated the emergence date of XBB based on the inferred root-to-tip regression (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). This analysis suggests that the XBB clade stemmed from the major BJ.1 clade in the span from July 22 to August 5, 2022 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Furthermore, we inferred the emergence region of XBB by a discrete ancestral state reconstruction utilizing a Markov model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). Most of the earlier isolates of XBB were sampled in India, and our analysis suggests that the ancestral state (i.e., the circulating region) of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of XBB sequences is likely India (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <bold>Extended Data Fig. S1b</bold>).

In the present study, we used the major S haplotype of XBB lineages as of October 3, 2022, corresponding to the S protein of XBB.1, for the following experiments (hereafter we simply refer to XBB.1 as XBB). In the case of breakthrough BA.2 infection sera, BA.2.75 did not exhibit significant resistance when compared to BA.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), which is consistent with our prior study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In contrast, we found that XBB exhibits a profound (30-fold) resistance to breakthrough BA.2 infection sera (<italic>P</italic>=0.0002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). To determine amino acid substitutions conferring the profound resistance to the breakthrough anti sera, we constructed the BA.2 S mutants which harbor respective single substitutions present in XBB. We did not analyze the substitutions present also in BA.2.75 (e.g., G446S) since we have already analyzed these substitutions in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, several substitutions such as V83A (2.1-fold, <italic>P</italic>=0.0034), Y144del (2.9-fold, <italic>P</italic>=0.0002), Q183E (2.0-fold, <italic>P</italic>=0.0039), R346T (2.1-fold, <italic>P</italic>=0.0005), L368I (1.8-fold, <italic>P</italic>=0.042), V445P (2.1-fold, <italic>P</italic>=0.0002), F486S (3.0-fold, <italic>P</italic>=0.0002), and F490S (2.7-fold, <italic>P</italic>=0.024) conferred significant resistance to breakthrough BA.2 infection sera. Because the immune resistance conferred by respective substitution is relatively minor when compared to the resistance of XBB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), our data suggest that multiple substitutions in the XBB S cooperatively contribute to the resistance against humoral immunity induced by breakthrough BA.2 infection.</p><p id="P9">Consistent with our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, BA.2.75 showed a statistically significant (1.8-fold) resistance to breakthrough BA.5 infection sera when compared to BA.2 (<italic>P</italic>=0.0016, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).

As described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a–c</xref>), the four RBD substitutions in XBB compared to BA.2, D339H, G446S, N460K and R493Q, are common to BA.2.75 since a part of RBD of XBB S is derived from the BA.2.75/BM.1 lineage. In our previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, we demonstrated that the N460K substitution augments ACE2 binding affinity. To address whether other substitutions in the XBB S affect the binding affinity of S RBD to human ACE2, we prepared a repertoire of BA.2 S RBD that possesses an XBB-specific substitution compared to BA.2. Consistent with our recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, the R346T substitution, which is common in both XBB and BQ.1.1, significantly increased the binding affinity of BA.2 S RBD to human ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Additionally, the L368I substitution also augmented ACE2 binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).

Because the F486V substitution also decreased ACE2 binding affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, our data suggest that the amino acid substitution at F486 leads to attenuated ACE2 binding affinity. Our results suggested that the enhanced binding affinity of XBB S RBD compared to BA.2 S RBD is attributed to at least three substitutions in the RBD: R346T, L368I and N460K<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the K<sub>D</sub> value of XBB S RBD was clearly higher than that of BA.2.75 S RBD (0.18±0.069) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In our prior study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, we showed that the D339H substitution contributes to the augment of ACE2 binding affinity only when the backbone is the BA.2.75 S RBD.

Furthermore, XBB shows substantially higher R<sub>e</sub> than the parental lineages, suggesting that the recombination event increased R<sub>e</sub> (i.e., viral fitness). To our knowledge, this is the first documented example of a SARS-CoV-2 variant increasing its fitness through recombination rather than single mutations. Furthermore, we showed that the R<sub>e</sub> values of XBB lineages are comparable with or slightly higher than those of BQ.1 lineages, and XBB and BQ.1 lineages are becoming dominants in Eastern and Western Hemisphere, respectively. Since XBB lineages are rapidly spreading also in Western countries such as the USA, this regional difference is likely explained simply by the distance from the emergence regions of these lineages rather than caused by the fact that viral fitness changes depending on circulated regions. Together, although XBB now circulates mainly in countries around India, this variant has a potential to spread worldwide in the near future.</p><p id="P21">Compared to BA.5, BA.2.75 and even BQ.1.1 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>), the most remarkable feature of XBB is the profound resistance to antiviral humoral immunity induced by breakthrough infections of prior Omicron subvariants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). In fact, our analyses showed that 10 out of 14 breakthrough BA.2 infection sera and 9 out of 20 breakthrough BA.5 infection sera fail to neutralize XBB. The neutralization experiments using single mutants showed that multiple substitutions in the XBB S protein cooperatively contribute to the immune resistance of XBB, and particularly, not only the substitutions in the RBD but also at least a mutation in the NTD, Y144del, closely associates with the immune resistant property of XBB. The effect of Y144del mutation on immune resistance is reported in a recent study by Cao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and this mutation has been observed in previous variants of concern such as Alpha and Omicron BA.1. Furthermore, we previously showed that the Mu variant, one of the previous variants of interest, also has a mutation in the region including Y144 (i.e., YY144-145TSN), which contributes to the robust immune escape of this variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Additionally, the region including Y144 is proposed that it is one of the major epitopes of NTD targeting neutralization antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Together, these observations suggest that Y144del mutation in XBB S contributed to escape from these NTD targeting neutralization antibodies.</p><p id="P22">A series of our previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> showed that the substitutions in S proteins associating with the escape from humoral immunity tend to lead to acquire substitutions enhancing the ACE2 binding affinity or viral infectivity probably to compensate for the negative effects of the immune escape-associated substitutions on the ACE2 binding affinity. In the present study, we show that XBB harbors both the immune escape-associated substitutions (i.e., Y144del and F486S) and the infectivity-enhancing substitutions (i.e., V83A and N460K). Importantly, XBB emerged through recombination in the <italic>S</italic> gene, and Y144del and V83A are located on the 5’ recombinant fragment while F486S and N460K are on the 3’ fragment. This means that XBB acquired two sets of a pair of immune escape-associated and infectivity-enhancing substitutions by only one recombination event. Harboring the two sets of the substitution pairs would be one of the causes why XBB shows higher R<sub>e</sub> than other Omicron subvariants. Together, although XBB emerged via a unique evolutionary pathway, our data suggest that XBB also follows the same evolutionary rule with other Omicron subvariants.</p><p id="P23">Although BQ.1.1, another Omicron subvariant of concern at the end of 2022, acquired these two types of mutation by convergent substitutions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, XBB acquired them by a recombination event. In terms of the evolutionary strategy to acquire these two types of mutations, XBB emerged in a unique way.</p><p id="P24">In our previous studies focusing on some Omicron subvariants such as BA.1 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>), BA.2 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>), BA.5 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>), and BA.2.75 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>), viral fusogenicity in <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental setup was well correlated to viral intrinsic pathogenicity in a hamster model. However, although the fusogenicity of XBB was greater than that of BA.2.75, one of the parental lineages of XBB, the intrinsic pathogenicity of XBB was comparable or even lower than that of BA.2.75. The discrepancy between viral fusogenicity and intrinsic pathogenicity was also observed in another Omicron subvariant of concern at the end of 2022, BQ.1.1 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>). The discrepancy between viral fusogenicity and intrinsic pathogenicity may be explained by at least three possibilities. First, certain mutations in the non-S region of the XBB genome can attenuate viral pathogenicity augmented by the higher fusogenicity compared with BA.2.75. There are at least seven substitutions in the non-S region of XBB when compared to that of BA.2.75, and some of these mutations may attenuate the viral intrinsic pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Second, a theoretical study by Sasaki, Lion, and Boots provided a possibility that antigenic escape can augment viral pathogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Since we demonstrated that at least two descendants of BA.2, BA.5 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>) and BA.2.75 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>), increased their intrinsic pathogenicity, this theory may explain the evolution of Omicron. More importantly, this theory also predicts that there is a limitation to increase viral pathogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Together with our observations, it might be possible to assume that the pathogenicity of Omicron lineage already reaches a plateau. Third, in the cases of BQ.1.1 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>) and XBB, it might be possible that the tropism and affinity of S proteins of these variants are different between human ACE2 and hamster ACE2, and therefore, a hamster model may not reproduce the human condition.</p><p id="P25">In summary, our results suggested that XBB is highly transmissible and resistant to the antiviral humoral immunity induced by breakthrough infections of prior Omicron variants. Although various “local variants” including XBB have simultaneously and convergently emerged in late 2022, local variants showing a higher transmissibility will eventually spread to the whole world, like XBB. Therefore, continued in-depth viral genomic surveillance and real-time evaluation of the risk of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, even though considered local variants at the time of emergence, should be crucial.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="P26">All experiments with hamsters were performed in accordance with the Science Council of Japan's Guidelines for the Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments.
