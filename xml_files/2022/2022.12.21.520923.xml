CHC17 performs endocytosis and housekeeping membrane traffic in all cells. CHC22, expressed most highly in skeletal muscle, transports the glucose transporter GLUT4 from the endoplasmic-reticulum-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) directly to an intracellular GLUT4 storage compartment (GSC) from where GLUT4 can be mobilized to the plasma membrane by insulin. Here, the molecular determinants distinguishing CHC22 from CHC17 trafficking are defined. The C-terminal trimerization domain of CHC22 binds SNX5, which also binds the ERGIC tether p115. SNX5, and the functionally redundant SNX6, are required for CHC22 localization independently of their participation in the endosomal ESCPE-1 complex. In tandem, an isoform-specific patch in the CHC22 N-terminal domain separately mediates binding to p115. This dual mode of clathrin recruitment, involving interactions at both heavy chain termini, is required for CHC22 targeting to ERGIC membranes to mediate the Golgi bypass route for GLUT4 traffic. Interference with either interaction inhibits GLUT4 targeting to the GSC, defining a bipartite mechanism regulating a key pathway in human glucose metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Clathrin</kwd><kwd>CHC22</kwd><kwd>sorting nexin 5</kwd><kwd>Glgi bypass</kwd><kwd>p115</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Clathrin coats mediate some of the major routes for vesicular intracellular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Briant <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Humans, along with several other vertebrate species, express two types of clathrin, each comprising a separate isoform of clathrin heavy chain, CHC17 and CHC22, named for their encoding human chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Fumagalli <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wakeham <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). CHC17 clathrin is the canonical form that performs receptor-mediated endocytosis and a range of intracellular trafficking pathways in all eukaryotic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Briant <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). CHC22 clathrin, is expressed most highly in skeletal muscle, and is essential for trafficking the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 to an intracellular storage compartment (GSC) where GLUT4 awaits insulin-induced translocation to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Camus <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Esk <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hoshino <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Vassilopoulos <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). This translocation pathway is responsible for 70% of post-prandial glucose clearance from the bloodstream in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bogan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gould <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Leto &amp; Saltiel, 2012</xref>) and malfunction of GLUT4 membrane traffic is associated with Type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bogan, 2012</xref>). CHC22 shares 85% sequence identity with CHC17, yet is distinct in both its intracellular recruitment profile and biochemical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dannhauser <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). For GLUT4 targeting to the GSC, CHC22 operates at the Endoplasmic Reticulum to Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC), bypassing the Golgi, in a pathway that is not mediated by CHC17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Camus <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). This study addresses the molecular mechanism of this CHC22 recruitment to the early secretory pathway to establish how its membrane association is regulated and ultimately how CHC22 might be manipulated to affect human glucose metabolism.</p><p id="P4">The main mechanism by which CHC17 is recruited to intracellular membranes is via the binding of its N-terminal domain (TD) to a variety of adaptors that recognize both phosphoinositides and membrane-embedded cargo. These include the heterotetrametric adaptors AP1 and AP2, which recruit CHC17 to endosomes and the plasma membrane respectively, as well as the monomeric GGA adaptors that enable protein sorting at endosomes and the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Briant <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lemmon &amp; Traub, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Robinson &amp; Bonifacino, 2001</xref>). The CHC17 TD has a seven-bladed β-propeller structure that binds adaptors at four identified sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lemmon &amp; Traub, 2012</xref>). Equivalent binding sites on the CHC22 TD are predicted by sequence homology. However, CHC22 does not bind AP2, nor functions at the plasma membrane in receptor-mediated endocytosis, while demonstrating preferential binding to GGA2 compared to CHC17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dannhauser <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). This latter interaction, plus CHC22 binding to AP1, may account for CHC22 function in sorting GLUT4 from endosomes back to the GSC following re-uptake from the plasma membrane by CHC17 after insulin-stimulated GLUT4 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Esk <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gould <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). CHC22 function at the ERGIC to form the GSC is attributed to its isoform-specific participation in a complex that includes the ERGIC tether protein p115 and insulin-responsive-amino peptidase (IRAP), which binds both p115 and GLUT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Camus <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hosaka <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), but whether this involves binding by the CHC22 TD and/or requires additional partner proteins, has not been established.</p><p id="P5">Yeast-two-hybrid assays identified sorting nexin 5 (SNX5) as a protein that binds CHC22 but not CHC17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Towler <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) in a domain that for CHC17 interacts with clathrin light chain (CLC) subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Wilbur <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). While yeast two-hybrid assays could also detect CLC binding to this domain of CHC22, the CLCs do not appear to associate with CHC22 in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dannhauser <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). SNX5 and the functionally-redundant paralogue protein SNX6 comprise a membrane-remodeling BAR domain and a Phox homology (PX) domain, with the latter binding cargo instead of the canonical lipid PX domain ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kvainickas <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Simonetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Although initially implicated in Retromer sorting at endosomes by homology with yeast proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Rojas <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Simonetti &amp; Cullen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">van Weering <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wassmer <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), it is now established that SNX5/6 are subunits of the ESCPE-1 complex, which mediates endosomal sorting distinct from Retromer pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Evans <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Simonetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Simonetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). In ESCPE-1, SNX5/6 heterodimerize with SNX1, or its functionally-redundant paralogue protein SNX2, to interact with lipids through the PX domain of SNX1/2 and with cargo through the PX domain of SNX5/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Evans <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kvainickas <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Simonetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">van Weering <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Here, we delineate the relationship between the differential membrane recruitment of CHC22 relative to CHC17, and the unique binding partners identified for CHC22. We confirm that CHC22 binds endogenously to SNX5/6 in cells and demonstrate that this interaction is exclusive of SNX5/6 participation in the ESCPE-1 complex. We show that SNX5 directly binds p115 and that this interaction is required but not sufficient for CHC22 localization and for GSC formation. The CHC22-ERGIC interaction and GSC formation were found to additionally require binding of the CHC22 TD directly to p115. This binding is disrupted by the mutation of a divergent patch in the CHC22 TD to the equivalent residues in CHC17. We thus demonstrate that the specific localization of CHC22 to early secretory membranes requires a bipartite recruitment mechanism. CHC22 is targeted to these membranes by recognition of p115 directly via the CHC22 N-terminal domain, and indirectly through SNX5/6 bridging at the C-terminal trimerization domain. The demonstration that both interactions are essential for the formation of an insulin-responsive GSC defines key molecular determinants regulating glucose clearance in humans with potential for therapeutic targeting.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>SNX5/6 are required for correct localization of CHC22</title><p id="P7">CHC22 is present in both HeLa and muscle cells and functions at the ERGIC for GLUT4 transport to the GSC in a pathway distinct from CHC17 clathrin traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Camus <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). In HeLa cells, which endogenously express CHC22 at levels comparable to myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Esk <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), CHC22 localizes to a perinuclear region overlapping strongly with p115 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Camus <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). To identify determinants of the perinuclear localization of CHC22, a quantitative image analysis methodology was developed. In brief, DAPI stained nuclei were used to identify each cell as well as provide a positional marker for quantification of the perinuclear area. The area between the nuclear boundary and a dilated boundary extending a further 4.5µm created a region comprising p115 staining and ERGIC structures, in which the perinuclear mean fluorescence intensity (PeriMI) of CHC22 was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To assess the effect on CHC22 distribution when SNX5 levels were altered, a HeLa cell line engineered by CRISPR to delete the genes encoding SNX5 and SNX6 <italic>(ΔSNX5/6)</italic> was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This SNX5/6-null cell line was previously produced for and characterized in studies of Retromer and ESCPE-1 trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Simonetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Simonetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Simonetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), and the deletion was confirmed in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. EV1A</xref>). In previous studies, phenotypes were only observed when both SNX5 and SNX6 were deleted, supporting their functional redundancy. Compared to the control parental HeLa line from which they were derived (Con), CHC22 in <italic>ΔSNX5/6</italic> cells exhibited reduced perinuclear enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) and quantification of the CHC22 PeriMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) revealed a significant reduction (p = 0.0095) in the <italic>ΔSNX5/6</italic> cell line. This reduced perinuclear enrichment was verified by measuring the association of CHC22 with its ERGIC interactor p115 using Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA), where fluorescence puncta represent labelling of CHC22 and p115 molecules within 40 nm of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alam, 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Quantification of the average number of puncta per cell confirmed that fewer PLA puncta were observed in <italic>ΔSNX5/6</italic> cells compared to parental control HeLa cells (p = 0.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>), supporting a role for SNX5/6 in CHC22 enrichment to p115-containing membranes. Moreover, a reduction of CHC22 membrane association was observed following fractionation of the <italic>ΔSNX5/6</italic> cells and quantifying the percentage of total CHC22 associated with membranes by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F, G</xref>). The relative percentage of CHC22 in the membrane fraction was decreased in <italic>ΔSNX5/6</italic> cells compared to parental control cells (p = 0.0002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>), while the proportion of CHC17 associated with membranes did not significantly differ between the control (C) and null cell (<italic>Δ</italic>) lines (p = 0.94, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, a higher proportion of CHC17 was present in the cytosolic fraction and a greater proportion of CHC22 on membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) in all cells. Moreover, the distribution of the cellular fractionation marker HSC70 was indistinguishable between the control and null cell line (p = 0.49, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>), further indicating a specific effect on CHC22 membrane association in the SNX5/6 null cells.</p><p id="P9">An active role for SNX5 in CHC22 membrane localization was then investigated to rule out indirect effects of SNX5/6 loss.

Additionally, transfection of the <italic>ΔSNX5/6</italic> cells with FLAG-tagged SNX5 restored perinuclear localization of CHC22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>), while mock transfected <italic>ΔSNX5/6</italic> cells lacked perinuclear CHC22. Quantification showed increased CHC22 PeriMI in the rescued cells relative to control (p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>), supporting a role for SNX5 in the perinuclear localization of CHC22 and demonstrating that SNX5 alone can compensate for the loss of both SNX5 and SNX6. Together, these data indicate that CHC22 perinuclear enrichment positively correlates with the levels of SNX5/6 present in cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>SNX5/6 role in CHC22 localization is independent of ESCPE-1 and Retromer</title><p id="P10">The requirement of SNX5/6 for CHC22 membrane localization raises the question of whether known partners of SNX5/6 are also involved. To address this, CHC22 localization was tested in HeLa cells lacking SNX1/2, which dimerize with SNX5/6 in the endosomal ESCPE-1 complex, and in cells lacking the Retromer complex (VPS26A/B:VPS35:VPS29) formerly considered a SNX5/6 interactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Simonetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Simonetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Simonetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). The retromer-null (<italic>ΔVPS35</italic>) and SNX1/2-null cells (<italic>ΔSNX1/2</italic>) were produced by CRISPR engineering and characterized in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Simonetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Simonetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Simonetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) with deletion confirmed in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. EV1B</xref>). In the <italic>ΔVPS35</italic> cells, neither CHC22 (p = 0.053, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>) nor p115 (p = 0.673, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, C</xref>) perinuclear intensities were altered relative to the control, while a decrease was observed in the PeriMI of the cis-Golgi marker GM130 (p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, D</xref>), a predicted indirect effect from disruption of endosomal traffic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wassmer <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). By contrast, in <italic>ΔSNX5/6</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-E</xref>), CHC22 PeriMI was reduced (p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), as already observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-E</xref>) and the mean intensity of p115 was also reduced (p = 0.0004, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), with no change detected in GM130 relative to control (p = 0.11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). A decrease in the CHC22 total protein level in <italic>ΔSNX5/6</italic> cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E, J</xref>), suggesting that the presence of SNX5/6 stabilizes CHC22, which in turn, stabilizes perinuclear enrichment of p115. Together, these data indicate that the Retromer pathway is distinct from the CHC22-SNX5/6 pathway and suggest a role for SNX5/6 in linking CHC22 with p115.</p><p id="P11">By comparison, an increase in CHC22 PeriMI (p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F, G</xref>) was observed in <italic>ΔSNX1/2</italic> cells relative to control cells with no change in p115 PeriMI (p = 0.15, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>) and an increase in GM130 PeriMI (p = 0.0006, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). Again, the PeriMI of CHC22 was reduced in <italic>ΔSNX5/6</italic> cells in parallel with effects on p115 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F-H</xref>). Levels of CHC22 protein were increased in the <italic>ΔSNX1/2</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>), a stability phenotype that might be expected if increased SNX5/6 is available to interact with CHC22 when not participating in the ESCPE-1 complex with SNX1/2. This could also potentially account for the increased CHC22 perinuclear localization in these cells, similar to the effect observed following SNX5 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). To assess whether the perinuclear localization of SNX5/6 increases in the absence of SNX1/2, <italic>ΔSNX1/2</italic> cells were immunolabeled for SNX6, since no available antibodies that recognize SNX5 were found to function for immunofluorescent staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref>). Quantification showed a significant increase of SNX6 PeriMI in <italic>ΔSNX1/2</italic> cells (p = 0.0067, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L</xref>). The enhanced CHC22 PeriMI in <italic>ΔSNX1/2</italic> cells is consistent with dependence on SNX5/6 for its localization and with independence from participation of the ESCPE-1 dimer in its recruitment.</p><p id="P12">The decreased PeriMI of GM130 in <italic>ΔVPS35</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, D</xref>) and its increased PeriMI in <italic>ΔSNX1/2</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F, I</xref>) did not correspond with altered CHC22 localization in these cells, and further emphasized the distinction between the CHC22 localization and sorting endosome traffic affecting GM130. Likewise, localization of transferrin receptor (TfR), the classical early endocytic cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mayle <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), in the <italic>ΔSNX1/2, ΔVPS35</italic> and <italic>ΔSNX5/6</italic> cells showed expected endosomal effects distinct from changes in CHC22 distribution in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. EV1C, D</xref>).

The membrane recruitment role identified for the SNX5/6 raises the question as to whether the SNX5-p115 interaction is both necessary and sufficient for CHC22 recruitment, or whether interactions mediated by the TD are also involved in CHC22 localization.

This protein was expressed in HeLa cells by transfection and its localization compared to a wild-type (WT) sfGFP-tagged CHC22 control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A, B</xref>). The WT sfGFP-CHC22 localized to the perinuclear region overlapping with p115 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, middle).

This suggested that either subtle structural perturbations in these binding sites alter their specificity, and/or that additional binding sites unique to CHC22 are responsible for mediating its specific localization. To search for potential unique binding sites, regions of the CHC22 TD that are divergent in sequence between CHC17 and CHC22 were identified on a homology model, derived from a CHC17 TD crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">ter Haar <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>), and colored based on CHC22 sequence conservation relative to CHC17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). This revealed a spatial clustering of nine divergent residues, which was not apparent from the primary amino acid sequence alone. To investigate the role of this divergent patch in adaptor binding, each of the divergent residues in CHC22 TD was mutated to the equivalent CHC17 TD residue, creating a chimeric construct CHC22-TD-Chim (Chim) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B, C</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> binding to p115 and GGA2-HE immobilized on glutathione beads was then tested for both WT TD and CHC22-TD-Chim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>).

Both the WT and CHC22-TD-Chim bound to a recombinant fragment of GGA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>) demonstrating that the gross architecture of the TD was not adversely affected by mutating the CHC22 residues to their CHC17 equivalents, and strongly implicating the divergent patch in CHC22 TD specificity for p115. Overall, these data indicate that the CHC22 TD can bind directly to p115 independently of the SNX5/6-TxD interaction at the C-terminus.

The bipartite link between CHC22 and p115 described here highlights the role of p115 in the recruitment of CHC22 to the ERGIC and the equal importance of this GLUT4 traffic pathway in establishing the human GSC relative to the endosomal recapture pathway.</p><p id="P29">We can now model a bipartite mechanism whereby CHC22 is recruited to the early secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). The SNX5/6 interaction at the CHC22 C-terminal domain may act as first stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>, step 1) in a sequential interaction that then enables the CHC22 N-terminal domain to dock onto p115, in a more conventional adaptor-like interaction, typical of CHC17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>, step 2). This idea is supported by the fact that separate loss of each interaction results in reduction of CHC22 localization to the ERGIC, indicating non-redundancy of both contacts. As p115 contains a long tail domain (~45nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Striegl <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), it is topologically possible that p115 can sustain two interactions with CHC22 spanning the thickness of the clathrin lattice, reaching the SNX5/6 present on the upper surface of the TxD and the TD oriented internal to the lattice. The flexible hinge region of the AP2 adaptor complex has been shown to extend over a similar range to link the clathrin lattice to the plasma membrane in CHC17-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kovtun <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Demonstrating the participation of SNX5/6 in p115 binding further verifies SNX5 as a CHC22 partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Towler <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), and also defines a function for SNX5/6, independent of participation in the endosomal recycling ESCPE-1 complex. This mode of interaction between clathrin and sorting nexins has not been previously documented. While sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) and sorting nexin 4 (SNX4) are known interactors of CHC17 at the plasma membrane, they primarily facilitate endocytosis by remodeling actin and enabling scission of vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Skanland <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Soulet <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), and CHC17 is not involved in the formation of SNX-dependent carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">McGough &amp; Cullen, 2013</xref>). Here we show that CHC22 binds SNX5 and requires only SNX5/6 and not SNX1/2 (its ESCPE-1 partners) to associate with ERGIC membranes. Apparently CHC22 does not use the SNX5/6 BAR domain for its potential capacity to induce membrane curvature, as this domain directly binds to the CHC22 TxD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Consistent with AlphaFold modeling, binding of SNX5 to CHC22 is competed by SNX1 and depletion of SNX1/2 did not reduce CHC22 localization with p115, nor was SNX1 present in CHC22 immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. EV2</xref>). The increased CHC22 perinuclear recruitment following depletion of SNX1/2, as observed for overexpression of SNX5, suggested that SNX5/6 was released by SNX1/2 depletion making more available to recruit CHC22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) and confirms lack of SNX1/2 interaction with CHC22. Overall, these findings indicate that CHC22 clathrin is repurposing a SNX-BAR protein. Prior evidence for SNX-BAR protein involvement in the early secretory pathway is limited, although recent reports suggest that SNX19 tethers and positions ER exit sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Saric <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) and identify roles for SNX4 in autophagosome formation and for SNX5 in xenophagy, both of the latter also originating from ER/ERGIC membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dong <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nemec <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Our finding that SNX5 binds the ERGIC tether protein p115 expands this emerging view of SNX-BAR activity beyond the endosomal system.</p><p id="P31">It has been reported that assembly and disassembly of the ESCPE-1 complex are influenced by phosphorylation of SNX5/6 at the interface with SNX1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Itai <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Mutation of SNX5 to a phosphomimetic residue that abrogates SNX1/2 binding partially reduced SNX5 binding to CHC22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">EV3E</xref>), supporting the AlphaFold model suggesting the CHC22-SNX5 interaction uses an overlapping interface as predicted for SNX5 to bind SNX1/2. However, the extent of phosphomimetic binding inhibition is stronger for SNX1 than for CHC22 suggesting that the CHC22-SNX5 interface may be dependent on additional residues. Whether CHC22 binding is affected by phosphorylation and how its competition with SNX1/2 in forming the ESCPE-1 complex is regulated remains to be determined.</p><p id="P32">The TxD of CHC22 alone is sufficient to bind SNX5, in a manner distinct from the configuration of clathrin light chain (CLC) interaction with the Hub (C-terminal third) region of CHC17. Our AlphaFold modeling predicts that the CHC22-SNX5 interaction could extend 40 Å along the proximal leg of the CHC22 triskelion. By comparison, the CLC interaction with CHC17 extends from the side of the TxD along the triskelion leg to its characteristic bended knee (125 Å from the TxD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Wilbur <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Endogenous CHC22 immunoprecipitated from cells does not bind CLCs, and anti-CLC antibodies do not co-localize with CHC22 in cells, although CHC22-CLC interactions can be detected by yeast-two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dannhauser <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Towler <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). The original mapping of SNX5 binding to the CHC22 Hub region by yeast-two-hybrid suggested that SNX5 might be a CLC substitute for CHC22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Towler <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). In so far as SNX5 interacts with the TxD, it may provide the trimer-stabilizing function imparted by CLC to CHC17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Ybe <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Indeed, recent phylogenetic studies identifying CLCs of highly divergent sequences in protist eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Santos <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) indicate that CLC equivalents are predicted to interact with the TxD of CHC17 equivalents, and that this may be the essential molecular requirement for a CHC-associated subunit. As SNX5/6 interacts principally with the TxD of CHC22 rather than spanning the proximal leg of the heavy chain to the knee where CLC affects CHC17 assembly dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Redlingshöfer &amp; Brodsky, 2021</xref>), one possibility is that SNX5/6 binding influences the CHC22 uncoating dynamics. CHC22 has markedly different uncoating properties to CHC17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dannhauser <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) and the truncation of the CHC22 TxD relative to CHC17, losing the recognition site for the uncoating ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Rapoport <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), is a notable distinction between the two clathrin isoforms.</p><p id="P33">This study provides the first direct evidence of the CHC22 TD mediating adaptor interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>. This is consistent with the clathrin recruitment paradigm derived from CHC17, in which the TD comprises four separate binding sites that interact with a collection of well-studied adaptor proteins to recruit clathrin to distinct cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Briant <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lemmon &amp; Traub, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Robinson &amp; Bonifacino, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Wood &amp; Smith, 2021</xref>).

When the CHC22 TD was modeled on the known structure of CHC17 TD, a divergent patch of nine residues on the surface of the CHC22 TD was identified, while additionally all the known adaptor binding sites in CHC17 are conserved in the CHC22 TD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A, B</xref>). Notably, when the residues comprising the divergent patch were all mutated to the equivalent CHC17 residues, p115 binding was abolished, while binding of a GGA2 fragment was maintained. This observation indicates that p115 interaction with the identified patch, plus p115 binding to CHC22 via SNX5/6, enables CHC22 function at the ERGIC. It may be that the divergent CHC22 TD patch also influences CHC22 TD conformation to increase its specificity for the CHC17 adaptors AP1 and GGA2 and lose AP2 binding. Alternatively, there may be additional CHC22 interactions that enhance its function in endosomal sorting of GLUT4 and reduce AP2 binding <italic>in vivo</italic> accounting for lack of CHC22 function in uptake from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dannhauser <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Esk <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>).</p><p id="P34">Overall, a bipartite mechanism for interaction of the specialized CHC22 clathrin isoform with the p115 tether in the early secretory pathway, a localization distinct from canonical CHC17, was identified and characterized.

In insulin-resistant human muscle, CHC22 accumulates at sites of GLUT4 over-sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Vassilopoulos <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), so interference with CHC22 membrane recruitment by targeting either site of the CHC22-p115 interaction defined here could potentially alleviate aberrant CHC22 accumulation during insulin resistance. Several cargoes, including CFTR, αps1-integrin, and several types of nutrient transporters are known to bypass the Golgi from the early secretory pathway, as observed for the CHC22-mediated GLUT4 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Camus <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dimou <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Grieve &amp; Rabouille, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Schotman <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Tveit <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).

A 63x (1.40 NA) HC Plan-Apo CS2 oil-immersion objective was used with five laser lines. Fluorophores were sequentially excited at 405 nm (DAPI), 488 nm (GFP, Alexa Fluor 488), 543 nm (Alexa Fluor 555), 561 nm (Alexa Fluor 568), and 633 nm (Alexa Fluor 647). For fixed images, 8-bit images were acquired (1024x1024 XY pixel aspect) without further digital magnification. For each image, a Z-axis sectional stack was acquired using the nuclear DAPI signal as a positional marker. This consisted of 9 sections with 0.5 µm intersectional spacing, corresponding to a total Z-axis length of 4 µm. The images were saved in the Leica binary image format (.lif) and exported for further processing. For analysis, the images were processed using a series of custom macros in Fiji (NIH). In brief, the images were sorted by number and channel and, for each individual channel, an average intensity projection of the Z-section was extracted, created, and sorted. For analysis of the perinuclear mean intensity (PeriMI), the DAPI channel was used to create two masks for each cell in each image: one of the original dimensions of the nucleus, the other dilated by a factor corresponding to an isotropic increase in radius of 4.5 µm. The two masks were applied to the average intensity projection of the channels to be quantified using a macro incorporating the ‘Analyze particles’ function in Fiji. This measured the area and total pixel intensity for the original and dilated areas for each channel, which was saved as a .csv file. These data were then processed using a custom script in R. In brief, the mean of the ‘total pixel intensities’ of the original masks was subtracted from the mean of the ‘total pixel intensities’ from the dilated mask to provide a mean ‘total pixel intensity’ value for the region between the two masks, corresponding to the perinuclear area (masks generated from 8-29 cells per condition per biological repeat). This value was in turn normalized to the mean area of the original masks subtracted from the mean area of the dilated masks (the perinuclear area), generating a PeriMI measurement corresponding to the mean intensity for the perinuclear area. These perinuclear mean intensity values were exported as .csv for subsequent statistical analysis. To account for differences in fluorescence intensity between biological repeats, for each, PeriMI results were normalized by the mean of all the images of all the genotype/conditions. For calculating the proximity ligation assay (PLA) puncta, the DAPI stained nuclei were counted for each image alongside processing of the PLA signal channel. In brief, the PLA signal channels were processed to remove background signal using thresholding and converted to a binary image. The puncta present in these binary images were then counted and the area of each particle was measured using the ‘Analyze particles’ function in Fiji. To identify particles containing multiple puncta, which could not be sufficiently resolved by confocal microscopy or the application of ‘Watershed’ segmentation functions, the area of each particle identified in each image was grouped by size in a frequency histogram using the minimal puncta size for the bin intervals. To correct for multiple puncta in a single identified particle, the number of particles in each bin interval was multiplied by the corresponding area bin value. The sum of these corrected puncta number values was then divided by the corresponding nuclei number to generate the final puncta per cell value.

Cells were then incubated with secondary antibody solution (anti-Mouse Alexa Fluor 647 diluted 1:1000 in PBS with 2% horse serum) for 1 hour at room temperature followed by washing three times in PBS and gently lifted using a cell scraper (Corning). These suspensions were pelleted by centrifugation at 300x g for 3 min and resuspended in a 500 µL of PBS. Flow cytometry data was acquired with FACS Diva acquisition software on a LSRII flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) equipped with violet (405 nm), blue (488 nm), yellow (561), and red (633 nm) lasers. Typically, 10,000 events were acquired, and median fluorescent intensity (MFI) values for surface GLUT4 (Alexa Fluor 647), CHC22 transfectants (mApple), and total GLUT4 (GFP) were recorded. Post-acquisition analysis was performed using FlowJo software (TreeStar), where debris was removed by using forward/side light scatter gating. Then fluorescence histograms were analyzed, using gating to select only the transfected cell populations in the TD rescue experiments based on the fluorescent signal (mApple) from the expression of the fusion protein. The MFI values were exported and processed in Excel (Microsoft), whereby the ratios of surface-to-total MFI were calculated to quantify the extent of GLUT4 translocation in each condition.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Protein extraction and immunoblotting</title><p id="P46">Protein extracts from cells were quantified by BCA (Pierce), separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide, Merck Millipore), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 µm, Bio-Rad), labelled with primary antibodies (1–5 µg/ml), washed, and labelled with species-specific HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The trimerization domain of CHC22 binds SNX5, which in turn binds p115 (interaction denoted by 1). This positions the N-terminal domain of CHC22 to directly bind p115 through a unique patch (asterisk) that diverges from the CHC17 sequence (interaction denoted by 2). Disruption of either interaction abrogates CHC22 recruitment and function. The ERGIC membrane is distinguished by the localization of p115. Through the interaction of p115 with IRAP, this complex (described previously) is linked to the capture of GLUT4 and its sorting to an insulin-responsive intracellular compartment upon assembly of the CHC22 coat at the ERGIC membrane.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS158955-f009"/></fig></floats-group></article>
