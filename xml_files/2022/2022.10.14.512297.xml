As melanoma progression is thought to recapitulate aspects of neural crest cell (NCC) development, understanding embryonic melanocyte specification and lineage fate decisions of closely related NCCs may illuminate the pathways co-opted during disease evolution. Here, we use a mouse model to isolate and sequence Dopachrome tautomerase (Dct) expressing NCCs, the precursors of melanocytes, at two key developmental stages. We classify these lineages and devise a Developmental Gene Module (DGM) scoring system to interrogate lineage state switching in melanoma samples. In bulk transcriptomes, activation of DGMs representing embryonic Schwann Cell Precursors (SCPs)—multipotent stem cells—in patient tumors predicts poor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Co-activation of SCP and Mesenchymal-like (Mes.) modules further correlates with resistance to MAPK inhibitors. Notably, single-cell analyses reveal that melanoma cells can simultaneously express multiple DGMs, forming “hybrid” states. Cells in a hybrid Neural/SCP state are enriched in early metastasis and ICI-resistant tumors and are insensitive to inflammatory stimuli. We demonstrate that targeting <italic>Hdac2</italic>, a histone deacetylase associated with this Neural/SCP hybrid state, promotes a mesenchymal-like state switch, remodels the tumor microenvironment, and sensitizes melanoma cells to TNFα and tumors to ICI therapy. Our methodology thus reveals dynamic patterns of lineage state switching correlated with melanoma tumor evolution to drive insight into new therapeutic targets.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Melanoma is a cancer of the melanocyte, the pigment-producing cell in the body. Melanocytes arise from melanoblasts, precursors derived from embryonic neural crest cells (NCCs) around Embryonic (E) day 8 or from Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) from E11.5 onwards in mouse. These progenitors also give rise to neurons, glial cells, and mesenchymal derivatives; melanocytes thus share origins with diverse cell types. Melanocyte specification can be tracked through the expression of Dopachrome tautomerase (Dct), a gene encoding a pigmentation enzyme.</p><p id="P3">Melanoma cells can co-opt embryonic cell states during progression and therapy resistance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], but the precise developmental states involved remain unclear. Some insights into the drivers of these NCC-like states have emerged, both intrinsic (gene regulatory networks) and extrinsic (microenvironmental cues). Rambow et al. identified RXRG as a regulator of persister cells during minimal residual disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], while Lu et al. demonstrated that an ALDH1A3-driven chromatin acetylation state induces NC stem cell gene expression[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], including the multipotent NCC gene, <italic>Tfap2b</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α also promote dedifferentiation and plasticity in melanoma cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Yet, the full complement of intrinsic and extrinsic regulators and how they interact remains poorly understood. The ability of melanoma cells to transition between therapy-resistant and therapy-sensitive states without new mutations mirrors the dynamic potential of NCCs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], and lineage state switching represents a form of plasticity with major clinical consequences[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P4">As in other cancers, understanding embryonic lineage specification may reveal alternative therapeutic targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. We reasoned that the regulatory mechanisms guiding lineage fate choices made by melanocyte precursors may be reactivated in melanoma progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). While one pioneering study deeply profiled mouse neural crest lineages across development[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], it relied on the broad Sox10:Cre-tdTomato reporter, limiting enrichment for melanocytic precursors at each stage. A second study captured human fetal and adult melanoblasts and melanocytes across many developmental stages and anatomic sites but profiled few embryonic NCC precursors of melanocytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Hence, we undertook an in-depth analysis of the melanocyte lineage at two specific stages: E11.5, with both directly developing NCCs and initial specification of SCPs and melanoblasts transmigrating across the basement membrane of the skin (mirroring vertically progressing melanoma lesions)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]; and E15.5, with melanoblasts colonizing the hair follicle niche, and SCPs establishing a stem cell niche surrounding nerves (niche establishment processes that may be relevant to metastatic colonization in cancer)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Using a Dct-driven inducible GFP reporter mouse (iDct-GFP)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], we enriched for melanocyte lineage cells for single-cell RNA sequencing. This enabled identification of Dct-expressing subpopulations and their linked NCC lineages, in turn leading us to devise a Developmental Gene Module (DGM) classification system to trace lineage co-option in melanoma.</p><p id="P5">Surprisingly, we found that Dct+ NCCs give rise to melanocytes and glia, and a small subset of neurons and mesenchymal derivatives. Applying DGM scoring to melanoma datasets revealed that SCP-like and mesenchymal-like gene expression predicts resistance to both immune checkpoint and MAPK-targeted therapies. Moreover, we discovered that melanoma cells can exist in “hybrid” states expressing markers of multiple NCC lineages. Hybrid cells with neural and SCP features are enriched in early metastasis and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) resistant tumors. Finally, we identified HDAC2 as a key regulator of the non-inflammatory Neural/SCP hybrid state; its loss sensitized melanoma to TNFα and ICI, offering a potential therapeutic target in ICI-resistant tumors. In summary, by profiling embryonic melanocytic lineages at single-cell resolution and building a developmental classification framework, we identify mechanisms of melanoma plasticity and progression with direct therapeutic implications.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>iDct-GFP reporter labels cutaneous, migrating, and nerve-associated embryonic NCCs</title><p id="P6">To characterize NCCs, particularly the melanocytic lineage, we employed an iDct-GFP doxycycline-inducible transgenic mouse model that labels Dct-expressing cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed GFP+ cells in the skin and hair follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), anticipated for the melanocyte lineage[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], and surrounding peripheral nerve bundles, localized to Neural Growth Factor Receptor (Ngfr) high regions, consistent with nerve-associated Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1a-c</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p><p id="P7">We next compared Dct (PEP8H antibody[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]) with GFP protein expression on serial sections at embryo stages E11.5, E13.5, and E15.5. TRE-H2B-GFP single allele mice were used as controls. GFP+ and PEP8H+ cells co-localized in the skin at E11.5 and E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, d, f-h</xref>). Total GFP+ cells relative to PEP8H+ cells appeared reduced at E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e, i-j</xref>), possibly due to differences in nuclear (GFP) compared to cytoplasmic (PEP8H) signal detection. At E11.5, GFP and PEP8H-labeled cells followed interspaced tracks consistent with dorsolateral migration (other; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, f</xref>), with GFP+ cells also localized more ventrally (<italic>v</italic>) than PEP8H+ cells, suggesting early <italic>Dct</italic> transcription preceding protein translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). At later stages, GFP+ cells localized near dorsal root ganglia and along nerve bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d–e</xref>), consistent with a SCP phenotype, while PEP8H+ cells could be detected in these regions, but were sparser than their GFP+ counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, g-j</xref>, blue arrows), indicating enhanced sensitivity of the iDct-GFP reporter. Sporadic GFP+ cells were detected between the skin and nerves, potentially representing migrating cells. GFP+ cells were also detected in cartilage at E15.5 in iDct-GFP but not control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e, i–j</xref>), suggesting these cells may have developed from a previous Dct-expressing progenitor, underlining the importance of understanding how Dct-expressing progenitors, Dct-expressing cells, and other lineages are related.</p><p id="P8">To define lineage dynamics, we induced Dct transgene expression with either a single injected dose of doxycycline at E10.5 or E12.5 or continuous exposure (initial injection followed by doxycycline chow). Given the stability of the H2B-GFP nuclear protein, we anticipated that some signal would persist after transgene silencing. The proportion of skin GFP+ cell numbers remained consistent across induction regimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref>). In contrast, E12.5 induction increased the proportion of GFP+ nerve-associated cells (bundles) by E13.5, while subdermal (other) GFP+ cells decreased. These results suggest an early (E10.5) Dct-expressing progenitor origin for subdermal GFP+ populations, yet a later (E12.5) origin for nerve-associated GFP+ cells, and that either the nerve-associated cells themselves or a very recent precursor expresses Dct, in line with a potential SCP multipotent hub population. Cartilage-localized GFP+ cells were reduced following E12.5 activation, meaning they are likely to come from very early (E10.5) Dct-expressing progenitors that are more multipotent. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the iDct-GFP model robustly labels melanoblasts and nerve-associated progenitors, and that temporal transgene activation differentially marks distinct extra-cutaneous NCC-derived populations.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ScRNA-seq identifies distinct melanocytic and glial subpopulations in embryonic NCCs</title><p id="P9">Melanomas frequently arise in the trunk, yet previous embryonic scRNA-seq studies have largely focused on cranial and vagal NCCs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Using the iDct-GFP mouse model, we isolated GFP+ neural crest-derived cells at E11.5 and E15.5 from the embryo trunk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

Cells were collected from multiple embryos per stage to mitigate litter effects and processed using the 10X Genomics platform for scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Fourteen transcriptionally distinct clusters were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Each embryo contributed to multiple clusters, confirmed via germline SNP-based computational genotyping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We enriched NCCs by selecting clusters with Sox10/Sox9 expression greater than zero and excluding non-NCC clusters, leaving eleven qualifying clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).

Lineage-specific differences emerged across timepoints: E11.5 cells expressed early NCC and chromatin remodeling genes, while E15.5 cells upregulated differentiation markers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), possibly hinting that earlier NCCs likely have a greater potential, such as previously described hub cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p id="P11">To contrast lineages enriched among GFP+ cells with those of other published neural crest populations, we integrated our dataset with Sox10-Cre-based NCC scRNA-seq (E9.5–E17.5) from Kastriti et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] and tested the statistical significance of co-clustering between cells from both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c–d</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). This should indicate which NCC lineages are closely linked to Dct-expressing progenitors, and which lineages are developmentally unrelated. Our samples were enriched for trunk NCCs and notably captured more melanocytes than Kastriti et al. Likely owing to our dissection strategy (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">methods</xref>), our data lacked enteric lineages seen in Kastriti et al. The lack of sympathoadrenal lineages in our data indicated a limited overlap between these lineages and Dct-linked NCCs. Mes.Early cells co-clustered with mesenchymal populations in Kastriti et al., while Mes.2 aligned with endoneurial fibroblasts. NPC1 cells, marked by <italic>Neurog1</italic>, showed a higher transcriptional heterogeneity and co-clustered with neural crest cells and glial cells, indicating a possible multipotent state. Both SCP clusters at E15.5 aligned with Kastriti and colleagues' Schwann cell clusters but remained transcriptionally distinct. The remaining neural, SCP, and melanocyte clusters in our data mapped to analogous clusters in Kastriti et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). In summary, the iDct-GFP model enriches for melanocytic and glial populations within NCCs, elucidating new subclusters and capturing embryonic melanoblasts at higher resolution than prior datasets, highlighting developmental plasticity between these lineages.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Construction of Developmental Gene Modules (DGMs)</title><p id="P12">To define transcriptional programs characterizing each Dct+ neural crest state, we derived gene signatures, termed “Developmental Gene Modules” (DGM), for each of the eleven qualifying clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Each DGM included up to 200 genes that were (i) significantly upregulated and co-expressed within a cluster, and (ii) significantly co-expressed in the lineage (Mel., Mes., Neural, or SCP) that the cluster belonged to and was not co-expressed in other lineages and (iii) excluded cell cycle-associated genes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). We validated DGM specificity and sensitivity using independent scRNA-seq datasets. In Kastriti and colleagues’ Sox10+ NCC atlas[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], when we scored the cells for each DGM using AUCell, we found that the DGMs of each Dct+ lineage were upregulated in their corresponding NCC lineage and were able to correctly separate neuronal, mesenchymal, melanocytic, and Schwann/glial populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). We further assessed the sensitivity and specificity of melanocytic DGMs using the Belote et al. dataset of fetal, neonatal, and adult human skin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Both Mel. and Mel.Early DGMs were enriched in fetal and neonatal KIT+ melanocytes relative to adult cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>), consistent with their embryonic origin. These melanocytic DGMs also showed higher activity in melanocytes than non-melanocytic DGMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref>), underscoring their specificity.</p><p id="P13">Together, these results highlight the utility of DGMs in capturing conserved, lineage-specific gene programs across diverse scRNA-seq datasets.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>An SCP-like melanoma cell state in patient tumors is linked to therapy resistance and disease progression</title><p id="P14">Melanoma dedifferentiation is associated with poor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], yet the specific embryonic states recapitulated by these resistant states remain unclear.

In bulk RNA-seq from pre-treatment biopsies of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1-treated patients (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>), we found that SCP.2 was upregulated in non-responders relative to responders, while Mel.Early was enriched in responders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Consistently, SCP.2 expression predicted shorter overall survival, whereas Mel.Early was associated with longer overall survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Focusing on progression-free survival, we found that the expression of SCP.Early and Mes.Early genes were indicative of shorter relapse times. These trends persisted in scRNA-seq data from pre-treatment biopsies of anti-PD1-treated patients, where malignant cells in non-responders showed upregulation of SCP.1, SCP.2, Mes.2, and Notochord DGMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Comparison of our embryonic DGMs to melanoma differentiation signatures (undifferentiated, neural crest-like, transitory, and melanocytic) defined by Tsoi et al., in their cell line panel mapped Tsoi and colleagues’ broad categories onto multiple distinct NC lineages captured in our dataset, with our DGMs offering greater lineage resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). As Tsoi et al. report undifferentiated melanoma cell lines being resistant to targeted therapies, we evaluated DGMs in bulk RNA-seq from untreated melanoma cell lines (CCLE) and accompanying drug response data with targeted therapies (CTRP). We found that high activity of SCP.1, SCP.2, Notochord, and Mes.2 DGMs correlated with resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>), while Mel. and Neural DGM activities showed no such association (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>).

The authors noted extensive heterogeneity and identified multiple histologic regions within each tumor encompassing normal (N), precursor (P), melanoma in situ (MIS), radial growth phase (RGP), and vertical growth phase (VGP) stages. Multiple microregions consisting of 100-300 cells each were sequenced from each tumor after their histologies were classified. Analyzing this data, we observed a global upregulation of DGMs in MIS microregions compared to precursor microregions and a striking stepwise increase in SCP.1 and SCP.2 activities across disease stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Collectively, SCP and Mes. states, particularly those defined at E15.5, rather than E11.5, were associated with resistance to both immunotherapy and MAPK pathway inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). These findings challenge the notion that dedifferentiation towards the earliest embryonic stage predicts resistance and suggest instead that melanoma lineage switching that co-opts characteristics of specific NC-derived lineages, especially SCPs and Mes., can drive melanoma therapy evasion.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>scRNA-seq reveals hybrid DGM cell states during early metastatic colonization</title><p id="P17">To investigate melanoma lineage plasticity during metastatic colonization, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on M4-BRN2 mouse melanoma cells, a highly metastatic and GFP+ subline of B2905, which were injected into the tail veins of immunocompetent mice. Analyzing lungs at 1-, 2-, and 3-weeks after injection, we observed that, as expected, tumor burden increased over time, with lesions ranging from pigmented to amelanotic, and that Sox10 expression was heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a–i</xref>). We also observed metastatic nodules with a tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).

DGMs peaked in week 2. These trends suggest that early metastatic cells transiently adopt SCP or Neural-like states, potentially facilitating adaptation. Notably, we observed cells co-expressing DGMs from multiple lineages, which we defined as a “hybrid” state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4l</xref>), in contrast with “singleton” cells that only express DGMs from a single lineage. Such hybrid states have been reported elsewhere during tumor initiation and metastasis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Each hybrid state was indexed based on the lineages enriched within it. We inferred the presence of hybrid cells in our experimental metastases data and next checked if the proportion of cells in each hybrid state differed from chance (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). Four hybrid states co-expressing Neural and SCP DGMs (NS-Hybrids) were highly significantly overrepresented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4m</xref>). We found that the fraction of NS-Hybrid cells significantly declined over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4n</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4d-e</xref>), suggesting an adaptation role during early colonization.</p><p id="P19">Importantly, although rare (~0.2% of cells), NS-Hybrid states were also observed in embryonic Sox10+ neural crest cells from Kastriti et al., specifically in SCPs and enteric neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4f</xref>), which aligned with the expression of multiple lineage markers in individual SCPs noted by Kastriti et al. We asked if hybrid states were more of a feature of cancer cells compared to development. We found a positive correlation between activities of DGMs within the same lineage in both cancer and development, yet only cancer cells displayed a positive correlation of DGM genes expressed between different lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4o</xref>), which is consistent with hybrid states being enriched in cancer. Finally, we evaluated associations between DGM expression and plasticity in melanoma microregions profiled by Vallius et al. Using self-organizing maps, they grouped transcript signatures from tissue microregions in human primary melanomas into three “branches” and computed an entropy-based measure of plasticity from matched high-plex immunofluorescence measurement of SOX10, PRAME, NGFR, SOX9, and MART1 within each microregion. Cellular neighborhoods with melanoma cells that expressed different combinations of these lineage markers had a higher entropy. Microregions in Branch 1 had high EMT expression and higher entropy than in Branch 3. We found that SCP and Mes. lineage DGMs were significantly more active in Branch 1 microregions than in Branch 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4g</xref>), further suggesting a link between activation of these lineages and high plasticity. Together, these findings suggest that SCP-like melanoma cells co-activate other lineage programs during early metastatic and primary tumor growth, while NS-Hybrid states may underlie adaptation during early metastatic colonization.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>A non-inflammatory NS-hybrid state predicts therapy resistance and is maintained by HDAC2, which protects against TNFα-mediated apoptosis</title><p id="P20">To further assess how gene expression in hybrid and singleton lineage states evolves during metastatic colonization, we grouped the tumor cells from all three timepoints after inoculation (1, 2, and 3 weeks) based on their specific hybrid state or singleton status, identified differentially expressed genes in each group, and performed functional enrichment analysis using GSEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Most subgroups showed a temporal shift from high interferon signaling (1 week) to EMT (2 weeks) and TNFα/NFκB activation (3 weeks), indicating a consistent inflammatory trajectory. Notably, NS-hybrid cells uniquely lacked upregulation of inflammatory pathways. This suggests that NS-hybrid cells are either refractory to inflammation or maintain a non-inflammatory phenotype. Given this, we classified hybrid states in two patient cohorts receiving anti-PD1 therapy (Pozniak et al. and Jerby-Arnon et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]) and found that hybrid state cells make up a significant fraction of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>).

Using these developmentally curated regulons, we then estimated regulator activity in cells from both human patient data (Jerby-Arnon) and our M4-BRN2 mouse metastases using AUCell. Regression analysis identified SOX10, RXRG, and HDAC2 as top regulators of the NS-hybrid state in both human and mouse melanomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). SOX10 and RXRG have previously been associated with minimal residual disease in melanoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], corroborating their link with a possible adaptive and therapy-resistant subtype. HDAC2 is a histone deacetylase with roles in Schwann cell lineage regulation and PD-L1 modulation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], yet further investigation of how HDAC2 may potentiate ICI therapy is warranted.</p><p id="P22">We hypothesized that HDAC2 is a candidate suppressor of inflammatory responses in NS-hybrid cells, given the lack of inflammatory gene expression enrichment in these cells.

Using the M4-BRN2 parental cell line, B2905, and an additional mouse melanoma cell line, Yumm2.1, that each had different SOX10 expression statuses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a- b</xref>), we performed <italic>Hdac2</italic> knockdown (siRNA), followed by TNFα stimulation. We confirmed TNFα action through immunoblotting of phosphorylated p65 (a key part of the NF-κB pathway and activated by TNFα; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a-b</xref>). This led to ~30% viability loss compared to non-stimulated cells, where non-targeting control siRNA-transfected cells (siControl) stimulated with TNFα demonstrated no change in viability compared to non-stimulated cells. IFNγ stimulation alone had no effect across modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>).

Entinostat is a Class I pan-HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) inhibiting HDACs 1, 2, and 3. Entinostat has been tested in phase I and II clinical trials against advanced malignancies and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Like <italic>Hdac2</italic> KD, B2905 cells treated with HDACi exhibited a TNFα-specific loss of viability, which was not exacerbated with combination treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). However, in contrast, HDACi-treated Yumm2.1 cells tolerated TNFα, suggesting that <italic>Hdac2</italic> loss alone may be a more efficacious target across multiple cell lines than inhibition of all 3 HDACs simultaneously. Chromatin acetylation was increased with HDACi treatment, as would be expected following inhibition of HDACs 1-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>), validating the drug’s activity. Yet chromatin acetylation levels remain unchanged in <italic>Hdac2</italic> KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>), which suggests other histone deacetylase proteins may be upregulated to compensate for the loss of <italic>Hdac2</italic>. Western blot analysis revealed that HDAC1 was upregulated following <italic>Hdac2</italic> KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5j</xref>), suggesting a mechanism through which global acetylation levels remain unchanged. However, regardless of acetylation levels, HDAC2 loss was sufficient to sensitize cells to TNFα, suggesting HDAC2 may have different targets than HDACs 1 or 3.</p><p id="P24">RNA-seq of <italic>Hdac2</italic> KD or HDACi-treated cells revealed widespread DGM alterations, especially a strong upregulation of the mesenchymal Mes.2 module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5k</xref>) and indicated a shift toward a mesenchymal state upon HDAC2 depletion. Universally, TNFα treatment led to a dramatic downregulation of all SCP gene modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>), in line with negative correlations between SCP expression and TNFα pathway activation in lung metastases. Functional enrichment analysis using GSEA revealed activation of interferon response and inflammatory pathways in <italic>Hdac2</italic> KD cells, consistent with a role for HDAC2 in mediating a non-inflammatory phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5l</xref>). We also found an upregulation of matrix remodeling pathways in <italic>Hdac2</italic> KD cells. Thus, while it is uncertain if HDAC2 drives the NS-hybrid state per se, it may repress both a transition to a mesenchymal state and sensitivity to inflammatory stimuli.

Moreover, with this approach, we could interrogate how loss of HDAC2 specifically impacts tumor colonization at a primary site (under the skin).

We consider Hdac2 KD IgG-treated tumors as treatment-naive tumors likely to respond to ICI therapy, whereas siControl IgG-treated tumors represent treatment-naive partial responders (based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Both anti-PD-1 tumors are considered relapsed tumors. In summary, transient loss of HDAC2 at tumor cell transplantation sensitized tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy.</p><p id="P27">We reasoned that transient HDAC2 loss might lead to lasting changes in tumor evolution, making tumors more sensitive to immune clearance triggered by ICI therapy. We then examined how transient HDAC2 loss affected tumor cell phenotypes and the tumor microenvironment at the time of transplantation. Using multiplexed tissue profiling, we analyzed tumor lineage phenotypes and tissue characteristics. Based on our RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5k-l</xref>), which showed increased activation of the mesenchymal module and significant changes in collagen biology after HDAC2 depletion, we investigated whether there were observable differences in tumor collagen content—a key feature of the tumor microenvironment—between siControl and siHdac2 knockdown tumors treated with either IgG control or anti-PD-1. Picrosirius red staining revealed different collagen phenotypes, with regions of dense, intermediate, and sparse collagen. The ratio of dense/intermediate collagen to sparse collagen was higher in IgG-treated <italic>Hdac2</italic> KD tumors (which were treatment-sensitive) compared to both anti-PD-1-treated groups (which relapsed). Conversely, siControl tumors (partial responders) showed no significant difference across any treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Many regions of sparse collagen were surrounded by borders of denser collagen; these features were regarded as encapsulated regions. The encapsulated tumor area was smaller in treatment-naive siHDAC2 tumors compared to siHdac2 relapsed tumors, while no difference was observed in siControl tumors before and after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e-f</xref>). This encapsulated phenotype could exclude entry of immune infiltrates and thereby help convey resistance to ICIs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesize that the presence of these encapsulated regions may alter the organization of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within the tumor and ultimately impact resistance to ICI therapies. We observed that CD3+ T cells and macrophages colocalized at the circumference of these collagen capsules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g-h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Thus, the presence of capsules results in regions of lower T cell infiltration, mimicking an immune cell exclusion phenotype.</p><p id="P28">We next asked how expression of lineage markers altered across tumors. While SOX10 expression was unaltered, we observed that tumors with greater numbers of capsules, such as following anti-PD-1 therapy, had significantly enriched RAB38 expression (a melanocytic marker upregulated in SCP.1 cells) compared to tumors with fewer capsules (<italic>Hdac2</italic> KD, IgG treated). This suggests relapsed tumors were more melanocytic post anti-PD-1 therapy, but less melanocytic in <italic>Hdac2</italic> KD, IgG-treated modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6i-j</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). This result initially surprised us as high Mel.Early expression before anti-PD1 therapy was associated with response and better survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, c</xref>). We, therefore, asked if, like our mouse data suggests, anti-PD1 treatment increased melanocytic gene expression in relapsed tumors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. We computed log-fold changes of genes in DGMs in post-treatment samples of non-responders and responders compared to their pre-treatment baselines and found that non-responders indeed up-regulated melanocytic DGMs post-therapy, whereas responders down-regulated melanocytic modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6l</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>).

Also, analysis of gene expression data from mouse melanocytes irradiated by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]<inline-graphic xlink:href="EMS155902-i001.jpg"/>, revealed activation of SCP.2 module expression at a timepoint post UVB treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7f</xref>) where upregulation of immuno-evasion genes had been previously reported.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">Our study refines longstanding observations that cancers, including melanoma, reactivate developmental programs. By deeply profiling Dct-expressing cells at two key stages in mouse embryogenesis, we identified specific neural crest cell (NCC) states, particularly late embryonic (E15.5) Schwann cell progenitors (SCPs), that are re-acquired during melanoma progression. These SCP-like states are clinically relevant: they correlate with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistance independently of traditional markers like tumor mutation burden[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] or tumor microenvironment profiles (TME)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], and are enriched in invasive primary tumors and early metastases. Moreover, because the SCP signature reflects a natural embryonic lineage, it offers a biologically grounded framework to explore the signaling, niches, and plastic potential associated with these states in melanoma.</p><p id="P30">As plastic adaptation is a dynamic process that has been traditionally difficult to predict, let alone manipulate, we propose that comprehensive longitudinal mapping of melanoma lineage states enabled by our iDct-GFP embryonic dataset may help bridge this gap in precision oncology. Our dataset reveals greater diversity in the Dct+ neural crest lineage than previously recognized, connecting early progenitors to both glial and melanocytic fates predominantly. This resource helps define coordinated gene programs (DGMs) in melanoma with greater resolution than traditional approaches based on a small number of lineage markers. Notably, our lineage signatures extend the developmental subtyping frameworks of Tsoi et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] and Belote et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] by identifying precise Dct-linked embryonic lineages reactivated in melanomas. While Belote et al. largely profiled melanocytes from embryonic and adult stages, we did not sequence Dct+ lineages from adult mice, a limitation that, when addressed, could help span the full differentiation trajectory represented in our DGMs.</p><p id="P31">An open question in melanoma biology is how the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic determinants drives melanoma evolution. Our metastatic colonization data reveal a temporal switch in inflammatory signaling within tumor cells: an early phase marked by interferon activation (including IFN-γ) and SCP-like gene expression, followed by a transition toward TNFα/NFκB signaling. IFN-γ plays a dual role—initially promoting immune targeting but eventually enabling immune evasion in tumor cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. This lineage-intrinsic response is mirrored in melanocytes, where UVB exposure induces both IFN-γ signaling[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] and SCP gene expression, perhaps linking an early stress response in melanocytes to the SCP module. Notably, SCP DGM activity is upregulated in metastatic cells at 1-week post-injection compared to later timepoints, preceding the inflammatory switch. We also identify two populations of SCPs at E15.5, of which SCP.1 cluster cells have enhanced inflammatory pathway activation and SCP.2 cluster cells have no inflammatory pathway activation. Thus, inflammation could play an important role in distinguishing biologically relevant SCP subtypes. We propose that SCP-like sub-states may mediate IFN-γ signaling, contribute to immune refractoriness, and enable phenotypic plasticity in melanoma. What adaptive advantage expression of SCP genes affords the tumor cells is yet to be determined, but potentially, expression of SCP genes could enable tumor cells to suppress antigen expression and/or presentation or enable greater plastic potential to permit a switch to immune-refractory states. For example, IFN-γ signaling has been shown to upregulate Nerve Growth Factor Receptor (NGFR) activity in cells. NGFR is a marker of SCPs, and NGFR signaling has been linked to immune therapy refractory, stem-like melanomas[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Taken together, an IFN-γ-SCP axis may signify a potential melanoblast lineage-induced mechanism of immune cell evasion.</p><p id="P32">At single-cell resolution, we found that a subset of melanoma cells co-express markers from multiple Dct-linked lineages simultaneously, forming hybrid states. These are rare in normal development but do occur, especially among SCPs and enteric neurons. We propose that, as in development[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], hybrid states in melanoma reflect lineage plasticity. One particularly notable state—NS-Hybrid—is enriched in SCPs and neural lineages and is prevalent in early metastasis and ICI-resistant tumors. While the mechanisms driving these hybrid phenotypes remain unclear, the role of SCPs as multipotent progenitors, their increased activity during progression, and their enrichment in regions of high spatial entropy all suggest a functional role for the SCP state in mediating this hybridity. SCP module activation may define a permissive, hub-like state facilitating cell-state transitions, similar to common cell fate decision routes hypothesized in dynamical theories of cell decision-making[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], and aligning with recent descriptions of SCP hub states[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] and cyclical fate restriction models in zebrafish[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>].</p><p id="P33">We highlight active NS-Hybrid regulons in both mouse and human melanomas as promising therapeutic targets. In our model, high HDAC2 activity was linked to the non-inflammatory phenotype of NS hybrid cells during lung colonization. Transient knockdown of <italic>Hdac2</italic> expression increased melanoma cell sensitivity to TNFα-induced apoptosis, possibly by reduced expression of C-FLIP, a known anti-apoptotic factor previously implicated in pancreatic cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]; alternatively, it may be due to a natural sensitivity to TNFα of a mesenchymal-like state. HDAC2 also bestowed resistance to the tumor growth suppressive action of ICI. This is likely multifaceted, reflecting changes in sensitivity to TNFα released as tumors become inflamed, but also in part due to HDAC2-mediated deacetylation of PD-L1, affecting its nuclear translocation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Moreover, in pancreatic cancer, HDAC2 has been linked to metastasis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>].</p><p id="P34">Moreover, tumors evolving from HDAC2-depleted tumor cells exhibited reduced encapsulation by cross-linked collagen and a concomitant reduction in RAB38 expression (a melanosome biogenesis and trafficking protein also implicated in metastasis)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Collagen encapsulation of tumors can alter T cell distribution[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], excluding T cells from entering the encapsulated masses, rendering the tumor more resistant to ICI. Accordingly, the less encapsulated HDAC2-depleted tumors are more sensitive to ICI. While collagen capsules are likely assembled by tumor-resident fibroblasts, our RNAseq data suggest that tumor cells themselves may contribute. The relative importance of stromal to tumor-derived collagen and its regulation remains unclear; interactions among tumor cells, fibroblasts, T cells, and macrophages likely shape this architecture. Future studies should explore how HDAC2-depleted cells modulate tumor evolution to reduce encapsulation and whether this can be therapeutically exploited.</p><p id="P35">Understanding the precise chromatin acetylation program that is executed in HDAC2-high or HDAC2-low contexts and how these differ from HDAC1 or HDAC3 is crucial, particularly considering HDAC inhibitors under clinical evaluation. The higher sensitivity of HDAC2 to TNFα relative to its family members, which our results suggest, could guide future drug development. More broadly, shifts in chromatin acetylation are associated with stemness and therapy resistance. Particularly, ALDH1A3-driven metabolic acetylation of histone H3 has been linked to upregulation of the embryonic gene[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], <italic>Tfap2b</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], critical to drug-refractory melanoma.</p><p id="P36">Finally, DGM-based lineage mapping has shed light on how melanoma lineage states evolve in response to therapy. Melanocytic, differentiated melanomas in a pre-treatment setting are generally more sensitive to ICI; nonetheless, relapsed tumors adopt a more melanocytic phenotype post-treatment. One possible resolution to this paradox is that a melanocytic identity confers a selective advantage only after the tumor has reconditioned the TME to evade immune attack. For instance, we observed that relapsed tumors in our model exhibited increased RAB38 expression and were encased in dense collagen capsules that excluded T cells from the tumor mass. We speculate that the tumor must first remodel its microenvironment—potentially by forming a collagen capsule—to physically shield these otherwise immunogenic melanocytic cells from immune surveillance. In this scenario, once immune pressure is mitigated by encapsulation and other TME changes, reactivating a melanocytic program becomes a selective advantage post-therapy.</p><p id="P37">In summary, through analysis of curated single-cell developmental and metastasis datasets and comprehensive analyses of developmental lineages in published data, we reveal how inflammatory signals shape developmental plasticity in melanoma. We have generated rich datasets and developed signatures to fully map the contribution of fundamental, conserved embryonic neural crest lineage pathways to melanoma progression. We explore, for the first time, how single melanoma cells can simultaneously co-opt multiple neural crest pathways and how these hybrid states contribute to tumor evolution. These data, and the tools we provide, help us gain new insight into mechanisms of melanoma plasticity, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Mouse models and melanoma cell lines</title><p id="P38">Melanoblasts were isolated from the Dct-rtTA; tre-H2B-GFP (<italic>i</italic>Dct-GFP; Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research) mouse model.

A Cox mixed-effects regression was carried out to determine the hazard ratios of DGM activity on patient survival, with the patient cohort label of each sample used as a mixed effect to account for cohort-level differences in survival.</p></sec><sec id="S36"><title>Analysis of Vallius et al. microregion data from early melanoma lesions</title><p id="P67">DGM activities were computed in RNA-seq from microregions as described above. The R lme4 function from the lmerTest package was used to compute t-values associated with DGM activity differences in P vs N, MIS vs P, RGP vs MIS, and VGP vs RGP contrasts (with patient ID as a random effect to account for multiple microregions coming from each patient). In the analysis of DGM activity changes due to TILs, the lme4 function was used to estimate the significance of t-values of the brisk TIL vs no-immune and non-brisk TIL vs no-immune contrasts (with patient ID set as a random effect).</p></sec><sec id="S37"><title>Estimating the background distribution of hybrid states in M4-BRN2 cells</title><p id="P68">We used Gaussian copula sampling to simulate DGM activities for a given scRNA-seq dataset. Gaussian copula sampling involves first drawing samples from a multivariate normal distribution which requires two sets of inputs – the mean of each random variable, along with the covariance matrix that captures correlations between all pairs of random variables. The background covariance matrix we used was obtained by evaluating DGM activities in our iDct-GFP+ neural crest dataset and computing covariances between all pairs of DGM activities. This matrix represents the expected correlation between any pair of DGM activities when DGMs are evaluated in any scRNA-seq dataset and represents lineage relationships between Mel, Mes, Neural, and SCP lineages in the embryo.</p><p id="P69">After computing this background matrix, we then used AUCell to compute DGM activities in M4-BRN2 cells and assign each cell to a lineage based on whether a DGM activity is higher than its respective threshold T. We then draw a sample matrix <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>N</italic>×<italic>d</italic></sub> consisting of <italic>N d</italic>-dimensional vectors (where <italic>N</italic> is the number of M4-BRN2 cells and <italic>d</italic> is the number of DGMs) of DGM activities from a multivariate Gaussian distribution whose means are the average activity of each DGM amongst M4 cells and whose covariance matrix is the one computed above from iDct-GFP neural crest data.

Cells with more than 15% of reads aligning to mitochondrial genes were discarded. For each metastatic time-point, read counts were normalized using the NormalizeData function in Seurat[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] (v4.0.1) with default parameters. DoubletFinder[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] was used (with parameters pN = 0.25 and the first 30 PCs) to detect putative doublet cells that were then removed from further analyses. The SCTransform method[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>] was used to perform integration and batch correction (based on the first 20 PCs with k.score = 20 and k.weight = 20). Clustering was performed on the integrated data with a resolution of 0.2 and based on the first 30 PCs.</p><p id="P72">We performed two steps of computation to separate malignant from non-malignant cells. First, we ran inferCNV (inferCNV of the Trinity CTAT Project) to infer the number of gene-level deletions and amplifications of cells in each cluster using droplet scRNA-seq data from the Tabula Muris project[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>] as a reference background dataset. We then scored each cluster using AUCell with signature genes of every cell type from the healthy lung background data. We counted the number of gene-level CNVs (amplifications and deletions) based on whether the CNV score assigned to the gene was above the 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile (amplification) or below the 2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile (deletion) of CNV scores amongst background cells. Clusters that had a high CNV burden and did not score highly on markers of healthy lung cell types were declared as malignant cells.</p><p id="P73">Out of 9 cell clusters, one malignant cluster was excluded for being enriched in apoptotic signatures. Another cluster expressed macrophage marker genes and had an intermediate CNV score, potentially representing macrophages that have engulfed a malignant cell. One intriguing cluster expressed endothelial marker genes and had an intermediate CNV score. This cluster potentially contains both metastatic and normal cells with an endothelial phenotype or may represent metastatic cells that have transdifferentiated to an endothelial subtype, which has been noted in another melanoma metastasis study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. While this is a notable feature of this model, it did not appear to be linked to the co-option of melanocytic lineage biology and was not pursued further.</p></sec><sec id="S39"><title>SCENIC analysis to determine upstream regulators of melanoma NS-Hybrid State</title><p id="P74">SCENIC was run with default options on all cells in our embryonic Dct+ NCC dataset to derive regulons for each transcription factor. The target genes of each inferred regulon were then scored across malignant cells in both the M4-BRN2 mouse metastatic single-cell RNA-seq dataset and the Jerby-Arnon et al. patient cohort using AUCell. Within the M4-BRN2 dataset, we fit a linear mixed model of each cell’s regulon AUCell score versus its hybrid state label (NS-Hybrid, Other-Hybrid, or Singleton) and the logarithm of total reads per cell as fixed effects and the time-point from which the cell was sampled as a random effect. The same fixed effects were used to regress each regulon’s AUCell score in the Jerby-Arnon et al. cohort, but the patient ID was used as a random effect. The t-value associated with the contrast NS-Hybrid minus Singleton was stored in each regression, where the TFs associated with regulons amongst the ten highest t-values were considered for experimental validation.</p></sec><sec id="S40"><title>Analysis of bulk RNA-seq from siHdac2 and HDACi treatments on M4 and YUMM2.1 cell lines</title><p id="P75">Reads were aligned to the mm10 genome using the salmon pseudoaligner and the salmon index constructed using Gencode vM9 transcript annotation.
