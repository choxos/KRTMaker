basis of this shared risk remains poorly understood. The 16p11.2 microduplication (16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup>) is a highly pleiotropic copy number variant (CNV) conferring risk for multiple NPDs including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia and intellectual disability, and is associated with a high prevalence of seizures. We used a mouse model of the <italic>16p11.2</italic> duplication (<italic>16p11.2</italic><sup>dup/+</sup>) to uncover molecular and circuit properties associated with this broad phenotypic spectrum, and examined genes within the locus capable of phenotype reversal. Quantitative proteomics of cortical membranes revealed alterations to synaptic protein networks and products of diverse NPD risk genes in <italic>16p11.2</italic><sup>dup/+</sup> mice. Network analysis identified an epilepsy-associated protein subnetwork, which was dysregulated in <italic>16p11.2</italic><sup>dup/+</sup> mice and proteomic datasets from human NPDs. We investigated circuit properties in <italic>16p11.2</italic><sup>dup/+</sup> mice and found they exhibited hypersynchronous activity and enhanced network glutamate release, which increased susceptibility to seizures. We hypothesized that a regulator of the synaptic and epilepsy-associated protein network could have an important impact on pathophysiology. Human brain co-expression and interactome analysis revealed PRRT2 as a major hub in the dysregulated epilepsy subnetwork. Remarkably, restoring <italic>Prrt2</italic> copy number to wild-type levels rescued aberrant circuit properties, seizure susceptibility and social interaction deficits in <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> mice. We show that proteomics and network biology can identify important disease hubs in multigenic CNVs, and reveal molecular and circuit phenotypes which may be relevant to the complex symptomatology of 16p11.2 duplication carriers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of global disability, but the underlying disease mechanisms are still poorly understood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.

Epilepsy is frequently comorbid in individuals with ASD, with (22%) or without (8%) ID, while ASDs occurs in 4-20% of children with epilepsy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.

Allied with epidemiological studies, human genetics studies have demonstrated an overlap between risk factors for epilepsy and those of common psychiatric disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, epilepsy shares a genetic basis and co-occurs widely with NPDs, but biological substrates of this co-morbidity is poorly understood. Expanding our understanding of the molecular and circuit bases of epilepsy co-morbidity could provide insight into NPD pathophysiology and renewed treatment strategies that cross diagnostic boundaries.</p><p id="P3">Copy number variants (CNVs) have emerged as highly penetrant risk variants that increase risk for multiple disorders, offering powerful models to better understand the convergent etiology of NPDs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Among these, the proximal 16p11.2 duplication (BP4–BP5), is remarkable for its extensive pleiotropy, conferring risk for a wide variety of NPDs, including epilepsy. The CNV encompasses approximately 600kb on human chromosome 16, a region encoding 30 genes (27 protein coding), many of which have poorly defined functions in the brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Meta-analyses have identified this CNV as one of the most statistically robust variants associated with SZ and ASD (odd ratios 8-14), confirming initial studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the 16p11.2 duplication confers risk for a wide spectrum of NPDs including intellectual disability, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and Rolandic epilepsy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.

These complex neuropsychiatric phenotypes have led to the delineation of a 16p11.2 duplication syndrome [MIM: 614671]. Mouse models of the syntenic 16p11.2 duplication region have been generated (16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup> mice), and have variable impairments in locomotor activity, working memory, repetitive and social behaviors, but clear disease mechanisms, and genotype-phenotype relationships, are still lacking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Advancements in proteomic techniques and sample preparation protocols, have transformed the large-scale study of proteins; building blocks of neuronal circuits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Although RNA-sequencing is widely used in neuroscience, proteomics offers a new perspective to study altered molecular pathways, which cannot always be predicted by transcriptomics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Importantly, proteomics can offer increased resolution on subcellular compartments such as cellular membranes, key sites of cell-cell communication, and uncover critical protein:protein interaction networks. In combination with network biology, proteomics can be used to isolate important disease processes, identify core networks and critical hub proteins which may mediate pathogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Thus, proteomics is promising approach to discover novel molecular and circuit mechanisms associated with complex genetic disorders and uncover hub proteins that are capable of reversing disease biology.</p><p id="P5">Here, we use a systems biology approach, combining proteomics with human genetic datasets, to uncover disease networks, and critical hub proteins, that are disrupted in the membrane proteome of the 16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup> mouse model. We identify a disrupted network of epilepsy and synaptic gene-products in the 16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup> mouse model, which is concomitant with hypersynchronous circuitry, enhanced evoked glutamate release and increased seizure susceptibility. Bioinformatics and interactome proteomics further identified PRRT2, a protein encoded within the 16p11.2 region, as a highly connected hub within the epilepsy subnetwork disrupted in 16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup> mice. Remarkably, genetic correction of subnetwork hub PRRT2 rectified aberrant circuit function, improved seizure susceptibility, and rescued social deficits in 16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup> mice.

Here, we focused on studying proteomic dysfunction in the neocortex, a brain region that exhibits molecular and structural abnormalities in several NPDs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. We performed a quantitative proteomic analysis of neocortical membranes because these sub compartments contain a diverse array of transporters, cell adhesion molecules, receptors, ion channels and enzymes, which integrate many aspects of neuronal physiology, and could provide insights into cellular and circuit function. In addition, the composition of the membrane proteome may reveal novel disease mechanisms that cannot be captured by transcriptomics or whole-tissue proteomics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. We first validated the altered protein expression in the <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> mouse model by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>) and then fractionated the neocortex of <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> mice to obtain membrane fractions. We employed a stable isotope labeling in mammals (SILAM)-based quantitative proteomic technique using <sup>15</sup>N-labeled mouse brains as internal standards to compare <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> and wild-type membrane fractions, which were then analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We identified ~4400 proteins representing diverse membranous compartments including vesicles, dendrites, axons and synapses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Our approach revealed a widespread proteomic dysregulation of neocortical membranes in <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> mice, including 659 significantly upregulated and 1024 significantly downregulated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Importantly, PRRT2 (Z-ratio = 115.6) and SEZ6L2 (Z-ratio = 23.3), the two brain-expressed membrane proteins encoded in the 16p11.2 region were identified as upregulated in membrane fractions. Globally, membrane proteome changes were enriched for genes products that preferentially express in excitatory neurons versus inhibitory neurons or other cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>). Using gene ontology (GO) analysis, we found that upregulated proteins were significantly enriched for biological pathways regulating multiple aspects of circuit activity, including synaptic signaling, ion transport, exocytosis and action potential generation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Conversely, downregulated proteins had only modest enrichment for very few pathways. A more detailed analysis of synaptic ontologies using SynGO, revealed that upregulated proteins were particularly enriched for presynaptic processes including synaptic vesicle cycle and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E-F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Alterations in membrane protein abundance could be caused by several mechanisms including transcriptional dysregulation, proteostasis and protein trafficking. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved, we compared our proteomic data to two published datasets that used RNA-seq to profile gene expression changes in the whole neocortex or prefrontal cortex of 16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup> mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-C</xref>). In the whole neocortex dataset, we found 41 genes that overlapped with the membrane proteome changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). Enrichment analysis revealed this overlap was not statistically significant, both with, or without 16p11.2 genes included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D-E</xref>). We also considered genes/proteins in the whole cortex dataset that were altered in the same direction (i.e. up in RNA-seq vs up in membrane proteome or down in RNA-seq and down in membrane proteome), and again found no statistically significant enrichment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D-E</xref>). We next performed a correlation analysis with gene/proteins in the overlap (n=41) and found that they were significantly correlated (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0378), albeit with a poor linear relationship (R<sup>2</sup>=0.022) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F</xref>). However, the significance of this correlation disappeared (<italic>p</italic> = 0.1638) when genes in the 16p11.2 locus were removed, indicating that the correlation was dependent on cis effects of the 16p11.2 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2G</xref>). In the prefrontal cortex dataset, we found 53 genes that overlapped with the membrane proteome changes, which represented an enrichment more than was expected by chance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0036) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B and S2H</xref>). This enrichment persisted when we removed the 16p11.2 locus genes (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0024) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2I</xref>). However, when considering genes/proteins that were altered in the same direction, we found no statically significant enrichment, which was corroborated by the lack of correlation between the two data sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2J-K</xref>). Together these data indicate a lack of correlation between gene expression and membrane proteomic changes in for genes/proteins located outside of the 16p11.2 locus, and suggest that membrane changes are likely not due to global transcriptional effects.</p><p id="P8">Given that human <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> carriers exhibit a broad phenotypic spectrum, we set out to determine if there were molecular networks associated with NPDs represented within the proteomic data. To this end, we used gene set analysis to determine if the dysregulated proteins contained a burden of disease associated gene products identified by <italic>de novo</italic> exome sequencing studies of NPDs. We used exome sequencing data because these implicate single genes in disease, and can therefore be employed to identify disease-specific protein networks with defined biological functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. To uncover these molecular networks, we compared sets of dysregulated proteins identified in our proteomic study to disease-specific gene sets; generating a proteomic disease profile for cortical membranes in the <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> mouse. Importantly, we used all identified membrane proteins within our dataset as a background for these analysis, removing any bias which may arise from brain expression or membrane localization. We found an increased burden of risk factors associated with many <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic>-related NPDs in our dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). These data are reminiscent of the diverse clinical spectrum observed in CNV carriers and suggest that subnetworks relevant to each disease may be dysregulated in <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> mice. The most enriched disease gene set was associated with epilepsy risk factors, followed by ID, SZ and ASD gene sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). Most of the epilepsy gene set was contained in the upregulated proteins (+69%, <italic>p</italic> = 1.07 x 10<sup>-3</sup>), whilst SZ gene sets were enriched among the downregulated proteins (+14%, <italic>p</italic> = 2.35 x 10<sup>-2</sup>). ID and ASD gene sets were enriched in both up and downregulated datasets. Importantly, control datasets of <italic>de novo</italic> single nucleotide variants (dnSNVs) identified in non-affected individuals were not enriched in any proteomic dataset, demonstrating a selective enrichment for NPD risk factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). To confirm the enrichment for epilepsy risk factors in the proteomic dataset we used an independent gene set derived from a catalog of Mendelian disease genes (OMIM) associated with epilepsy or ID. This analysis revealed an even stronger enrichment for epilepsy (+103%, <italic>p</italic> = 1.11 x 10<sup>-4</sup>), suggesting a robust association between the altered proteins in cortical membranes of <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> mice and biological pathways related to epilepsy.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>An epilepsy subnetwork is altered in neuropsychiatric disorders</title><p id="P9">We next aimed to determine if epilepsy-related proteins in our data set were functionally independent or formed part of a larger protein-protein interaction (PPI) network with enriched biological functions. We seeded a network with 110 proteins disrupted in the <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> mouse model and genetically associated with epilepsy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). By matching with a PPI database <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, we found that the majority of epilepsy-associated proteins were physically interconnected (100 nodes, 137 edges), potentially forming a large functional module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). GO analysis further showed that the epilepsy-associated network was highly enriched for synaptic ontologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To determine the broader relevance of this network, we aimed to determine whether proteins disrupted in the epilepsy network and membrane proteome of <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> mice were also altered in NPD mouse models, and human post-mortem brain tissue in ASD and SZ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>). To this end, we overlapped lists of proteins dysregulated in the <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> mouse model with dysregulated proteins from mouse or human datasets, and assessed the extent of overlap between with each list. Gene enrichment set analysis was then used to determine whether the overlap was more than was expected by chance. We found that a majority of mouse model datasets we evaluated (namely, <italic>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup>, Shank3<sup>-/-</sup>, 22q11.2<sup>+/-</sup>, Cul3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) were enriched for the membrane protein alterations observed in <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> mice. Human datasets for ASD and SZ were remarkably, also enriched, indicating a convergence in the human and mouse proteomic changes. We next evaluated if proteins from the epilepsy subnetwork were disrupted in these same human and mouse datasets. We found proteins from this network were also enriched in multiple mouse models (<italic>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup>, 22q11.2<sup>+/-</sup>, (Cu1<sup>3</sup>)<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, and the level of enrichment in these models was consistently higher for the epilepsy network than for the global proteome disrupted in <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> mice. In human post-mortem data, ASD-associated changes were more enriched in the epilepsy network than in the full <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> membrane proteome (1.86 vs. 3.08 fold), as was the synaptosome dataset from SZ (1.99 vs. 3.34 fold). Together these data indicate the potential for shared proteomic pathophysiology across different genetic mouse models with diverse etiologies, and reveal that elements of the epilepsy network are disrupted in mouse models and human NPDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P11">In summary, we discovered a disrupted epilepsy module regulating essential aspects of circuit function, which strongly suggests that the activity of cortical networks is altered in <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> mice.

Evidence from brain imaging studies supports the view that network hypersynchrony is an epilepsy endophenotype and may facilitate epileptogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. It is also noteworthy that not all human 16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup> carriers have seizures. However, seizures are one of the most prevalent symptoms in 16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup> carriers affecting up to 40% of individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.

Thus, increased synchrony in the somatosensory cortex area may increase risk for Rolandic seizures. Nonetheless, <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> carriers are reported to have a diverse seizure types including, focal dyscognitive, generalized tonic-clonic, febrile and infantile seizures, indicating a seemingly general susceptibility to seizures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Implications of circuit phenotypes for other NPDs</title><p id="P32">Alterations in neuronal synchrony have been associated with a wide variety of NPDs including autism and schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>.

Overly synchronized cortical circuits therefore represent an attractive mechanism by which multiple neuropsychiatric phenotypes could be affected including aspects of cognition, social functioning and seizures. Here, we have shown that reversing circuit phenotypes in the <italic>16p11.2<sup>dup/+</sup></italic> mice is also associated with a rescue of social deficits, a non-epileptic phenotype.

Peak amplitude, half-width and frequency was calculated within MATLAB. Calcium event amplitude was measured by subtracting the local baseline (F0) to the maximum peak value (F) and was normalized to a percentage by dividing by the local baseline: (F-F0)/F0. A Monte-Carlo simulation using 1,000 permutations of the peaks for each neuron was used to unbiasedly detect the minimal number of co-active cells that could be considered a synchronized calcium event (threshold equal to the 99.9 percentile of the sum of events for the 1000 simulations). Following the detection of synchronized events, we determined the number of co-active cells per event and the frequency of network events within MATLAB. Neuronal synchronization was also assessed using a pairwise-correlation that measures the R coefficient correlation (a value of 1 being equal to a perfect positive correlation i.e. perfect synchrony) for the signals of all pairs of neurons. The delay between neurons is quantified by measuring the time separating a calcium event from the closest calcium event for every pair of neurons in an interval of plus or minus 2.1 seconds.</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Glutamate imaging in cultured neurons</title><p id="P60">Experiments were performed at DIV17-22 in primary cortical neurons.

The baseline of the signal was normalized using the “medfilt1” function and peaks were detected using “findpeaks”, with a minimum of 1% variation above the baseline. Evoked peaks were elicited by adding KCl (30 mM final conc.) directly into the ACSF of the imaging chamber. KCl-induced peaks were normalized by dividing fluorescence values by the baseline fluorescence (average of the first 50 frames). Normalized peaks were imported into GraphPad Prism.
