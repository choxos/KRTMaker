We compared GluK2 editing-deficient mice that express ~95% unedited GluK2(Q) to wild-type counterparts that express ~85% edited GluK2(R). At mossy fibre-CA3 (MF-CA3) synapses GluK2(Q) mice displayed enhanced postsynaptic KAR function and increased KAR-mediated presynaptic facilitation, demonstrating heightened ionotropic function. Conversely, there was reduced metabotropic KAR function, assessed by KAR-mediated afterhyperpolarization currents, in GluK2(Q) mice. GluK2(Q) mice had fewer GluA1- and GluA3-containing AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and reduced postsynaptic AMPAR currents at both MF-CA3 and CA1-Schaffer collateral synapses. Moreover, long-term potentiation of AMPAR-mediated transmission at CA1-Schaffer collateral synapses was reduced in GluK2(Q) mice. These findings suggest that GluK2 Q/R editing influences ionotropic/metabotropic balance of KAR signalling to regulate synaptic expression of AMPARs and plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Kainate receptors</kwd><kwd>AMPA receptors</kwd><kwd>AMPARs</kwd><kwd>ADAR2</kwd><kwd>RNA editing</kwd><kwd>Long-term potentiation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Kainate receptors (KARs) are glutamate-gated cation channels assembled from tetrameric combinations of the subunits GluK1-GluK5.

Despite their close homology to AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors, postsynaptic KARs mediate only a minor fraction of the ionotropic synaptic response to glutamate but they are critically important for synaptic integration and regulation of neural circuits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.

Metabotropic signalling through postsynaptic KARs has been demonstrated at Schaffer collateral CA1 synapses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and at MF-CA3 synapses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.

KAR-mediated inhibition of I<sub>sAHP</sub> occurs in multiple neuronal types via a G<sub>i/o</sub> G protein and PKC-dependent pathway and, in CA3 cells, is absent in GluK2 knockout mice, suggesting a crucial role for this subunit in this form of metabotropic signalling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">KAR surface expression is activity-dependently and bidirectionally regulated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.

Specifically, transient activation of GluK2-containing KARs in cultured hippocampal neurons increases AMPAR surface expression, and in hippocampal slices GluK2-containing KARs can induce AMPAR long-term potentiation (KAR-LTP<sub>AMPAR</sub>) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses via a pertussis toxin-sensitive metabotropic signalling pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.

The only previous study using these GluK2(Q) mice detected no differences in GluK2 mRNA levels, no alterations in editing of the other GluK2 editing sites (I/V and Y/C) and no change in Q/R editing of the GluA2 AMPAR subunit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. However, the GluK2(Q) mice were reported to have increased susceptibility to kainate-induced seizures and display a form of NMDAR-independent LTP at the medial perforant-DG synapses that is not present in WT mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Here, we show enhanced pre- and postsynaptic KAR ionotropic function in the GluK2(Q) mice compared to WT controls whereas metabotropic KAR-mediated inhibition of I<sub>sAHP</sub> was reduced. Furthermore, in GluK2(Q) mice AMPAR-mediated transmission at hippocampal CA3 and CA1 synapses, synaptic levels of GluA1 and GluA3 were decreased and LTP at CA1 Schaffer collateral synapses was severely attenuated. We interpret these data to indicate that GluK2 editing is important for determining the mode of KAR signalling, and that this, in turn, plays key roles in the regulation of basal expression of synaptic AMPARs and AMPAR-mediated synaptic plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Enhanced postsynaptic KAR and reduced AMPAR currents at MF-CA3 synapses in GluK2(Q) mice.</title><p id="P10">In recombinant systems KARs containing unedited GluK2(Q) have a higher conductance than edited GluK2(R) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.

Postsynaptic responses were recorded from CA3 pyramidal neurons in whole-cell voltage clamp configuration in the presence of picrotoxin (50μM) and D-APV (50μM) to block GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and NMDARs, respectively. The stimulation intensity applied to presynaptic axons was increased in small increments until a postsynaptic response was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).

However, how GluK2 editing impacts on KAR function and subsequent downstream AMPAR function has not been explored. To address these outstanding questions we compared WT mice, which contain &lt;15% unedited GluK2(Q), and GluK2 Q/R editing deficient (GluK2(Q)) mice that have &gt;95% unedited GluK2(Q) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">In recombinant expression systems KARs containing unedited GluK2(Q) have a much greater single channel conductance than those containing edited GluK2(R) (~150ps compared to &lt;10ps) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. We therefore predicted that postsynaptic ionotropic KAR function would be enhanced in GluK2(Q) mice. We found this to be the case, but the increase in EPSC<sub>KA</sub> we observed (WT=4.66 ± 0.63pA, GluK2(Q)=7.31 ± 0.50pA) was markedly less than expected based on the data from heterologous expression systems. However, it should be noted that heterologous expression systems can lack neuron specific proteins (e.g., Netos, KRIP6) that are known to affect the gating of the receptors. In addition, we are unaware of any information on how heteromeric KARs containing GluK2(Q) or GluK2(R) subunits behave when combined with GluK4/GluK5.</p><p id="P30">Similarly, we anticipated that the increased conductance and Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of GluK2(Q)-containing KARs should boost presynaptic KAR function, resulting in enhanced short-term facilitation at both 50ms (PPF) and 1s (FF) timescales. This is indeed what we found, but we also observed an increase in failure rate in the minimal stimulation experiments. These data suggest an additional factor of reduced basal probability of release, or number of release sites, within the large presynaptic mossy fibre boutons, which on its own is predicted to increase presynaptic facilitation. Minimal stimulation at 3Hz is sufficient to engage KAR-mediated FF and would therefore be expected to produce a lower failure rate in GluK2(Q) mice. We observed the opposite effect, suggesting that the reduction in basal probability of release is substantial. Our data cannot distinguish between reduced probability of release and reduced number of release sites so further anatomical investigation would be necessary to address this. Nonetheless, overall, our data indicate that GluK2(Q) mice exhibit enhanced pre- and postsynaptic KAR function.</p><p id="P31">In stark contrast to their enhanced ionotropic KAR function, GluK2(Q) mice show reduced metabotropic function measured by inhibition of I<sub>sAHP</sub> at MF-CA3 synapses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Possible explanations for the diminished metabotropic KAR signalling in GluK2(Q) mice include a reduction in expression of GluK1 and GluK2 KAR subunits and/or Q/R editing state-dependent conformational changes which regulate metabotropic signaling. It remains unclear and controversial which, and how, specific KAR subunits contribute to KAR metabotropic signalling. Indeed, it has been proposed by different groups that GluK1, GluK2, or GluK5 are required for G protein coupling and metabotropic effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Thus, although we cannot draw definitive mechanistic conclusions, our data demonstrate that GluK2(Q) mice show reduced metabotropic KAR signalling and, at the same time, enhanced ionotropic function.</p><p id="P32">A critical role for KAR signaling is activity-dependent regulation of both KAR and AMPAR surface expression. For example, depending on the extent of activation, KARs can enhance or reduce AMPAR surface expression to evoke LTP or LTD via metabotropic or ionotropic signalling, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Our data also show that GluK2 editing impacts on NMDAR-induced LTP at Schaffer collateral synapses in CA1, with GluK2(Q) mice exhibiting reduced LTP. GluK2(Q) mice also had reduced AMPAR-EPSCs at mossy fibre and Schaffer collateral synapses and lower GluA1 and GluA3 levels in synaptosomal fractions, suggesting that KARs not only regulate activity-dependent AMPAR trafficking but may also maintain basal synaptic levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs. It should be noted that activity-dependent regulation of KAR alters the synaptic expression of GluA1 and GluA2 AMPARs, while GluK2 editing specifically alters the basal synaptic expression of GluA1 and GluA3 containing AMPARs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Importantly, these changes were specific to AMPARs, since synaptic levels of the NMDAR subunits GluN1 and GluN2A were unchanged, indicating the loss of AMPARs is not due to wholesale changes in synaptic composition in the editing-deficient mice.</p><p id="P33">These findings demonstrate that KAR activity mediates the ‘tone’ of synaptic AMPARs at MF-CA3 and Schaffer collateral synapses and suggests a wider role where KAR signalling may set the tone for synaptic AMPAR composition more broadly. We speculate that this may be a homeostatic mechanism in which the presence of high-conductance, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable GluK2(Q)-containing KARs causes a compensatory decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable GluA1/GluA3-containing AMPARs to balance synaptic responsiveness. This is similar to the observed effects of KAR signalling on expression of AMPARs during the development of synaptic circuits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> and suggests that this developmental regulation extends into adulthood.</p><p id="P34">In healthy adult brain GluK2-containing KARs predominantly comprise edited GluK2(R) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Using mice that almost exclusively express only GluK2(Q) we show that the ionotropic/metabotropic balance of KAR signalling is radically altered by a lack of GluK2 editing. Based on these results, we propose that unedited GluK2(Q)-containing KARs primarily or exclusively function as ion channels with enhanced conductance for both mono and/or divalent cations, whereas the edited GluK2(R)-containing KARs act as metabotropic receptors to regulate and maintain network activity.</p><p id="P35">These findings are important because GluK2 Q/R editing is subject to both developmental and activity-dependent control <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.

Taken together our data indicate that physiologically and pathologically relevant alterations in GluK2 editing may dynamically regulate KAR function, signalling mode, maintenance of functional neuronal networks, and set the threshold for the induction of plasticity. Thus, in conclusion, our results highlight that GluK2 Q/R editing acts as a previously unsuspected molecular switch that regulates the enigmatic dual-mode capability of KARs to operate via either ionotropic or metabotropic signalling, to initiate distinct and diverse downstream pathways.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Animals</title><p id="P36">GluK2 editing-deficient ECS mice and their WT counterparts (129Sv strain) were created at the Salk Institute by mutating the intronic editing complementary sequence (ECS) in the <italic>grik2</italic> gene that directs ADAR2-mediated codon substitution in the GluK2 pre-mRNA. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P37">The mice were housed in groups of 2-4 in standard individually ventilated (IVC) cages in rooms with temperature maintained between 19-23°C and with 12h light and dark cycles.
