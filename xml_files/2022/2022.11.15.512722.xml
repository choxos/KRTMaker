Developing minimally invasive tools to modulate alpha activity and identifying the parameters that determine its response to exogenous modulators, is essential for the implementation of focussed interventions. We introduce Alpha Closed-Loop Auditory Stimulation <italic>(αCLAS)</italic> as an EEG-based method to augment and investigate these brain rhythms in humans with specificity and selectivity, using targeted auditory stimulation. Across three independent studies, we demonstrate that <italic>αCLAS</italic> alters alpha power, frequency, and connectivity in a phase, amplitude and topography-dependent manner. Using a single-pulse-<italic>αCLAS</italic> evoked potentials approach we show that the effects of auditory stimuli on alpha oscillations and resulting evoked potentials can be explained within the theoretical framework of oscillator theory and a phase-reset mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate the functional relevance of our approach by showing that <italic>αCLAS</italic> modulates sleep onset dynamics in an alpha phase-dependent manner.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The alpha rhythm (~10 Hz) is a defining electrophysiological feature of the waking human brain, most prominent in parietal and occipital areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], but observed across a variety of neural regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Alpha oscillations have been associated with fundamental processes, from memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] and perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], to ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Despite its reputed importance, selective modulation of the alpha rhythm remains challenging, and little is known about the underlying determinants of an alpha oscillation’s response to stimuli.</p><p id="P5">One promising route to efficacious alpha modulation is to address this rhythm on its own terms, using a closed-loop approach which leverages the instantaneous features of the oscillation in real-time. Influential theories posit that neuronal excitability fluctuates as a function of alpha phase and amplitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], since neurons more readily fire during the trough of alpha oscillations, and during periods of lower alpha amplitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Accordingly, the amenability of alpha to exogenous influence should itself also be phase-dependent, owing to the interdependent nature of spikes and oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p><p id="P6">In this vein, alpha phase-dependencies have been investigated in visual perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. These studies typically sort the EEG, post-hoc, on the (binary) basis of perception of a visual stimulus, finding an effect of alpha phase at stimulus onset. However, phase estimates are often dependent on what proceeds them (i.e. they are non-causal) and conscious perception itself may have an electrophysiological component which backwards-influences the preceding phase estimate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Experiments in which specific phases of the alpha oscillation are targeted in <italic>real-time</italic> are therefore needed to clarify phase-response dependencies.</p><p id="P7">Phase dependency of the response to stimuli has been demonstrated in a real-time manner for the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) motor evoked potential (MEP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. This approach circumvents the issue of time-dependency, but TMS pulses cause large artefacts in the EEG, rendering rapidly-repeating closed-loop (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]) stimulation unfeasible, and are clouded by concomitant residual auditory and somatosensory activity resulting from the TMS pulse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Therefore, previous studies have not been able to provide neurophysiological characterisations of phase-dependencies of the alpha rhythm, i.e. whether alpha oscillations themselves respond to stimuli in a phase-dependent manner.</p><p id="P9">Closed-loop <italic>sensory</italic> stimulation has the potential to overcome this limitation, since sensory stimuli do not create artefacts in the EEG (allowing repeated neurophysiological interrogation), with the additional advantage of utilising safe, easy to apply and affordable technology. This approach has been used in sleep studies in which <italic>sounds</italic> are commonly phase-locked to the slow-oscillations (0.5-4Hz) of sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Some of these studies have found a phase-dependent effect of stimuli and, in this case, their primary outcome is often neurophysiological. Thus, sounds boost or diminish slow-oscillations on a phase-dependent basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], although this remains contentious[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. However, the closed-loop approaches used to deliver sounds at particular phases of the slow oscillation cannot be directly employed to target the much faster alpha oscillation, since they predominantly operate on the basis of an amplitude-threshold, which is unsuitable for alpha rhythms because they are highly variable in their amplitude and are instead defined on the basis of frequency. Recently, a number of strategies have been proposed to overcome this limitation, either relying on forecasting algorithms for real-time phase prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] or through the application of a causal band-pass filter, the endpoint corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], to compute the instantaneous phase of an oscillatory signal in real-time.</p><p id="P10">Here, we introduce <bold>Alpha Closed-Loop Auditory Stimulation <italic>(αCLAS)</italic></bold>, which uses the ecHT approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] to administer sound stimuli phased-locked to the alpha rhythms of the waking brain. Across three independent studies we employ <italic>αCLAS</italic> to explore the precise contributions of <italic>phase</italic> to the response of alpha rhythms to external stimuli and provide evidence of the functional implications of this approach. We first demonstrate that repetitive-<italic>αCLAS</italic> induces phase-dependent modulations of alpha power, frequency, and connectivity in a spatially-specific manner. We then use singlepulse <italic>αCLAS</italic> to show that these effects are dependent on oscillation amplitude and can be explained using oscillator theory and a phase-reset model. Finally, we apply these principles during the transition to sleep, a process in which alpha oscillations become naturally dampened, to show that the dynamics of sleep onset can be modulated in a phase-dependent way by <italic>αCLAS.</italic></p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Study 1. Repetitive-αCLAS – Proof of Principle</title><sec id="S4"><title>Accuracy and spatial specificity of alpha closed-loop auditory stimulation</title><p id="P11">In Study 1, we examined whether repetitive-<italic>αCLAS</italic> can selectively modulate the resting alpha oscillation at different cortical locations, on the basis of the phase at which sounds are repeatedly administered (at four orthogonal phases: pre-peak 330°, postpeak 60°, pre-trough 150°, post-peak 240°, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Phase was computed in realtime (using the endpoint-corrected Hilbert Transform, ecHT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]) based on the EEG activity recorded from one electrode placed over the frontal, Fz (experiment 1) or parietal cortex, Pz (experiment 2). Simultaneously, we recorded whole-scalp activity using high-density (hd) EEG. Participants were exposed to 30-seconds of repeated sounds (termed ‘on’), interleaved with 10-seconds of silence (‘off’), while seated with their eyes closed (experiment 1, N=20, experiment 2, N=28; 10 blocks per phase per experiment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We first examined whether sounds were phase-locked in a physiologically meaningful manner. The presence of a spectral peak in the alpha band (7.5-12.5 Hz) in the phase-locking electrode during the ‘off’ period was confirmed in both the group average and majority of participants (experiment 1: 18/20; experiment 2: 28/28 participants, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The individual alpha frequency (IAF) in the ‘off’ periods correlated strongly with the average inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of the sounds, indicating that stimulation frequency was tailored to the individual, with approximately 1 stimulus applied per alpha cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Phase-locking accuracy was then assessed by calculating the mean resultant vector length and average angle of phase at stimulus onset, resulting in a value between 0 (uniform distribution) and 1 (unimodal distribution, perfect phase-locking). The resultants were high for both experiments and for all phases, with significant unimodal distributions (experiment 1, resultant mean ± std: 0.84 ± 0.07; experiment 2: 0.85 ± 0.05; Z-tests confirm significant unimodality in all conditions; z values &gt;18, ps&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, the average phase angles were highly consistent across participants, and orthogonal between conditions (experiment 1, phase angle deviation from target, mean ± std: 3.80° ± 2.14; experiment 2: 3.63° ± 1.37). Likewise, resultants were high in the hd-EEG system (experiment 1, mean ± std: 0.54 ± 0.13; experiment 2: 0.63 ± 0.13; z values &gt;8, ps&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>) and showed high phasespecificity. These results show that sounds were accurately delivered at the prescribed phase. Stimulus onset phase angles were comparable across experiments and EEG systems, but resultant vector lengths were lower in the hd-EEG, which can be explained by the difference in reference-schemes; the ecHT system used a mastoid reference, whilst the hd-EEG used scalp current density. Finally, we took advantage of the spatial resolution of the hd-EEG to assess the spatial selectivity of the phase-locking. Phase-locking was highly accurate across experiments, greatest around locations targeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>αCLAS induces phase and location-specific effects on alpha power and frequency</title><p id="P14">Having established the accuracy and spatial-specificity of <italic>αCLAS,</italic> we examined whether stimulation induced phase-dependent changes to the alpha oscillations we set out to target. When sounds were phase-locked to Fz EEG (experiment 1) we observed a main effect of phase on power, which was localised to frontal midline regions, around the target electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the topography of the effect of <italic>αCLAS</italic> phase determined by the ANOVA, for the centre, i.e. 10 Hz, alpha frequency; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2, S3</xref> show the specificity of this effect in the alpha band).</p><p id="P15">Changes in power were circumscribed to the alpha band and persisted throughout the 30-second stimulation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2Bi</xref>). To better understand this effect, we compared power changes between opposite phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2Bii-iii</xref>). We again observed significant effects of <italic>αCLAS</italic> phase in the alpha band that were present throughout the stimulation period, particularly when comparing the post-peak and post-trough conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2Biii</xref>). Noteworthily, these effects appeared to be frequency-specific, i.e., frequencies within the alpha band were not modulated equally. When different phases were targeted, the power at different frequencies within the alpha band was indeed significantly increased or decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The manner in which these power changes were distributed suggested a slowing or quickening of alpha rhythms; in the post-trough condition, for example, power decreased for high alpha frequencies, and increased for low alpha frequencies (i.e. slowing), and the inverse was true for the opposite phase, i.e. post-peak. For pre-peak and pre-trough conditions frequency effects were more modest, with the former mostly decreasing power in the alpha band and the latter largely increasing it.</p><p id="P16">To verify whether different phases impacted the frequency of alpha oscillations differently, we estimated instantaneous frequency (within the alpha band) across all EEG channels, following the method proposed by Cohen (2014). The stimulation-induced frequency change for each condition was then computed by subtracting the average alpha frequency of ‘off’ from ‘on’ periods. The topography of the effect of phase on frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2Di</xref>) showed a strikingly similar distribution to the effect of phase on power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Comparison of the frequency change showed significant differences in frequency between each phase condition, in agreement with what was inferred from the power change spectra, i.e. a slowing or quickening of different extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2Dii</xref>, these differences were not present during the ‘off’ period, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>).</p><p id="P17">We then performed the same analyses to experiment 2, targeting Pz. Contrary to our previous results, we did not observe a significant effect of <italic>αCLAS</italic> phase on the power of alpha oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5, S6</xref>). We observed a significant modulation of alpha power when focusing on a parietal ROI centred around Pz, but only for the post-trough, where alpha frequencies between ~10-11 Hz were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, we did not detect a change in frequency for Pz stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that the effects of <italic>αCLAS</italic> on alpha power and frequency are phase and location specific.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>αCLAS induces whole-brain changes in connectivity depending on the phase and targeted location</title><p id="P18">Functional connectivity metrics provide a useful framework to understand the coordination of brain regions during specific states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. We evaluated whether sounds altered brain connectivity in a phase-dependent manner by using two well-established and complementary, phase-based measures of synchrony, the phase-locking value (PLV) and phase lag index (PLI). While PLV is more sensitive to type 1 errors, i.e. incorrectly assigning connectivity (rejecting the null) that is in fact volume conduction, PLI is more sensitive to type 2 errors, i.e. incorrectly rejecting genuine connectivity (failing to reject the null) with zero (modulo pi) phase difference.</p><p id="P19">We observed a significant effect of <italic>αCLAS</italic> phase on the connectivity around the phase-locking site when targeting the alpha rhythm at Fz, experiment 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3Ai</xref>), which was specific to the alpha band (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>). To explore whether this frontal midline area modulated its connectivity to other regions of the brain, we used the electrodes showing significant phase effects as seeds and computed their connectivity to all EEG channels. The connectivity of this frontal cluster differed primarily between phase conditions in short-range connections with itself, and long-range connections with occipito-parietal and central channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3Aii</xref>). To better understand the effect of <italic>αCLAS</italic> phase on connectivity we computed PLV per phase condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The most noticeable patterns were observed for the post-peak and post-through conditions, such that during post-peak stimulation there was an increase in connectivity, particularly between frontal midline and occipito-parietal channels, in good agreement with the topology observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3Aii</xref>. The post-through condition, on the other hand, resulted in a fairly global decrease in connectivity, which was also present, albeit to a smaller extent, for the pre-peak and pre-through conditions. Using PLI, we observed similar effects of phase on connectivity, which was centred around Fz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3Ci</xref>), and comparable patterns to PLV of local and long-range connectivity between the frontal midline cluster and occipito-parietal channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3Cii</xref>). Regarding PLI per phase condition, while the overall pattern was similar to PLV, long-range connectivity was less salient, suggesting either the presence of volume conduction or the true existence of zero modulo pi-lag connectivity between these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Analysis of connectivity for experiment 2 (i.e. targeting Pz), did not show an effect of phase on either alpha PLV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) or alpha PLI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>), although a small and disparate effect was seen for delta PLV and beta PLI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>). Exploratory analysis on the alpha connectivity patterns of each phase condition showed a generalised decrease in whole-brain connectivity, particularly for pre-through and post-through conditions, in both PLV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>), and PLI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Overall, we observed again that the effects of <italic>αCLAS</italic> on brain dynamics are dependent on the phase applied and the location of the alpha rhythm targeted.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Changes in connectivity are related to frequency changes induced by αCLAS</title><p id="P22">Changes in connectivity might be explained by differences in frequency; in that the synchrony between two oscillators will, at least partially, depend on the differential of their frequencies – it is not possible for oscillators of different frequencies to have a coupling constant of 1, for example. Accordingly, we explored whether connectivity and frequency were related in experiment 1, where phase-dependent changes in frequency and connectivity were observed.</p><p id="P23">We first investigated whether frequency differences are present across the scalp in the absence of stimulation. This was achieved by expressing alpha frequency at all channels relative to frontal ROI alpha frequency, before averaging these values across all ‘off’ blocks of all conditions and participants to produce <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>. On average, alpha frequency was lowest at the frontal ROI and highest (approximately 0.4 Hz higher) across parietal and occipital regions. This gradient is consistent with previous investigations of frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> shows that when comparing the absolute frequency at the frontal ROI to all remaining channels, the frontal ROI was slower across all but one participant. This means that a selective increase in alpha frequency at the frontal ROI would bring it more in line with the remainder of the scalp, and a decrease would do the opposite. We then calculated the stimulation-induced change in this frequency difference by subtracting the absolute frequency difference in ‘on’ periods from those of ‘off’ periods for each condition; meaning regions becoming more similar in their frequencies with stimulation are assigned a negative value and vice versa.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> shows that the frequency difference was changed in an <italic>αCLAS</italic> phase-dependent manner, in accordance with the previously outlined frequency changes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p id="P24">Finally, we quantified the relationship between frequency difference and connectivity using all data from all conditions in a mixed effects model with participant as a random effect. This showed the predicted significant negative relationship between absolute frequency difference and connectivity in both of our connectivity metrics, and this held true for both the absolute values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4Di</xref> for PLV and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4Ei</xref> for PLI) and the stimulation-induced changes to those values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4Dii 4Eii</xref>). Although changes in frequency difference explain only a small amount of variance in connectivity (PLV R<sup>2</sup>=0.19, PLI R<sup>2</sup>=0.11), we suggest that it is a contributory factor and may, at the very least, describe differences in connectivity between the frontal ROI and the remainder of the scalp. This also indicates that a genuine change in connectivity may be at play, in line with theories of intra-brain information transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]; if inter-areal communication is dependent on oscillation phase, there may be a particular phase at which sound-evoked activity is most prominently relayed between regions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Study 2. Single-Pulse αCLAS – Mechanism</title><sec id="S9"><title>Auditory evoked potentials provide a putative phase-reset mechanism by which αCLAS may operate</title><p id="P25">To understand why sounds administered at different phases of the alpha oscillation appear to speed it up or slow it down we conducted a new study similar to Study 1, but with the critical difference that sounds were administered as isolated/single-pulse stimuli. In addition to allowing an exploration of phase reset, the application of single-pulse <italic>αCLAS</italic> provides a means to further investigate the spatial specificity (Fz vs Pz stimulation) of the effects reported before. In a phase-reset model, the phase (and hence, the <italic>frequency)</italic> of an oscillation changes <italic>abruptly</italic> following reception of a stimulus. Specifically, this model predicts that the extent and trajectory (i.e. faster or slower) of the reset is dependent on the phase at the onset of perturbation, consistent with our findings from experiment 1. For example, if an oscillation reliably resets to a particular phase with a fixed latency following a stimulus, the trajectory of its phase (and consequently, the frequency of the oscillation) would differ depending on the phase at stimulus onset – this can take two forms: an advancing of the cycle or a delaying, to meet the reset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>].</p><p id="P26">Study 2 was composed of two experiments targeting the alpha rhythm at Fz and Pz, respectively (experiment 3: N=8; experiment 4: N=7).

Oscillator theory would distinguish these two types of resetting as type 0 and type 1 respectively – type 0 describes a strong input/reset, characterised by a phase response curve with a gradient of 0 (as in Fz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), whilst type 1 describes a weak input/reset, typified by a phase response curve with a gradient of 1 (as in Pz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Additionally, when targeting Fz, the phase-dependent slowing and quickening observed in the PRC, agrees with what was seen in experiment 1; post-peak resulted in a quickening and post-trough achieved the opposite, but the remaining two conditions show more ambiguous responses. This ambiguity may be explained by the complexity associated with repeated perturbations. If an oscillator phase-resets with a fixed latency following a perturbation, but its frequency is allowed to vary, the phase-response profile should be frequency dependent – thus, if one pulse brings about a change in frequency, a second pulse may interact with the oscillation differently.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Study 3.

The increase in alpha frequency during pre-peak compared to pre-trough condition was observed for 15 out of 16 participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7Aii</xref>) and both conditions were significantly different in frequency to sham.

Using the data from the sham condition, in which sound triggers were locked to pre-peak, but no sound was played, allowed us to disentangle this conundrum. These dummy sound pulses were locked to the same phase as the pre-peak condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>), but the ISIs differed, indicating that the ISI was indeed dependent on the brain’s responses to sound, as opposed to the particular phase targeted. Furthermore, the distribution of ISIs differed between vigilance states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11</xref>). During sleep there was an increase of ISIs in the theta and sigma range, representative of the theta oscillations and spindles that characterise shallow sleep (N1/N2).

Whilst the frequency changes may appear very small they are consistent with, or greater than, those derived from the same analysis method elsewhere in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>].</p><p id="P45">Previous studies on phase-dependencies of neural oscillations consider phase an index of ‘cortical excitability’, i.e. a cyclical measure of the cortex’s sensitivity to stimuli. These studies focused primarily on secondary, or higher order, outcomes (perception, for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]) of stimuli delivered at a particular phase without making explicit predictions on the oscillation’s response, or they expected a straightforward change in the amplitude of the targeted oscillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>], akin to observations from sound stimulation to the slow oscillations of sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Whilst our stimulation effects agreed with the literature, insofar as they are phase-dependent, we found they could be better explained by changes to the <italic>frequency</italic> of oscillations, rather than amplitude. Striking phase-dependent changes in alpha-band connectivity were also observed, which we suggest are at least partially consequent of this localised frequency change, but may also have implications for theories of intra-brain information transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>].</p><p id="P46">By targeting the alpha rhythm at multiple phases while delivering single-pulse <italic>αCLAS</italic> we tested whether a phase-reset mechanism would provide a parsimonious explanation to the observed alpha frequency modulation. Our results support this hypothesis and were consistent with an oscillator model, in which a perturbation will advance or delay an oscillation to varying degrees depending on the phase at which it is administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. While there is no unanimous consensus on how related or unrelated evoked potentials are to phase reset of oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>], our results cannot simply be explained by the response evoked by the auditory stimulus, as we observed similar auditory evoked potentials across phase conditions. In addition, our results showed that the frequency dependency on phase was maintained, for short (Study 1) and sustained periods of stimulation (Study 3).</p><p id="P47">Despite, phase-locking with high spatial selectivity, modulation of alpha activity was limited to phases targeted at the frontal region. We put forward two complementary explanations for this phenomenon supported by our findings. The first lies in the endogenous regional differences in alpha amplitude, i.e. higher in parietal than frontal locations. Indeed, our results demonstrate that a parietal phase-reset could only be observed in instances of low alpha power, and that alpha power and phase reset magnitude are strongly related. This is also in line with oscillator theory, which proposes a phase reset is dependent on the magnitude of both the oscillator and the perturbation, and agrees with prominent theories that the phasic inhibition exerted by alpha oscillations is proportional to their amplitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. Secondly, the differential in the magnitude of AEPs at frontal and parietal regions could be a contributory factor to regional differences. Future studies employing visual stimuli phase-locked to parietal alpha oscillations could help disentangle the contribution of evoked potential magnitude and oscillation amplitude in phase-dependent responses, since visual evoked potentials are larger over the visual cortex in spite of higher amplitude oscillations.</p><p id="P48">Finally, in addition to the immediate electrophysiological consequence of <italic>αCLAS,</italic> we have shown the functional significance of this approach, during the transition to sleep. Auditory stimuli modulated alpha frequency, once again, and sleep depth on a phase-dependent basis. We, once more, put forward two hypotheses. In Study 1, in addition to a frequency change, we showed that pre-peak <italic>αCLAS</italic> predominantly caused a decrease in alpha power, whilst pre-trough <italic>αCLAS</italic> did the opposite, i.e. an increase in alpha power. Accordingly, during the transitionary period of N1 sleep, pre-trough <italic>αCLAS</italic> may have impeded the disappearance of alpha, preventing sleep from progressing further, whilst pre-peak <italic>αCLAS</italic> did not. Alternatively, differences in sleep depth may simply reflect phasic differences in sensitivity to sound. In this scenario, pre-trough locked sounds arrived at a more suitable phase at which to perturb the brain and in consequence the sleep process, in a similar vein to the cyclic excitability put forward in the visual neuroscience literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. Studies using intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings in humans or animal models could help to elucidate the direct neural response and offer further mechanistic insights.</p><p id="P49">A general limitation of our studies is that our closed-loop stimulation did not account for variations in the endogenous alpha power. This was mitigated by the fact that participants had their eyes closed, a state of abundant alpha oscillations, and variations in alpha power were used to our advantage in Study 2. However, in Study 3, we see that ISIs deviate to other frequencies when alpha oscillations are reduced as participants fall asleep. While we cannot completely rule out an effect of ISI, or stimulation frequency in Study 3, such that the impact of sound on sleep is only phase-dependent in the sense that the frequency of sound was phase-dependent, the differences in ISI (0.4 Hz on average) are very slight, rendering this explanation unlikely. Future studies can implement closed-loop strategies that include a detection threshold, thus limiting stimulation to periods when the target rhythm is most prominent. Another helpful addition may be the inclusion of a random-sound condition – in Study 3 we were unable to say for certain whether the pre-peak represented a moment of decreased sensitivity to sound, or pre-trough a window of increased sensitivity. Finally, we used a mastoid reference for real-time phase-locking. The use of an on-line Laplacian reference, as seen in some other closed-loop experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], may afford stronger, and further localised effects.</p><p id="P50">Alpha oscillations are involved in a number of fundamental processes. Here we demonstrate that sound can be used to effect phase-dependent modulation of their activity. Future research could extend our findings into potential clinical applications. For example, by countering the decline in alpha frequency observed in older age and cognitive decline/dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>] or facilitating the increase in alpha frequency observed during increases in cognitive load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]. There remains much to be explored, regarding the application of <italic>αCLAS</italic> to neural oscillation-dependent behaviours, but we propose that sound can provide more utility in this context than previously considered, particularly if stimulation is used to address the brain on its own terms, through closed-loop approaches.</p></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S16"><title>Participants</title><sec id="S17"><title>Study 1</title><p id="P51">58 participants took part in this study, 25 in experiment 1 and 31 in experiment</p><p id="P52">2.

In addition, in Studies 1 and 2, we used a StimTrak (Brain Products GmbH) that logged a trigger whenever a sound was played, allowing us to assess phase-locking in the hd-EEG data and to time-locked evoked potentials. In Study 3, an analogue marker was sent from the ecHT device to the S-Med PSG system, so as to align EEG recordings according to the start of the nap.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S28"><title>EEG Pre-processing</title><p id="P64">All EEG data were pre-processed and analysed in MATLAB 2021a (Mathworks, Natick, MA). EEG filtering was carried out using the FieldTrip toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>], all other preprocessing was carried out using EEGLAB v2022.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. All topoplots and related statistics were produced using FieldTrip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>].</p><p id="P65">Hd-EEG data were high-pass filtered (1 Hz) and notch filtered (50 Hz, 100 Hz), before automatic subspace reconstruction (ASR) was used to remove noisy channels and artefacts. This was followed by independent component analysis, to identify and remove components related to ocular and cardiac artefacts, in Study 1. EEG data from Study 3 were filtered between 1 and 30 Hz, before artefacts were manually identified and removed. The hd-EEG data was subjected to a scalp current density re-referencing, whilst the EEG data from study 3 remained referenced to Cz.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>EEG Analysis</title><p id="P66">Accuracy of phase-locking was calculated for each channel, participant, condition and experiment using the following method. For every stimulus, the EEG was epoched in 1 s windows up to and including stimulus onset, before the ecHT algorithm was applied, and the final phase estimate in each window was taken. The ecHT algorithm minimises the Gibbs phenomenon by applying a causal bandpass filter to the frequency domain of an analytic signal, thus selectively removing the distortions to the end part of the signal. This strategy has been shown to provide accurate computations of the instantaneous phase and envelope amplitude of oscillatory signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. The resultant vector length of these values was then computed, giving a value between 0 and 1, representing perfectly uniform and perfectly unimodal circular distributions respectively. The accuracy of phase-locking for the group was summarised by computing the average resultant of all participants, and computing a z-test. Z-test was calculated using phase angle and resultant per participant, and the respective target phase angle (i.e. 60°, 150°, 240°, 330° depending on the condition).</p><p id="P67">For all analyses regarding power, the same method was used; power was computed in 1-second epochs, 2-30 Hz, in steps of 0.1 Hz, Hamming window, using the ‘pwelch.m’ function. For all analyses regarding frequency, Cohen’s frequency sliding method was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>].</p><sec id="S30"><title>Study 1</title><p id="P68">Frontal and parietal regions of interest (ROI) were defined <italic>a priori,</italic> and included four electrodes, the phase-locking electrode and the three surrounding electrodes. The frontal cluster comprised AFz, Fz, AFF1h, and AFF2h. Whist the parietal ROI consisted of Pz, POz, PPO1h, and PPO2h.</p><p id="P69">For all Study 1 analyses of power spectra, percentage changes from ‘off’ to ‘on’ were computed for every frequency bin. Before running statistics and plotting time-frequency representations, data were smoothed <italic>across time,</italic> using a moving mean window of 4 seconds. ‘movmean.m’ function, with a window argument of ‘[0 4]’, meaning each second in the plot was an average of that second and the 4 seconds that followed. Statistics were computed for these time-frequency representations using either one-way ANOVA or t-tests as appropriate. Statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) contiguous clusters of 10 or more time-frequency points were kept and considered significant, and smaller clusters were discarded to control for multiple comparisons. Individual alpha frequency (IAF) was calculated at the respective phase-locking electrode (i.e. Fz/Pz) using the frequency sliding method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>].</p><p id="P70">Connectivity was computed for four frequency bands (delta 1-4 Hz, theta 4-7 Hz, alpha 8-12 Hz, beta 13-30 Hz), for every second of clean EEG data. Two metrics were used, phase-locking value (PLV) and phase lag index (PLI). In both cases, the following was carried out for each channel pair: the data from each channel was filtered in the band of interest using a 2<sup>nd</sup> order Butterworth filter; phase difference between the two channels was estimated for all time points using Hilbert transform derived phase estimates; for each second, the resultant vector length of phase differences was computed. The only difference between PLV and PLI was that in the case of PLI, phase differences of 0 mod π were discarded prior to computing the resultant. When comparing conditions, these measures of connectivity were averaged across the ‘on’ (sound stimulation) period. When computing stimulation-induced changes to connectivity, these measures were separately averaged across the ‘on’ and ‘off’ periods before comparing the two.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Study 2</title><p id="P71">Broadband auditory evoked potentials were computed by filtering the data between 1 and 40 Hz (2<sup>nd</sup> order Butterworth), and averaging over all trials, per condition, per participant. Narrowband auditory evoked potentials (both amplitude and phase) were computed by applying the ecHT algorithm – a 1 s window was slid in increments of 1 data point (2 ms), each window was subjected to ecHT, and the estimate for the final timepoint in that window was assigned to that timepoint in the data.</p><p id="P72">To assess unimodality of phase angles between conditions (and hence, a phase reset), a Rayleigh test was carried out for each timepoint, using the average phase angle and resultant for each participant, for each condition. Timepoints at which the Rayleigh p≤0.05 were considered to have significant unimodality.</p><p id="P73">Trials were sorted into octiles on the basis of pre-stimulus (-200 to -100 ms) alpha power, (mean ± SD number of trials per octile per participant: experiment 3: 22.69 ± 0.998; experiment 4: 21.86 ± 2.37). This allowed us to assess the effect of oscillation amplitude on phase-reset.</p><p id="P74">The aforementioned phase estimates were also used to sort all evoked potentials by stimulus onset phase, into ten 36° bins centred on 0°, 36°, 72°, 108°, 144°, 180°, 216°, 252°, 288°, and 324° (mean ± SD number of trials per phase bin per participant; experiment 3: 74.02 ± 1.45, minimum: 67.1, maximum: 80; experiment 4: 72.19 ± 2.72, minimum: 67.1, maximum: 80.4). This allowed phase response curves to be computed at various latencies, by plotting starting phase bin against end phase, and to derive phase transfer curves by plotting starting phase bin against change from expected phase (assuming a 10 Hz oscillation).</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Study 3</title><p id="P75">Sleep was scored by an experienced sleep technician blinded to the experimental condition, according to AASM guidelines. In order to better assess the dynamics of the ecHT’s stimulation, we computed inter-stimulus intervals ISI’s by taking the difference in time between each stimulus and the stimulus that proceeded it, before converting this value to Hz. ISI’s greater than 0.5 s (&lt;2 Hz) were discarded before the average ISI was computed by taking the median. The proportion of ISI’s which fell in canonical bands (theta 4-7 Hz, alpha 8-12 Hz, sigma 12-18 Hz) was then computed, to demonstrate that the behaviour of the stimulator followed the oscillatory features of the sleep stages.</p><p id="P76">We employed eBOSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>] to estimate both rhythmic, i.e. oscillatory, and arrhythmic, i.e. aperiodic or 1/f, EEG activity. For eBOSC analysis, for each channel, EEG data were divided into 30 s epochs, since, during a dynamic process such as sleep onset, a single fit and threshold for oscillation detection is unlikely to be optimal. For each of these epochs, eBOSC was run between 1-30 Hz, in steps of 0.25 Hz, excluded frequencies for background 1/f fit 7:16 Hz. Only oscillations with a duration of at least 3 cycles were analysed. The abundance computed was then averaged within canonical bands for each epoch. This was done for all channels (F3, F4, C3, C4, O1, O2) before further averaging into regions (frontal: F3, F4; central: C3, C4; occipital: O1, O2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p id="P77">Unless stated otherwise, statistics were run in the following manner. Cluster-corrected permutation t-tests or ANOVA were run on FieldTrip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>] and used for topographical representations. Linear mixed-effects models (LMEM), in which participant was a random effect, were used throughout (for all but one violin plot – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Where these LMEM registered a significant main effect (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) post-hoc comparisons between all groups were carried out using the ‘emmeans’ toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jackatta/estimated-marginal-means">https://github.com/jackatta/estimated-marginal-means</ext-link>), so as to control for multiple comparisons. Study 3 features a number of ‘stim minus sham’ plots – in these cases, an LMEM was run on the data from the three groups, prior to subtracting sham, and the sham-subtraction was applied for visualisation purposes. All circular statistics were conducted using the ‘circstat’ toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS157214-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d6aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S34"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Sarah Leslie and Adrian Cheung for their contributions to data collection, Giuseppe Atzori for scoring the sleep EEGs, David Wang for his technical support, and Ullrich Bartsch for fruitful discussion of our results.</p><p>H.H. is supported by the University of Surrey’s Doctoral College Scholarship Award.</p><p>I.R.V. is supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/S008314/1).
