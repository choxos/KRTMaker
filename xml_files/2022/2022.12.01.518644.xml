Systemic dissemination of EV-D68 is crucial for the development of extra-respiratory diseases, but it is currently unclear how EV-D68 viremia occurs. We hypothesize that immune cells contribute to the systemic dissemination of EV-D68, as this is a mechanism commonly used by other enteroviruses. Therefore, we investigated the susceptibility and permissiveness of human primary immune cells for different EV-D68 isolates. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) inoculated with EV-D68, only B cells were susceptible but virus replication was limited. However, B cell-rich cultures, such as Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell line (BLCL) and primary lentivirus-transduced B cells, were productively infected. In BLCL, neuraminidase treatment to remove α2,6- and α2,3-linked sialic acids resulted in a significant decrease of EV-D68 infected cells, suggesting that sialic acids are the functional receptor on B cells. Subsequently, we showed that dendritic cells (DCs), particularly immature DCs, are susceptible and permissive for EV-D68 infection and that they can spread EV-D68 to autologous BLCL. Altogether, our findings suggest that immune cells, especially B cells and DCs, play an important role in the development the systemic dissemination of EV-D68 during an infection, which is an essential step towards the development of extra-respiratory complications.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a small non-enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Enterovirus.</italic> Although EV-D68 causes predominantly mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, EV-D68 caused outbreaks of severe respiratory diseases worldwide in 2014, which were associated with neurological complications in some individuals. Among these complications, acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) was most frequently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Since then, EV-D68 has caused biennial outbreaks of severe respiratory disease and AFM up to 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). EV-D68 circulation was limited during the pandemic, partly due to COVID-19 measures, but EV-D68-associated severe respiratory illnesses have been rising in several countries since 2021 and 2022 due to easing of COVID-19 measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Throughout the years, multiple clades of EV-D68 circulated, but so far there is little evidence for differences in the virulence of these viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The ability of EV-D68 to disseminate into the circulation (viremia) is essential for the virus to spread from the respiratory tract, which is the primary replication site of the virus, to other organs, such as the central nervous system (CNS), and cause extra-respiratory complications. However, despite the importance of viremia in the pathogenesis of EV-D68 infection, the mechanism that leads to EV-D68 viremia is poorly understood.</p><p id="P5">Studies in mice, ferrets and patient samples have shown that the virus or viral RNA can be detected in the circulation and extra-respiratory tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). In intranasally inoculated mice, virus was detected in the blood within 24 hours post-inoculation (hpi), and in extra-respiratory tissues, such as the spleen and skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). In intranasally inoculated ferrets, virus was detected in axillary lymph nodes at multiple days post-inoculation (earliest detection at day 5 post-inoculation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).

In addition, it is unclear whether the virus detected in the circulation is a direct spill-over from the respiratory tract or whether virus first spreads to and replicates in other tissues, <italic>e.g.</italic> lymphoid tissues, before disseminating into the circulation.</p><p id="P6">Other EVs, such as poliovirus and EV-A71, are known to replicate in lymphoid tissues, resulting in a sustained production of infectious viruses and subsequent spill-over into the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). In the case of EV-D68, the role of immune cells and lymphoid tissues in the development of viremia remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that EV-D68 productively infects several human immune cell lines, such as granulocytic (KG-1), monocytic (U-937), T (Jurkat and MOLT) and B (Raji) cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), suggesting that immune cells or lymphoid tissues may play a role in the development of EV-D68 viremia. Here, we investigated the susceptibility and permissiveness of human primary immune cells to infection of EV-D68 from different clades to unravel the potential role of immune cells in the development of viremia and to investigate if there are clade-specific differences in the susceptibility and permissiveness of these cells. Subsequently, we investigated whether dendritic cells (DCs) can transmit virus to other immune cells, such as B cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Human B cells are susceptible and permissive to EV-D68 infection</title><p id="P7">To investigate whether human leukocyte subsets are susceptible to EV-D68 infection, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were inoculated with EV-D68 strains from subclades A, B2 and D. We observed that B cells were susceptible to infection with EV-D68/A (mean 6% ± standard error of mean (SEM) 1) and EV-D68/B2 (3% ± 1) but not for EV-D68/D, based on intracellular expression of EV-D68 capsid protein VP1. In one donor, 3% of monocytes were susceptible to infection with EV-D68/A. We did not observe any VP1<sup>+</sup> cells in CD4<sup>+</sup> nor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Next, we investigated whether EV-D68 inoculation of PBMC resulted in a productive infection. Supernatant and cell lysate were collected and the presence of infectious virus particles at 0, 6, 8, 10, 24, 48 and 72 hpi was determined by virus titration. Despite the presence of infected cells after inoculation with EV-D68/A or EV-D68/B2, we did not observe an increase in infectious virus titer at any time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). As human PBMC consists only of 4 – 14% of B cells, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) of which 3 – 6% were infected by EV-D68, we cannot exclude the possibility that viral replication occurs in VP1<sup>+</sup> B cells but this was below the detection limit of the assay.</p><p id="P9">In order to determine whether B cells are susceptible and permissive for EV-D68, we utilized two B cell-rich models. We first inoculated Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell line (BLCL) with EV-D68 strains from subclades A, B2 and D. The inoculation resulted in 13% ± 4 EV-D68/A, 18% ± 5 EV-D68/B2 and 21% ± 4 EV-D68/D VP1<sup>+</sup> cells, although there was variation among donors in the percentage of infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). Production of new infectious viruses over time (<sup>~</sup>2 – 3 logarithmic increase of TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml within 24 hours) was detected after inoculation with all three viruses, in which EV-D68/B2 and EV-D68/D replicated faster than EV-D68/A, albeit without any statistical differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Primary B cell clones that were lentivirus-transduced to express the germinal center-associated B cell lymphoma-6 (Bcl-6) and Bcl-xL in order to endow a stable proliferative state, were inoculated with EV-D68 strains from subclades A, B2 and D. This resulted in 11% ± 2 EV-D68/A, 27% ± 8 EV-D68/B2 and 14% ± 6 EV-D68/D VP1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C)</xref>. The inoculation also resulted in production of new infectious viruses (<sup>~</sup>2 – 3 logarithmic increase within 10 to 24 hours), without any statistical differences among the different EV-D68 clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Infection of BLCL is largely mediated by the presence of α2,3- and α2,6-linked SAs</title><p id="P11">Several immune cells, including B cells, express α2,6-linked and α2,3-linked sialic acids (SAs), which can function as receptors for EV-D68 to initiate binding and virus entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). To investigate whether α2,3- and α2,6-linked SAs mediate EV-D68 infection of BLCL, BLCL were treated with <italic>Arthrobacter ureafaciens</italic> neuraminidase (ANA) to remove cell surface SAs prior to inoculation with EV-D68 strains. Upon ANA treatment, the average percentages of α2,3-linked SA<sup>+</sup> BLCL decreased from 77% ± 9 to 38% ± 3 and of α2,6-linked SA<sup>+</sup> cells from 89% ± 1 to 5% ± 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). ANA treatment of BLCL prior to inoculation resulted in a significant decrease of percentage of VP1<sup>+</sup> cells, with only 2% ± 1 EV-D68/A, 5% ± 2 EV-D68/B2 and 5% ± 1 EV-D68/D VP1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Dendritic cells (DCs) are susceptible and permissive to EV-D68 infection</title><p id="P12">DCs are a subset of immune cells that are attracted to sites of inflammation, but not abundantly present in PBMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). To investigate whether DCs are susceptible and permissive to EV-D68 infection, monocytes were differentiated in immature and mature DCs (imDCs and mDCs, respectively), and inoculated with EV-D68 strain from subclade A as a representative strain. Increased expression of maturation markers (HLA-DR, CD86, PD-L1 and CD83) was used to confirm differentiation of imDCs to mDCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig</xref>). The average percentage of VP1<sup>+</sup> cells in imDCs (10% ± 1) was significantly higher than in mDCs (4% ± 1) at 6 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>).

Therefore, we investigated whether imDCs can transmit EV-D68 infection to B cells. EV-D68/A-inoculated imDCs were co-cultured with autologous BLCL (BLCL+DC), after which the percentages of VP1<sup>+</sup> BLCLs were determined. The following controls were included: (1) EV-D68/A-inoculated imDCs (DC only); (2) BLCL cultured with supernatant from EV-D68/A-inoculated imDCs collected at 0 hpi, directly after the virus inoculation for 1 hour and the subsequent washing steps (BLCL + t0 DC sup) and (3) BLCL cultured with supernatant from EV-D68/A-inoculated imDCs collected at 6 hpi (BLCL + t6 DC sup). The schematic representation of this experiment is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>. As observed previously, inoculation of imDCs in the absence of their autologous BLCL resulted in an average of 11% ± 2 VP1<sup>+</sup> cells at 6 hpi and the percentage remained stable at 24 hpi. In imDCs co-cultured with BLCL, we observed an average percentage of 10% ± 4 VP1<sup>+</sup> imDCs, although this percentage decreased at 24 hpi (4% ± 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>). When BLCLs were inoculated with supernatants from EV-D68-inoculated imDCs collected at 0 or 6 hpi, only very few B cells were infected, with average percentages of 0.5% VP1<sup>+</sup> BLCLs in BLCL+t0 DC sup and 1% VP1<sup>+</sup> BLCLs in BLCL+t6 DC sup at 24 hpi. When BLCLs were co-cultured with EV-D68-inoculated imDCs, the percentage of infected BLCL increased from 2%±1 at 6 hpi to 6% ± 1 at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The inoculation of imDCs in the absence of BLCL resulted in production of new infectious virus particles (<sup>~</sup> logarithmic increase of TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml) within 24 h. Detection of infectious virus particles in the supernatants of the BLCL+DC co-culture showed efficient virus replication and stable virus titer over time (<sup>~</sup>1 logarithmic increase of TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml) within the same period of time. Very few, if any, new infectious virus particles were produced by BLCL inoculated with t0 or t6 DC supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>). Together, the results suggested that imDCs are capable to transmit virus to other susceptible immune cells, such as B cells, which subsequently become productively infected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">The systemic dissemination of EV-D68 is an essential step for extra-respiratory spread of the virus and the development of associated complications, such as AFM, but the underlying mechanism of how viruses spread to the circulation or the origin of virus in blood is largely unknown. In this study, we reveal the potential role of immune cells in the systemic dissemination of EV-D68. We show that human B cells and DCs are susceptible and permissive to EV-D68 infection and that DCs may play a role in the transmission of virus to B cells.</p><p id="P16">Immune cells are susceptible to infection of other members of <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>. Coxsackievirus type B infects murine splenic B cells resulting in production of new virus particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Poliovirus productively infects DCs and macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> (human PBMC) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (non-human primates) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Echoviruses and EV-A71 have also been reported to infect human imDCs and mDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Here, we showed that primary human B cells and DCs are susceptible and permissive to EV-D68 infection, which fits with findings in a cohort study that detected enterovirus RNA in peripheral blood B cells and DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). In B cells, this tropism is facilitated by the presence of α2,6- and/or α2,3-linked SAs. Productive infection was only detected in BLCLs and lentivirus-transduced B cells; the latter resembles activated germinal center B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Additionally, imDCs were more susceptible and permissive to EV-D68 infection than mDCs. Therefore, it is possible that activation or maturation state of immune cells play a role in the susceptibility and permissiveness to EV-D68 infection, similar to what is observed in poliovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Furthermore, it may be that the different susceptibility to EV-D68 between imDCs and mDCs is due to higher expression of α2,6-linked SA on imDCs than mDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).</p><p id="P17">We observed differences in the susceptibility and permissiveness to EV-D68 infection among viruses or donors included in this study. Differences in the susceptibility for different EV-D68 clades were observed in B cells within the PBMCs, but this was not observed in BLCLs and lentivirus-transduced B cells. Donor variation was observed in PBMCs and all B cell models and, in one PBMC donor, we observed monocytes infected with EV-D68 isolate from subclade A. The underlying mechanism for these differences among donors and possibly among different virus clades, as well as their association with the risk of the development of extra-respiratory diseases, are still unclear.</p><p id="P18">Virus replication within immune cells and/or lymphoid tissues is likely important for the development of a viremia. Due to the susceptibility and permissiveness of immune cells to EV-D68 infection, an immune cell-rich environment, such as a lymphoid tissue, can serve as a secondary replication site for EV-D68, from where the virus can spread into the circulation. Since poliovirus viremia is essential for virus spread to the CNS and the subsequent development of CNS diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), it can be speculated that EV-D68 viremia is essential for virus entry into the CNS and subsequent neurological complications, such as AFM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). In addition, a viremia could lead to virus spread to other organ system contributing to non-neurological complications associated with EV-D68 infection, including acute gastroenteritis, myocarditis and skin rash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Prevention of spread or productive infection in the lymphoid tissues may prevent systemic dissemination, as observed in poliovirus infection, in which vaccination prevents viral spread to other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Based on our findings, we propose a model that explains the systemic dissemination of EV-D68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref>). EV-D68 infects respiratory epithelial cells, which results in the production of infectious virus particles and the recruitment of immune cells, such as imDCs. From the respiratory tract, cell-free virus can spill over into the circulatory and lymphatic systems and spread into lymphoid tissues. Alternatively, imDCs can become infected, and migrate to the lymphoid tissues, where they release newly produced viruses or spread virus to resident DCs or B cells. Lymphoid tissues can be the secondary replication site for EV-D68, from where the virus is released in the bloodstream. Prevention of virus spread to and amplification in lymphoid tissues can therefore prevent the development of a subsequent viremia and severe extra-respiratory complications caused by EV-D68.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="P20">PBMC were obtained from healthy adult donors after obtaining written informed consent.

At day 5, monocyte-derived imDCs were further differentiated into mature DCs by adding lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1ug/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific; L8274-10MG) into the medium. mDCs were defined by the increased expression of HLA-DR, CD86, PD-L1 and CD83 compared to imDCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig</xref>) and the determination of the cellular marker expression by flow cytometry is described below.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>EV-D68 infection of PBMC, BLCL and lentivirus-transduced B cells</title><p id="P27">Freshly isolated PBMCs, BLCLs or lentivirus-transduced B cells (1×10<sup>6</sup> cells) were inoculated with EV-D68 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 1 h at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

To investigate whether imDCs transfer virus particles directly to autologous BLCL or indirectly by release of infectious virus, the supernatant from imDCs that were infected with EV-D68/A for 6 hours, were transferred to autologous BLCL (BLCL+t6 DC sup). As a control, to show that infected BLCL is not due to the leftover of virus inoculum, supernatant from the last washing step in infected imDCs were transferred to the autologous BLCL (BLCL+t0 DC sup).

position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Author summary</title></caption><p>Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is an emerging respiratory virus that has caused outbreaks worldwide since 2014. EV-D68 infects primarily respiratory epithelial cells and the infection commonly results in mild respiratory diseases. However, EV-D68 infection is also associated with complications outside the respiratory tract, including a polio-like paralysis. Despite the severity of these extra-respiratory complications, it is unclear how EV-D68 is able to spread outside the respiratory tract and infect other organs, like the central nervous system (CNS). To understand this, we investigated if immune cells play a role in the extra-respiratory spread of EV-D68. We showed that EV-D68 can infect and replicate in specific immune cells, <italic>i.e.</italic> B cells and dendritic cells (DCs), and that the virus can be transferred from DCs to B cells. Our findings suggest that lymphoid tissues, which harbormany immune cells, can be a secondary replication site for EV-D68, from where virus is released in the circulation. Our data reveal the importance of immune cells in the systemic spread of EV-D68, which is essential for infection of extra-respiratory tissues. Intervention strategies that prevent EV-D68 infection of immune cells will therefore potentially prevent virus spread from the respiratory tract to other organs.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Susceptibility and permissiveness of human PBMC to EV-D68 infection.</title><p>(A) Percentage of EV-D68 VP1<sup>+</sup> leukocyte subsets 24 h after inoculation with EV-D68 strains from subclades A (n = 5 donors), B2 (n = 4 donors) and D (n = 4 donors).

The infection will result in the recruitment of immune cells, including imDCs. Subsequently, cell-free EV-D68 can spread to lymphoid tissues by spilling over into the circulatory or lymphatic system. Alternatively, it can infect imDCs, which can transfer the virus to lymphoid tissues. These lymphoid tissues can function as a secondary replication site, where EV-D68 infects mDCs and B cells. From this site, cell-free virus or virus-infected immune cells can enter the blood circulation and spread virus to other tissues. HEV: high endothelial venule.
