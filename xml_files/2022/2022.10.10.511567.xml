Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 (IRF1) plays an essential role as a transcription factor in driving the expression of immune response genes during infection. The striking difference in functional output with other IRFs, is that IRF1 also drives the expression of various cell cycle inhibiting factors, making it an important tumor suppressor. Thus, it is critical to regulate the abundance of IRF1 to achieve a “Goldilocks” zone in which there is sufficient IRF1 to prevent tumorigenesis, yet not too much which could drive excessive immune activation. Using genetic screening, we identified the E3 ligase receptor Speckle Type BTB/POZ Protein (SPOP) to mediate IRF1 proteasomal turnover. We identified four S/T-rich degrons in IRF1 required for its SPOP MATH domain-dependent turnover.

Type I interferons (IFNα/ß) can be secreted by most cells upon infection, whereas type II IFNs (IFNγ) are secreted by specific cell types such as Natural Killer (NK) cells, and T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) cells. Binding of these cytokines to their receptors initiates cell signaling driving transcription of hundreds of response genes, which collectively mediate the anti-pathogen response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Schoggins, 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs) play essential roles as transcription factors in the IFN system. Some IRFs, such as IRF3, are constitutively expressed, their activity is predominantly regulated through phosphorylation, and they are essential for induction of type I IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Tamura et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, some other IRFs, including IRF1, are transcriptionally induced during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Feng et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P5">IRF1 is a key family member for the induction of the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Forero et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kimura et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Langlais et al., 2016</xref>). The importance to precisely control IRF1 levels and its functional output is underpinned by the fact that aberrant IRF1 expression is linked to inflammatory syndromes, such as Behcet’s disease, arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Donn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Govind et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Uddin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Z. Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). The striking difference in functional output with other IRFs is that IRF1 also drives the expression of various cell cycle inhibiting factors (e.g. p21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Armstrong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Tanaka et al., 1996</xref>), making it an important tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Nozawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Xie et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, it is critical to regulate the abundance of IRF1 to achieve “Goldilocks” levels at which there is sufficient IRF1 to prevent tumorigenesis, yet not too much which could cause excessive immune activation.</p><p id="P6">In addition to its transcriptional regulation, the other main means of IRF1 regulation is at a protein level through rapid degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Nakagawa &amp; Yokosawa, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pion et al., 2009</xref>), which seems to in turn be critical to limit transcriptional output and reduce the IRF1 protein pools once IRF1 transcription is shut off during infection resolution. In line with this notion, proteasome inhibitors have been shown to block IRF1 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Attard et al., 2005</xref>). Several factors have thus far been reported to mediate poly-ubiquitination of IRF1, and direct its proteasomal degradation.</p><p id="P7">The importance of these individual regulators for IRF1 turnover is to a degree determined by their cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Remoli et al., 2020</xref>). This draws an interesting parallel to other transcription factors which can be ubiquitinated by various different E3 ligase complexes, depending on cellular context. cMYC is a prime example of such a cell-context regulated transcription factor. A Cullin E3 ligase complex using the FBXW7 substrate receptor module (SCF<sup>FBXW7</sup>) has been reported as a key factor in cMYC degradative ubiquitination in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Welcker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Yada et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, various others, including TRIM32, CHIP, and several other Cullin F-box complexes, have been shown to be important for cMYC degradation, yet in more cell-specific contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). Identification and characterization of such E3 ligases is critical for ultimately understanding how their action controls transcriptional output in various cell types, within the context of whole organisms.</p><p id="P8">As for other transcription factors, turnover mechanisms can be different for distinct cellular IRF1 protein pools, dependent on their localization and functional engagement in transcription. As such, understanding which functional IRF1 domains determine its turnover is important. IRF1 has an N-terminal DNA binding domain, followed by a nuclear localization signal (NLS), IRF1 transactivation IRF-association domain (IAD2), and a C-terminal intrinsically disordered enhancer region (IDR). This C-terminal IDR is an important determinant of IRF1 turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Nakagawa &amp; Yokosawa, 2000</xref>). On the one hand, the IDR is stabilized by the chaperones HSP70 and HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Landré et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Nakagawa &amp; Yokosawa, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Narayan et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">2015</xref>, p. 7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Narayan, Halada, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Narayan, Pion, et al., 2011</xref>), whereas it is targeted for degrative ubiquitination by the protein quality control E3 ligase CHIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Narayan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Narayan, Pion, et al., 2011</xref>). This has suggested that cells may, at least in part, turn over IRF1 co- or post-translationally using their general protein quality control pathways.</p><p id="P9">In addition, the N-terminal DNA binding domain has been reported to determine IRF1 stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Landré et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with a model in which IRF1 is ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase MDM2 in an unbound state, DNA binding competes with E3 ligase interaction, thereby stabilizing IRF1 in a functionally engaged state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Landré et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Lastly, the IAD2 domain has been implicated in driving IRF1 ubiquitination and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Garvin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pion et al., 2009</xref>). In part, this has been attributed to generation of a GSK3β-dependent phospho-degron on DNA-bound IRF1, and subsequent recognition by the SCF<sup>FBXW7</sup> E3 ligase complex driving its degradation.</p><p id="P11">In this study, we set out to identify novel factors that control IRF1 abundance in an unbiased manner. Genome-wide genetic screens were performed to identify novel IRF1-specific E3 ligases. This identified the Cullin ubiquitin E3 ligase receptor SPOP to functionally mediate IRF1 degradation. Follow-up analyses identified four degrons in, or near the IRF1 IAD2 enhancer domain responsible for SPOP binding, and subsequent IRF1 ubiquitination and degradation. Consequently, loss of <italic>SPOP</italic> increased transcriptional output of IRF1-stimulated genes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Establishment of an IRF1 protein abundance reporter cell line for genetic screening</title><p id="P12">The IRF1 protein is ubiquitinated and turned over by the proteasome. However, the cellular E3 ligases contributing to targeting IRF1 for degradation have remained poorly understood. The overarching goal of this study was to identify and characterize novel regulators of IRF1 protein abundance. For the identification of IRF1 stability regulators, we characterized IRF1 degradation properties in the human RKO colon carcinoma cell line, as it is highly amenable for genetic screening.</p><p id="P13">IRF1 is transcriptionally induced upon type I or type II IFN stimulation in a wide variety of cells. Likewise, stimulation of RKO cells with IFNγ strongly induced endogenous IRF1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>; 11.2-fold). Subsequent treatment with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) rapidly chased out the induced IRF1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In the absence of <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis, IRF1 levels returned to pre-stimulation protein levels within 4 h, indicating that it is highly unstable. In line with this finding, endogenous IRF1 protein levels measured by intracellular staining were also induced by IFNγ and depleted upon translation inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>; left panel), whereas inhibition of proteasomal degradation by MG132 increased IRF1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>; right panel). Together, these results indicate that IRF1 is induced by IFNγ and degraded by the proteasome in RKO cells, as has been described for other cell types, making it a suitable model for identification of IRF1 stability regulators.</p><p id="P14">Endogenous IRF1 protein levels are influenced by transcriptional and post-translational effects. Therefore, a strategy was devised to uncouple IRF1 protein abundance from its endogenous transcriptional program, thereby aiming to maximize the identification of regulators of protein degradation. To this end, a monoclonal cell line harboring Dox-inducible Cas9 was established, and a dual-color reporter construct under the control of a constitutively active promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), consisting of an mCherry-IRF1 cassette separated from BFP by a P2A ribosomal skip site. Although both proteins are translated from a single transcript in equimolar quantities, the unstable mCherry-IRF1 was predicted to accumulate at lower steady-state levels than the stable BFP functioning as an internal control.</p><p id="P15">We reasoned that it would be important to screen in parallel with an unrelated protein that is degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner, in order to distinguish between general players in the ubiquitin proteasome system and factors specifically regulating IRF1 abundance. cMYC is constantly turned over by the proteasome with a 20-30 min. half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gregory &amp; Hann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Ramsay et al., 1986</xref>). Therefore, a comparable cell line expressing mCherry-cMYC was established and characterized alongside the mCherry-IRF1 cell line.</p><p id="P16">To investigate whether the mCherry-tagged IRF1 reporter had comparable degradation characteristics as its endogenous counterpart, cells were subjected to a CHX chase to determine protein stability. In line with endogenous IRF1, mCherry-IRF1 levels rapidly diminished within four hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). IRF1 degradation was prevented by simultaneous inhibition of the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), whereas inhibition of autophagy with Bafilomycin A (Baf) did neither stabilize endogenous IRF1, nor mCherry-IRF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Similarly, mCherry-cMYC and endogenous cMYC were rapidly lost upon CHX treatment, which was prevented by simultaneous proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). This indicated that mCherry-IRF1, mCherry-cMYC, and their endogenous equivalents are all predominantly degraded by the proteasome.</p><p id="P17">Next, we set out to determine whether our fluorescent reporters were compatible with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based genetic screening. In particular, we assessed by flow cytometry whether inhibition of protein synthesis or proteasomal degradation would specifically affect the mCherry-tagged unstable proteins, without affecting their stable BFP internal controls. Consistent with our findings by Western blot readout, flow cytometry analysis also showed that both mCherry-IRF1 and mCherry-cMYC were degraded in the absence of <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>; top panels), and stabilized by proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>; bottom panels), without affecting levels of the stable BFP internal control.</p><p id="P18">To determine IRF1 and cMYC half-lives, we quantified mCherry-IRF1 and IFNγ-induced endogenous IRF1 levels over time following inhibition of protein synthesis. Single exponential decay curve fitting indicated the half-life of endogenous IRF1 to be 72 min., whereas the half-life of mCherry-IRF1 was twice as long at 144 min. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Importantly, IFNγ treatment did not alter constitutively expressed mCherry-IRF1 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>), indicating that its degradation machinery is likely already active under non-stimulated conditions. Similar measurements for mCherry-cMYC indicated a 24 min. half-life for mCherry-cMYC and 21 min. for endogenous cMYC in the same cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>), consistent with previously published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Welcker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Yada et al., 2004</xref>). These combined data indicate that the N-terminal mCherry fusions of IRF1 and cMYC phenocopied the proteasomal degradation and instability of their endogenous counterparts.</p><p id="P19">Lastly, we assessed whether our selected monoclonal mCherry-IRF1 and mCherry-cMYC reporter cell lines had retained the ability to drive genome editing. To this end, cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector constitutively expressing an sgRNA targeting the cell-essential factor Ribonucleotide Reductase Catalytic M1 (<italic>RRM1</italic>), while co-expressing iRFP. Subsequently, the ratio between these transduced cells and non-transduced cells in the same cell pool were measured over time by flow cytometry as a proxy for cell fitness.</p><p id="P20">As anticipated, the presence of Dox in the culture medium to induce Cas9 resulted in a near-complete loss of iRFP<sup>+</sup> <italic>sgRRM1</italic> cells from the cell pool in six days in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E/F</xref>), whereas parallel <italic>sgAAVS1</italic> control samples remained at a constant ratio. In contrast, in the absence of Dox, sg<italic>RRM1</italic> cells were not depleted over the two-week course of the experiment. This indicated that the mCherry-IRF1 and mCherry-cMYC cell lines had minimal editing in the absence of Dox, yet efficient genome editing upon Dox-induced Cas9 expression.</p><p id="P21">Taken together, our data demonstrate that mCherry-IRF1 and mCherry-cMYC phenocopy the unstable nature of their endogenous counterparts and are likewise predominantly degraded by the proteasome. We concluded that the established reporter cell lines were suitable for subsequent genetic screening to identify IRF1 and cMYC stability regulators and that the established cell lines could be used for parallel screens to determine specificity of identified factors.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Identification of the Cullin substrate receptor SPOP as a regulator of IRF1 abundance</title><p id="P22">The characterized mCherry-IRF1 and mCherry-cMYC reporter cell lines were subsequently used for genome-wide genetic screening for regulators of their protein abundance. To this end, a genome-wide lentiviral sgRNA library was integrated in the cell lines at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) ensuring the targeting of one gene per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. 1</xref>), followed by selection for G418-resistance to enrich for sgRNA-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. 2</xref>). At three and six days after Cas9 induction with Dox, the top 1-3% of cells with the highest and lowest mCherry levels were collected by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. 3 and 4</xref>), to enrich for cells with decreased or increased levels of the unstable mCherry-IRF1 or mCherry-cMYC. In parallel, the top 1-3% of cells with the highest and lowest levels of the stable BFP control were collected to identify non-specific effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. 3 and 4</xref>).</p><p id="P23">The two harvesting time points were previously empirically determined to be optimal for capturing essential genes (day 3), and genes that encode proteins whose levels require longer times to deplete (day 6) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E-F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">de Almeida et al., 2021</xref>). Integrated sgRNA coding sequences from the selected cell pools were quantified by next generation sequencing and compared to relative frequencies determined in unsorted cells representing the initial library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. 5</xref>). The robustness and uniformity of the screens in both cell lines is underpinned by the fact that all sgRNA coding sequences in unsorted samples were covered by 100-1000 reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P24">As anticipated, the mCherry-cMYC screen strongly identified its well-known degrader FBXW7 in mCherry-cMYC<sup>high</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-D</xref>). Moreover, it identified other UPS components reported to mediate cMYC degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-D</xref>), such as proteasome components (PSMC5, PSMD4, PSMD11), the proteasome regulator AKIRIN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">de Almeida et al., 2021</xref>), and the UPS-related ATPase VCP/p97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Heidelberger et al., 2018</xref>). These factors were not enriched in the BFP<sup>high</sup> stable control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C-D</xref>), attesting to the specificity and identification power of the experimental system.</p><p id="P25">The mCherry-IRF1 screen identified 27 high confidence factors which specifically affected mCherry-IRF1 abundance, but neither mCherry-cMYC, nor the stable BFP controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. 2C-E</xref>). The strongest candidate enriched at both three and six days after Cas9 induction was the Cullin E3 ligase receptor Speckle Type BTB/POZ Protein (SPOP), which did not score in the mCherry-cMYC screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E-F</xref>). In addition, seven nuclear transport-related factors (NUP35, NUP85, NUP93, NUP155, NUP160, TMEM48, NUTF2) were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F</xref>), suggesting that nuclear translocation of IRF1 or one of its degraders may be important for its degradation. Consistent with this notion, SPOP has been previously reported to localize to the nucleus and degrade nuclear substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Marzahn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Usher et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, a chromatin reader component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex (YEATS4) and two factors with limited functional annotation (GPATCH1, C14ORF102) were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Previously described regulators of IRF1 proteasomal turnover such as FBXW7, MDM2, or STUB1/CHIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Garvin et al., 2019</xref>, p. 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Landré et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Narayan, Pion, et al., 2011</xref>) did not score as significant IRF1 regulators in our screen, indicating that they are unlikely to play a significant role in IRF1 degradation in this cellular context.

Our data presented here adds IRF1 to this growing list of SPOP substrates. Since IRF1 levels are low in many cells in the absence of cytokine stimulation, for that reason it may have previously been missed as a SPOP interactor and substrate in unbiased proteomics efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Dai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Janouskova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">P.

Thus, while the contributions of SPOP to cancer establishment or progression are likely through deregulation of a manifold of its substrates, our work suggests that IRF1 may be one of them. In line with our finding that SPOP could be critical for lowering the tumor-suppressive levels of IRF1, SPOP is overexpressed in most clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Patel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>).

This opposite SPOP phenotype and function from what we describe here could be explained by the fact that many non-immune cells do not express TLRs and their associated adapter proteins, which were shown to be required for SPOP complex formation and repression of IRF1 phosphorylation and degradation.</p><p id="P45">Importantly, IRF1 degradation in myeloid cells is seemingly dependent on active TLR-dependent immune signaling, whereas in the stromal, non-myeloid cell models used in this study, IRF1 degradation was independent of immune signaling.

Together, these possible contrary effects of SPOP on IRF1 abundance in different cell types should thus be considered when addressing the impact of SPOP in the context of future whole-organism studies.</p><p id="P46">Previous work has indicated that SPOP recognizes nucleoplasmic targets with intrinsically disordered regions through multivalent interactions with S/T-rich degrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Usher et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, its related paralog SPOP-like (SPOPL) has been proposed to regulate the oligomeric state of the SPOP E3 ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Errington et al., 2012</xref>). While our genetic screens indicate that SPOPL does likely not play an important role in IRF1 targeting, our data from this study are fully consistent with the reported substrate profile: IRF1 has IDRs and localizes almost exclusively to the nucleoplasm. Moreover, IRF1 is likely targeted by SPOP through recognition of multiple S/T-rich degrons, although we have not determined the contribution of the four individual S/T-rich degrons to IRF1 degradation.</p><p id="P47">The S/T residues in these SPOP binding domains are theoretical sites of phosphorylation, which as such could influence SPOP-IRF1 interaction. Indeed, previous work has indicated that SPOP preferentially binds some substrate S/T-rich degrons in their non-phosphorylated form, whereas in other substrates, phosphorylation of these sites seems a prerequisite for interaction and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Ostertag et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zhuang et al., 2009</xref>). Whether any of the identified IRF1 degrons are phosphorylated, and how this would affect its SPOP-dependent degradation, remains to be determined. IRF1 phosphorylation on S219 and S221 in the fourth degron was identified with low coverage in available IRF1 proteomics data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Garvin et al., 2019</xref>) and independently in a region that includes this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lin &amp; Hiscott, 1999</xref>), suggesting that this particular identified SPOP binding domain could be post-translationally modified. The same sites were identified to be phosphorylated in breast cancer cells by the immune-activating kinase IKKε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Remoli et al., 2020</xref>). Phosphorylation under these conditions increased IRF1 proteasomal degradation. Since IKKε is activated under physiological conditions during infection, this could suggest that in some cellular contexts, ongoing immune signaling could thus provide a regulatory circuit driving transcription of <italic>IRF1,</italic> as well as providing its subsequent signal for degradation of the encoded IRF1 protein by SPOP.</p><p id="P48">Three of the identified S/T-rich degrons in IRF1 are located in its IAD2 transactivation domain.

Therefore, an additional regulatory implication of our findings could be that IRF1 heterodimerization through its IAD2 domain could shield three of the S/T-rich degrons from recognition by SPOP. As such, SPOP could thus preferentially target the inactive nucleoplasmic IRF1 pool that is not engaged in transcription.</p><p id="P49">Taken together, our study identified and characterized SPOP as a cellular factor targeting IRF1 for proteasomal degradation.
