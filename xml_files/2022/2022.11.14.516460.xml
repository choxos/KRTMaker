We showcase the value of these models with a head-to-head comparison between the features output by normative modeling and raw data features in several benchmarking tasks: mass univariate group difference testing (schizophrenia versus control), classification (schizophrenia versus control), and regression (predicting general cognitive ability). Across all benchmarks, we confirm the advantage (i.e., stronger effect sizes, more accurate classification and prediction) of using normative modeling features. We intend for these accessible resources to facilitate wider adoption of normative modeling across the neuroimaging community.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Normative modeling is a framework for mapping population-level trajectories of the relationships between health-related variables while simultaneously preserving individual-level information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Marquand et al.

Health-related variables is an intentionally inclusive and broad definition that may involve demographics (i.e., age and gender), simple (i.e., height and weight) or complex (i.e., brain structure and function, genetics) biological measures, environmental factors (i.e., urbanicity, pollution), self-report measures (i.e., social satisfaction, emotional experiences), or behavioral tests (i.e., cognitive ability, spatial reasoning). Charting the relationships, as mappings between a covariate (e.g. age) and response variable (e.g. brain measure) in a reference population creates a coordinate system that defines the units in which humans vary. Placing individuals into this coordinate system creates the opportunity to characterize their profiles of deviation. While this is an important aspect of normative modeling, it is often just the first step first, i.e. you are often interested in using the outputs of normative models in downstream analyses to detect case-control differences, stratification or individual statistics. This framework provides a platform for such analyses as it effectively translates diverse data to a consistent scale, defined with respect to population norms.</p><p id="P3">Normative modeling has seen widespread use spanning diverse disciplines.

Second, we comprehensively evaluate the utility of normative models for a range of downstream analyses, including 1) mass univariate group difference testing (schizophrenia versus controls), 2) multivariate prediction – classification (using support vector machines to distinguish schizophrenia from controls), and 3) multivariate prediction – regression (using principal component regression (PCR) to predict general cognitive ability). Within these benchmarking tasks, we show the benefit of using normative modeling features compared to using raw features. We aim for these benchmarking results, along with our publicly available resources (code, documentation, tutorials, protocols, community forum, and website for running models without using any code).

Also, prior studies using HCP data have shown promising results for predicting general cognitive ability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Sripada et al. (2020</xref>). The HCP data was used in the prediction – regression benchmarking task. The COBRE and UMich data sets are used in the classification and group difference testing benchmarking tasks. Inclusion criteria across all the datasets was that the participant has necessary behavioral and demographic variables, as well as high-quality MRI data. High-quality was defined for structural images as in our prior work <bold><italic>Rutherford et al.</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>2022a</italic></bold>), namely as the lack of any artifacts such as ghosting or ringing, that Freesurfer surface reconstruction was able to run successfully, and that the Euler number calculated from Freesurfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Klapwijk et al.

(2021</xref>). For the structural data, we used a publicly shared repository of pre-trained normative models that was estimated on approximately 58,000 subjects using a warped Bayesian Linear Regression algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Fraza et al. (2021</xref>). Model fit was established using explained variance, mean standardized log loss, skew, and kurtosis. The outputs of normative modeling also include a Z-score, or deviation score, for all brain regions and all subjects. The deviation score represents where the individual is in comparison to the population the model was estimated on, where a positive deviation score corresponds to greater cortical thickness or subcortical volume than average, and a negative deviation score represents less cortical thickness or subcortical volume than average. The deviation (Z) scores that are output from the normative model are the features input for the normative modeling data in the benchmarking analyses. In addition to normative models of brain structure, we also expanded our repository by estimating normative models of brain functional connectivity (resting-state brain networks, Yeo-17 and Smith-10) using the same algorithm (Bayesian Linear Regression) as the structural models. Models were trained on a large multi-site data set (approx. N=22,000) and evaluated in several test sets using explained variance, mean standardized log loss, skew, and kurtosis. We transferred the functional normative models to the data sets used in this work for benchmarking (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) to generate deviation (Z) scores. HCP was included in the initial training (half of the sample was held out in the test set), while the UMich and COBRE datasets were not included in the training and can be considered as examples of transfer to new, unseen sites.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Raw Input Data</title><p id="P13">The data that we compare the output of normative modeling to, referred to throughout this work as “raw” input data, is simply the outputs of traditional preprocessing methods for structural and functional MRI. For structural MRI, this corresponds to the cortical thickness files that are output after running the Freesurfer recon-all pipeline. We used the aparcstats2table and asegstats2table functions to extract the cortical thickness and subcortical volume from each region in the Destrieux atlas and Freesurfer subcortical atlas. For functional MRI, raw data refers to the Yeo17 brain network connectomes which were extracted from the normalized, smoothed, de-noised functional time-series. The upper triangle of each subject’s connectivity matrix was vectorized, where each cell represents a unique between-network connection. For clarification, we also note that the raw input data is the starting point of the normative modeling analysis, or in other words the raw input data is the response variable or independent (<bold><italic>Y</italic></bold>) variable that is predicted from the vector of covariates when estimating the normative model. Before entering into the benchmarking tasks, to create a fair comparison between raw data and deviation scores, nuisance variables including sex, site, linear and quadratic effects of age and head motion (only for functional models) were regressed out of the raw data (structural and functional) using least squares regression.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Benchmarking</title><p id="P14">The benchmarking was performed in three separate tasks, mass univariate group difference testing, multivariate prediction – classification, and multivariate prediction – regression, described in further detail below. In each benchmarking task, a model was estimated using the deviation scores as input features and then estimated again using the raw data as the input features. After each model was fit, the performance metrics were evaluated and the difference in performance between the deviation score and raw data models was calculated, again described in more detail in the evaluation section below. An overview of the analysis workflow is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><sec id="S9"><title>Task 1 Mass Univariate Group Difference Testing</title><p id="P15">Mass univariate group difference (schizophrenia vs. control) testing was performed across all brain regions.

Individual deviation maps were summarized by counting the number of individuals with ‘extreme’ deviations (<italic>Z</italic> &gt; 2 or <italic>Z</italic> &lt; −2) at a given brain region or network connectivity pair. This was done separately for positive and negative deviations and for each group and visualized qualitatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). To quantify the individual difference maps in comparison to group differences, we performed a Mann-Whitney U-test on the count of extreme deviations in each group.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Task 2 Multivariate Prediction – Classification</title><p id="P17">Support vector machine is a commonly used algorithm in machine learning studies and performs well in classification settings. A support vector machine constructs a set of hyper-planes in a high dimensional space and optimizes to find the hyper-plane that has the largest distance, or margin, to the nearest training data points of any class. A larger margin represents better linear separation between classes and will correspond to a lower the error of the classifier in new samples. Samples that lie on the margin boundaries are also called “support vectors”. The decision function provides per-class scores than can be turned into probabilities estimates of class membership. We used Support vector classification (SVC) with a linear kernel as implemented in the scikit-learn package (version 1.0.9) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Pedregosa et al.

We updated our publicly available repository of pre-trained normative models to include a new MRI imaging modality (models of resting-state functional connectivity extracted from the Yeo-17 and Smith-10 brain network atlases) and demonstrate how to transfer these models to new data sources. The repository includes an example transfer data set combined with a user-friendly interface. Next, we compared the features that are output from normative modeling (deviation scores) against ‘raw’ data features across several benchmarking tasks including univariate group difference testing (schizophrenia versus control), multivariate prediction – classification (schizophrenia versus control), and multivariate prediction – regression (predicting general cognitive ability). We found across all benchmarking tasks there were minor (regression) to strong (group difference testing) benefits of using deviation scores compared to the raw data features.</p><p id="P27">The fact that the deviation score models perform better than the raw data models confirm the utility of placing individuals into reference models. Our results show that normative modeling can capture population trends, uncover clinical group differences, and preserve the ability to study individual differences. We have some intuition on why the deviation score models perform better on the benchmarking tasks than the raw data. With normative modeling we are accounting for many sources of variance that are not necessarily clinically meaningful (i.e., site) and we are able to capture clinically meaningful information within the reference cohort perspective. The reference model helps beyond just removing confounding variables such as scanner noise, because we show that even when removing the nuisance covariates (age, sex, site, head motion) from the raw data, the normative modeling features still perform better.</p><p id="P28">Prior works on the methodological innovation and application of normative modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kia et al.

However, the framework does not end after the model has been fit to the data (estimation step) and performance metrics have been established (evaluation step). Transferring the models to new samples, interpretation of the results, and potential downstream analysis are equally important steps, but they have received less attention. When it comes time to interpret the model outputs, it is easy to fall back into the case-control thinking paradigm, even after fitting a normative model to one’s data (which is supposed to be an alternative to case versus control approaches). This is due in part to the challenges arising from the results existing in a very high dimensional space (100s to 1000s of brain regions from 100s to 1000s of subjects). There is a reasonable need to distill and summarize these high dimensional results. However, it is important to remember there is always a trade-off between having a complex enough of a model to explain the data and dimensionality reduction for the sake of interpretation simplicity. This distillation process often leads back to placing individuals into groups (i.e., case-control thinking) and interpreting group patterns or looking for group effects, rather than interpreting results at the level of the individual. We acknowledge the value and complementary nature of understanding individual variation relative to group means (case-control thinking) and clarify that we do not claim superiority of normative modeling over case-control methods. Rather, our results, especially in the comparisons of group difference maps to individual difference maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), from this work show that the outputs of normative modeling can be used to validate, refine, and further understand some of the inconsistencies in previous findings from case-control literature.</p><p id="P29">There are several limitations of the present work. First, the representation of functional normative models may be surprising and concerning. Typically, resting-state connectivity matrices are calculated using parcellations containing between 100 to 1,000 nodes and 5,000-500,000 connections. However, the Yeo-17 atlas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">Yeo et al. (2011</xref>) was specifically chosen because of its widespread use and the fact that many other (higher resolution) functional brain parcellations have been mapped to the Yeo brain networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Eickhoff et al.

There is on-going debate about the best representation of functional brain activity. Using the Yeo-17 brain networks to model functional connectivity ignores important considerations regarding brain dynamics, flexible node configurations, overlapping functional modes, hard versus soft parcellations, and many other important issues. We have also shared functional normative models using the Smith-10 ICA-based parcellation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Smith et al. (2009</xref>), though we did not repeat the benchmarking tasks using these data. Apart from our choice of parcellation, there are fundamental open questions regarding the nature of the brain’s functional architecture, including how it is defined and measured. While it is outside the scope of this work to engage in these debates, we acknowledge their importance and refers curious readers to a thorough review on functional connectivity challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bijsterbosch et al.

The included sample for training the functional normative models in this work, and the structural normative modeling sample in <bold><italic>Rutherford et al.</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>2022a</italic></bold>) are most likely overrepresentative of European-ancestry (WEIRD population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Henrich et al.

Our models do not include race or ethnicity as covariates due to data availability (many sites did not provide race or ethnicity information). Prior research supports the use of age-specific templates and ethnicity specific growth charts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dong et al. (2020</xref>).

Critically, we do not use normative in a moral or ethical sense, and we are not suggesting that individuals with high deviation scores require action or intervention to be pulled towards the population average. Although in some cases this may be true, we in no way assume that high deviations are problematic or unhealthy (they may in fact represent compensatory changes that are adaptive). In any case, we treat large deviations from statistical normality strictly as markers predictive of clinical states or conditions of interest.</p><p id="P31">There are of many open research questions regarding normative modeling. Future research directions are likely to include: 1) further expansion of open-source pre-trained normative modeling repositories to include additional MRI imaging modalities such as task-based functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging, other neuroimaging modalities such as EEG or MEG, and models that include other non-biological measures, 2) increase in the resolution of existing models (i.e., voxel, vertex, models of brain structure and higher resolution functional parcellations), 3) replication and refinement of the proposed benchmarking tasks in other datasets including improving the regression benchmarking task, and 4) including additional benchmarking tasks beyond the ones considered here.</p><p id="P32">There has been recent interesting work on “failure analysis” of brain-behavior models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Greene et al.

Deviation scores (Z-scores) are calculated for the <italic>n<sub>th</sub></italic> subject, and <italic>d<sub>th</sub></italic> brain area, in the test set as: <disp-formula id="FD5"><label>(5)</label><mml:math id="M5"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P39">Where <inline-formula><mml:math id="M6"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the true response, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M7"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the predicted mean, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M8"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the estimated noise variance (reflecting uncertainty in the data), and <inline-formula><mml:math id="M9"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the variance attributed to modeling uncertainty.
