unrelated families presenting with epileptic encephalopathy associated with a broad neurological involvement characterized by microcephaly, intellectual disability, seizures, and global developmental delay. <italic>SLITRK3</italic> encodes for a transmembrane protein that is involved in controlling neurite outgrowth and inhibitory synapse development and that has an important role in brain function and neurological diseases. Using primary cultures of hippocampal neurons carrying patients’ SLITRK3 variants and in combination with electrophysiology, we demonstrate that recessive variants are loss-of-function alleles. By analyzing the development and phenotype of SLITRK3 KO (<italic>SLITRK3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice, we bring additional evidence of enhanced susceptibility to pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure with the appearance of spontaneous epileptiform EEG, as well as developmental deficits such as higher motor activities and reduced parvalbumin interneurons. Taken together, our results exhibit impaired development of peripheral and central nervous system and support a conserved role of this transmembrane protein in neurological function. Our study delineates an emerging spectrum of human core synaptopathies caused by variants in genes that encode SLITRK proteins and essential regulatory components of the synaptic machinery. The hallmark of these disorders is impaired postsynaptic neurotransmission at nerve terminals; an impaired neurotransmission resulting in a wide array of (often overlapping) clinical features, including neurodevelopmental impairment, weakness, seizures, and abnormal movements. The genetic synaptopathy caused by SLITRK3 mutations highlights the key roles of this gene in human brain development and function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Slitrk3</kwd><kwd>GABAergic synapse development</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>global developmental delay</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Synapse development is a multi-step process coordinated by various molecules acting in a highly spatially and temporally controlled manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are an example of such molecules essential for the establishment and maturation of synaptic connections. Recent studies have identified a growing number of synaptic CAMs such as slit and NTRK-like family proteins (Slitrks) that are single-passing transmembrane proteins and bind to presynaptic protein tyrosine phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Members of the Slitrk family contain twelve N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and C-terminal regions that share homology with neurotrophin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). They are expressed predominantly in neural tissues of the central nervous system and have neurite-modulating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Even though such molecules are involved in various stages of synapse development, their function diversity still remains largely unclear.</p><p id="P3">Recent studies in humans and genetic mouse models have led to the identification of Slitrk family member genes as candidate genes that may be involved in the development of neuropsychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome, or trichotillomania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Additionally, Slitrk3 abnormality has also been strongly associated with multiple cancers, such as human epithelial ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) and squamous cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P4">SLITRK3 (Slit and Trk-like family member 3), is a synaptic cell adhesion molecule highly expressed at inhibitory synapses and enhances inhibitory synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Recent studies have provided additional evidence to our understanding of the mechanisms of GABAergic synapse formation by revealing a direct extracellular protein-protein interaction between SLITRK3 and another inhibitory postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecule, Neuroligin 2 (NL2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) and a critical role of the SLITRK3-gephyrin interaction in stabilization of pre- and post-synaptic compartments during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Collectively, these studies have shown that SLITRK3, through its extracellular domain, selectively regulates inhibitory synapse development via the trans-synaptic interaction with presynaptic cell adhesion molecule, receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase δ (PTPδ), the <italic>cis</italic> interaction with postsynaptic NL2, and the intracellular interaction with gephyrin. In this way, they exert differential, sometimes cooperative effects on GABAergic synapse formation depending on the developmental stage of the system. Furthermore, other recent studies have shown a critical role of a conserved tyrosine residue, Y969, in SLITRK3 carboxyl-terminus in GABAergic synapse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), indicating SLITRK3 may mediate signaling through both extracellular and intracellular domains.</p><p id="P5">In the brain, many types of interneurons make functionally diverse inhibitory synapses onto principal neurons. In the mammalian brain GABAergic synapses provide an important level of inhibitory balance to glutamatergic excitatory drive, therefore, controlling neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. As GABAergic inhibition is important in almost every aspect of brain physiology, and the dysregulation of GABAergic synapse development has been implicated in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), it is critical to understand the molecular determinants of GABAergic synapse formation. Prevention and treatment of brain disorders will also depend partly on restoration of GABAergic function and/or inhibitory/excitatory balance.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we report on biallelic and monoallelic variants in <italic>SLITRK3</italic> in 3 families presenting with epileptic encephalopathy associated with neurodevelopmental findings that include seizures, motor delay, microcephaly, hyperactivity, and MRI brain abnormalities. Using primary cultures of hippocampal neurons carrying patients’ SLITRK3 variants and in combination with electrophysiology, we characterized the functional effects of these variants on inhibitory synapses. Furthermore, by analyzing the development and phenotype of SLITRK3 KO <italic>(SLITRK3<sup>-/-</sup>)</italic> mice, we looked at survival, seizure susceptibility, and any developmental deficits to correlate to the patients’ phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P7">After local institutional review board approval of this study and informed consent from the families, we collected blood samples from the three patients and their parents and extracted DNA using standard procedures.

The candidate variants were confirmed after filtering and interpretation according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) and segregation analyses were carried out using Sanger sequencing. Homozygosity mapping was performed on the genetic data from the 3 affected individuals and unrelated healthy controls age-and ethnically matched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Genomic DNA from the submitted specimens analysed at GeneDx was enriched for the complete coding regions and splice site junctions for most genes of the human genome using a proprietary capture system developed by GeneDx for NGS with CNV calling (NGS-CNV).

Animals were anesthetized with 3% and 1.5% isoflurane in air (2 L/min flow rate) for induction and maintenance, respectively. MRI images were obtained by using the FISP-3D protocol of Paravision software 5.0, by setting the following parameter values: Effective TE, 4.0 ms; TR, 8.0 ms; Flip angle, 15 degree; Average number, 5; Acquisition Matrix, 256 × 256 × 256, FOV, 25.6 × 25.6 × 25.6 mm. Regional volumetric changes were measured by tensor-based morphometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). The images were subjected to non-uniformity correction and intensity standardization, before a multi-iteration group-wise registration, including 5 iterations of affine registration and 3 iterations of non-rigid registration, was performed.

However, it is more time consuming, potentially leading in the delay in the inclusion of recently published data. Since, SLITRK3 has limited literature, we decided to manually curate its literature and include additional PPIs in our network. This resulted in the identification of 4 additional interactions, of which only 1 was between two human proteins (i.e., NTRK3), while the rest were mouse proteins (i.e., Ptprd, Nlgn2, and Erbb4).

The gene is intolerant to loss of function mutations in humans, with a pLi score of 0.94. Indeed, the mIPSC frequency and amplitude in hippocampal neurons expressing SLITRK3-E606X mutant had no changes compared with the control cells expressing WT SLITRK3 that increased inhibitory transmission. Consistently, expression of SLITRK3-E606X did not change dendritic densities of vGAT and gephyrin, while overexpression of WT SLITRK3 significantly increased GABAergic synapse development. These data indicate that E606X mutation abolishes the function of SLITRK3 in promoting GABAergic synapse development. We thus conclude that the phenotype in the index probands with the SLITRK3-E606X variant could be due to a loss of function of WT-SLITRK3. This could be explained by the fact that E606X is a truncation mutant lacking the important transmembrane domain and C-terminus.</p><p id="P43">Interestingly, expression of SLITRK3-C566R mutant also did not change mIPSCs and GABAergic density in hippocampal neurons, suggesting that the N-terminal residue, C566, is essential for SLITRK3 function in the regulation of GABAergic synapse development and that mutation of Cytosine 566 to Arginine completely inactivates SLITRK3-dependent promotion of GABAergic synapse development. In line with SLITRK3 being tolerant to missense mutations in humans, with a Z score of 0.59, we speculate that probably heterozygous de-novo non-synonymous variants likely affect the somewhere important?.Currently, the mechanisms underlying the role of C566 in regulating inhibitory synapses remain unclear. As SLITRK3 N-terminus is critical for trans-synaptic interaction with presynaptic PTPδ and cis interaction with postsynaptic NL2, it is possible that C566 might be important for SLITRK3 N-terminus mediated protein interactions crucial for its synaptogenic function.</p><p id="P44">Additionally, the overexpression studies showed no changes in dendritic densities of vGAT and gephyrin, suggesting these both variants SLITRK3-C566R and SLITRK3-E606X are essential to the function of SLITRK3 in the regulation of GABAergic synaptic densities. Together, we found the increased vGAT and gephyrin in neurons overexpressing SLITRK3-WT-Myc but no change of those in neurons overexpressing SLITRK3-C566R-Myc or SLITRK3-E606X-Myc, consistent with the change of mIPSC frequency in those transfected GFP-positive cultured hippocampal neurons.</p><p id="P45">In terms of seizure-associated phenotypes of SLITRK3 KO, we previously reported that enhanced susceptibility to pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure and the appearance of spontaneous epileptiform EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). These results together with the developmental deficits shown in the current study strongly support the <italic>SLITRK3</italic> loss-of-function mutations as genetic causes of epileptic encephalopathy. In addition, the cognitive dysfunction in SLITRK3 KO mice might be associated with sensory or motor signs or intellectual disability presented in the patient with <italic>SLITRK3</italic> loss-of-function mutation.</p><p id="P46">PV interneurons in the hippocampus are mostly basket cells with fast-spiking actions at a high energy cost, and are highly vulnerable to stressors and have been implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Impaired development or function of Parvalbumin-positive interneurons are associated with epilepsy in various animal models of epilepsy, as well as some genetic form of epilepsy in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). In mice, selective silencing of hippocampal PV interneurons induces recurrent spontaneous limbic seizure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Therefore, reduced PV interneurons in SLITRK3 KO mice raise the possibility that deterioration of parvalbumin interneurons in the neurological signs of the patients with SLITRK3 loss-of-function mutations.</p><p id="P47">The clinical phenotype associated with the homozygous variant c.1816G&gt;T, p.Glu606* (generalised tonic-clonic seizures, behavioural abnormalities, ADHD) correlates with absent protein levels and a shorter protein missing the cytoplasmic domain and could reflect impaired protein stability as suggested by <italic>in-silico</italic> structural modeling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig S4</xref>). However, the clinical phenotype of the heterozygous variants c.1696T&gt;C, p.Cys566Arg and c.660_684del25, p.Gly221Trp<italic>fs</italic>*15 (periventricular leukomalacia with tonic-clonic seizures, motor delay, facial and behavioural abnormalities) point more towards altered structural confirmation of the proteins. Disulfide bonds can have profound effects on the folding pathway and the stability of a protein, thus increasing its suitability for existence in the extracellular milieu. However, due to the limited tendency of alpha-helical residues to form disulfide bridges in these two variants, we suspect that only a chunk of the extracellular domain is being formed, especially in the case of c.660_684del25, p.Gly221Trp<italic>fs</italic>*15, which is predicted to be detrimental to normal protein function.</p><p id="P48">In conclusion, we have identified a neurodevelopmental disease with an early onset of symptoms that is variably associated with additional neurological features predominated by GDD/ID, ADHD, hypotonia, and epilepsy. Given that the synaptopathies are defined as brain disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) and that the individuals presented in this study have clinical features overlapping those observed in individuals with synaptopathies (cognitive disorders such as intellectual disability, motor dysfunction such as ataxia and dystonia, epilepsy and psychiatric diseases such as ASD and ADHD), we coin the phenotypes associated with SLITRK3 variants as SLITRK3-related synaptopathy. Furthermore, variability in the effects of different SLITRK3 mutants under <italic>in-vitro</italic> conditions points toward mutation-specific mechanisms underlying the postsynaptic defect of the affected children, and this variability highlights a promising area of future research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary data</label><media xlink:href="EMS158935-supplement-Supplementary_data.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d36aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The original family was collected as part of the SYNaPS Study Group collaboration funded by The Wellcome Trust and strategic award (Synaptopathies) funding (WT093205 MA and WT104033AIA).
