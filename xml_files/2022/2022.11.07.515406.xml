Cancer cells are capable of evading clearance by phagocytes such as microglia and monocyte-derived cells through engaging tolerogenic programs. Here, we found that high level of Siglec-9 expression correlates with reduced survival in GBM patients. Using conditional knockouts of Siglec-E, the murine functional homologue of Siglec-9, together with single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrated significant pro-phagocytosis effects in microglia and monocyte-derived cells in the absence of Siglec-E. Loss of Siglec-E on monocyte-derived cells enhances antigen cross-presentation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in more efficient T cell priming. This bridging of innate and adaptive responses delays tumor growth and results in prolonged survival. Further, we showed synergistic activity of Siglec-E blockade in combinatorial immunotherapies and demonstrate its translational potential against GBM.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Glioblastoma (GBM) is a fatal disease without effective long-term treatment options. The current standard of care consists of tumor resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy resulting in a median overall survival of only 14 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), has improved the outcomes of different cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], but clinical trials of systemic T cell ICI showed only disappointing results in GBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. This was attributed in part to the highly immunosuppressive immune tumor microenvironment (iTME) of GBM, which mainly consists of yolk sac-derived microglia (MG) and monocyte-derived cells (MdCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], together termed glioma-associated microglia/macrophages (GAMs). Recent work identified GBM associated MG and MdCs as effector cells of tumor cell phagocytosis in response to blockade of the ‘don’t eat me’-signal CD47 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. However, variability in the magnitude and durability of this response suggests the presence of additional, yet unknown such signals.</p><p id="P4">Upregulation of sialic acid-containing glycans on tumor cell surface and in the tumor microenvironment (hypersialylation) is a key change in malignant tissue and capable of impacting tumorigenesis by promoting cell invasion and metastatic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. By engaging immunomodulatory sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs), tumor hypersialylation can trigger tolerogenic programs in different immune cell types and contributes to the establishment of the immunosuppressive iTME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Recent work has shown that inhibitory CD33-related Siglecs, including human Siglec-7, Siglec-9 and Siglec-10, promote tumor progression in various models of pancreatic, breast and ovarian cancer by inducing a regulatory M2-like phenotype in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Similarly, increased density of sialylated glycans on cancer cells inhibits human NK cell activation and cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] and facilitates induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) through engagement of Siglec-7/-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. However, little is known on the induction of tolerogenic programs via Siglec receptors on MG and MdCs in the GBM iTME.</p><p id="P5">Here, we aimed to define the role of inhibitory Siglecs in innate-centered GBM immunotherapy.

Expression of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase (<italic>GNE),</italic> a rate-limiting enzyme in the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], was mainly expressed by GBM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>); suggesting that there could be interactions between Siglec-9 in GAMs and sialic acid in GBM cells. Flow cytometry (FC) analysis of primary human GBM- and glioma-associated mouse MG revealed high expression of Siglec-9 and Siglec-E protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 1d, e</xref>).

The Siglec-E deletion-mediated pro-phagocytic effect in MG was more prominent in CT-2A tumor bearing animals than in GL261-grafted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1m, n</xref>), probably due to the higher Siglec-E ligand expression on CT-2A than in GL261 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>).

Of note, this compensatory upregulation on MdCs was only observed for Siglec-E, whereas we did not measure expression changes in other Siglec receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Using scRNA-seq, we profiled the iTME from <italic>Siglece<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Siglece<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> x <italic>Sall1<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> CT-2A tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), identifying 23 distinct cell clusters, including seven GAM clusters, ten lymphoid clusters, one NK cell cluster, three dendritic cell (DC) and one B cell cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 2b-d</xref>). Focusing on GAM clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>), two MG clusters were identified (MG_1 and MG_2). A differential expression analysis between cells from <italic>Siglece<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Siglece<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> x <italic>Sall1<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> CT-2A tumor-bearing mice for these MG clusters revealed a partial reversal of a disease-associated MG (DAM)-phenotype upon Siglec-E deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 2e</xref>). DAMs were initially described in a genetic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], but have been reported in other models of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], where excessive activation of MG proinflammatory functions may be detrimental and accelerate the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Upon Siglec-E deletion, we observed downregulation of DAM-signature genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], including tetraspanins (<italic>Cd9),</italic> chemokines (<italic>Cxcl13),</italic> molecules involved in Trem2-signaling (<italic>Lgals3</italic>) and tissue remodeling (<italic>Spp1, Gpnmb</italic>) In contrast, genes involved in phagocytosis (<italic>Axl, Arg1</italic>) and cellular activation (<italic>Trpm2</italic>) were upregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 2e</xref>). Along the same line, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on the differentially expressed genes using the MSigDB Hallmark collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] identified TNF-α signaling via NF-κB to be upregulated in Siglec-E depleted MG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 2f</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Focusing on MdCs, we identified two phenotypically distinct monocyte-derived cell (MdC) clusters (MdC_Ly6c<sup>low</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> and MdC_Ly6c<sup>low</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>), probably representing intermediate stages of differentiation towards monocyte-derived DCs and monocyte-derived macrophages, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Among MdCs clusters, differential expression analysis attributed the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to the MdC_Ly6c<sup>low</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> cluster (57 DEGs in MdC_Ly6c<sup>low</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>; 12 DEGs in Monocytes, 10 DEGs in MdC_Ly6c<sup>low</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>, 12 DEGs in TAMs and 10 DEGs in MdC_Proliferating, at a 5% FDR; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). GSEA on the differentially expressed genes ascribed a highly immunosuppressive phenotype to these MdC_Ly6c<sup>low</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells upon MG-specific Siglec-E deletion, with downregulation of genes modulating type I and type II interferon responses and TNF-α signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>).</p><p id="P11">In addition, differential abundance analysis revealed significant increases in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters 9 and 11 (CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells_Effector/pre-exhausted and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells_Exhausted) in <italic>Siglece<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> x <italic>Sall1<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 2g</xref>). This corroborates the hypothesis that the infiltrating MdCs render the iTME pro-tumorigenic. Although we focused our analysis on immune cells, we still captured transcripts originating from CD45<sup>neg</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>), which acquired a progressive phenotype with upregulation of genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), KRAS signaling and increased TGFβ signaling after MG-specific Siglec-E deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref>), which might facilitate the immunosuppressive shift of the MdC subcluster. Together, these data identified a population of early phase MdCs as a main driver of the counteracting immunosuppressive response upon Siglec-E deletion induced MG activation.</p><p id="P12">To test our hypothesis of early phase MdCs as main counteracting force to the antitumor MG response, we combined MG-specific Siglec-E deletion with C-C chemokine ligand 2 (Ccl2) neutralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2k</xref>).

Indeed, anti-Ccl2 treatment led to less excessive infiltration of MdCs to the tumor site and converted their ‘M2-like’ polarization state upon concomitant MG-specific Siglec-E deletion. However, both phenotypes ameliorated only to control level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2l, m</xref>), indicating that recruitment of MdCs to the GBM iTME is a highly redundant mechanism which cannot be perturbed by antagonizing the action of a single tumor-attracting chemokine. Accordingly, the combination of MG-specific Siglec E deletion and anti-Ccl2 treatment did not improve survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2n</xref>). These results showcase that MG-specific Siglec-E deletion promotes tumor cell phagocytosis, which is subsequently counteracted by infiltrating MdCs that acquire an immunosuppressive phenotype in the perturbed iTME.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Siglec-E deficiency in whole GAM population improves innate anti-tumor immunity</title><p id="P13">To test the role of inhibitory Siglec receptors on all GAMs, we used <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], which harbor tamoxifen-inducible <italic>Cre</italic> activity under transcriptional control of the C-X3-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (<italic>Cx3cr1</italic>) promoter.

Additionally, MG displayed accentuated antigen presentation capacity with increased surface MHC-II and costimulatory CD86 expression upon <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>-specific Siglec-E deletion. The MdC compartment showed CD86 increase only by trend, and no difference in MHC-II expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). The proportion of intratumoral MdCs was comparable between cohorts at endpoint, indicating that recruitment of these cells to the tumor site remained intact in <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>-specific Siglec-E deleted mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 3b</xref>). In fact, MdCs were the dominant CD45<sup>+</sup> cell population at endpoint (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 3b</xref>), highlighting the potent myeloid influx during CT-2A tumor progression.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Siglec-E deficient MdCs show increased antigen cross-presentation and T cell cross-priming capacity</title><p id="P14">Within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, we observed mainly a CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell driven response upon GAM-specific Siglec-E deletion with increased activation signature (CD69<sup>+</sup>Ki-67<sup>+</sup> co-expression) and effector cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Together with the absent MHC-II response in MdCs after increased tumor cell phagocytosis, we hypothesized that loss of Siglec-E on MdCs could enhance antigen cross-presentation and cross-priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Therefore, we pulsed the CD11b<sup>+</sup> GAM fraction on day 15 post tumor-inoculation with ovalbumin protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) and evaluated the presence of MHC-I bound ovalbumin-derived peptide SIINFEKL.

As the main mechanism, we show that Siglec-E deletion leads to increased tumor cell phagocytosis by MG and MdC and elevated expression of NF-κB target genes in MdCs. This mediates cross-priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and ultimately synergizes with cancer immunotherapy to convey a substantial survival benefit in a highly aggressive and poorly immunogenic CT-2A GBM preclinical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>].</p><p id="P22">Previous preclinical studies have shown similar anti-phagocytic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>] and macrophage differentiating properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>] for Siglec receptors in cancer and other diseases. Our study expands this knowledge on the interactions of Siglec receptors with sialoglycans by dissecting the complex interplay between the two main innate immune populations in the GBM iTME. We found a counteracting MdC response upon Siglec-E deletion-driven MG activation and proliferation. Yeo and colleagues recently reported similar changes in their study investigating longitudinal changes in the immune cell composition throughout tumor progression in a genetic mouse GBM model. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] Specifically, they identified a highly proliferating population of GBM-associated MG, for which the authors discussed a decisive role in activating emergency myelopoiesis in GBM and recruiting bone marrow-derived immunosuppressive myeloid cells to the GBM iTME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. This paralleled our observation of a Siglec-E deletion induced activation and proliferation of MG cells, and the counteracting ingress of immunosuppressive MdCs which could only be reverted to control level by Ccl2 inhibition. Even though, the tumor cells were not the primary focus of our scRNA-seq analysis after MG Siglec-E disruption, we found profound changes in the CT-2A transcriptome as well, particularly concerning EMT pathways. This might unveil further tumorcell intrinsic plasticity and resistance mechanisms upon perturbance of iTME components e.g., MG, and highlights potential paracrine and intercellular reactions between neoplastic cells and MG induced by highly selective deletion of Siglec-E.</p><p id="P23">By extending the cell type specific Siglec-E deletion to the MdC compartment, we observed increased anti-tumor immunity and upregulation of NF-κB target genes.
