In response, VSMCs generate enhanced contractile forces. Our previous findings demonstrate that VSMC volume is enhanced in response to increased matrix rigidity, but our understanding of mechanisms regulating this process remain incomplete. In this current study, we show that microtubule stability in VSMCs is reduced in response to enhanced matrix rigidity via piezo1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Moreover, VSMC volume and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux was regulated by microtubule dynamics; microtubule stabilising agents reduced both VSMC volume and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux on rigid hydrogels, whereas microtubule destabilising agents increased VSMC volume and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux on pliable hydrogels. Finally, we show that disruption of the microtubule deacetylase HDAC6 uncoupled these processes and increased K40 alpha tubulin acetylation, VSMC volume and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux on pliable hydrogels, but did not alter VSMC microtubule stability. These findings uncover a microtubule stability switch that controls VSMC volume by regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. Together, these data demonstrate that manipulation of microtubule stability can modify VSMC matrix rigidity response.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>smooth muscle cell</kwd><kwd>matrix rigidity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Maintaining aortic compliance, the ability of the aorta to change shape in response to changes in blood pressure is essential for cardiovascular (CV) health. Decreased aortic compliance is a major risk factor associated with a variety of age-related CV diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Glasser et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Lacolley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>). The rigidity of the aortic wall is a major contributor to aortic compliance. In the healthy aortic wall, rigidity and compliance are determined by the balance between elastic-fibres, including elastin, that provide pliability, and non-elastic fibres, including collagen-I, that provide tensile strength, to the extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Tsamis et al., 2013</xref>). However, during ageing and CV disease, elastic-fibres degrade, and collagen-I accumulates. These ECM changes increase the rigidity of the aortic wall and decrease aortic compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Afewerki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ahmed and Warren, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are the predominant cell type within the aortic wall. VSMC contraction regulates vascular tone in healthy aortae, where aortic wall rigidity and compliance are a balance between ECM rigidity and VSMC stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>). Changes in intracellular calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) levels are integral for regulating VSMC contractile function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ahmed and Warren, 2018</xref>). As such, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> are normally tightly regulated by mechanisms that promote release and reuptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores such as the sarcoplasmic reticulum. During VSMC contraction, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is stimulated via receptor signalling or stretch activated ion channels, which include the TRPC family and piezo1, leading to the activation of sarcoplasmic IP<sub>3</sub>R and ryanodine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Sanders, 2001</xref>). This results in a rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark in VSMCs that drives actomyosin force generation. These sparks are short lived as Ca<sup>2+</sup> is rapidly reabsorbed to the sarcoplasmic reticulum via SERCA channels(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Sanders, 2001</xref>).</p><p id="P4">However, the balance between ECM rigidity and VSMC stiffness is disrupted in ageing and CV disease, resulting in VSMC dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Lacolley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Tsamis et al., 2013</xref>). Age associated changes in ECM composition increase aortic wall rigidity and triggers increased VSMC stiffness, that further decreases aortic compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Lacolley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Sehgel et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Tsamis et al., 2013</xref>). This is termed VSMC stiffness syndrome, but our understanding of the mechanisms driving this process remain poorly defined. In response to hypertension, VSMCs undergo a process known as hypertrophy and increase their cell mass without increasing cell number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Owens and Schwartz, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Rizzoni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Schiffrin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Increases in volume and protein synthesis are key components in VSMC hypertrophy, which is known to increase aortic wall thickness and rigidity and decrease aortic compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Owens and Schwartz, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Rizzoni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Schiffrin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sehgel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, we have recently shown that activation of piezo1 drives a sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, resulting in an increase in VSMC volume, via the membrane translocation of the water channel aquaporin-1, in response to matrix rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Johnson et al., 2024</xref>). Increased matrix rigidity and hypertension are known to promote VSMC dedifferentiation, where they switch from a contractile phenotype to disease associated synthetic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hayashi and Naiki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Xie et al., 2018</xref>). Both aquaporin-1 and piezo1 gene expression is enhanced during VSMC dedifferentiation in atherosclerosis, during carotid remodelling and during aortic ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Johnson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Luu et al., 2023</xref>). Whether increased volume drives increased VSMC stiffness in response to matrix rigidity and the VSMC phenotypes involved remain unknown.</p><p id="P5">Microtubules are hollow tube-like structures, made up of alpha and beta tubulin heterodimers, that play important roles in determining cell morphology and resisting deformational forces applied to cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Brangwynne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Stamenović, 2005</xref>). Microtubule organisation is regulated via a process called dynamic instability, where microtubules exist in a balance between growth and shrinkage that enables them to respond rapidly to the changing needs of a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Michaels et al., 2020</xref>). Post-translational modifications of tubulin are predicted to regulate microtubule mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Song and Brady, 2015</xref>). Most modifications are predicted to occur on the outer surface of polymerised microtubules. However, lysine 40 (K40) of alpha-tubulin in the inner lumen of polymerised microtubules, can be acetylated and deacetylated by αTAT1 and HDAC6, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Osseni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Shida et al., 2010</xref>). While the precise impact of K40 acetylation on microtubule mechanical properties remains controversial and contradictory, K40 acetylation is proposed to influence lateral associations between polymerised tubulin monomers and potentially stabilise microtubules, making them more resistant to mechanical damage than deacetylated microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Eshun-Wilson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Janke and Montagnac, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Enhanced K40 acetylation increases cytoskeletal stiffness in striated muscle, but the impact of K40 acetylation in VSMC matrix rigidity sensing remains unknown(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Coleman et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The mechanical regulation of VSMC behaviour obeys well defined rules. For example, in response to enhanced matrix rigidity, VSMCs generate increased actomyosin derived traction forces and increased deformational stresses are placed upon the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Petit et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Sanyour et al., 2019</xref>). These deformational stresses drive the opening of stretch-activated ion channels in VSMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Johnson et al., 2024</xref>). Microtubules exist in a mechanical balance with actomyosin activity, serving as pre-stressed compression bearing struts capable of resisting actomyosin generated deformational stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Brangwynne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Stamenović, 2005</xref>). This relationship is known as the tensegrity model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Stamenović, 2005</xref>). The tensegrity model predicts the interplay between actomyosin and microtubules in VSMCs. Previous studies have shown that microtubule stabilisation decreases VSMC actomyosin activity, whereas microtubule destabilisation increases VSMC actomyosin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ahmed et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>). Other models have been proposed that describe VSMC mechano-adaption responses, yet we lack an in-depth mechanistic understanding of pathways linking changes in VSMC behaviour to the proposed models of mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Steucke et al., 2017</xref>). For example, whether mechanical cues and stretch-activated ion channel activity influence microtubule stability and vice versa remains unknown.</p><p id="P7">In this current study, we show that changes in microtubule stability serve as a switch that regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and VSMC volume control. Treatment with the microtubule stabilising agent paclitaxel reduced VSMC volume on rigid hydrogels. In contrast, treatment with the microtubule destabilising agent colchicine increased VSMC volume on pliable hydrogels. Furthermore, we show that paclitaxel reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux specifically in VSMCs on rigid hydrogels, whereas colchicine treatment increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in VSMCs on pliable hydrogels. In keeping with our previous findings, our data also implicates piezo1 in this process and depletion of piezo1 increased microtubule stability specifically on rigid hydrogels. Finally, we demonstrate that disruption of HDAC6 increases acetylation of alpha tubulin and induces increased volume and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in VSMCs on pliable hydrogels. Together, these data implicate a piezo1/Ca<sup>2+/</sup>microtubule stability feedback pathway in the regulation of VSMC matrix rigidity response.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Piezo1 activity promotes microtubule destabilisation within VSMCs on rigid hydrogels</title><p id="P8">Previous studies have shown that matrix rigidity promotes increased VSMC traction stress generation. To confirm that angiotensin II stimulated VSMCs seeded on rigid hydrogels generated enhanced traction stresses, we performed traction force microscopy. As expected, analysis confirmed that angiotensin II stimulated VSMCs seeded on rigid hydrogels generated greater maximal and total traction stress, compared to their counterparts on pliable hydrogels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Our previous study found that on pliable hydrogels, VSMCs generated enhanced traction stresses as a result of colchicine-induced microtubule depolymerisation. Therefore, we predicted that VSMCs would display decreased microtubule stability on rigid hydrogels. To test this, we compared the number of cold-stable microtubules possessed by quiescent and angiotensin II stimulated VSMCs on pliable and rigid hydrogels. Analysis revealed that angiotensin II stimulation resulted in a reduction of cold-stable microtubules possessed by VSMCs on pliable and rigid hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 A and B</xref>). However, this decrease was only significantly different on rigid hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We have previously shown that piezo1 is an essential mediator of the enhanced VSMC volume response on rigid hydrogels. We next utilised a siRNA mediated knockdown approach to investigate whether piezo1 was required for this change in microtubule stability. Consistent with our previous studies, western blot analysis confirmed that piezo1 was efficiently depleted in VSMCs by piezo1 specific siRNA compared to non-targeting scrambled siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Analysis of microtubule stability revealed that piezo1 depleted, angiotensin II stimulated VSMCs possessed similar numbers of cold stable microtubules on pliable hydrogels as their scrambled control counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 D and E</xref>). In contrast, piezo1 depleted angiotensin II stimulated VSMCs on rigid hydrogels possessed increased numbers of cold-stable microtubules compared to their scrambled control counterparts (Figure D and E). We have previously shown that piezo1 activation promotes Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in VSMCs on rigid hydrogels. To confirm that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was driving microtubule destabilisation, we performed a cold-stable microtubule assay in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> had no effect on the number of cold-stable microtubules detected in angiotensin II stimulated VSMCs on pliable hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). In contrast, the number of cold-stable microtubules increased within angiotensin II stimulated VSMCs on rigid hydrogels when extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). This suggests that piezo1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx decreases microtubule stability on rigid hydrogels following angiotensin II stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Microtubule stability influences isolated smooth muscle cell volume following contractile agonist stimulation</title><p id="P10">The above data shows that on rigid substrates, VSMCs generate increased traction stresses and possess decreased microtubule stability. We have previously shown that VSMCs on rigid hydrogels swell and possess increased cell area and volume. We next hypothesised that decreased microtubule stability was driving the enhanced VSMC volume response on rigid hydrogels. To test this, we utilised our screening assay described previously. Quiescent VSMCs were seeded onto pliable and rigid hydrogels and pre-treated with increasing concentrations of microtubule stabilisers prior to angiotensin II stimulation. Treatment with either paclitaxel or epothilone B had no effect on the contractile response of VSMCs seeded on pliable hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). In contrast, increasing concentrations of either microtubule stabiliser was sufficient to prevent the increase in VSMC area observed following angiotensin II stimulation on rigid hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 A, C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Given that microtubule stabilisation prevented VSMC enlargement following angiotensin II stimulation on rigid hydrogels, we next hypothesised that microtubule destabilisation would trigger VSMC enlargement in angiotensin II stimulated VSMCs on pliable hydrogels. VSMCs were pre-treated with increasing concentrations of the microtubule destabilisers colchicine or nocodazole, and then stimulated with angiotensin II. On pliable hydrogels, VSMCs treated with either colchicine or nocodazole displayed increased cell area following angiotensin II stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E, F, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). In contrast, treatment with the microtubule destabilisers had no effect on VSMCs seeded on rigid hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E, G, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). All microtubule targeting agents were used at concentrations that did not cause cell death, as confirmed through a viability assay for concentrations of epothilone B and nocodazole (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>) or previously for paclitaxel and colchicine (Ahmed et al., 2022). We next confirmed that paclitaxel and colchicine treatments were inducing microtubule stabilisation and destabilisation respectively. Quiescent VSMCs seeded on pliable and rigid hydrogels were pretreated with microtubule targeting agents prior to angiotensin II stimulation. Analysis confirmed that paclitaxel treatment (1 nM) resulted in increased numbers of cold stable microtubules in angiotensin II stimulated VSMCs on both rigid and pliable hydrogels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Colchicine treatment (100 nM) resulted in reduced numbers of cold stable microtubules in angiotensin II stimulated VSMCs on pliable hydrogels but did not significantly alter the number of cold stable microtubules in angiotensin II treated VSMCs on rigid hydrogels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Having determined that microtubule stability regulated changes in VSMC area, we then sought to confirm its regulation of VSMC volume. Quiescent VSMCs were pre-treated with paclitaxel (1 nM) or colchicine (100 nM), prior to angiotensin II stimulation and confocal microscopy was used to assess changes in cell volume. Treatment with the microtubule stabiliser, paclitaxel had no effect on the volume of VSMCs seeded on pliable hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-D</xref>). Whereas, on rigid hydrogels, microtubule stabilisation prevented the angiotensin II induced expansion of VSMC volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-D</xref>). Finally, microtubule destabilisation, via colchicine pre-treatment, increased VSMC volume on pliable hydrogels following angiotensin II stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-F</xref>) but had no additional effect on VSMC volume on rigid hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Changes in microtubule stability alter calcium ion flux</title><p id="P12">The above data confirm that microtubule stability influences VSMC volume control. Previously, we have identified piezo1 mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx as a regulator of VSMC volume control. Therefore, we next hypothesised that microtubule stability was altering Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in VSMCs. To test this, quiescent VSMCs on rigid and pliable hydrogels were loaded with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fluo-4 prior to angiotensin II treatment. Fluorescence video time lapse microscopy was used to measure changes in Fluo-4 fluorescence. Analysis supported our previous findings showing that Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux was heightened and prolonged in VSMCs on rigid hydrogels compared to VSMCs on pliable hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).

We next hypothesised that increased tubulin acetylation would influence the VSMC matrix rigidity response. To test this, we utilised tubastatin to inhibit HDAC6 deacetylation of the K40 position. Western blot analysis confirmed that VSMCs exposed to an increasing concentration of tubastatin possessed increased levels of acetylated alpha tubulin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S6A and B</xref>). Next, quiescent VSMCs were pretreated with tubastatin prior to angiotensin II stimulation and confocal microscopy was used to assess changes in the cell volume. Tubastatin treated VSMCs possessed increased volume compared to their vehicle treated counterparts on pliable hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-D</xref>). Tubastatin treatment had no effect on VSMC volume on rigid hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-D</xref>). To confirm that this altered response was driven by HDAC6 disruption, we performed siRNA mediated HDAC6 depletion experiments. WB confirmed HDAC6 was efficiently depleted in VSMCs by 2 independent siRNA oligomers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S6C and D</xref>). Analysis of z-stacks captured by confocal microscopy confirmed that HDAC6 depleted, angiotensin II stimulated VSMCs possessed increased volume on pliable hydrogels, compared to their scrambled control treated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E-H</xref>). HDAC6 knockdown had no effect on VSMC volume on rigid hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E-H</xref>). Due to the increased volume of HDAC6 disrupted VSMCs on pliable hydrogels, we next predicted that increased tubulin acetylation was altering VSMC microtubule stability and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. To test these possibilities, we firstly performed cold-stable microtubule stability assays in tubastatin treated VSMCs on pliable and rigid hydrogels. However, the number of cold-stable microtubules remained unaffected by tubastatin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A and B</xref>).

Furthermore, in response to matrix stiffness, VSMC reorganise their actin cytoskeleton and generate enhanced traction stresses, a finding we recapitulate in this study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Petit et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Sanyour et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Sazonova et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Our findings show that changes in the tensegrity equilibrium defines VSMC behaviour in response to matrix rigidity. In this model, the microtubules serve as compression bearing struts that resist actomyosin generated strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Brangwynne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Stamenović, 2005</xref>). Healthy VSMC behaviour is therefore a balance between microtubule stability and actomyosin activity. Actomyosin generated tension drives VSMC contraction and microtubules maintain VSMC morphology, protecting against strain induced cellular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Stamenović, 2005</xref>). The tensegrity model predicts that disruption of the microtubule cytoskeleton alters the equilibrium of these stresses and results in increased VSMC traction stress generation, a hypothesis previously confirmed by both wire myography and traction force microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ahmed et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>). We show that in rigid environments, the VSMC tensegrity equilibrium becomes unbalanced. Contractile agonist stimulation increases VSMC traction stress generation and reduces the number of cold-stable microtubules, resulting in deregulating VSMC morphology and enlargement of VSMC volume. Importantly, the altered tensegrity equilibrium can be induced by microtubule destabilising agents on pliable hydrogels and restored by treatment with agents that stabilise microtubules on rigid hydrogels. These data suggest that microtubules and the tensegrity equilibrium are key regulators of VSMC function and dysfunction. Given the prevalence of increased aortic wall stiffness in ageing and disease, our findings suggest that altered tensegrity equilibrium is a key driver of VSMC dysfunction under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Tsamis et al., 2013</xref>). We propose that changing this equilibrium could be a mechanistic target for manipulating VSMC function. Using microtubule agents clinically is not a viable option to modulate this equilibrium, so a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate this equilibrium is now required to test this idea further.</p><p id="P16">In this study, we used Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux as a readout of stretch-activated channel function. One of these, piezo1, is emerging as an important regulator of VSMC dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Johnson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Luu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Qian et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Retailleau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Swiatlowska et al., 2023</xref>). Our findings further implicate piezo1, as a critical regulator of VSMC behaviour and suggest that changes in piezo1 opening drive altered VSMC behaviour in response to enhanced matrix stiffness. In this study, we show that VSMCs on rigid hydrogels display prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux, increased traction stresses and reduced microtubule stability. The relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and microtubule stability were reciprocal, and changes in microtubule stability altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. We have previously shown that changes in microtubule stability also altered VSMC traction stress generation. Although untested, we predict that microtubule stability alters the ability of VSMCs to withstand the deformational forces placed on the plasma membrane, resulting in changes in membrane tension that control stretch-activated ion channel opening. Therefore, stretch-activated ion channel mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx serves as a mechanistic switch that triggers loss of the microtubule bearing struts and shifts the VSMC tensegrity equilibrium. We still do not understand the precise mechanisms that drive piezo1 mediated microtubule destabilisation. Millimolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations spontaneously induce microtubule destabilisation in vitro, but cellular concentrations are much lower than this. We envisage 3 possibilities: 1) increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux induces changes in the ability of microtubule stabilising proteins to associate with microtubules, resulting in destabilisation; 2) increased mechanical damage induces microtubule catastrophe; or 3) increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> reduces microtubule growth/polymerisation.</p><p id="P17">The role of acetylation in microtubule stability, rigidity and resistance to mechanical damage remains controversial with many conflicting reports. We show that increased microtubule K40 acetylation stimulated both enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and VSMC volume on pliable hydrogels. This suggests that changes in microtubule post translational modification is also a factor in regulating VSMC matrix rigidity response. Despite this finding, K40 acetylation remained unaltered in VSMCs on pliable and rigid hydrogels in our study. This suggests that K40 acetylation does not play a role in the altered microtubule stability observed during VSMC matrix rigidity response. However, HDAC6 inhibition failed to alter microtubule stability and appeared to uncouple the tensegrity equilibrium from the Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux response on pliable hydrogels. Despite this uncoupling, the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> appeared to activate downstream signalling to enhance VSMC volume. HDAC6 has numerous targets, and we predict that this uncoupling is being driven by increased acetylation of other targets that remain unknown. Importantly, these findings suggest that, in addition to the tensegrity equilibrium and our previously identified volume control pathway, other unidentified mechanisms also contribute to the VSMC response to matrix rigidity. Further research is now needed to identify these unknown mechanisms for a more complete understanding of the VSMC matrix rigidity response.</p><p id="P18">In the healthy aortic wall, VSMCs adopt a quiescent, contractile differentiated phenotype. During ageing and disease, VSMCs downregulate contractile marker expression and modulate their phenotype towards disease relevant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Pedroza et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wirka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Worssam et al., 2023</xref>). An important limitation of our study is that we have used dedifferentiated isolated VSMCs. VSMCs are known to possess multiple stretch-activated ion channels, and these can vary depending on phenotype. We have previously shown that piezo1 is upregulated in disease relevant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Johnson et al., 2024</xref>). It remains unknown whether the VSMC tensegrity equilibrium can be altered in healthy contractile differentiated VSMCs, but microtubule agents alter VSMC contractile function in isolated aortic rings, suggesting that this is the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>). In this study, we implicate piezo1 in the defective matrix rigidity induced tensegrity equilibrium of isolated VSMCs. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other stretch ion channels can induce altered tensegrity equilibrium in other phenotypes. Despite this limitation, our findings support the notion that the VSMC tensegrity equilibrium is modifiable and can be targeted to restore VSMC morphology.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Polyacrylamide Hydrogel Preparation</title><p id="P19">Hydrogels were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Johnson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Minaisah et al., 2016</xref>).
