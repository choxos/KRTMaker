Candidalysin is essential for inducing host cell damage during mucosal and systemic <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections, resulting in neutrophil recruitment. Neutrophil influx to <italic>C. albicans</italic>-infected tissue is critical for limiting fungal growth and preventing the fungal dissemination. Here, we demonstrate that candidalysin secreted by hyphae promotes the stimulation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), while synthetic candidalysin triggers a distinct mechanism for NET-like structures (NLS), which are more compact and less fibrous than canonical NETs. Candidalysin activates NADPH oxidase and calcium influx, with both processes contributing to morphological changes in neutrophils resulting in NLS formation. NLS are induced by leukotoxic hypercitrullination, which is governed by protein arginine deaminase 4 activation via calcium influx and initiation of intracellular signalling events. However, activation of signalling by candidalysin does not suffice to trigger downstream events essential for NET formation, as demonstrated by lack of lamin A/C phosphorylation, an event required for activation of cyclin-dependent kinases that are crucial for NET release. Interestingly, exposure to candidalysin does not immediately restrict the capability of neutrophils to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), nor to phagocytose particles. Instead, candidalysin triggers ROS production, calcium influx and subsequent activation of downstream signalling that drive morphological alteration and the formation of NLS in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Notably, candidalysin-triggered NLS demonstrate anti-<italic>Candida</italic> activity, which is resistant to nuclease treatment and dependent on the deprivation of Zn<sup>2+</sup>. This study reveals that <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae releasing candidalysin concurrently trigger canonical NETs and NLS, which together form a fibrous sticky network that entangles <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae and inhibits their growth. Importantly, this explains discrepancies of previous studies demonstrating that neutrophil-derived extracellular chromatin structures triggered by <italic>C. albicans</italic> can be both dependent and independent of ROS. Our data also demonstrate that while candidalysin hampers neutrophil function, the toxin also increases the capability of neutrophils to entangle hyphae and to restrict their growth, reflecting the importance of human neutrophils in controlling the dissemination of <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Candida albicans</kwd><kwd>candidalysin</kwd><kwd>PAD4 citrullination</kwd><kwd>ROS</kwd><kwd>NETs</kwd><kwd>chronic granulomatous disease</kwd><kwd>fungal immunology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Neutrophils are important innate immune cells that play a pivotal role in preventing fungal infections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In addition to engulfing and eradicating microbes by phagocytosis, extracellular mechanisms involving the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and granular vesicles have been described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. As pathogenic fungi can grow as a network of filamentous hyphae, phagocytic killing by neutrophils is often insufficient, thus extracellular mechanisms, such as NET formation, are required for efficient eradication. NETs have been reported to restrict fungal growth and to corroborate inflammatory responses during mycoses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Pathogenic fungi trigger NETs in an NADPH oxidase-dependent manner involving activation of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Several studies indicate that if NET release is not properly balanced, NETs may also have harmful effects on the host, mainly due to their pro-inflammatory function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Notably, microbial toxins can trigger leukotoxic hypercitrullination of histones in neutrophils resulting in similar extracellular structures, termed NET-like structures (NLS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. NLS are less fibrous and more compact than canonical NETs and are triggered in an NADPH oxidase-independent fashion. Similiar to NETs, NLS can induce pro-inflammatory effects with potentially hazardous consequences for the host <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The human fungal pathogen, <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, is a dimorphic yeast with the ability to form invasive, filamentous hyphae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.

Invasive <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae are controlled by human neutrophils, thereby preventing dissemination and exacerbation of disease in otherwise healthy patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. A critical factor for the invasive and inflammatory potential of <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae is the recently discovered peptide toxin candidalysin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Candidalysin is released from the polyprotein Ece1p via a sequential proteolytic cleavage by the proteases Kex2p and Kex1p <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The corresponding <italic>ECE1</italic> gene is exclusively expressed by the hyphal morphology of <italic>C. albicans</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and belongs to the hyphal core response genes consisting of eight hyphal-associated genes expressed under a variety of hyphal inducing conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae deficient in candidalysin are unable to damage epithelial cells or activate key signalling mechanisms that result in alarmin release and inflammatory responses and the recruitment of neutrophils <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Consequently, neutrophil recruitment is severely impaired in models of mucosal and systemic candidiasis in response to candidalysin-deficient mutant strains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Thus, we investigated whether candidalysin can directly act on neutrophils and whether the toxin shapes neutrophil responses, which in turn may impact the outcome of invasive candidiasis.</p><p id="P4">We found that candidalysin-expressing <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains induce more NETs than candidalysin-deficient strains, indicating that candidalysin contributes to NET formation. Notably, synthetic candidalysin induces leukotoxic hypercitrullination and the release of NLS. NLS were dependent on NADPH oxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and PAD4-mediated histone citrullination, but candidalysin did not induce cell cycle activation as indicated by lack of lamin A/C phosphorylation.

To investigate the impact of candidalysin on the neutrophil immune response towards <italic>C. albicans</italic>, we infected neutrophils with wild-type <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>ECE1</italic>-deficient (<italic>ece1</italic>ΔΔ), and corresponding revertant (<italic>ece1</italic>ΔΔ+<italic>ECE1</italic>) strains, and a strain only lacking the candidalysin-coding sequence (P3) within the <italic>ECE1</italic> gene (<italic>ece1</italic>ΔΔ+<italic>ECE1</italic>-P3). After 4 h of infection, samples were prepared for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize extracellular trap events using decondensed neutrophil chromatin (DNA and α-histone) as marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Whereas wild-type and the revertant strain induced comparable amounts of NETs, the <italic>ECE1</italic>- and candidalysin-deficient strains triggered reduced levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Based on previously published image-based quantitative analysis of NET formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, each DAPI-stained event exceeding 100 μm<sup>2</sup> was considered a NET. The quantification revealed that both toxin-deleted strains induced significantly less NETs compared to toxin-expressing strains, with ~60% decreased levels after 3 and 5 h compared with the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Notably, the scrutinized image-based quantification excluded background noise potentially derived from cell debris as confirmed by unstimulated control samples which were incubated in the same manner as stimulated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In conclusion, the data demonstrates that candidalysin contributes to NET formation triggered by <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Synthetic candidalysin induces NET-like structures</title><p id="P6">As candidalysin-expressing <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains induced more NETs, we aimed to investigate the potential of the toxin alone to stimulate neutrophils. Exposure of neutrophils to synthetic candidalysin was sufficient to trigger morphological changes (chromatin decondensation) in 46.3 ± 0.8% of cells after 4 h compared to 80.7 ± 3.2% after exposure to PMA, a well-known inducer of NETs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Neither scrambled candidalysin nor Ece1p peptide 2 (one of eight different Ece1p-derived peptides) affected neutrophil morphology, confirming specificity to candidalysin. Notably, the outspread structures in response to candidalysin were more compact, less fibrous and patchier compared to canonical NETs released upon stimulation with PMA or <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d with c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref> wild type, respectively). Hence, we concluded that synthetic candidalysin does not stimulate canonical NETs, but rather more compact DNA structures, resembling NLS that may be the result of leukotoxic hypercitrullination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Moreover, candidalysin demonstrated a dose-dependent effect with increased NLS formation from 3 μM to 15 μM. However, reduced NLS formation was observed at 70 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), which can be explained by neutrophil cell death induced by the toxin as determined by a DNA Sytox Green assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>). The structures induced by synthetic candidalysin were morphologically different from canonical NETs. However, the time course of morphological changes occurring during exposure to candidalysin was similar to the dynamics of morphological alterations during PMA-induced or <italic>C. albicans</italic> hypha-induced NET formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In both cases, nuclear decondensation commenced at ~60 min and mixing of granular and nuclear components at ~120 min after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). In summary, synthetic candidalysin triggers morphologically distinct NLS in a time- and dose-dependent manner, whereas candidalysin-producing <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae induce canonical NETs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Candidalysin-induced NET-like structures differ morphologically from NETs induced by various stimuli</title><p id="P7">To investigate candidalysin-triggered NLS further, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that allows a more detailed view of the neutrophil-derived structures (<bold>Error! Reference source not found</bold>.a). To categorize the morphological alterations upon candidalysin stimulation, we compared the alterations with canonical ROS-dependent NETs triggered by PMA and NLS upon exposure to the bacterial peptide toxin ionomycin. Ionomycin has been previously reported to induce NLS, also referred to as leukotoxic hypercitrullination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Both, PMA and ionomycin generated widespread chromatin fibers in the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, left and middle panels). In contrast, fibrous, web-like structures were absent in candidalysin-treated neutrophil samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> right panels, for 7 h treatment see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). In addition, <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae induced NETs with observable fibers and threads similar to PMA- and ionomycin-stimulated neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Image-based quantification of NLS events (candidalysin and ionomycin) and NETs (PMA and <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae) revealed that although candidalysin-triggered NLS appeared slightly earlier (after 1 h 17.9 ± 2.6% NLS), time dependency and quantity was similar compared to PMA-induced NETs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Ionomycin-induced changes, however, were more delayed with 26.5 ± 2.6% and 51.9 ± 3.1% NLS after 3 h and 5 h, respectively, and led to overall fewer NLS events. This was confirmed by an area-based analysis of the events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The average area per event exceeding 100 μm<sup>2</sup> was determined using the images from the DNA stain. The frequency of extended threads was low for ionomycin-treated samples and the average area was significantly smaller for ionomycin-induced NLS (149.3 ± 6.21 after 3 h) than it was for PMA-induced (262 ± 8.43 after 3 h) and <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae-triggered NETs (231.34 ± 16.68 after 3 h). Lacking any recognizable fibers and threads candidalysin-triggered NLS displayed a lower average area per event (151.53 ± 0.62 after 3 h) comparable to ionomycin-triggered NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The post-translational protein modification (PTM) of histones, in which arginine residues are enzymatically converted into peptidylcitrulline, was analysed since PTM is a driver of chromatin decondensation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The process of the PTM is called deamination or citrullination. Calcium influx activates protein arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) and the enzyme subsequently facilitates histone citrullination (citH), which contributes to chromatin decondensation and eventually chromatin release. PAD4 activation has been reported for ionomycin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and nicotine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Thus, we assessed whether candidalysin induced histone citrullination in neutrophils. Indeed, like ionomycin, candidalysin increased histone citrullination in neutrophils above basal levels (<bold>Error! Reference source not found</bold>.e). Image quantification of histone citrullination using an antibody directed against citrullinated histone H3 (citH3), demonstrated that citH3 in candidalysin-stimulated neutrophils appeared more distributed than ionomycin-stimulated neutrophils, which remained concentrated in compact nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Notably, we observed ~1.5-fold increased citH3 levels with ionomycin and candidalysin compared to unstimulated neutrophils and no increased citH3 levels with PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). While citrullination levels decreased over time, ionomycin sustained high levels over 5 h. These data strongly suggest that candidalysin induces histone hypercitrullination in neutrophils, which likely promotes chromatin de-condensation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Candidalysin-expressing strains induce more NETs and higher citrullination levels than candidalysin-deficient strains</title><p id="P10">Since candidalysin contributed to the ability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to induce NETs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and synthetic candidalysin strongly stimulated histone citrullination, we investigated citrullination events when neutrophils were exposed to candidalysin-producing and candidalysin-deficient <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains. To assess this, neutrophils were stained with citrullination-specific antibodies (<bold>Error! Reference source not found</bold>.). Candidalysin-producing strains induced far more NETs than candidalysin-deficient strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Image-based quantification corroborated the visual analysis and confirmed that candidalysin-producing <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae promote histone citrullination in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). As synthetic candidalysin only induces NLS, we concluded that candidalysin augments NET release when the toxin is secreted by <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae. Thus, we propose that the combination of candidalysin activity and fungal recognition via pattern recognition receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> is required to fully trigger NET formation when neutrophils are exposed to <italic>C. albicans in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P11">To test this proposition, neutrophils were infected with a yeast-locked (<italic>cph1</italic>ΔΔ /<italic>efg1</italic>ΔΔ) strain and an <italic>ECE1</italic>-overexpressing strain of the same genetic background <italic>cph1</italic>ΔΔ/<italic>efg1</italic>ΔΔ-<italic>ECE1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). As expected, the yeast-locked mutant induced significantly fewer NETs than wild-type <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae. Notably, the <italic>ECE1</italic>-overexpressing yeast-locked mutant, was partly restored in its ability to induce NET release, with 2-fold increased levels after 5 h compared to the yeast-locked mutant and over 60% of WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). This confirmed that candidalysin promotes <italic>C. albicans</italic>-triggered NET release. This was further confirmed by elevated citrullination patterns in presence of candidalysin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). However, <italic>ECE1</italic>-overexpressing yeast-locked mutants were delayed in their ability to induce NET release and citrullination, which only emerged after 5 h of stimulation. Finally, we aimed to determine whether synthetic candidalysin could rescue NET formation when neutrophils were infected with a candidalysin-deficient strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Interestingly, the addition of synthetic candidalysin resulted in a shift to NLS, irrespective of the time of addition, 1 h or 2 h post infection. The data suggest that candidalysin is the key driver of histone citrullination in neutrophils infected with <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>NADPH oxidase enhances candidalysin-triggered NLS formation</title><p id="P12">As other peptide toxins can induce NETs independent of NADPH oxidase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, we investigated the role for ROS in the induction of NLS by candidalysin. Treatment of neutrophils with synthetic candidalysin induced low levels of ROS, but significantly more than untreated neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In the strain context we observed lower ROS levels in the ece1Δ/Δ strain compared to its revertant strain, however, not to a significant extend (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Next, we assessed whether NADPH oxidase dependent ROS or mitochondrial ROS was induced by candidalysin using a luminol-based assay. Notably, candidalysin-induced ROS production was blocked by diphenyliodonium (DPI), a specific NADPH oxidase inhibitor, and by Tempol, a ROS scavenger. ROS inhibition was also observed with MitoTempo, a scavenger targeting mitochondrial ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The inhibitors alone had no significant effect on neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). A similar pattern was observed in response to PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). PMA activates protein kinase C (PKC) and the subsequent assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Thus, we concluded that candidalysin predominantly triggers NADPH oxidase to produce ROS but also moderate amounts of mitochondrial ROS. Next, we analysed how inhibition of ROS influenced the release of NLS triggered by candidalysin. Both, DPI and Tempol blocked candidalysin-induced ROS by 40-50%, while PMA-induced ROS production was totally blocked by DPI and Tempol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). The data were confirmed by immunofluorescence where neutrophils were stained for DNA, histone, and elastase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). Importantly, using NADPH oxidase-deficient neutrophils isolated from chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients (n = 3), we observed a reduction of candidalysin triggered NLS (30-40%) that was comparable to the effect of the ROS inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g and 5h</xref>). Together, the data confirm that candidalysin induces NLS in part in a NADPH oxidase-dependent fashion.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Calcium influx and PAD4 activity contribute to candidalysin-triggered NLS</title><p id="P13">Cytoplasmic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) influx is required to stimulate PAD4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, which is responsible for histone citrullination and chromatin de-condensation during ionomycin-induced hypercitrullination. Since candidalysin also led to increased citrullination of histones in neutrophils, we aimed to elucidate the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during candidalysin neutrophil interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Candidalysin had a clear dose-dependent effect on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). In contrast to Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes characteristic for chemokine receptor signalling, candidalysin-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was not instantaneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S4</xref>) but started around 30 min post stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). This indicates that candidalysin most probably causes Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via pore formation and not via direct receptor stimulation. The PAD inhibitor Cl-amidine (PADi) reduced candidalysin-induced NLS formation by 70% after 180 min and by 50 % after 300 min, as quantified by microscopic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Also, the cell-permeable calcium-chelator BAPTA-AM blocked candidalysin-induced NLS after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). At later time points, BAPTA-AM led to an increase in NLS, probably due to toxic effects as indicated by higher background levels of NLS formation in non-stimulated, BAPTA-AM-treated neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). We thus hypothesized that it may be possible to fully block candidalysin-induced NLS using a combination of PADi and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI, since this combination would target both the ROS-dependent and -independent axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). At 180 min, the combination of PADi and DPI abrogated candidalysin-induced NLS slightly more than the individual inhibitors alone but not beyond the individual inhibitor effect at 300 min. Nevertheless, quantitative image analysis confirmed that PADi and DPI together blocked most NLS formation. For this purpose, neutrophils were stained with antibodies directed against histone H1, citrullinated histone H3, and with DNA dye DAPI. The analysis revealed that the treatment with DPI and PADi reduced the amount of patchy areas representing NLS after 300 min to almost background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that candidalysin-induced NLS formation depends in part on both, ROS and PAD4.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Candidalysin initiates signalling pathways involved in NET formation</title><p id="P14">Our data show that candidalysin induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in neutrophils, which in turn activates PAD4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> leading to chromatin decondensation. Next, we investigated whether additional signalling pathways were involved in candidalysin induction of NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) is a signalling molecule upstream of protein kinase B (Akt). PI3K and Akt are known molecular switches for neutrophil apoptosis or NET formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), an important signalling protein involved in fungal detection, acts upstream of PI3K <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. In agreement, SYK signalling contributes to the regulation of NET formation triggered by <italic>C. albicans</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. As <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae bind to pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), activate neutrophils and ultimately promote the release of NETs, we aimed to elucidate whether candidalysin alone leads to the activation of similar pathways in neutrophils. Hence, we stimulated neutrophils with candidalysin in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors for SYK, PI3K, and Akt. Interestingly, SYK blockade with R406 and PI3K blockade with wortmannin reduced NLS formation by candidalysin almost to background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). The inhibitor piceatannol, which blocks both SYK and PI3K, also blocked NLS formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>). In contrast, Akt blockade with AKT inhibitor XI only partially blocked candidalysin-induced NLS formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>). This was expected, since Akt signals towards a ROS-dependent mechanism in neutrophils <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, which is not critical for NLS induction by candidalysin. In contrast, candidalysin stimulation of neutrophils induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which leads to PAD4 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Candidalysin has been reported to induce inflammasome activation via NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. However, NLRP3 activation seems to be dispensable for NLS induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). Cell cycle molecules are also activated in the latter stages of NET formation and a hallmark of cell cycle induction is the phosphorylation of lamin A/C <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, unlike <italic>C. albicans</italic>, synthetic candidalysin did not trigger the phosphorylation of lamin A/C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e, f</xref>). Thus, we conclude that pathways involved in NET formation are triggered by candidalysin but these pathways cannot be fully sustained, thus NLS are formed rather than NETs. It is likely that a combination of candidalysin activity and hyphal recognition is required for sustained signalling, which will lead to complete chromatin decondensation and expulsion of NET fibers. This notion is confirmed by lack of downstream activation of the cell cycle proteins by synthetic candidalysin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Neutrophils remain functional in the presence of candidalysin</title><p id="P15">Next, we investigated whether neutrophils exposed to candidalysin retain essential antimicrobial function, such as ROS production and phagocytosis. Although cellular death, as assessed using Sytox Green cell-impermeable DNA dye, occurs in increasing rates in candidalysin-treated neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>), neutrophils generally retained their functionality. Neutrophils were able to phagocytose beads in the presence of candidalysin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref>), which was confirmed by time-lapse video (Movie S1), indicating that both Sytox-negative and Sytox-positive neutrophils remained functional. Candidalysin-treated neutrophils were tested for their capacity to mount ROS using PMA as a stimulant. Production of ROS was evident, even 1 or 2 h after candidalysin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8b</xref>). Untreated neutrophils, which were allowed to rest for the times indicated between 30 min and 3 h, showed increased ROS responses upon PMA stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8b</xref>). Notably, even after 2 h treatment with 15 μM candidalysin, neutrophils remained responsive, with ~40-50% of the ROS generated by PMA-stimulated neutrophils in the absence of candidalysin. The data indicates that the majority of neutrophils do not die upon exposure to 15 μM candidalysin. Finally, ionomycin-treated cells showed a minor ROS response and were subsequently unable to produce ROS in response to PMA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Candidalysin-triggered NLS inhibit <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth</title><p id="P16">As NETs inhibit the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, we investigated whether candidalysin-induced NLS harbored antifungal activity. Thus, we designed an image-based assay to assess <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth by quantifying calcofluor white staining in the presence of neutrophils that had been stimulated by candidalysin. Most importantly, the NLS triggered by candidalysin showed a strong anti-<italic>Candida</italic> effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>). Optical density (OD) measurements were used to quantify biomass increase of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). This confirmed that synthetic candidalysin did not suppress <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth, thus this effect was solely due to the candidalysin-induced NLS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). In addition, the <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth suppression could be reverted by addition of excess Zn<sup>2+</sup> but not by micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>). This confirms that, in contrast to canonical NETs, candidalysin-triggered NLS cannot be dismantled and removed by nuclease treatment, probably because NLS are considerably more compact than NETs. Therefore, NLS possessed antimicrobial effects even after nuclease treatment. The anti-<italic>Candida</italic> effect is most probably exerted via the zinc binding protein, calprotectin, as supplementation with excess Zn<sup>2+</sup> blocked the antimicrobial effect of candidalysin-triggered NLS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Candidalysin is the first fungal peptide toxin identified in any human fungal pathogen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and is critical for initiating inflammatory responses that trigger neutrophil recruitment during mucosal and systemic experimental candidiasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. As candidalysin is only produced by <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, we investigated neutrophils response when these phagocytes encounter candidalysin-expressing <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae or synthetic candidalysin. Hyphae of candidalysin-expressing strains induced more NETs than <italic>ECE1</italic>-deficient and candidalysin-deficient strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), indicating that candidalysin promotes NET formation. However, incubation of neutrophils with synthetic candidalysin was not sufficient to induce NETs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Rather, stimulation with candidalysin led to citrullination of histones via PAD4, leukotoxic hypercitrullination, and the release of NLS. In contrast to canonical NETs, NLS are more compact and patchier with fewer clear fibers and threads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Nevertheless, candidalysin-induced NLS did not occur instantaneously. Morphological changes were visible after 30-60 min exposure to candidalysin and intracellular mixing of granular and nuclear material was observed after ~120 min. After 300 min, ~80% of the neutrophil stimulated with candidalysin released NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The role of candidalysin to promote canonical NET release was confirmed using a yeast-locked strain overexpressing <italic>ECE1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). While this overexpression construct did not reach the <italic>ECE1</italic> expression levels driven by the endogenous <italic>ECE1</italic> promoter, it nevertheless secreted significant level of candidalysin as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">Interestingly, candidalysin induced low activity of NADPH oxidase and consequently ROS production. In CGD patient neutrophils, candidalysin-induced NLS were significantly reduced compared to control neutrophils; however, 60% of the CGD neutrophils were still able to release NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Hence, while NADPH oxidase activity promotes candidalysin-induced NLS, it is not essential for NLS formation. This notion is clinically confirmed by the observation that CGD patients very rarely acquire <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. In addition to ROS effects, candidalysin also induces the influx of calcium ions into the cytosol of neutrophils. Calcium influx is a known inducer of PAD4, the enzyme responsible for histone citrullination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We show that PAD4 is also required for histone decondensation during candidalysin-induced NLS formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). It is unlikely that calcium influx in neutrophils is due to candidalysin directly triggering chemokine receptors, since calcium influx is slow and over time, and not in a pulse-like fashion.</p><p id="P19">High concentrations of candidalysin (70 μM) lyse human neutrophils more rapidly than lower concentrations (15 μM and 3 μM). Rapid lysis does not allow for regulated cellular processes to be induced within neutrophils. However, at lower concentrations (15 μM), the neutrophils encountering the toxin were still functional (ROS, phagocytosis) and mount a specific response leading to ROS production, PAD4 activation and the release of NLS. Signalling pathways involved in NET formation were also triggered by candidalysin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Notably, SYK and PI3K inhibition significantly reduced the amount of candidalysin-triggered NLS; both signalling molecules are also inducers of NADPH oxidase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. While chelation of calcium ions and PAD4 inhibition also reduced NLS formation, cell cycle processes such as the phosphorylation of lamin A/C, which is essential for the release of <italic>C. albicans</italic>-induced canonical NETs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, were not activated by synthetic candidalysin. This indicates that candidalysin activates NET signalling pathways but these are not sustained or sufficient to induce the release of canonical NETs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). This notion is consistent with previous findings describing that PAD4 is dispensable for NET formation induced by <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Our data demonstrates that candidalysin is the main driver of histone citrullination in neutrophils infected with <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Lack of candidalysin production in <italic>C. albicans</italic> results in significantly reduced histone citrullination, accompanied with decreased NET formation. However, citrullination is not required for NET release, but rather governs the formation of NLS, which is dominant when candidalysin is added exogenously. With regard to <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae secreting candidalysin, it may be difficult to discriminate NLS form NETs, as both will be induced concurrently <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. It seems logical that the pore-forming activity of candidalysin augments the release of NET fibers during <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection, where PRRs will additionally be triggered on neutrophils, resulting in combinatorial activation of downstream pathways. In line with this notion, candidalysin drives histone citrullination, which contributes to chromatin decondensation. On the contrary, when neutrophils are exposed to synthetic candidalysin, the activation of pathways involved in NET formation are insufficiently sustained, resulting in the emergence of NLS. Importantly, our discovery that hyphae induce NETs and candidalysin induces NLS, provides an explanation for why opsonized <italic>C. albicans</italic> induce NETs in a ROS-dependent fashion, whereas un-opsonized <italic>C. albicans</italic> induce NETs in an ROS-independent fashion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. As such, it appears that candidalysin has a more dominant effect in experimental settings without serum opsonization and a less dominant effect in the presence of serum opsonization.</p><p id="P20">It is noteworthy that candidalysin-induced NLS displayed anti-<italic>Candida</italic> activity. While some reports describe NLS as having no antimicrobial activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, we clearly see an anti-<italic>Candida</italic> effect by candidalysin-triggered NLS. As epithelial cells are able to expunge candidalysin for protection while <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae remain adeherent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, recruited neutrophils may encounter candidalysin before direct contact with hyphae. In addition, neutrophil recruitment is virtually absent in mucosal and systemic models of candidasis in response to candidalysin-deficient strains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Hence, we chose to delineate the capacity of candidalysin-exposed neutrophils to kill <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Interestingly, candidalysin-triggered NLS are resistant to nuclease treatment but the resulting anti-<italic>Candida</italic> effect was Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, indicating that growth inhibition of <italic>C. albicans</italic> by NLS relies on the presence of S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and potentially other Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding neutrophil proteins. Given that NLS are morphologically distinct from NETs, being more compact and lacking threads, this likely explains why NLS are more resistant to nucleases. In context of <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection, candidalysin-induced permeabilization of the plasma membrane will result is large amounts of S100A8/A9 to be released, which will entangle in the structures.
