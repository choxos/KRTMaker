Immune-induced metabolic change is most conspicuous as a driver of pathology in serious or prolonged infection, but it is normally expected to be important to support immune function and recovery. Many of the signalling mechanisms linking immune detection with metabolic regulation, and their specific consequences, are unknown. Here, we show that <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> respond to many bacterial infections by altering expression of genes of the folate cycle and associated enzymes of amino acid metabolism. The net result of these changes is increased flow of carbon from glycolysis into serine and glycine synthesis and a shift of folate cycle activity from the cytosol into the mitochondrion. Immune-induced transcriptional induction of <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>Nmdmc</italic>, the two most-induced of these enzymes, depends on <italic>Dif</italic> and <italic>foxo</italic>. Loss of <italic>astray</italic> or <italic>Nmdmc</italic> results in infection-specific immune defects. Our work thus shows a key mechanism that connects immune-induced changes in metabolic signalling with the serine-folate metabolic unit to result in changed immune function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Immunity and metabolism are closely interconnected. Immune responses are metabolically costly, and therefore metabolism must change to provide the required energy and raw materials. As a result of this dependence, malnutrition and other metabolic perturbations can negatively impact immune function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Conversely, inappropriate or prolonged immune activation can drive metabolic pathology, exemplified in the dramatic wasting of lean and fatty tissues in tuberculosis patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Malnourished children have defects in both innate and adaptive immunity, increasing their risk of dying from infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, whilst obesity is associated with chronic inflammation which in turn promotes the development of other metabolic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Despite the importance of immune-metabolic interplay in human disease, we do not yet fully understand the mechanisms and consequences of this interaction.</p><p id="P3">As a genetically tractable organism with similar innate immunity and metabolism to humans, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has been widely used to study immune-metabolic interactions <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The fat body, an organ analogous to the liver and adipose tissue of vertebrates, is the primary site of energy storage and metabolism in the fly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, it is also responsible for coordinating the humoral immune response. Activation of Toll or Imd signalling in the fat body, triggered most commonly by Gram-positive or -negative bacteria respectively, results in cytosolic translocation of the NF-κB transcription factors Dif and Relish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. These drive expression antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are secreted from the fat body and neutralize microorganisms via a variety of mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Infection can profoundly affect fat body energy storage. A cachexia-like phenotype has been observed upon <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> infection, in which flies progressively lose glycogen and triglyceride stores and become hyperglycemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Similar observations have been made during <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and <italic>Beauvaria bassiana</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> infection. This reduction in energy stores is likely at least in part a direct result of immune signalling, as constitutive activation of the Toll receptor in the larval fat body phenocopies triglyceride loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">One mechanism by which the Toll pathway can drive changes in triglyceride and carbohydrate metabolism is through disruption of insulin signalling, a prominent anabolism-promoting pathway. Insulin signalling results in the phosphorylation and activation of Akt, which inhibits the transcription factor FOXO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Infections with <italic>M. marinum, M. luteus and B. bassiana</italic> all reduce phosphorylation of Akt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Overexpression of Dif also reduces Akt phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, indicating that disruption of the insulin signalling pathway likely occurs via transcriptional targets of Dif. The mechanism of disruption has been attributed to impaired Akt phosphorylation by the kinase Pdk1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and reduced insulin like peptide activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. This reduction in insulin pathway activity has been suggested to enable triglyceride remodelling into phospholipids to support the immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Outside of insulin signalling, the transcription factor MEF2 has also been shown to be an important determinant of triglyceride and carbohydrate anabolic-catabolic balance in infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Whilst a significant amount is known in <italic>Drosophila</italic> about the mechanisms connecting immune activation with triglyceride and carbohydrate metabolism, connections between immune activation and other metabolic processes are not as clearly understood. One such area is amino acid metabolism. Two studies have noted that immune activation drives changes to the expression of enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism. Infection of <italic>Drosophila</italic> with seven different bacteria results in downregulation of <italic>Agxt</italic>, encoding an alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase involved in alanine and glycine metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Further, constitutive activation of Imd in the larval fat body has been shown to drive upregulation of genes encoding enzymes associated with glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and downregulation of arginine and proline metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Beyond changes to transcript levels, two studies have measured the levels of amino acids themselves and noted infection-induced changes. Both <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infections result in a decrease in branched chain amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection causes changes to the levels of numerous other amino acids, including a consistent increase in amino acids associated with glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and a drop in tyrosine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The reduction in tyrosine is likely due to its involvement in generating phenols for melanisation, an important aspect of the immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. However, the functional impacts of alterations to the other individual amino acids, and the expression of associated enzymes, remains unexplored.</p><p id="P8">This is also true of other metabolic systems that support amino acid metabolism. For example, one-carbon (1C) metabolism encompasses a set of reactions that involve the activation and transfer of one-carbon units via folate intermediates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Carbon units are moved between metabolites to support biosynthetic processes such as purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, as well as maintain glycine, serine, and methionine homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Infection-induced alterations to the expression of enzymes involved in 1C metabolism have been observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, but the underlying regulatory mechanisms and functional relevance are unknown.</p><p id="P9">In this work, we performed RNAseq and fat body-specific Targeted DamID (TaDa) to study gene expression changes induced by infection. We observed transcriptional upregulation of two enzymes of interest—<italic>astray</italic>, a phosphoserine phosphatase, and <italic>Nmdmc</italic>, an enzyme involved in 1C metabolism that supplies a tetrahydrofolate cofactor for serine to glycine conversion. We observed that other enzymes in metabolic proximity are also transcriptionally regulated during infection, including <italic>Shmt,</italic> which catalyses the serine to glycine conversion, and <italic>pug,</italic> another 1C enzyme that is partially redundant with <italic>Nmdmc</italic>. We first looked at regulation of the enzymes and discovered that a transcriptional preference is shown towards running the 1C cycle through the mitochondria upon infection. We found that <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>Nmdmc</italic> are repressed by MEF2 in healthy flies and upregulated by Dif and FOXO, perhaps via the suppression of insulin signalling. Finally, we used knock downs and CRISPR mutants to investigate the functional role of these enzymes during infection. We found that <italic>astray</italic> is required for tolerance during <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infection and resistance against <italic>Enterococcus faecalis,</italic> whilst the other enzymes show mixed, pathogen specific phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Fly husbandry</title><p id="P10">Flies were maintained on a standard yeast-sugar diet containing 10% w/v Brewer’s yeast, 8% fructose, 2% polenta, 0.8% agar, 0.075% nipagin and 0.0825% v/v propanoic acid.

Accurate mass spectrometry was performed using an Agilent Accurate Mass 6545 QTOF apparatus. Dynamic mass axis calibration was achieved by continuous infusion after the chromatography of a reference mass solution using an isocratic pump connected to an ESI ionization source operated in positive-ion mode. The nozzle and fragmentor voltages were set to 2,000 V and 100 V, respectively. The nebulizer pressure was set to 50 psig, and the nitrogen drying gas flow rate was set to 5 l/minute. The drying gas temperature was maintained at 300 °C. The MS acquisition rate was 1.5 spectra/sec, and m/z data ranging from 50 to 1,200 were stored. This instrument enabled accurate mass spectral measurements with an error of less than 5 parts per million (ppm), a mass resolution ranging from 10,000 to 45,000 over the m/z range of 121-955 atomic mass units, and a 100,000-fold dynamic range with picomolar sensitivity. The data were collected in centroid 4-GHz (extended dynamic range) mode. The detected m/z data were deemed to represent metabolites, which were identified based on unique accurate mass-retention times and MS/MS fragmentation identifiers for masses exhibiting the expected distribution of accompanying isotopomers. The typical variation in the abundance of most of the metabolites remained between 5 and 10% under these experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Metabolomics analysis</title><p id="P28">Mass spectrometry data was analysed using the Agilent Masshunter software suite, Microsoft Excel and in-house R scripts.</p><p id="P29">Features were identified as the compounds of interest by comparison with metabolite standards.

The fact that the metabolic perturbations resulted from fat body knock down of <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>Shmt</italic> demonstrates that the expression of these enzymes in the fat body specifically is important for whole-organism metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Loss of <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>foxo</italic> expression impairs immune competence</title><p id="P57">Looking next at immune function, we observed that <italic>astray</italic> fat body knockdowns had a significant survival defect during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7A</xref>). The same phenotype was observed upon knockdown of <italic>astray</italic> using a different RNAi line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5B-C</xref>) and fat body mutation of <italic>astray</italic> using tissue-specific CRISPR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5D</xref>). No meaningful difference in bacterial load was observed in <italic>astray</italic> knockdowns, with as great a difference observed between the two genetic controls as between the controls and the knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B</xref>). This demonstrates that <italic>astray</italic> is required for tolerance of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, as knockdowns are not impeded in their ability to limit bacterial numbers, but struggle to maintain health when faced with the same bacterial load.</p><p id="P58">Since FOXO appeared to be the main driver of <italic>astray</italic> induction, we investigated whether <italic>foxo</italic> mutants also present an immune phenotype. Indeed, we observed that mutation of <italic>foxo</italic> resulted in significantly reduced survival during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, coupled with unchanged bacterial load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7C-D</xref>). The importance of FOXO during infection is traditionally attributed to its role in fat and sugar metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. However, the similarity between the <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>foxo</italic> phenotypes suggests that, at least in <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, regulation of amino acid metabolism could be an important mechanism by which FOXO promotes host survival.</p><p id="P59">We next studied the role of <italic>astray</italic> in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> infection. Fat body knock down of <italic>astray</italic> resulted in a stark survival phenotype; nearly all knockdowns died overnight, whilst survival of the genetic controls remained relatively unaffected by the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7E</xref>). This was matched with significantly increased bacterial loads in <italic>astray</italic> knockdowns five and eight hours post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7F</xref>). The clearance defect was still observed when flies were given a dose of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> low enough that it could be controlled by wild-type flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5E</xref>). <italic>E. faecalis</italic> is cleared primarily through the action of Bomanins, a family of small effector peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. The observed defect in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> clearance thus might result from impaired Bomanin production. Glycine is the most abundant amino acid in the Bomanin family, comprising almost 20% of all residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5F</xref>). Hence the requirement of <italic>astray</italic> for glycine synthesis could explain the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> clearance defect in <italic>astray</italic> knock downs.</p><p id="P60">Unlike <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, mutation of <italic>foxo</italic> did not mimic the phenotypes observed with <italic>astray</italic> knock down during <italic>E. faecalis</italic> infection.

This reduction was temporary: bacterial numbers returned to wild type levels by 30 hours post-infection. We observed improved survival upon <italic>Shmt</italic> knock down in some, but not all, experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S7B-F</xref>).</p><p id="P63">A clearer immune phenotype was observed with <italic>Nmdmc.</italic> Mutation of mitochondrial <italic>Nmdmc</italic> resulted in significantly improved survival and reduced bacterial numbers during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8B-C</xref>). A survival advantage was also observed upon fat body knockdown of <italic>Nmdmc</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S8A-B</xref>).

The transcriptional mechanism involves activation by FOXO and inhibition by MEF2. The consequences of this induction are infection dependent.</p><p id="P68">Since we observed induction of <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>Nmdmc</italic> in every infection tested (<italic>M. luteus, F. novicida, S. aureus, E. faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>)), modulation of these enzymes could be a conserved infection response. In support of this, Troha <italic>et al</italic>. set out to identify a set of ‘core host response’ genes that are differentially expressed in response to most infections and observed significant <italic>astray</italic> upregulation in nine out of ten infections tested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. <italic>Nmdmc</italic> was not on this list, but since that we found that its expression is driven by Dif, it is likely also induced by infection with any Toll-pathway agonist. Further, constitutive activation of Imd in the larval fat body has been shown to increase <italic>Nmdmc</italic> expression, suggesting that induction could also be part of a conserved response against Gram-negative bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P69"><italic>Nmdmc</italic> is not the only 1C enzyme to show altered expression during infection. Troha <italic>et al.</italic> also identified <italic>CG7560</italic> as one of the ‘core host response’ genes, with significantly increased expression observed in nine of the ten infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In mammals, this enzyme acts on the same metabolite as <italic>Nmdmc</italic> and <italic>pug</italic>- 5,10-methylene THF- but converts it to 5-methyl-THF rather than 10-formyl-THF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This 5-methyl-THF has a unique function in remethylation of homocysteine to form methionine. Subsequently, methionine is adenylated to form S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which plays a key role in epigenetics and biosynthetic processes through methylation of DNA, RNA, proteins and metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In line with our observations, downregulation of <italic>pug</italic> has been reported upon infection of adult flies with <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> and Sindbis virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Interestingly, this downregulation is likely the result of immune signalling, as constitutive activation of Imd in the larval fat body has been shown to reduce <italic>pug</italic> expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Alongside <italic>pug</italic> downregulation, constitutive Imd activation also leads to downregulation of <italic>Mthfs</italic>, an enzyme required to convert 5-formyl-THF, an inactive form of THF, into the active form 5, 10-methenyl-THF.</p><p id="P70">As well as identifying that <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>Nmdmc</italic> are upregulated during infection, we were able to investigate the transcriptional mechanisms controlling this. Our data suggest a model in which expression of <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>Nmdmc</italic> is kept low in healthy flies by MEF2, but the repression is either alleviated by the previously documented infection-induced change in MEF2 function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> or simply overcome during infection by Dif and/or FOXO. We observed numerous FOXO binding sites in the vicinity of the <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>Nmdmc</italic> loci, and evidence from the literature suggests that FOXO is likely a direct regulator of <italic>astray</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. It has been shown that overexpression of FOXO in S2 cells in the presence of insulin results in a 19-fold upregulation of <italic>astray</italic>, and <italic>in vitro,</italic> FOXO can directly bind the <italic>astray</italic> promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P71">However, the lack of Dif binding sites in proximity to <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>Nmdmc</italic> led us to believe that Dif likely acts via an intermediate. Given the established paradigm that Toll signalling can block Akt phosphorylation and thereby overcome FOXO repression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, we hypothesise that Dif may contribute to <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>Nmdmc</italic> upregulation by enabling FOXO to drive their expression. This dependence of FOXO on Dif would also explain why we observed a complete lack of <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>Nmdmc</italic> induction in Dif and FOXO mutants, rather than an intermediate phenotype for each.</p><p id="P72">The repression of <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>Nmdmc</italic> by MEF2 warrants further investigation. In mammals, MEF2 can recruit HDACs and compact chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Co-localisation of MEF2 and HDAC4 has been reported in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body, suggesting that MEF2 could have the same repressive function in flies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. However, it is also possible that the increased expression of <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>Nmdmc</italic> observed in <italic>Mef2</italic> knock downs could be an indirect influence of FOXO. MEF2 has numerous important functions, particularly in muscle development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, so it is possible that MEF2 knock down could elicit a stress response. Constitutive activation of the stress-responsive kinase JNK in the larval fat body and insulin producing cells results in nuclear translocation of FOXO and expression of FOXO target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Hence increased expression of <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>Nmdmc</italic> in <italic>Mef2</italic> knock downs could be due to a FOXO-mediated stress response. Identification and manipulation of MEF2 binding sites in the vicinity of <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>Nmdmc</italic> could help test this hypothesis.</p><p id="P73">Having studied the transcriptional regulation of <italic>astray, Nmdmc</italic>, and other enzymes in proximity, we next looked at their functions in an infection context. Experiments with <italic>S. aureus</italic> revealed intriguing phenotypes. Knock down of <italic>astray</italic> resulted in a tolerance defect, with flies dying faster from infection whilst bacterial numbers were unchanged compared to the genetic controls. In contrast, <italic>Shmt</italic> knock down temporarily reduced bacterial numbers at the start of infection, and mitochondrial <italic>Nmdmc</italic> mutation resulted in significantly improved survival and reduced bacterial loads. Together this suggests that serine must be required for alternative processes, as production of serine is advantageous to the host, whilst diversion of serine into 1C metabolism is detrimental.</p><p id="P74">However, another possibility is that the serine is required by <italic>S. aureus</italic> itself. Serine serves important functions in <italic>S. aureus</italic> metabolism, both in protein synthesis and in its role as an alternate carbon source, and has been shown to be amongst the most highly consumed amino acids <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. In an <italic>in vivo</italic> context, bacteria often depend on uptake of host nutrients for survival. Indeed, numerous genes encoding amino acid and peptide transporters are important for <italic>S. aureus</italic> survival in multiple animal infection models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. It is therefore plausible that the lack of available serine in <italic>astray</italic> knock downs could drive <italic>S. aureus</italic> to become more virulent in order to release serine from host tissue. This would result in the observed phenotype of increased fly mortality without higher bacterial burdens. In support of this, expression of virulence determinants often correlates with reduced nutrient availability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P75">A direct link between amino acid status and virulence factor production in <italic>S. aureus</italic> has been identified in CodY<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. This is a transcriptional regulator that is activated by branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) and primarily represses target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. When nutrients are depleted and BCAA availability is low, CodY activity is reduced, and target genes become de-repressed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Evidence suggests that the first genes to become de-repressed are those involved amino acid synthesis and transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. If nutrient depletion progresses, there is subsequent de-repression of virulence factors that mediate the destruction of host tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Similar systems could exist to drive <italic>S. aureus</italic> virulence in serine-poor environments.</p><p id="P76">Unlike <italic>S. aureus</italic>, we propose that the phenotypes observed with <italic>E. faecalis</italic> infection are primarily the result of metabolites required to support immune function. We observed striking resistance defects with <italic>astray</italic> and <italic>Shmt</italic>, with knockdowns showing significantly reduced survivorship and higher bacterial loads. The phenotypes with <italic>Nmdmc</italic> mitochondrial mutants and <italic>pug</italic> mutants were less clear cut but showed a trend in the same direction. We hypothesise that these phenotypes are the result of impaired Bomanin production due to the reduced availability of glycine. Immunity against <italic>E. faecalis</italic> appears to be mediated almost entirely by the Bomanin family of peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Mutation of all Bomanin family members bar two leads to as strong a survival defect as is observed upon mutation of Myd88, a core component of the Toll signalling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Almost 20% of all amino acid residues in the Bomanin family peptides are glycine, providing an explanation for why flies with defects in glycine production have poorer immune function.</p><p id="P77">Together, these data reveal that the metabolism of individual amino acids, and the supporting 1C reactions, are tightly fine-tuned in the context of infection and significantly impact immune competence in a pathogen-specific manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental figures and legends</label><media xlink:href="EMS157693-supplement-Supplemental_figures_and_legends.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d28aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS157693-supplement-Supplemental_tables.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d28aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S31"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all members of the Dionne lab and the Imperial South Kensington fly laboratory for useful discussion and comments.
