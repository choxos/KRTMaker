However, the importance of cellular oxygen consumption is often underappreciated, with rates of oxygen consumption often sufficient to cause hypoxia at cell monolayers. We initially focused on cultured adipocytes as a terminally differentiated cell-type with substantial oxygen consumption rates to support diverse cellular functions. Under standard conditions, cultured adipocytes are hypoxic and highly glycolytic. Increasing oxygen diverted glucose flux toward mitochondria and resulted in thousands of gene expression changes that pointed toward alleviated physiological transcriptional responses to hypoxia. Phenotypically, providing more oxygen increased adipokine secretion and rendered adipocytes more sensitive to insulin and lipolytic stimuli. The functional benefits of increasing pericellular oxygen were transferable to other cellular systems including hPSC-derived hepatocytes and cardiac organoids. Our findings suggest that oxygen is limiting in many terminally-differentiated cell culture systems, and that controlling oxygen availability can improve the quality and translatability of cell models.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cell culture</kwd><kwd>oxygen tension</kwd><kwd>oxygen diffusion</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>HIF</kwd><kwd>glucose metabolism</kwd><kwd><italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis</kwd><kwd>adipocytes</kwd><kwd>hPSC</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Over the past two decades, substantive focus has been placed on improving translation between mice and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. However, until recently, attempts to improve translation between cell culture and <italic>in vivo</italic> settings, be they mouse or human, has not received as much attention. In the past 5-6 years there have been efforts to improve the fidelity of cell culture models principally by altering the nutrient composition of cell culture media to be more physiological<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. However, the importance of oxygen tension in cell culture has not received the same attention.</p><p id="P4">Cell culture is usually viewed as hyperoxic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, due to incubators containing approximately 18% oxygen. As a result, most work studying oxygen tension in cell culture focuses on reducing atmospheric oxygen concentrations to 5% or even 1%. However, the notion that cell culture is hyperoxic relies on an assumption that oxygen delivery through the medium exceeds cellular demand. First, the depth of medium in which cells are cultured is not trivial. Under “standard culture conditions” (e.g. 1 mL of medium per well of a 12-well plate) the depth of medium varies between 2.4 and 2.9 mm due to the meniscus effect. Most mammalian cells range between 40 and 100 µM in diameter. This means that oxygen must diffuse through a distance equivalent to between 27 and 58 cell diameters to get to a cell monolayer. Most cells <italic>in vivo</italic> are directly subtended by capillaries which deliver oxygen over significantly shorter diffusion distances (microns) than the medium column (millimetres). Thus, standard culture conditions pose a significant barrier to oxygen delivery. Second, cultured cells have a large range of oxygen consumption rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. If these exceed the rate of oxygen delivery from the air-medium interface, cells will experience hypoxia at the cell monolayer. While the concept that cellular respiration can outstrip oxygen delivery in cell culture is known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, the functional consequences of hypoxia under standard culture conditions on cell metabolism, gene expression and function has not been addressed.</p><p id="P5">Many cultured cell lines exhibit high rates of glycolytic metabolism generating lactate from glucose to meet their ATP demands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. This glycolytic metabolism is often attributed to an intrinsic metabolic rewiring of cultured cells, similar to the aerobic glycolysis/Warburg effect observed in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Indeed, a high rate of glycolysis is a key metabolic adaptation in proliferating cells, suggesting that this may be a necessary cell-intrinsic adaptation to support proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. However, this reasoning does not hold for the high rates of glycolysis observed in many terminally-differentiated non-proliferative cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Non-cell-intrinsic causes for high rates of lactate production by cell lines have been previously investigated.</p><p id="P6">One suggestion to explain why glycolysis appears almost ubiquitous to cell culture is that unphysiological media compositions promote glycolysis, also referred to as the Crabtree effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, an arguably simpler explanation for the high glycolytic rates of many cultured cells is that oxygen is limiting; with cells responding physiologically to a hypoxia by switching to anaerobic metabolism. While data regarding the glucose and lactate metabolism by many terminally-differentiated cell types is consistent with the hypothesis that these cell types are hypoxic, it remains to be formally proven and, perhaps more importantly, the impact on cellular phenotypes of increasing oxygen supply to cells is largely unexplored.</p><p id="P7">Here, we provide experimental evidence that multiple terminally-differentiated metabolic cell lines are hypoxic under standard culture conditions, and explore the consequences of limited oxygen availability on cellular metabolism and phenotypes. We show that the high glycolytic activity of several cultured cell lines is a physiological response to hypoxia, resulting from limitations in oxygen diffusion through the medium column. We demonstrate that increasing oxygen availability reprogrammed cells away from glycolytic and toward oxidative metabolism, increased pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) flux, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity and oxygen consumption, promoted lipid anabolism, destabilised hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1α protein, and induced over 3000 transcriptional changes within 16 h. Notably, these changes occurred in multiple cell lines and resulted in improved cellular functions. Our findings highlight that understanding and controlling oxygen availability in cell culture models is important for the development of better <italic>in vitro</italic> models.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Increasing pericellular oxygen tension decreases lactate production and increases <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes</title><p id="P8">To study the effects of oxygen tension in cell culture, we selected the 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell line as our primary model. 3T3-L1 adipocytes are generated from a fibroblast precursor cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and are a valuable model used to study adipocyte differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, lipid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, and hormonal responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Under standard culture conditions (e.g., 1 mL DMEM/10% FCS per well in 12-well plates) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>), 3T3-L1 adipocytes grow as a monolayer and produce high levels of lactate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Given the high oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (200 fmol/mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>/s) of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B and 1C</xref>), we hypothesised that their glycolytic phenotype may not be innate, but a consequence of limited oxygen availability. Indeed, <italic>in vivo</italic> estimates from human subcutaneous adipose tissue across fasting and postprandial periods place adipose tissue lactate production at 15-30% of glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, which is lower than observed for cultured 3T3-L1s (close to 50%). Fick’s first law of gas diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) states that oxygen diffusion rates are proportionate to medium depth. To support an OCR of 200 fmol/mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>/s we calculated that medium depth could not exceed 2.43 mm (e.g., a 5 mm medium depth would limit OCR to just 100 fmol/mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>/s). Medium height is not constant in cell culture wells due to the meniscus. The minimum depth of medium in a 12-well plate containing 1 mL of medium was measured at ∼2.4 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>). Based on the OCR of 3T3-L1s, Fick’s law predicts that oxygen concentrations at the cell monolayer would be virtually 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Indeed, under standard culture conditions (100 µL per well in a 96-well plate), the oxygen concentration measured 0.55 mm above the cell monolayer (the minimum measurable depth by the Resipher system) was ∼15 µM (11 mmHg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>), well below atmospheric oxygen (181 µM; 139 mmHg). To increase oxygen tension at the cell monolayer, we lowered medium volumes, reducing the distance from the air-medium interface to the cell monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). As expected, lowering medium volumes increased pericellular oxygen levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>), with oxygen concentrations 0.55 mm above the cell monolayer reaching between 38–73 µM (29–56 mmHg) for cells cultured in 50 µL or 33 µL medium in a 96-well plate, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). These values were more similar to those measured in mouse (∼60 mmHg)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and human (40.5 – 73.8 mmHg)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> adipose tissue, than cells grown under standard conditions. Therefore, lowering medium volumes provided a simple experimental system to assess the impact of oxygen tension on 3T3-L1 adipocyte metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Under low oxygen tension, glycolysis switches from being primarily aerobic, with CO<sub>2</sub> as the end point, to becoming increasingly anaerobic, with lactate as the end point. We initially measured glucose consumption and lactate production. Switching cells cultured in 12-well plates from 1 mL (high) to 0.67 mL (mid) or 0.33 mL (low) medium lowered glucose uptake and caused an even more drastic reduction in lactate production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, the extent of lactate production from glucose in 3T3-L1 adipocytes cultured at a higher oxygen tension (17% lactate from glucose) is more similar to the <italic>in vivo</italic> values of 15-30% in human subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. This change was not driven by depletion of glucose, which remained &gt;12 mM under all medium volumes after 16 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). Instead, our results indicated a considerable reduction in anaerobic glycolysis under conditions of greater oxygen availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Importantly, the reduction in the lactate-to-glucose ratio in low medium conditions was independent of starting medium glucose concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>), suggesting that the effect of increasing oxygen on glucose metabolism was not an artefact of culturing cells in non-physiological medium glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">Critically, despite a 50% reduction in glucose uptake, cells cultured in lower medium volumes (0.33 mL <italic>versus</italic> 1 mL) increased <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis (DNL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating the cells were substantially more metabolically efficient; able to produce sufficient ATP and obtain enough carbon to support DNL from less glucose. The increased efficiency of the cells was consistent with the fact that generation of ATP by converting glucose to lactate only produces 2 molecules of ATP, whereas complete oxidation in mitochondria generates up to 36<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. To confirm these metabolic responses to low medium conditions were due to a primary change in oxygen availability, we cultured cells in gas-permeable cell culture plates (Lumox). These plates allow oxygen diffusion from the bottom of the well, bypassing the media layer. Similar to the low medium conditions, gas-permeable plates lowered glucose use and lactate production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>), and increased DNL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that the glycolytic metabolism of 3T3-L1 cells is not innate, but a response to limited oxygen supply. We next sought to determine how important the impact of increasing oxygen tension was to the metabolism and phenotypes of cells in culture.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Lowering medium volumes increases mitochondrial glucose oxidation</title><p id="P11">We next directly measured OCR under different medium volumes. Switching cells from standard (100 µL per well in 96-well plates) to low (33 µL) medium conditions rapidly (within 3-4 h) doubled the oxygen consumption rate from 200 to 400 fmol/mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), showing that standard culture volumes were indeed limiting for oxygen delivery to 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Increased O2 consumption was independent of changes in mitochondrial content as measured by western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>), or oxygen consumption in permeabilised cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). Under standard culture conditions, medium oxygen concentration was ∼15 µM</p><p id="P12">0.55 mm above the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, in a closed system, 3T3-L1 adipocytes respired maximally down to ∼4 µM oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Together, these data suggest a near total use of available oxygen (to less than 4 µM) at the cell monolayer. Overall, we demonstrate that 3T3-L1 adipocytes consume all oxygen that diffuses to the monolayer under standard culture conditions, become hypoxic, and perform anaerobic glycolysis to maximise ATP production.</p><p id="P13">Multiple adaptations to hypoxia are known, including increased glucose uptake for anaerobic glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, inhibition of PDH flux to limit aerobic TCA cycle activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, and activation of the HIF system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Firstly, we determined changes in glucose transport and expression of glucose transporters. We did not see any changes in the protein levels of the insulin-regulated glucose transporter GLUT4. In contrast, the hypoxia-inducible glucose transporter GLUT1 was strongly suppressed by low medium, as was non-GLUT4 dependent glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C</xref>). Second, PDH phosphorylation was decreased following the switch to low medium volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), consistent with decreased negative regulation of PDH by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) and therefore increased PDH activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Indeed, direct measurement of PDH flux using mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) of palmitate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> revealed a ∼40% increase in glucose entry to the TCA cycle via PDH when cells were cultured in lower medium volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Consistent with greater PDH activity and glucose entry into the TCA cycle, U<sup>13</sup>C-glucose tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>) revealed that transitioning cells to low medium (0.33 mL in 12-well plates) for either 4 h (Figure S2E) or 16 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>) increased <sup>13</sup>C-labelling of all TCA cycle intermediates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). Additionally, enrichment of m+3 isotopologues for fumarate and malate suggested increased pyruvate carboxylase activity, which allows for TCA anaplerosis by replenishing oxaloacetate. In total, the abundance of 45 metabolites was changed by culturing cells in low medium for 16 h, indicating comprehensive metabolic rewiring of cells beyond just the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2G</xref>). Of note, α-ketoglutarate (ɑ-KG) was the most upregulated TCA metabolite under low medium conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F</xref>), with all the additional ɑ-KG containing glucose-derived carbon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>).

That oxygen tension can be limiting in standard cell culture has been described and discussed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, this is not widely considered, perhaps due to a lack of data on how oxygen deficiencies actually affect cells in culture both metabolically and phenotypically. Our study builds upon this previous work, to provide a comprehensive investigation on the broader impact of oxygen limitations in standard cell culture. Importantly, we show that increasing oxygen availability resulted in significant metabolic and transcriptional changes, and markedly improved cellular function in several cell types that model major metabolic organs – namely adipocytes, hiPSC-derived hepatocytes, and hPSC-derived cardiac organoid cultures. These data provide empirical evidence that limited oxygen has profound effects on cell metabolism and function under standard culture conditions.</p><p id="P21">There are several possibilities how increased oxygen availability in culture may improve or alter cellular function. The observed impact on cellular phenotypes may be HIF-driven, given the wide range of cellular functions influenced by HIF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. For example, we measured increased rates of lipolysis in cells with greater oxygen availability, consistent with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. However, our RNAseq analyses revealed transcriptional changes beyond the HIF pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that additional pathways may connect oxygen availability to cellular behaviour/responses. Indeed, signalling molecules such as reactive oxygen species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, or metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> may be implicated. For example, in the abundance of a number of metabolites altered upon increased oxygen including lactate, acetyl-CoA, succinate, fumarate, and α-ketoglutarate can affect cellular signalling through post-translational modifications, metabolite receptors, and/or epigenetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Our simple method to increase oxygen to cells, which induces a large shift in cell metabolism, may provide a useful system to further interrogate the link between oxygen tension, metabolites, and cell function.</p><p id="P22">We used two methods to increase oxygen availability to terminally-differentiated metabolic cell-types; decreasing medium volumes to decrease oxygen diffusion distances, as well as gas-permeable culture plates. Lowering medium volume provides an accessible method to increase oxygen provision which can be easily employed by most laboratories. However, this method has its limitations, such as medium evaporation and nutrient depletion. Other methods to increase cellular oxygen have been employed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, but bioreactors or perfusion systems most accurately recapitulate the sophisticated oxygen delivery system of the vasculature since they continuously supply oxygenated medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. However, scalability of and accessibility to this method pose major barriers to widespread use. The field where oxygen tension has perhaps been most carefully considered is in organoid culture. Air−liquid interface culture models have been adopted for many stem-cell and organoid lines, including the respiratory tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, tumour immune microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, and gastrointestinal tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, with many studies highlighting the improved fidelity of <italic>in vitro</italic> air-liquid interface models to their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts.

First, although we have focussed exclusively on terminally-differentiated cell types, our findings are likely applicable to other cell types. However, it is probable that factors such as differentiation stage and whether the cells are proliferating will affect whether cells in culture experience hypoxia and the cellular response to experimental changes in oxygen tension. Indeed, a key determinant of oxygen consumption at the cell monolayer is cell density or confluence. Our study focuses on terminally-differentiated cell types, which are typically grown to 100% confluence. This is distinct from rapidly proliferative cell-types, such as cancer or immune cells, which proliferate rapidly and are usually grown and studied at pre-confluence. Thus, whether specific cells in culture experience hypoxia and would functionally benefit from increased oxygen needs to be determined on a cell type-to-cell type basis</p><p id="P24">Second, our study highlights a critical distinction between incubator oxygen levels, and the local oxygen concentration experienced by cells. This suggests that reporting of incubator oxygen % is insufficient, and that measuring pericellular oxygen is required to reveal the actual oxygen concentration experienced by cells.

Shifting cells to a more physiological oxygen tension correlated with improved adipocyte function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Since cells <italic>in vivo</italic> exist on a spectrum of oxygen tensions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, we suggest that the best reference point for optimal oxygen tension for a specific cell-type is to match the pericellular oxygen to that of the relevant tissue <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P25">Finally, the powerful effects of adjusting oxygen tension on cell phenotypes highlights the need for researchers to control and report on factors that impact oxygen availability (e.g. medium volumes, cell densities) to ensure reproducibility.

Each hCO contained 5 × 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> cells, a final concentration of 2.6 mg/ml collagen I and 9% Matrigel. 3.5 μL of suspension was pipetted into the hCO culture insert and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 45 min in order to gel. After gelling, α-MEM GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher Scientific), 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 200 μM L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate sesquimagnesium salt hydrate (Sigma) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (ThermoFisher Scientific) was added. hCO were subsequently cultured in maturation medium (MM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup> with medium changes every 2 to 3 days for 5 days (7 days old hCO). To better approximate adult metabolic provisions a ‘weaning medium’ (WM) was utilised. hCO were cultured in WM containing 4% B27 – insulin, 5.5 mM glucose, 1 nM insulin, 200 μM L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate sesquimagnesium salt hydrate, 1% P/S, 1% GlutaMAX (100x), 33 μg/mL aprotinin and 10 μM palmitate (conjugated to bovine serum albumin in B27) in DMEM without glucose, glutamine and phenol red (ThermoFisher Scientific) with medium changes every 2-3 days.</p><p id="P85">The elasticity of the Heart Dyno poles enables the contractile properties to be determined via tracking pole deflection, which directly correlates with force<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. Videos of 10 s were made of each hCO with the Nikon ANDOR WD Revolution Spinning Disk microscope (magnification 4x). While imaging, hCO were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 to prevent changes in contractile behaviour. This facilitated the analysis of the contractile properties of the organoids and the production of time-force graphs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. Moreover, data was obtained regarding additional important functional parameters including the contraction rate and the activation and relaxation time of the organoids.</p></sec><sec id="S38"><title>Quantification and Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P86">All statistical analyses, unless otherwise stated in figure legends, were carried out using GraphPad Prism 9.
