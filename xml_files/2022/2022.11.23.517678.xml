To prevent viral infection and reduce viral spread, vaccine strategies must elicit protective immunity in the airways. FcRn transfers IgG across epithelial barriers; we explore FcRn-mediated respiratory delivery of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S). A monomeric IgG Fc was fused to a stabilized S protein; the resulting S-Fc bound to S-specific antibodies (Ab) and FcRn. A significant increase in Ab responses was observed following the intranasal immunization of mice with S-Fc formulated in CpG as compared to the immunization with S alone or PBS. Furthermore, we intranasally immunize adult or aged mice and hamsters with S-Fc. A significant reduction of virus replication in nasal turbinate, lung, and brain was observed following nasal challenges with SARS-CoV-2, including Delta and Omicron variants. Intranasal immunization also significantly reduced viral transmission between immunized and naive hamsters. Protection was mediated by nasal IgA, serum-neutralizing Abs, tissue-resident memory T cells, and bone marrow S-specific plasma cells. Hence FcRn delivers an S-Fc antigen effectively into the airway and induces protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Based on these findings, FcRn-targeted non-invasive respiratory immunizations are superior strategies for preventing highly contagious respiratory viruses from spreading.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>mucosal</kwd><kwd>nasal</kwd><kwd>FcRn</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>hamster</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">SARS-CoV-2, a virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic, is highly infectious and circulates rapidly worldwide, and mutates constantly. The SARS-CoV-2 variants include Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529). These variants evade the immunity induced by vaccinations and infections. Through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike (S) protein, SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein undergoes a structural change upon binding and is cleaved by host proteases, such as the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), allowing it to fuse with the cellular membrane for host cell entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Because of its vital role in mediating receptor binding and infection initiation, the S protein is the primary target for developing vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">SARS-CoV-2 can be shed from individuals with asymptomatic infections and spread predominantly through droplets and airborne aerosols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The virus first enters the nose or mouth and replicates within epithelial cells of the nasopharynx, causing an upper respiratory infection. Hence, the nasal mucosa and nasopharynx are the primary sites of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 before dissemination to the lungs and other tissues/organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> .The currently authorized intramuscular vaccines can effectively prevent severe diseases and deaths caused by COVID-19. However, they are unable to effectively elicit protective mucosal immunity in the upper respiratory tract <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. This shortcoming allows opportunistic breakthrough infections in those who received vaccinations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Hence, the SARS-CoV-2 can linger in the nasal mucosa even after clearing infection in the lungs in vaccinated individuals. The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially the Omicron, exacerbates the situation. This ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 necessitates a safe and protective mucosal vaccine to block the viral entry and reduce or eliminate the viral spread, thus, prevent lung and systemic infection and breakthrough infection. Nasal-spray vaccines can elicit local secretory IgA antibodies and resident T and B cell responses in the upper respiratory tract and the lungs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract form a mucosal barrier. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binds to the Fc portion of IgG and mediates the transfer of IgG across the epithelial cells, a function essential to IgG distribution and homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Typically, FcRn shows a pH-dependent IgG binding, with a preference to bind IgG at acidic pH (6.0 – 6.5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Generally, the FcRn-IgG on the cell surface or in the endosome under acidic conditions goes through a non-degradative vesicular transport pathway within epithelial cells. Consequently, FcRn transports its bound IgG across the mucosal barrier and then releases it into the lumen or submucosa upon exposure to physiological pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Through binding, FcRn also extends the halflife of IgG by reducing lysosomal degradation in cells, such as endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The vaccine must be administered locally in the respiratory tract to establish respiratory immunity with resident memory of T and B cells in the lungs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> .In this study, we determined the ability of FcRn to deliver an intranasally-administered SARS-CoV-2 S antigen and induce protective mucosal and systemic immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We defined protective immune responses and mechanisms relevant to this nasal vaccination in the mouse and hamster models. Our results show that FcRn-mediated nasal delivery of a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S antigen induces secretory IgA Abs in the nasal lavage and high levels of long-lasting Ab and T-cell responses. We found that our nasal vaccine conferred durable protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Expression and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 S-Fc fusion proteins</title><p id="P6">To target antigen to FcRn, we expressed a monomeric human IgG1 Fc fused to a prefusion-stabilized, soluble form of S, which contained an R685A mutation at the furin cleavage site, an R816A mutation at S2’ cleavage site, and 2P conversions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) along with the T4 fibritin trimerization domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. We also removed the C1q binding site in IgG1 Fc.</p><p id="P7">We showed that the soluble S or S-Fc protein was secreted from the stable CHO cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Since IgG only binds to FcRn at acidic pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, we determined if the S-Fc portion binds to FcRn at either pH 6.0 or 7.4. As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, S-Fc interaction with both human (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) and mouse (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) FcRn/β2m was detected at pH 6.0 condition. Since hamster FcRn/β2m is not available, we produced a biotinylated hamster FcRn/β2m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Fig. 1d</xref>). We found the S-Fc bound to hamster FcRn/β2m similar to human or mouse FcRn/β2m did (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). However, the binding of the S to human, mouse, or hamster FcRn/β2m protein was barely detectable (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). To further show whether the S-Fc binds to FcγRI (CD64), we also produced biotinylated hamster FcγRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Fig. 1e</xref>). As expected, the S protein did not bind to mouse, human, or hamster FcγRI (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, the S-Fc, human IgG1, or hamster IgG2 could bind human or hamster FcγRI similarly in an ELISA assay. However, the S-Fc did not bind mouse FcγRI with high affinity (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), although mouse IgG was shown to bind mouse FcγRI strongly. This result could be explained by the fact that human IgG1 does not interact with mouse FcγRI with high affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">We next determined if the S portion of the S-Fc binds to human ACE-2. In an ELISA assay, the S-Fc and S protein bound human ACE-2 similarly (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>), indicating the Fc fusion doesn’t affect the conformation of S in the S-Fc protein. As a negative control, RSV F protein with or without Fc-fusion did not bind to human ACE-2 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). In contrast to an RSV-F specific mAb (D25), the S-Fc could not bind to human or mouse C1q protein (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>) in <italic>vitro.</italic> We further wanted to know if the S portion of the S-Fc interacts with convalescent serum Abs compared to the S alone. Normal human sera from the different healthy donors were used as a negative control. Indeed, the sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Fig. 2a</xref>) were able to equivalently recognize both purified S-Fc <italic>(solid lines</italic>) and S <italic>(dashed lines</italic>) protein, showing varying binding efficiencies. Most importantly, S-Fc and S showed the same levels of binding for each tested serum sample, indicating Fc-fusion with S didn’t alter its conformation. Normal sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Fig. 2b</xref>) from healthy individuals showed no binding activity. The results were further confirmed by the interactions of both S-Fc and S with various spike-specific mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Fig. 2c, d</xref>). Together, the S portion of the S-Fc protein maintains the correct conformational structure allowing for binding to the ACE-2 and S-specific Abs and also possesses the function to engage with FcRn and human or hamster FcγR1.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>FcRn-dependent respiratory immunization significantly enhances Spike-specific immune responses</title><p id="P9">We tested whether FcRn-dependent transport augments the immune responses to S protein.

To determine whether antigen targeting to FcRn also elicited plasma cells that secreted S-specific Abs, the number of IgG-secreting plasma cells in the bone marrow was measured 8 months after the boost by ELISpot. High numbers of S-specific IgG-secreting cells were present in the bone marrow of mice immunized with S-Fc compared with other groups (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>, <italic>p&lt;0.05).</italic> To show whether increased IgG-secreting plasma cells correspond to a rise in Ab production and maintenance, IgG Abs in the sera were measured 8 months after the boost.

Immunization with the S-Fc was more effective than immunization with S alone, indicating that S-specific Abs persisted much longer after FcRn-targeted mucosal immunization. Overall, our data demonstrate that an Fc-fused, soluble, prefusion-stabilized S protein delivered through FcRn is much more potent in triggering S-specific Ab responses.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Intranasal vaccination by the S-Fc leads to increased protection against infection by the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice</title><p id="P11">Human ACE2 transgenic mice are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 intranasal challenges when high virus doses are used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In the study, hACE2 mice were i.n. immunized with 10 μg of S-Fc or PBS in 10 μg CpG and boosted in a 2- week interval (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). We confirmed that significantly higher titers of serum IgG (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, P&lt;0.0001) and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, P&lt;0.01) were detected in the hACE2 mice i.n. immunized with the S-Fc when compared with PBS-treated mice. To test whether the immune responses elicited by the intranasal (i.n.) vaccination with the S-Fc provide protection, we i.n. challenged all immunized mice with a lethal dose (2.5 X 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>) of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus 2-3 weeks after the boost (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Mice were monitored and weighed daily for 14 days. All mice in the control groups exhibited rapid weight loss following the challenge, either succumbing to infection within 8 days post-infection (dpi) or subjecting to euthanasia. In contrast, the S-Fc-immunized mice did not experience significant body-weight loss (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>) and they had full protection with significantly higher survival rates (100%) than those of the PBS control group (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). As expected, all the PBS-treated mice had high virus loads in the lung at 5 dpi. In contrast, a significant reduction of virus load in the nasal turbinate (P&lt;0.0001), lungs (P&lt;0.0001), and brain tissue (P&lt;0.0001) were seen in the S-Fc immunized mice when compared to the control animals (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). Interestingly, brain tissues exhibited the highest levels of virus load in the PBS control mice at 5 dpi. Therefore, the S-Fc-immunized hACE2 mice essentially contained viral replication in tissues/organs of the viral entry and prevented the viral spreading to other tissues/organs. To further show protection, lungs were collected at 5 dpi for histopathological analysis. The lungs of uninfected mice were used as normal control (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). Prior to the virus challenge, no apparent alterations were observed in the lung structure and histology of the S-Fc immunized mice and normal mice, suggesting that the S-Fc did not induce inflammation. In contrast, we found focal inflammatory cell infiltration, pneumonia, peribronchiolitis, and perivasculitis in the lungs of PBS control mice after virus infection (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). The alveolitis was not observed. Hence, the mice immunized with S-Fc had a significantly lower inflammation score of the lungs compared with those of mice in the PBS group <italic>(<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref></italic>, P&lt;0.05). We also found that i.n. immunization with the S-Fc protected the aged hACE2 mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Fig. 4a-f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information A</xref>) and elicited durable protection in hACE2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Fig. 4g-j</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information B</xref>). These findings demonstrate that FcRn-mediated delivery of the S-Fc confers significant protection against lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge, resulting in decreased mortality, viral replication, and pulmonary inflammation in a hACE2 mouse model.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Intranasal vaccination with the S-Fc protein leads to protection against SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants</title><p id="P12">The SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly evolving via mutagenesis, which significantly impacts transmissibility, morbidity, reinfection, and mortality and lengthens the pandemic. Since the S portion of the S-Fc is derived from ancestral SARS-CoV-2, we were interested in determining the effectiveness and neutralizing activity elicited by the S-Fc vaccine against both Delta and Omicron variants. First, we i.n. immunized hACE2 mice twice with 10 μg of S-Fc adjuvanted in 10 μg CpG (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) and tested the protection against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta strain. The majority of the immunized mice developed nAbs against the Delta strain after the boost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Fig. 3e</xref>, p&lt;0.01). To show protection, we challenged all immunized mice with a lethal dose (2.5 x 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>) of the Delta strain 17 days after the boost. All mice in the control group experienced rapid weight loss (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), labor breathing, and ataxia, and finally died from the viral infection, or were euthanized for humanity. In contrast, the S-Fc-immunized hACE2 mice did not show significant body-weight loss (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) or clinical signs. The majority (83.3%) of the S-Fc-immunized mice survived, which was significantly higher than the survival rates of the PBS control groups, where all mice died from Delta virus infection (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Further, we measured viral replication in the nasal turbinate, lung, and brain tissues 6 DPI (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). We were able to detect live Delta virus in the nasal turbinate, lung, and brain tissues of the PBS control mice, but failed to find any live virus in the nasal turbinate and lung tissues of the S-Fc-immunized animals (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). For brain samples, only one mouse in the S-Fc-immunized group showed the reduced virus load, while the others had no virus detected. Additionally, no prominent inflammation was observed in the lungs of the S-Fc immunized mice. In contrast, focal perivascular and peribronchial inflammation and thickened alveolar septa were found in the lung of PBS control mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). The mice immunized with S-Fc had a significantly lower inflammatory score compared with those of mice in the challenged animals in PBS control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Fig. 3f</xref>, P&lt;0.01).</p><p id="P13">Interestingly, three i.n. immunizations were necessary to produce the Omicron-specific nAbs in the sera of the majority of mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f, g</xref>). Very likely, the Omicron strain possesses abundant mutations in its S protein, implicating that Omicron can escape nAbs elicited by the ancestral S protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Noticeably, when the S-Fc immunized mice were challenged with a dose (1 X 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>) of the Omicron A.1 strain after 2nd boost, there was no difference in visual clinical symptoms and body-weight loss between the S-Fc-immunized and the PBS control mice throughout the experiments (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>), which can be attributed to the low virulence of Omicron strain in mice. We did not find any live Omicron virus in nasal turbinate and brain tissues (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i, j</xref>) in all S-Fc-immunized mice at 4 and 6 dpi. For lung tissues, the live Omicron virus was only identified in 2 mice immunized with S-Fc at 4 dpi at low levels (around 1030 and 22 folds of virus reduction compared to the average virus titer in PBS groups) but not 6 dpi, indicating the limited virus replication in these mice. Furthermore, we found a dramatically decreased inflammation in the lung of the S-Fc immunized mice compared with the PBS control mice who had apparent focal perivascular and peribronchial inflammation. Overall, in contrast to the ancestral and Delta strains, infection of the Omicron A.1 in mice did not cause body-weight loss and mortality. However, the S-Fc nasal immunization remarkably attenuated replication of the Omicron variant in the respiratory tract and the brain, and resulted in substantially reduced lung inflammation in the hACE2 mice.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Intranasal immunization with the S-Fc protein induces local immune responses and abrogates SARS-CoV-2 viral replications in the respiratory tract</title><p id="P14">Because SARS-CoV-2 initiates its infection in the upper respiratory tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, it is critical for a nasal vaccine to elicit anti-viral IgA Abs in the nasal secretions and BAL of the lung. First, to determine the ability of the respiratory immunization by the S-Fc to induce local humoral immune responses. We examined S-specific Abs in mucosal secretions, which were compared to those of mice that received intramuscular (i.m.) immunization with the same amount of the S-Fc and CpG (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). The nasal washes and BAL were collected 14 days following the boost and analyzed for S-specific IgA and IgG by ELISA.

The present study produced several lines of evidence. First, the S-Fc-immunized mice had higher IgG and IgA Abs in nasal washes, BAL, and blood, compared with those immunized by S alone or FcRn KO mice immunized by S-Fc. Also, the S-Fc-immunized mice exhibited stronger nAb activity relative to the control animals. Second, as opposed to the PBS control animals, hamsters or hACE2-transgenic mice i.n. immunized by S-Fc developed resistance to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection, exhibiting reduced virus replication in the nasal turbinate, lung, and mouse brain. We detected high levels of live virus in the brain of the infected unimmunized hACE2 mice but not in the infected hamsters. This discrepancy may be explained by the expression level and localization of human ACE2 in transgenic animals. For example, hamsters expressing human ACE2 also have high virus titers detected in the brain following exposure to SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Third, the S-Fc-immunized, hACE2 mice displayed excellent protection against infections by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta or Omicron variants. An additional booster is required to protect hACE2 mice from Omicron infection completely. However, this is not surprising because Omicron variants possess many mutations in its S protein and are shown to be resistant to immune responses elicited by the S protein from the ancestral strain. Likewise, to induce broad nAbs against the Omicron strain, it is evident that two boosters are also required for the mRNA vaccination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Fourth, remarkably, most S-Fc-immunized animals exhibited significantly reduced inflammation in the lungs of hACE2 mice. Finally, in the transmission study, in striking contrast to the PBS-immunized hamsters or hamsters immunized by the i.m. route, most i.n. S-Fc immunized hamsters that were infected with the virus did not spread the virus to unimmunized hamsters. Similarly, most i.n. s-Fc immunized hamsters were not infected with the virus spreading from the infected unimmunized hamsters. Our study demonstrates that respiratory mucosal immunization with S-Fc is essential to generating protective immunity against infection and transmission by the SARS-CoV-2 viruses in preclinical studies.</p><p id="P21">Several mechanisms may account for protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. FcRn bounds S-Fc in acidic pH conditions. A slightly acidic pH in the respiratory tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> is expected to facilitate FcRn to retain antigens in airway mucosal surfaces and transfer them across the airway barrier, as shown by our previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and others <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> . The local Ab immune responses can represent a primary barrier of immune defense against viral infections of the respiratory tract, characterized by the presence of sIgA in the nasal mucosa or IgG in the BAL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The natural SARS-CoV-2 infection induces mucosal sIgA, which dominates the early nAb response to SARS-CoV-2 with potent neutralizing activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the levels of mucosal Abs determine the viral load and the amount of time required to recover from systemic symptoms. In this study, the mice and hamsters that were i.n. immunized by S-Fc developed high levels of IgA Abs in the nasal washes and BAL. These results are consistent with the findings of previous studies where FcRn-targeted respiratory immunizations against viral mucosal infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and adenovirus-vectored SARS-CoV-2 nasal vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> elicit high Ab responses. In addition, the mice or hamsters i.m. immunized by S-Fc failed to produce significantly high levels of IgA Abs in the nasal washes, despite high IgG Abs in the BAL. A robust SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasal turbinates is readily detectable after the adoptive transfer of the nAbs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. This observation is further supported by our findings that hACE2 mice succumb to nasal infection following an adoptive transfer of serum Abs from i.n. immunized mice by S-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Fig. 9</xref>). Indeed, i.m. vaccination fails to significantly reduce viral load in nasal swabs or nasal turbinate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Considering SARS-CoV-2 also infects cells via a cell-to-cell fashion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, it may be difficult for serum IgG Abs to block viral entry and spread in the upper respiratory tract, or a high level of IgG Abs is required.</p><p id="P22">FcRn-mediated respiratory delivery of vaccine antigen facilitates the production of memory immune responses. The induction of S-specific memory immune responses is crucial for a vaccine to provide sustained protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The S- or RBD-specific nasal Abs can last for at least 9 months in COVID-19 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. FcRn-mediated respiratory vaccination with S-Fc induces and sustains high levels of S-specific IgA and IgG and plasma cells 8 months after the boost, which they resist lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 6 months after the boost. TRM T cells in the lung can promote rapid viral clearance at the site of infection and mediate survival against lethal viral infections, especially in severe COVID patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Our study demonstrated that a higher percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> TRM T cells were present in the lungs of mice that received i.n. S-Fc immunization than in those of PBS control animals. Furthermore, the i.n immunization induced significantly more lung-resident TRM cells than the i.m. route. This is consistent with previous findings by directly delivering viral antigens into the airway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Additionally, FcRn prolongs IgG half-life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.

Likely, TRM T cells are particularly critical against the SARS-CoV-2 variants that undergo rapid mutations and evade antibody immunity. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the duration that these TRM T and B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> may persist in the lung and how they contribute toward long-term protection against the SARS-CoV-2 variants. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> TRM cells persist for at least two months after viral clearance in the nasal mucosa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">Several rationales could explain the rise in breakthrough infections, two of which are most likely. First, i.m. vaccination couldn’t effectively induce local immunity in the respiratory mucosa. Indeed, the i.n., but not i.m., immunizations with S-Fc induce nasal IgA and TRM T cells in the lung. Second, individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 through the nasal epithelial cells can asymptomatically shed the infectious virus for an unknown time. Hence, we envision the nasal vaccination as an essential complementary strategy to the i.m. vaccines that are authorized or undergoing clinical trials. Because FcRn can transfer the immune complexes across the mucosal epithelial barrier with or without pre-existing Abs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, we do not expect that the efficacy of the FcRn-targeted mucosal vaccination is influenced by pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity. The FcRn-targeted nasal vaccine can be used for an unimmunized first dose or booster for those who have been immunized, even previously infected by SARS-CoV-2. The combination of mucosal and parenteral vaccines has been proven effective at mucosal entry against SARS-CoV-2 infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P24">In addition to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, some symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, including those with breakthrough infections, are reported to experience a long COVID <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. The exact causes of the long COVID-19 are elusive; they may involve direct effects of viral infection or indirect influences on the brain. In humans, the nasal olfactory epithelium expresses a high level of ACE2 receptor. Although it is debatable, SARS-CoV-2 may enter the brain by crossing the neural-mucosal interface in olfactory mucosa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> or infecting the olfactory epithelium or bulb, or both<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 is identified to replicate in brain astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Alternatively, inflammatory cytokines derived from inflamed lungs or other organs may cross the blood-brain barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Consequently, a virus or cytokine may cause encephalitis or necrosis, leading to a long COVID. The hACE2 mice are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection with the virus detected in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Our study confirms this fact and further shows that FcRn-mediated respiratory vaccination can prevent brain viral infection in hACE2 mice. Likely, the sIgA or TRM T cells induced by S-Fc can efficiently block the viral replication in nasal turbinates, resulting in reduced viral infection in the olfactory epithelium or access to the olfactory bulb.</p><p id="P25">Taken together, we developed a respiratory vaccine using pre-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S antigen that stimulates local and systemic protective immunity. Our working model states that FcγR-expressing mucosal antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells, take up the FcRn-transported spike and subsequently migrate to mediastinal lymph nodes where they prime the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and initiate the cognate B cell response in the germinal centers. By increasing the persistence of the S-Fc in tissue and circulation, the vaccination may further enhance the development of long-term humoral and cellular immunity. The substantially longer half-life of IgG in humans compared to mice or hamsters (21 vs. 6 days) would ensure high and persisting levels of S-Fc in human immunization. Also, the S-Fc and human IgG1 had a lower affinity to the mouse FcγRI, but it exhibits a high affinity with human FcγRI (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), suggesting our S-Fc vaccine may work more efficiently in humans. Although the i.n. administered viral vaccines induce protection in the respiratory tracts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, a protein-based nasal vaccine may be preferred, especially in young, elderly, and immunocompromised populations.

To produce a non-cleavable S protein, we performed mutagenesis at the cleavage site S1/S2 (R685A) and S2’(R816A) of the S gene to keep the S protein in a pre-cleavage conformation. On the surface of coronaviruses, S glycoprotein exists predominantly in the prefusion form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. A prefusion structure of SARS-CoV-2 S is critical for maximizing immunogenicity. To produce a prefusion form of S antigen, we made a pair of point mutations to proline (K986P and V987P) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, which prevents the formation of a helix associated with the post-fusion conformation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The S protein also naturally exists as a trimer on the virions or virally infected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. To facilitate the trimerization of soluble S protein, we engineered a foldon domain from T4 bacteriophage fibritin protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> to the C-terminus of the extracellular domain of the S (residues 1-1213) gene to facilitate the trimerization. To target FcRn for delivery, we selected human IgG1 Fc. The rationale for using human IgG1 is consistent with the fact that it has the highest affinity for activating FcγRI, but the lowest affinity for inhibiting FcγRIIB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. In IgG1 Fc, the complement C1q-binding motif was eliminated (E318A/K320A/K322A)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) to prevent the binding of human and mouse C1q.
