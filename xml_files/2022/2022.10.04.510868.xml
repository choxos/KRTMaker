Modern medicine has moved towards the mimicking and regenerations of such systems both with in vitro models and therapies. Although researchers have now an increased repertoire of cell types and bio-physical cues to generate increasingly complex in vitro models, the inclusion of novel biomaterials in such systems has been negligible, with most approaches relying on scaffold-free self-assembling strategies. However, the rapid development of functional biomaterials and fabrication technologies - such as electroconductive scaffolds – warrants consideration and inclusion of materials, with recent evidence supporting the benefit of incorporating electrically active materials and their influence on the maturation of cardiac cells and tissues. In order to be manipulated in bioreactor systems, scaffold-based in vitro models require bespoke rig and bioreactors that vary from those commonly used for scaffold-free systems. In this work, we detail methods to rapid prototype an electrical pacing bioreactor and R3S - a Rig for Stimulation of Sponge-like Scaffolds. As a proof of concept and validation we demonstrate that these systems are compatible with isotropic and anisotropic porous scaffolds composed of collagen or poly(<italic>3,4</italic>-ethylene dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). External pacing of C3H10 cells on anisotropic porous scaffolds led to a metabolic increase and enhanced cell alignment. This setup has been designed for pacing and simultaneously live tracking of in vitro models. This platform has wide suitability for the study of electrical pacing of cellularized scaffolds in 3D in vitro cultures.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>biomaterials</kwd><kwd>electroconductive biomaterials</kwd><kwd>cardiac tissue engineering</kwd><kwd>polymer chemistry</kwd><kwd>organoid generation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Bioreactors are controllable dynamic systems used to recapitulate biophysical stimuli, scale up cultures in vitro to generate sufficient numbers of therapeutic cells, growth factors, proteins and hormones, and study physiological responses ex vivo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Such stimuli include strain and stress, pressure, flow, and the subject focus of this paper: electrical pacing. Pacing is a method commonly used with engineered heart tissues derived from primary cardiomyocytes and cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent stem cell sources <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, neural applications in the case of neuronal cultures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, and skeletal muscle cultures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. More recently, the use of electrical pacing has been explored in non-traditional tissues such as skin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, bone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and immune cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Many electric field-based systems investigate cells embedded in fibrin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> or collagen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> gels, in the form of tubules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, rings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> or patches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Engineered tissues are also often generated using biologically-derived hydrogels, typically based on fibrin or collagen, enabling spontaneous self-assembly, and has been applied to the generation of engineered heart tissues since 1997 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. For example, engineered heart tissues are often incorporated into bioreactors capable of delivering diverse cues (e.g. shear rate, mechanical constrain, electrical stimulation), and these stimuli have been shown to support the maturation of induced pluripotent derived cardiomyocyte (iPSC-CMs) cells towards more adult-like phenotypes with functionality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. In particular, electrical pacing can synchronise cell beating with an effect similar to the action potential generated in the sinoatrial node, and it can also be used to tune the beating frequency of the engineered heart tissues itself <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and study inherited genetic defects in engineered heart tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">A less explored strategy in engineered tissues subjected to electric field stimulation is seeding cells onto a pre-existing preformed scaffold, possessing a predefined geometry and stiffness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Due to simplicity of fabrication, many researchers have focussed on the scaffold-free self-assembling method, most recently with the generation of a human-size engineered heart tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. A possible reason for the lack of scaffold-based strategies is the repertoire of materials and constructs available such as collagen sponges <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> or polylactic acid fibrous scaffolds <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The burgeoning progress of electroconductive biomaterials, especially conjugated polymers (CPs), may impact this trend and rationalise scaffold use for engineered tissues in vitro.

While their use as 2D substrates in cardiac tissue engineering is gathering momentum <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, the inclusion of electroconductive materials into engineered tissues has yet to be fully exploited. The use of porous scaffolds with predefined microarchitecture could directly influence cell response, in particular their spatial orientation. In the case of a highly anisotropic tissues such as myocardium, muscle or nerve fibres, microarchitecture can guide the alignment of cells along the direction of contraction and their fusion into structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Material stiffness is another physical property known to play a significant role, in promoting the differentiation of progenitor cells towards a desired progeny <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In this work, we describe the development of an in-house electric field bioreactor system for use with prefabricated porous scaffolds for 3D electric-field stimulation.

This in-house bioreactor is capable of applying electrical pacing to monolayer cell cultures as well as to 3D constructs and its construction and design is documented in detail. Furthermore, we conceptualised and manufactured R3S (Rig for the Stimulation of Sponge-like Scaffolds); an in vitro platform designed to maintain scaffolds suspended in media in the same location, while enabling free-contraction of the cell laden constructs and simultaneously providing optical accessibility for both standard and inverted microscopy. This is achieved using custom-made grips incorporated into this platform. We report validation of this system using a C3H10 cell line and demonstrate that scaffold morphology and electrical pacing play a synergistic role on the proliferation and metabolism of cells. Moreover, C3H10 cells preferentially aligned along the direction of the electric field even in the absence of an anisotropic substrate.</p><p id="P7">Here we provide detailed methods on the fabrication and assembly of this bioreactor system.

A schematic representation of the setup is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. A set of twelve 22 mm long cylindrical carbon electrodes were cut from a 3 mm large carbon rod (Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd, UK) and a 1 mm large hole was drilled at one end, through which a platinum-iridium wire (Advent Research Materials Ltd, UK) was tied. A mould, consisting of a top and a bottom component (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), was 3D printed to allocate twelve electrodes and, once the two components were sealed together, PDMS Sylgard™ 184 was introduced in the mould.

To promote the adhesion of cultured cells to the scaffolds and implement a level of standardisation during assembly of the R3S system, a detailed seeding protocol was optimised. The seeding chambers were fabricated with agarose, and cells were suspended and delivered within a weak Matrigel™ mix (1:1 ratio mixed with cell suspension in media) which undergoes a rapid sol/gel transition. The rationale for this seeding is that the assembly of R3S involves a compression manoeuvre by the elastomeric bars on the scaffolds, as well as permanent suspension of the scaffolds in a floating, stable position at constant distance from the bottom of the plate. These factors may hinder cell delivery to the scaffolds and subsequent seeding density. At day 1, DNA content between groups seeded with C3H10 with standard media in a PDMS mould or in R3S was comparable, and no statistical difference was found between the different scaffold types, confirming that the use of the Matrigel™ mix (1:1) led to a successful seeding yield (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). Samples seeded with C3H10 in R3S were then studied up to seven days, applying electrical pacing with this in-house bioreactor and their performance compared to day 3. Electrical cues have the potential to ameliorate cell performance and influence differentiation fate, however, the application of an improper electrical signal can drive uneven electric field distribution, excess of ions with generation of by-products, all eventually leading to detrimental effect on cell viability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Pacing patterns, pulse duration, peak intensity, pulse frequency, and duration of the pacing session are all key players in the effective delivery of pacing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In particular, the adoption of a biphasic pulse instead of monophasic has shown to reduce the risk of by-products production by limiting the formation of nonreversible-Faradaic reactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The choice of a biphasic pulsatile stimulation and 1-hour long training sessions have been implemented with a conservative approach to preserve cell wellbeing and prevent excessive production of potentially harmful redox oxygen species. The findings presented here are proof that such choices successfully maintained cells viability and provides sufficient signalling cues to obtain a positive effect on their activity As demonstrated by quantification of live/dead imaging, fibroblasts remained viable at both day 3 and 7, with no difference between collagen alone, or PEDOT:PSS-based sponges, with or without electrical pacing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). From the mosaic micrographs, cells were clearly distributed homogeneously across the scaffolds, with the exception of the terminal regions, corresponding to the sites of anchorage with the elastomeric bars. Here, the elastomeric bars held the scaffold ends without breaking them, and by day 7 a plastic compression of the scaffolds occurred together with less cell presence. The use of elastomeric bars is meant to not only simplify the assembly sequence, but also to maintain scaffolds in a free-floating location in the media. Moreover, acting as flexible constrains with known stiffness, these bars are particularly important for application of this rig with mechanically dynamic and contracting cells such as those from the cardiac or skeletal muscles. Indeed, monitoring and quantification of the beating of these cells are a crucial towards the understanding of their physiology. Real-time monitoring during the experiment will enables the indirect quantification of the in vitro models, for example the frequency of contraction or derivatisation twitch forces generated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-iii</xref>). DNA quantification verified cell proliferation within all groups, with trends of increased proliferation for paced groups when compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5.A</xref>). Similar results were obtained for the analysis of cell metabolism; in particular, cells on paced anisotropic scaffolds demonstrated significant increases in metabolism compared to all collagen and isotropic groups, suggesting a benefit on cell performance by the synergistic effect of an anisotropic morphology and the external pacing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5.B</xref>).</p><p id="P29">In terms of cell morphology, no major qualitative difference was observed; when focussing on cell orientation as it related to nuclei orientation, it could be observed that cells aligned along the lamellae of the anisotropic scaffolds already from day 3 and they maintained such directionality up to day 7. As anticipated, cells on collagen or isotropic substrates did not have any preferential alignment at either day 3 or at day 7 without pacing, however this alignment adopted preferentially in parallel to the electric field of those samples that were subject to electrical pacing. While more studies are necessary to further validate and finalise the present results, here it is confirmed that orientation of C3H10 cell line can be influenced by either scaffold geometry or external pacing and indeed this bioreactor system facilitates this, similar to other cell types such as neural stem cells PC-12 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and H9C2 rat cardiomyoblast <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Such is alignment hypothesized to be based on mechanisms that include voltage-gated ion channels, G-protein coupling receptors, integrins, cell polarization, and endogenous electric fields <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="conclusions"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P30">In this work we explain the design, fabrication, and validation of an electrical pacing bioreactor and of a Rig for Stimulation of Sponge-like Scaffolds (R3S) which allows for real time monitoring of these such systems. These can be manufactured inexpensively and in a scalable manner using rapid prototyping. The development of electroconductive scaffolds and electric-field stimulation models in vitro model is becoming increasingly pursued by researchers, there is a need for systems that can combine these two elements and often on that is easy (and cheap) to fabricate.</p><p id="P31">This system is not just limited to use with 3D porous scaffolds, and the electrical pacing bioreactor can be used to pace monolayer cultures, and the optical accessibility of the system enables an assessment of chemotaxis or electrotaxis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. We presented an assembly sequence that is suitable for scaffolds generated with multiple material types and potentially different manufacturing techniques. The impact and validation of this platform is clear. When applying external pacing to C3H10 cells no detrimental effect on cell viability was observed, while a synergistic increase in metabolism and cell orientation was found with the combination of anisotropic scaffolds and pacing. Pacing was instrumental in cell alignment whether platforms were conductive, anisotropically aligned; or not. This system opens up great opportunity to study the interplay between cells and a wider repertoire of biomaterials that are prefabricated and predesigned, while observing the movement and contraction of these cellularised tissues in vitro.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"
