Over the last decade, CRISPR-Cas systems have emerged as the preferred system for the installation of targeted mutations, mainly due to their high efficiency and ease of use. CRISPR nucleases, such as Cas9 or Cas12a, can be programmed by guide RNAs (gRNAs) to create DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at defined genomic loci, which are resolved by error-prone endogenous DNA repair pathways, thereby creating mutations at the target site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. A pervasive shortcoming of this strategy is the uncontrollable nature of the induced DNA alterations, which are typically dominated by short insertions and deletions (indels)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, but also include large indels and genomic rearrangements at significant frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Typically, not all of the induced mutations have the desired effect. For example, small in-frame indels are often functionally silent when induced in the coding sequence of a gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> and larger deletions and rearrangements can cause false-positive phenotypes by affecting genes other than the target. Therefore, methods that can efficiently generate precise mutations would offer advantages for gene inactivation experiments.</p><p id="P4">CRISPR base editors are fusion proteins of a Cas9 nickase linked to a deaminase domain and can be used to install defined point mutations in the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Cytosine base editors (CBEs) create C-to-T edits through i) R-loop formation, ii) deamination of cytosine residues in the single-stranded, non-target DNA strand by a cytidine deaminase to convert cytosine to uracil, and iii) propagation of the edit through DNA repair and/or cell division (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A-B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. DNA deamination occurs in a specific interval within the R-loop, called the editing window. As a result, cytosines other than the target residue are likely to be edited if they are present within the editing window<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. While these so-called bystander edits are often problematic when the aim is to install or correct missense variants, CBE-based gene inactivation strategies, such as converting codons encoding amino acids into stop codons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> or mutating splice sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, are generally not limited by the occurrence of bystander edits.</p><p id="P5">Predictable loss-of-function mutations introduced by base editing could circumvent some of the limitations associated with random mutations introduced by CRISPR nucleases, provided that they are installed with high efficiency and minimal undesired byproducts. However, several shortcomings and uncertainties exist. First, while CBEs and other base editors have been extensively optimised for expression, nuclear localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and activity of the deaminase domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, loss-of-function experiments aiming to create biallelic gene knock-outs in all cells of a multicellular tissue or organism require particularly high editing rates, which remain difficult to attain with base editors in various systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. This may at least partially be due to the fact that genome editing tools are typically developed and optimised in immortalised mammalian cell lines, which differ from many other systems relevant for research and biotechnology in parameters such as temperature and composition of DNA repair pathways. Second, while CBEs predominantly give rise to predictable C-to-T edits in the editing window, they are also known to cause random indel mutations through error-prone repair of abasic sites that arise from uracil removal by Uracil-N-Glycosylases (UNG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, a process which can only partially be suppressed through UNG inhibitor domains (UGIs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Induction of such random indels limits the ability of CBEs to avoid undesirable editing products.</p><p id="P6"><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is one of the most widely used model organisms in biomedical research, largely due to the availability of sophisticated genetic tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Over the years, genetic research in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has uncovered numerous fundamental and evolutionary conserved principles governing the biology of multicellular animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Despite these efforts, functionally validated null alleles are still not available for the majority of genes encoded in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In recent years, large collections of CRISPR gRNA lines have been generated that can be used in conjunction with Cas9 nuclease to induce targeted mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, but these suffer from the aforementioned limitations of random mutagenesis. So far, only a single study has reported on the use of a first-generation base editor in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which was shown to induce C-to-T edits in less than half of the tested genomic target sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Whether optimized base editors can lead to more robust editing in this organism remains to be explored.</p><p id="P7">Here, we establish CBEs for gene inactivation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and uncover crucial parameters influencing the performance of these tools. While the efficiencies obtained with a derivative of the most commonly used APOBEC1 domain were constrained by the temperature range tolerated by <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a domain derived from an ectothermic species living in cold to temperate environments permitted robust base editing with remarkably high efficiency. Using this CBE in combination with gRNA multiplexing we observed near homogenous biallelic gene inactivation in almost all tested target genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, we uncovered unusually high CBE product purity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which is likely attributable to the lack of a <italic>UNG</italic> gene in holometabola<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Our results highlight the usefulness of CBEs for gene inactivation in multicellular organisms, establish robust and highly efficient base editing tools for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and reveal so far underappreciated parameters that influence the activity and purity of base editing systems.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Generation of cytosine base editing tools</title><p id="P8">To explore CBE-mediated gene inactivation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we first constructed vectors for <italic>in vivo</italic> CBE expression. We utilised a Cas9<sup>D10A</sup> coding sequence previously shown to be well tolerated in <italic>Drosophila</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, linkers and bipartite nuclear localization signals (bpNLSs) from the optimised BE4max architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, as well as a UGI domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). To explore the properties of two distinct deaminases, we constructed CBEs featuring recently laboratory evolved versions of the APOBEC1 protein from <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> and the CDA1 protein from <italic>Petromyzon marinus</italic>, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (henceforth referred to as <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cytosine Base Editor<sup>evoAPOBEC1/evoCDA1</sup>, dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup> and dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup>).</p><p id="P9">For ubiquitous base editing, we cloned these editors downstream of the <italic>act5c</italic> promoter (<italic>pAct-dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup></italic> and <italic>pAct-dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>) and generated transgenic animals harbouring a genomic insertions of these constructs on a defined landing site on the second chromosome. Such animals were viable, fertile and without any obvious phenotypic abnormalities and can be maintained as a stable stock under standard conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>).

While expression under direct control of the <italic>act5C</italic> promoter is well tolerated, expression under the Gal4-UAS system, which is known to lead to substantial overexpression, can lead to undesired side effects. Even though dose dependent toxicity <italic>in vivo</italic> of the Cas9 nuclease alone has been previously observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, the effects of CBE overexpression observed here are more severe. Our finding that evoCDA1 is much better tolerated than evoAPOBEC1 suggests that the deaminase portion of the editors dictates tolerability and that CBE expression levels should be carefully controlled.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Differential temperature sensitivity of evoAPOBEC1 and evoCDA1 base editors</title><p id="P11">Next, we set out to assess the efficiency of CBE-mediated gene inactivation. To facilitate both phenotypic and genotypic readouts, we initially targeted a set of non-essential genes with well-characterised, visible and recessive <italic>null</italic> mutant phenotypes (<italic>ebony</italic> (<italic>e</italic>), <italic>singed</italic> (<italic>sn</italic>), <italic>forked</italic> (<italic>f</italic>) and <italic>sepia</italic> (<italic>se</italic>)). To this end, we utilised the previously described <italic>pCFD5</italic> vector to ubiquitously express pairs of gRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> designed to either mediate the conversion of codons coding for amino acids to STOP codons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> or to disrupt splice donor or acceptor sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> at two independent positions in each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). To establish optimal conditions for base editing in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we crossed males from four gRNA strains (one targeting <italic>se</italic>, two targeting <italic>e</italic> and one targeting <italic>sn</italic>) against <italic>pAct-dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup></italic> or <italic>pAct-dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup></italic> virgins ubiquitously expressing either CBE, raised the animals at various temperatures within the range used to maintain <italic>Drosophila</italic> (18°C, 24°C and 29°C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and assessed offspring phenotypically and by Illumina deep-sequencing of PCR amplicons (Amp-Seq) of the target sites.</p><p id="P12">We observed strong loss-of-function phenotypes when base editing was performed with dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup> at 29°C, with fully penetrant phenotypes observed with three gRNA strains and a mosaic phenotype with one strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, phenotypes were attenuated when animals were raised at 24°C and nearly absent at 18°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup> mediated fully-penetrant phenotypes resembling heritable, homozygous loss-of-function alleles in all instances at 29°C and 24°C. Surprisingly, even at 18°C animals developed phenotypes indicative of biallelic gene disruption in most or all of their body.</p><p id="P13">We then used amplicon sequencing to sensitively quantify mutations at the target site of each gRNA. Consistent with our phenotypic observations, we found a strong correlation between temperature and C-to-T editing rates with dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup>, but highly efficient editing at at least one target site across all conditions with dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). At the target residue C-to-T editing rates at 29°C with dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup> were 51.9±30% compared to 89.8±16.5% with dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup>, 29.7±20.3% compared to 82.4±26.5% at 24°C and 10.4±8.8% compared to 73.6±31.8% at 18°C. Summarising across all gRNAs and all C nucleotides within an editing window of positions 3-9 of the protospacer, base editing efficiency decreased an average of 5.7-fold from 29°C to 18°C with dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup>, but only 1.3-fold with dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), demonstrating that activity of the evoCDA1 deaminase domain is much less temperature sensitive at that range.</p><p id="P14">Together, these findings demonstrate that the evoAPOBEC1 domain functions suboptimally at the lower temperatures preferred by <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other ectothermic organisms, whereas evoCDA1 permits efficient base editing within this broad temperature range.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup> permits highly efficient biallelic gene inactivation <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P15">To further explore whether dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup> can mediate gene knock-out with high penetrance in somatic cells at a larger selection of target sites, we generated six additional pairs of gRNAs targeting the aforementioned non-essential genes as well as four pairs of gRNAs designed to create STOP codons in well-characterised essential genes (<italic>wg</italic>, <italic>ct, evi</italic> and <italic>smo</italic>).</p><p id="P16">In crosses targeting the non-essential genes at 29°C, <italic>pAct-dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup></italic> led to fully penetrant loss-of-function phenotypes in all but one instance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). In the case of <italic>f</italic><sup>SPLICE_a</sup>, where gRNAs target the splice acceptors of two small exons, we did not observe any phenotype indicating disruption of <italic>f</italic>. This could reflect inefficient base editing or result from biological compensation by exon skipping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). Excluding the former possibility, we observed highly efficient (90.0±2.25% and 90.0±1.36%) C-to-T conversion at the target residue of both gRNAs present in <italic>f</italic><sup>SPLICE_a</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Together these results demonstrate that dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup> mediates phenotypes with unusually high penetrance and robustness, but also highlights that the outcome of splice acceptor disruption is not always predictable (e.g. can for example lead to both intron retention or exon skipping), as has also previously been observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">In contrast to our results with dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup>, phenotypic outcomes resulting from editing with dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup> were much more heterogeneous. We observed fully penetrant phenotypes in three instances, mosaic phenotypes with five gRNA pairs and no detectable phenotype in two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). Sequencing of the gRNA target sites confirmed highly efficient C-to-T conversion of the target deoxycytidine with dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup>, but large variation in base editing efficiency at the target base as the underlying cause of variation in phenotypic penetrance with dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). We tested if a publicly available machine-learning model could predict which gRNAs support efficient editing with dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup>, but found only a modest and not statistically significant correlation between the Z-score predicted by the model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and the observed fraction of base-edited alleles at each target site (Pearson <italic>R</italic> = 0.34, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To determine the average base editing efficiency across the base editing window at 29°C with both editors, we calculated the averaged C-to-T conversion rates as a function of position in the protospacer. In line with previous reports for these deaminases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup> and dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup> exhibited editing windows of different size, spanning positions 3-9 and −1-14, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, defined as &gt; 10% median C-to-T editing efficiency). While dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup> achieved a maximal mean editing efficiency of 45.9%-53.5% at positions 4-6 of the protospacer, dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup> enabled highly robust C-to-T conversion of 88.3%-96.3% at the same positions of the target sites.</p><p id="P19">Next, we crossed the <italic>pAct-dCBE</italic> constructs to gRNA pairs targeting a set of essential genes (<italic>wg</italic>, <italic>smo</italic>, <italic>evi</italic> and <italic>ct</italic>). While <italic>dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup>/gRNA</italic> animals died during development, the known loss-of-function phenotype of these target genes, crosses with dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup> gave rise to viable offspring with wing malformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>), indicating inefficient mutagenesis. To confirm this, we stained wing imaginal discs from 3rd instar larvae from crosses targeting <italic>evi</italic> and <italic>smo</italic> for endogenous Evi and Smo protein and assayed the status of each target site by Sanger sequencing. While dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup> caused incomplete loss of protein expression in the wing disc and led to limited editing of the target residues, dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup> mediated almost complete ablation of Evi and Smo in all cells of the tissue and caused efficient C-to-T editing at the targeted C residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P20">A useful strategy to circumvent lethality when targeting essential genes is to restrict mutagenesis to the target tissue of interest. To investigate if base editing permits the tissue-selective inactivation of essential gene targets, we performed conditional mutagenesis in the wing imaginal disc by utilising the <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> driver, which is selectively expressed in the posterior compartment of this tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). We crossed <italic>pUAS-dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup>; hh-Gal4</italic> virgins to males expressing gRNAs targeted against either <italic>evi</italic> or <italic>smo</italic>, raised the animals at 29°C and performed immunofluorescence analysis on wing imaginal discs from 3rd instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Compared to control discs, dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup> expression caused some morphological abnormalities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary 7</xref>, white arrows), in line with our previous observations of overexpression-related toxicity. gRNA pairs targeting <italic>evi</italic> or <italic>smo</italic> resulted in ablation of the respective gene products in the posterior compartment only, with no signs of residual gene product in the targeted area nor evidence of ectopic mutagenesis in the non-targeted compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In summary, these results establish that dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup> in conjunction with two gRNAs enables highly efficient biallelic gene inactivation <italic>in vivo</italic>, with practically no unedited or function-retaining alleles, in both ubiquitous as well as tissue-specific settings.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Creating heritable alleles with base editing in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline</title><p id="P22">While a previous study established base editing with a first-generation CBE in <italic>Drosophila</italic> somatic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, germline transmission of base edits has thus far not been described. We reasoned that dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup> might be the preferred editor for germline transmission applications, as one typically screens several animals of the offspring, meaning intermediate editing efficiencies are sufficient, and a narrower editing window makes it more likely to recover precise edits at the target C without bystander edits.</p><p id="P23">We first performed a genetic complementation assay by crossing <italic>pAct-dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup>;pCFD5-2xgRNA</italic> males raised at 29°C to virgins harbouring homozygous null alleles in the targeted genes, and assessed the percentage of offspring inheriting two loss-of-function alleles and thus exhibiting the respective null mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). For all four assayed gRNA lines, we detected germline transmission rates that were in line with the somatic editing efficiencies we had observed previously (84%, 95%, 70% and 75% respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). To confirm that phenotypes were caused by the intended gene edits and to exclude unintended indel byproducts, which have been previously shown to occur with CBEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, we performed Sanger sequencing of the <italic>e</italic><sup>STOP_b</sup> and <italic>e</italic><sup>SPLICE</sup> target sites in phenotypic offspring to assess the identity of the transmitted edits.

The system is composed of genetically encoded CBEs and gRNAs to create premature stop codons or to disrupt splice sites. By combining a base editor featuring the evoCDA1 deaminase domain with high activity at temperatures below 30°C and multiplexing of two gRNAs targeting the same gene, biallelic knock-out alleles can be installed in most or all cells of the animal. Furthermore, the high product purity attainable with base editing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> minimises the generation of function-retaining alleles, further contributing to the very high efficiency of this system.</p><p id="P29">Efficiency of gene disruption experiments with CRISPR nucleases in bulk cell populations and entire organisms are usually curbed by limited gRNA activity and the generation of function-retaining mutations at the target site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Multiplex base editing presents a broadly applicable alternative to precisely install loss-of-function alleles. The generation of stop codons is hereby more widely applicable, as typically there are many more positions in a gene where it is possible to convert codons to stop codons than there are targetable splice sites, in particular in organisms with compact genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. For example, we were not able to design SPLICE gRNAs against the small <italic>se</italic> gene. Moreover, when targeting splice sites, splice acceptors of small exons should be avoided given the tendency to result in exon skipping, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and also evidenced by the <italic>f</italic><sup>SPLICE_a</sup> gRNAs in our study. In contrast, premature stop codons are expected to have severe functional consequences on gene function, in particular when placed in the 5’ portion of the gene, where they are also more likely to cause nonsense mediated mRNA decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. However, the possibility of stop codon read-through and functionality of polypeptides encoded 5’ of the first base edited allele should be considered when designing and analysing such experiments. For both strategies, computational tools are available for the identification of suitable gRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> (see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). Notably, such gRNAs can in many cases also be used in combination with existing Cas9 nucleases to create mutations by error-prone double strand break repair, should both NHEJ and base-editing mediated gene disruption be of interest.</p><p id="P30">Our work reveals the crucial role of temperature in determining base editing efficiency with different CBEs. While the evoAPOBEC1 deaminase domain shows rapidly declining activity at temperatures below 30°C, evoCDA1 is better adapted to this temperature range, likely reflecting the fact that these deaminase domains originate from an endothermic and ectothermic organism, respectively. While the fact that different enzymes are optimised for different temperatures is generally recognized, temperature is rarely a tested parameter during the development of novel gene editing tools. As a result, the optimal temperature range for most genome editors is not known. Prior work has revealed that variants of the Cas12a nuclease derived from different bacterial species vary dramatically in their activity at lower temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Our study extends this observation to deaminases used for precision genome engineering. Outside of applications in mammals, many of the most important uses of CRISPR genome engineering take place in organisms that do not tolerate longer term exposure to temperatures of 37°C. For example, important disease vectors, such as mosquitos of the genus <italic>Aedes</italic> that transmit malaria, dengue and other diseases, are optimally adapted to temperatures between 20°C and 30°C, with an upper limit of 34°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Likewise, the optimal growth temperatures for the majority of crop plants is below 30°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. It is therefore important to develop genome engineering tools optimised to different climates to realise the full potential of CRISPR technology.</p><p id="P31">One surprising finding of our study is the fact that base editing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> leads to much fewer undesired byproducts in the form of indels or C-to-G or C-to-A edits at the gRNA target site compared to many other species. This is likely due to system specific differences in DNA repair. Indel byproducts during cytosine base editing mostly arise from error-prone repair of abasic sites that are generated by the UNG enzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. To limit such events, CBEs are typically linked to one or more UNG-inhibition (UGI) domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other holometabolous insects are naturally missing a <italic>UNG</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and thus mimic human <italic>UNG</italic> knockout cells, which had previously been shown to essentially eliminate indels and C-to-G/A editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The fact that we did observe some indel formation, in particular with the highly active evoCDA1 domain, suggests that additional DNA repair enzymes recognize intermediate base editing products and contribute to the formation of undesired editing outcomes. For example thymine DNA-glycosylase (TDG) has previously been shown to act on U:G mismatches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, suggesting additional targets to increase base editing precision.</p><p id="P32">The data presented here also highlight organismal toxicity as a potential limitation of current base editing technology. While base editing does not induce genotoxic DNA double strand breaks, it does rely on the expression of constitutively active deaminase domains, which on their own act indiscriminately on single stranded DNA and in some cases RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Specificity of such systems relies on the ability to concentrate an active base editor at the target site through RNA-guided DNA binding of Cas9, while limiting base editor concentration in the rest of the cell. Indeed, a previous study has shown that limiting CBE expression to the level of housekeeping genes abrogates the Cas9-independent DNA and RNA off-targeting observed with transfection mediated overexpression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. In line with this, we find that CBEs expressed directly from a housekeeping promoter (<italic>act5c</italic>) are well tolerated in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, while overexpression with the binary expression system Gal4-UAS gives rise to severe side effects. As the expression levels achieved with the <italic>act5c</italic> promoter already mediate highly efficient base editing, it should be possible to reduce expression by the Gal4-UAS system to minimise toxicity with limited or no trade-off in efficiency, as previously demonstrated for Cas9 and a DNA methyltransferase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Interestingly, toxicity arising from CBE overexpression is also dependent on the deaminase domain. While dCBE<sup>evoAPOBEC1</sup> resulted in lethality when expressed under the control of an <italic>act</italic>- or <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> driver, dCBE<sup>evoCDA1</sup> was better tolerated under the same conditions, despite the higher activity of this editor. It is tempting to speculate that this at least in part is due to the fact that APOBEC1, but not CDA1, exhibits RNA off-targeting in human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In the future, the use of engineered deaminase domains with reduced Cas9-independent off-targeting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> might further reduce the toxicity of base editors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other species. Likewise, recently described TadA-based CBEs have been shown to minimise the occurrence of DNA and RNA off-targeting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P33">In summary, our study describes highly efficient base editing tools for the installation of loss-of-function alleles in somatic cells or the germline of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These systems will be useful for the efficient establishment of mutant fly lines or testing of gene function in the F1 generation. Base editor-mediated gene inactivation will be particularly advantageous in scenarios where function-retaining indels are problematic, knowledge of the type of edit is desired, deleterious consequences of DSBs are particularly problematic or when PCR bias would obscure sequencing-based analysis of target sites of different length. Our work also highlights several avenues to further improve CRISPR technology, such as optimization of temperature range and expression levels and leveraging the natural diversity in DNA repair between different systems.
