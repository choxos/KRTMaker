Here, a thorough and systematic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study is conducted to investigate how the RBD mutations on these subvariants affect the interactions with broad mAbs including AstraZeneca (COV2-2196 and COV2-2130), Brii Biosciences (BRII-196), Celltrion (CT-P59), Eli Lilly (LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016), Regeneron (REGN10933 and REGN10987), Vir Biotechnology (S309), and S2X259. Our results show a complete loss of binding for COV2-2196, BRII-196, CT-P59, and LY-CoV555 with all Omicron RBDs. REGN10987 also loses its binding against BA.1 but partially retains against BA.2 and BA.4/5. The reduction in binding is either significant for LY-CoV016 and REGN10933 or moderate for COV2-2130. S309 and S2X259 retain their binding strength against BA.1 but decrease against others. We introduce a mutational escape map for each mAb to identify the key RBD sites and critical mutation. Overall, our findings suggest that majority of therapeutic mAbs have diminished or lost their activity against Omicron subvariants, indicating the urgent need for a new therapeutic mAb, modifying current ones with a better mAb design, or seeking an alternative approach.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Omicron subvariants</kwd><kwd>mAb escape mutations</kwd><kwd>antibody recognition process</kwd><kwd>MD simulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Despite significant progress in understanding the biological implications of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, the emergence of several variants of concern (VOCs) poses the biggest new COVID-19 threat. These VOCs have different phenotypes from the original Wild-type (WT) strain in terms of infectivity, antigenicity, and transmissibility, resulting in increased infection and mortality rates globally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> So far, the World Health Organization (WHO) has designated five VOCs: Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529 or BA.1). The latter one is the most mutated VOC with 37 mutations in the spike (S) protein, 15 of which are in the receptor-binding domain (RBD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> This high number of RBD Omicron mutations represents a serious concern to the effectiveness of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), vaccines, and drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Another curious feature of Omicron is that it includes different subvariants (i.e., BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4, BA.5, etc.), which raises more doubts about the efficacy of these medical options. Indeed, many studies have demonstrated that Omicron subvariants can rise infectivity, reduce antibodies and vaccines effectivity, and result in more vaccine-breakthrough infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> Therefore, the study of the mutation effects of different Omicron sublineages is of paramount importance to predict which of them can help SARS-CoV-2 elude mAb therapies and vaccines. It may also enable us to prepare for future new variants.</p><p id="P3">RBD mutations in Omicron subvariants are either common or unique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Specifically, BA.2 has 16 RBD mutations, 12 of which are identical to those detected in BA.1 (G339D, S373P, S375F, K417N, N440K, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, Q498R, N501Y, and Y505H), three of which are unique (T376A, D405N, and R408S), and the final one is S371F vs S371L of BA.1. But BA.2 does not have the G446S and G496S present in BA.1. On the other hand, both BA.4 and BA.5 (from here on referred to as BA.4/5) have accommodated the same 17 RBD mutations, 15 of which are similar to BA.2, with two additional mutations being L452R and F486V, but they lack Q493R harbored by BA.1 and BA.2. Strikingly, some of these RBD Omicron mutations have previously been identified in other VOCs, such as K417N, L452R, T478K, mutation at site 484, and N501Y, which lead to antibody escape and/or high infectiousness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> However, many of Omicron mutations are extremely rare and their biological function remains to be determined. Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify their roles, particularly how they affect the immune recognition process of a wide range of clinical mAbs. This knowledge could provide critical information on the antigenic drift of RBD Omicron mutations, guiding the development of effective mAb therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p><p id="P4">Antibodies have a major role in the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. RBD-specific or N-terminal domain (NTD)-specific mAbs of S-protein have been shown to be the most promising and effective antiviral therapeutics for COVID-19.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> However, mAbs still confront significant challenges, with the most pressing concern being whether mutations of RBD Omicron subvariants can confer antibody resistance. Particularly, RBD is immunodominant and contains WT epitopes for 90% of the antibodies elicited by natural infection or vaccination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Thus, the distributions of RBD Omicron mutations on these epitopes could potentially disrupt biological characteristics of RBD epitope surfaces, leading to escape from the majority of mAb therapeutics and/or compromise the acquired human immune profile. While this is a hot topic with valuable studies using different approaches,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> further research effort is necessary to probe the consequences of RBD Omicron mutations on antigenic profiles, particularly those that address the molecular dynamics and thermodynamic aspects, which is the goal of the current study.</p><p id="P5">RBD-targeting mAbs are typically classified into four classes (class 1 to 4, which we utilized here)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> or six RBD receptor binding sites (RBSs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> depending on various criteria such as their binding modes to “up”, “down”, or both RBD conformations, competitions with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, the location of their RBD epitope, and derivation from antibody gene families. These two classifications are highly overlapping. Class 1 mAbs are mainly derived from the VH3-53 or VH3-66 germlines with short CDRH3 (complementarity-determining region 3 of heavy chain) loops that block ACE2 and exclusively bind to “up” RDB conformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> Class 2 mAbs are encoded by different germ segments and has a long CDRH3 loop and directly compete with ACE2 by binding to both “open” and “close” RBDs. Unlike classes 1 and 2, classes 3 and 4 bind the RBD but do not interfere with ACE2-binding site. Class 3 recognizes both RBD conformations, whereas class 4 binds only the “up” RBD.</p><p id="P6">In this study, the molecular basis of antibody binding against emerging Omicron subvariants such as BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/5 is investigated and compared with its WT to determine the overall impact of RBD mutations or the effect of each specific RBD mutation. To achieve this, the binding of ten mAbs against RBD WT or Omicron subvariants (BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/5) has been probed. These mAbs mainly recognize and target the RBD class 1 (BRII-196<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, CT-P59<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, and LY-CoV016<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>), class 2 (LY-CoV555<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, COV2-2196<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, and REGN10933<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>), class 3 (REGN10987<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, COV2-2130<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, and S309<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>) and class 4 (S2X259<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>) epitope regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). These mAbs cover almost all epitope sites on the RBD. In total, 40 different mAb-RBD complexes, i.e.,10 mAb for each RBD case, have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and followed by end-point binding free energy (BFE) calculation with molecular mechanics Generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) method. Such investigations are crucial not only for understanding the molecular and amino acid origins of immune evasion by these Omicron subvariants but also for instructing better design of mAbs and vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><label>2</label><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="P7">To map escape mutations and determine the effects of RBD Omicron subvariant mutations as well as to elucidate the molecular basis for immune recognition of RBD antigenic sites, we explicitly generated four different RBD-Fab models for each individual mAb. The first model is for WT RBD with the fragment antigen-binding (Fab) region of the mAb, while the remaining three models are for BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/5 RBD with the Fab. The comparison of the Omicron models against the WT model allows us to predict the mutational implications of each Omicron subvariant and how Omicron has evolved to dodge acquired immunity. In total, this study targeted forty mAb-RBD complexes, i.e., ten mAb × four different RBDs.</p><p id="P8">We developed a procedure for creating initial structural models having all RBD Omicron mutations as fully described in Supporting Information (SI). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref> summarized all 40 solvated models of the glycosylated mAb-RBD complex in WT or Omicron variants. The MD and MM-GBSA protocols are also described in SI.</p><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Conformational changes in RBD Omicron subvariants impair the stability of the mAb-RBD complex</title><p id="P9">To gain insight into how the Omicron mutations impact the dynamic behavior of mAb-RBD complex, two replicates of all-atom MD simulations were run over 200 ns for forty biosystems and their MD trajectories are monitored to verify the structure stability of Omicron subvariant complexes vs related WT. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 (a)</xref> (top panel) displays the averaged root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) of the complex from these two MD runs, while <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1</xref> shows the time evolution of RMSD for all models. These figures, with a few exceptions, show that the mAb forms a fairly unstable complex with Omicron subvariants, as evidenced by relatively large fluctuations in RMSD with many plateaus relative to the WT.</p><p id="P10">Additionally, CT-P59 and REGN10987 have relatively large RMSD compared to other complexes, especially when their RBD contains Omicron mutations. This result implies that RBD Omicron mutations may change the overall stability of the mAb-RBD complex. To demonstrate that, the principal component analysis (PCA) has been performed to extract the fundamental motions of RBD in Omicron subvariants vs WT. The first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) of only RBD (T333-P527) in different Omicron seniors is projected onto their WT RBD as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>. PCA shows notable variation in collective motion for Omicron RBDs comparing to WT, indicating conformational changes between them. The PC1 of Omicron RBDs captures relatively largest variance during the MD simulations comparing to WT, clearly support our finding that Omicron RBDs explores a relatively larger conformational space than in WT (see the amount (%) of variance accounted by PC1 and PC2 in the middle panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3(a)</xref>). Analysis of the root-mean-square-fluctuations (RMSF) further confirms this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S3</xref>). In most cases, the RBD Omicron subvariants exhibit an increase in overall flexibility, particularly in the β5–β6 loop region (residues 473-488) of RBM. It is possible that the high flexibility of these Omicron sites and the mAb residues at the interface resulted in a destabilized complex, which in turn reduce the binding of the mAb-RBD Omicron complexes in comparison to their corresponding WT system. Collectively, our findings show that mAb-RBD Omicron complexes are relatively less stable and more dynamic than their WT counterparts. As a result, immune evasion of Omicron subvariants could be facilitated, limiting mAb efficacy.</p><p id="P11">Although the simulation time is only 200 ns, there is a considerable overlap between two MD runs as seen by <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1</xref> of the RMSD. This is a good indication that the independent MD runs are reproducible. This is even more pronounced by both the PCA for whole complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S4</xref> for mAbs class 1 as an example) and the value of the root mean squared inner product (RMSIP) for the PC1 and PC2 that ranges from 0.65 to 0.9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3(a)</xref> bottom panel).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>RBD Omicron subvariant mutations reduce or abolish mAb binding by changing their electrostatic potential surface</title><p id="P12">BFE is a critical thermodynamic quantity that drives all molecular processes, including the mAb-RBD binding mechanism. It measures the strength of the interaction between the mAb and its antigen like RBD and is thus often directly related to the mAb’s potency. In present study, MM-GBSA approach was used to predict the complete BFE profile between the mAb and RBD at 310 K (37 °C) under a neutral pH and 0.15 M univalent NaCl salt concentration. We first compare our predicted BFE of the WT mAb-RBD complexes to the available experimental results,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> as listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref> shows that the calculated BFE using MM-GBSA has excellent agreement in six complexes, but it is underestimated in BRII-196<sub>WT</sub> and overestimated in LY-CoV016<sub>WT</sub>, S309<sub>WT</sub>, and S2X259<sub>WT</sub>. Overall, there is an acceptable correlation between the MM-GBSA and experimental values (the Pearson correlation r = 0.63 for all 10 models as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>). When the computed BFE values for BRII-196<sub>WT</sub>, LY-CoV016<sub>WT</sub>, S309<sub>WT</sub>, and S2X259<sub>WT</sub> are excluded, the correlation coefficient increases to 0.93 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>). This observation is not surprising, since the MM-GBSA method is highly dependent on the system under investigation and is influenced by many parameters such as the solute dielectric constant, MD length and replica, the ensemble used to calculate entropic contributions, and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> The experimental values, on the other hand, fall within a relatively narrow range of -10.5 to -17 kcal/mol, making the linear fit with this computational method is significantly affected when there is a little drift. Nonetheless, it is well known that the MM-GBSA can provide a good BFE ranking that agrees reasonably well with the experimental binding affinity ranking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> Additionally, this popular MM-GBSA methodology offers a tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup></p><p id="P13">To assess the effects of Omicron mutations on mAb binding, the BFE between different Omicron RBDs and mAb is calculated and compared to the binding of related WT complex, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. Roughly speaking, a positive BFE indicates that there is no spontaneous association between the mAb and RBD (not favorable or no binding), whereas a negative value reflects the association (favorable). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows that the BFEs for BRII-196, CT-P59, COV2-2196, and LY-CoV555 are completely flipped toward positive values in all Omicron cases, suggesting that they have all lost their ability to neutralize RBD Omicron subvariants. This finding is in consistent with recent experimental observations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> REGN10987 also loses its ability to associate with BA.1 while retaining moderate binding to BA.2 and BA.4/5. A recent experimental studies support this observation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> The bindings of REGN10933 and LY-CoV016 to BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/5 are substantially dropped, with the reduction in BFE ranging from 30 to 68% of their WT complexes. On the other hand, the COV2-2130 exhibits a moderate reduction in BFE to Omicron subvariants especially of BA.1, ranging from 10 to 5 % compared to its WT. This again also in line with previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup></p><p id="P14">S309 and S2X259 preserve their ability to bind BA.1 but are reduced against BA.2 and BA.4/5, particularly S2X259. The drop in binding for S2X259 against BA.2 and BA.4/5 is 18 and 21% of their original WT, respectively. The binding behavior of the S309 and S2X259 against Omicron subvariants is good correlated with experimental data. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup></p><p id="P15">In general, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows that the binding of mAb classes 3 and 4 are less affected by Omicron than mAb classes 1 and 2.</p><p id="P16">To gain a better understanding of the primary driving force that causes Omicron subvariants to weaken/lose mAb binding, the BFE is dissected into its energetic components as shown in histogram plots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> for 9 mAbs as well as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S6</xref> for S2X259.

These figures indicate that the source of escape Omicron mutations from a broad mAbs mainly originates from changing their electrostatic interactions. Obviously, seven RBD Omicron mutations, G339D, N440K, L452R, T478K, Q493R, Q498R, and Y505H, change from polar or nonpolar residues to charged residues, whereas K417N, D405N, R408S, and E484A have opposite charge modifications (change from charged residues to polar/nonpolar). These charge modifications undoubtedly have induced the electrostatic changes between Omicron RBDs and mAbs as demonstrated by quantitative and qualitative results in our study. Consequently, the recognition and specificity of mAb are strongly affected by these electrostatic changes. This observation is fully consistent with other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup></p><p id="P17">Along with these, changes in van der Waals (ΔE<sub>vdW</sub>) interaction also contribute to the loss/reduction of binding of specific mAbs such as CT-P59, LY-CoV061 and LY-CoV555 in all Omicron subvariants, as well as S309 binding in BA.2 and BA.4/5.

Interestingly in BA.2 and BA.4/5, LY-CoV061 and S2X259 share the same escape mutation R408S. In BA.4/5, L452R confer the immune resistance against BRII-196, CT-P59 and LY-CoV555 as well as F486V in CT-P59, LY-CoV061, COV2-2196, and REGN10933. Other mutations could be classified as potential escape mutations such as Q493R, Q498R and Y505H. However, not all RBD Omicron mutations facilitate immune evasion. For instance, S373P and S375F in the S2X259 complex or T487K in the REGN10933 enhance the binding. This is also true for N501Y for some mAbs. Other mutations, such as E484A against COV2-2196 or D405N against S2X259, appear to enhance binding, but the reality is quite the opposite, as we will see in next section. Therefore, the per-residue BFE decomposition of only the actual mutation site is inadequate to describe the complete picture of mutational impacts. It requires the incorporation of unmutated RBD residues whose biological environment has changed due to mutations, particularly those adjacent to the mutation, as well as mAb residues that form a pair with WT RBD as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S7.

In general, many other conserved RBD or mAb chain residues are implicated in the consequences of evading each mAb. HC residues of mAb are more involved in these Omicron ramifications. Significantly, the per-residue BFE differences for some of these key residues are very critical and reached more or less than ±2.5 kcal/mol (see bold residues in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These critical residues could be mainly contributed to conferring antibody evasion (see next section). Furthermore, the interacting spectrum for the mAb that its binding is less affected by Omicron mutations such as COV2-2130 differs from that of its WT. This indicates that while the net BE of some mAbs remains significantly unchanged, their intermolecular interactions with Omicron are not completely identical. It should also mention that the glycan at N343 is anticipated in the interactions with mAb class 3, in particular S309 in all cases and REGN10987<sub>BA.2</sub> and REGN10987<sub>BA.4/5</sub>. In the S309 complexes, the impact of Omicron mutations on their interactions with glycan did not follow a specific trend, in which BA.1 mutations can enhance interactions with glycan while BA.2 or BA.4/5 mutations can do the opposite. In REGN10987, both BA.2 and BA.4/5 are made many interactions with glycan that are not observed in both WT and BA.1. Further investigations are required here.

Furthermore, the structural and thermodynamic basis for these escape Omicron mutations has been thoroughly determined, and our findings show that the main source of the antibody evasion is the loss of ionic and hydrogen interactions between Omicron RBDs and mAbs. This research sheds light on the molecular mechanism by which mutations in the RBD Omicron subvariants affect the mAb-RBD recognition process. Additionally, this study paves the route for the development of effective antibody therapy against current or future SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>SI excel sheet</label><media xlink:href="EMS159093-supplement-SI_excel_sheet.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d84aAdDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Table S1, Table S2, Table S3, Table S4, Figure S1, Figure S2, Figure S3, Figure S4, Figure S5,</label><media xlink:href="EMS159093-supplement-Table_S1__Table_S2__Table_S3__Table_S4__Figure_S1__Figure_S2__Figure_S3__Figure_S4__Figure_S5_.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d84aAdDcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This research used the resources of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a DOE Office of Science User Facility supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy by U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC03-76SF00098, DE-AC02-05CH11231 using NERSC award NERSC DDR-ERCAP0023727, and the Research Computing Support Services (RCSS) of the University of Missouri System.
