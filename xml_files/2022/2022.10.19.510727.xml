Advances were made possible through – among other methods - detailed structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and symptom mapping in subjects with focal cerebellar lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bodranghien et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Timmann et al., 2009</xref>). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy subjects has also provided key insights of cerebellar-cortical pathways that mediate a wide range of motor and non-motor behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Buckner, 2013</xref>). Computational models have been informative for delineating the cerebellar learning algorithms and for generating testable hypotheses for empirical investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Raymond &amp; Medina, 2018</xref>). However, the physiological mechanisms of these diverse cerebellar functions remain topics of ongoing debate. It is especially noticeable that there is a profound deficiency of electrophysiological knowledge of the cerebellum in humans, as compared to animals, because the pervading perception is that it is difficult to non-invasively record human cerebellar activity using MEG or EEG.</p><p id="P3">One model case that demonstrates the knowledge gap between animal and human cerebellar physiology is eyeblink conditioning. In the classic delayed eyeblink conditioning procedure, a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS), such as a tone or a light, is paired with a blink-eliciting air-puff unconditioned stimulus (US) with the CS-US interval being fixed and the two stimuli co-terminating. Over time, the temporal association between the CS and US is acquired and learning is manifested by a conditioned response (CR) - blinks which start during the CS and generally peak at the arrival of US. It is now well known that in both animals and humans, associative learning happens within the cerebellum (review for animal see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Freeman, 2015</xref>; for human see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gerwig et al., 2007</xref>). Experimental lesions either in cerebellar lobule VI or the interposed nucleus of animals can impair the acquisition and retention of conditioning. Human patients with cerebellar pathologies are also deficient in the capacity to acquire eyeblink conditioning. Detailed lesion-symptom mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Timmann et al., 2009</xref>) and functional MRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dimitrova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Thurling et al., 2015</xref>) identified lobule VI and the interposed nuclei being the eyeblink conditioning regions in humans, indicating the same functional anatomy in animals and humans.</p><p id="P4">However, our understanding of the neural mechanisms of eyeblink conditioning came almost exclusively from animal recordings. A rich body of unit and local field recordings showed that the US is transmitted to Purkinje cells via climbing fibres that originate in the inferior olive. The CS is transmitted mainly via mossy fibres that synapse on granule cells. The axons of granule cells become parallel fibres which synapse on Purkinje cells. Thus, CS and US signals converge on Purkinje cells, the sole output of the cerebellar cortex. Mossy and climbing fibres also have collaterals to deep nuclear neurons, which are the only downstream neurons of Purkinje cells. It is generally agreed that the interplay between Purkinje cells and nuclear neurons is at the heart of learning. Purkinje cells are intrinsically active, firing simple spikes at a fast and regular rate (30-150 Hz generally, up to 250 Hz)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Armstrong &amp; Rawson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kahlon &amp; Lisberger, 2000</xref>), and are further driven by prolific numbers of parallel fibres. However, each single climbing fibre has more than 1000 synapses on a Purkinje cell, forming a powerful excitatory connection. Therefore, in naïve animals, cerebellar responses to US are characterised by complex spikes resulting from climbing fibre input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jirenhed et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ohmae &amp; Medina, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Rasmussen et al., 2014</xref>) (called US-complex spike in this manuscript). Although powerful, these complex spikes are irregular, occurring only on a proportion of trials, with close but not uniform latencies after the US. After learning, complex spikes can also be observed early in the CS-US interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ohmae &amp; Medina, 2015</xref>) (called CS-complex spike in this manuscript). Importantly, the occurrence of CS-complex spikes is accompanied by the brief suppression of simple spikes and the pause and subsequent excitation of nuclear neurons(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref>). Nuclear output neurons then activate downstream motor nuclei driving eyelid closure and result in blinks as a CR. In addition, nucleo-olivary connections inhibit the inferior olive and thus US-complex spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Nicholson &amp; Freeman, 2003</xref>). There are still fierce debates about the exact roles and importance of each anatomical site and their corresponding activities in the acquisition and maintenance of conditioning. For example, the mechanism that triggers simple spike depression and interaction between simple spikes and complex spikes during learning are both topics of active research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Rasmussen, 2020</xref>). The importance of CS-complex spike and simple spike depression to CR generation are also under scrutiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">ten Brinke et al., 2019</xref>). Electrophysiological studies nonetheless provide rich knowledge about eyeblink conditioning-related plasticity at circuitry and cellular levels.</p><p id="P5">In comparison to animal studies, even though clinical studies have strongly supported the key role of the cerebellum, direct evidence of neurophysiological changes to conditioning in humans is largely lacking. Identifying electrophysiological markers in humans is necessary for several reasons. First, while fMRI aims to provide a proxy of neural activity by measuring metabolic changes, the nature of haemodynamic responses means it is technologically infeasible to investigate the precise temporal properties of cerebellar activity using fMRI. There is also increasing evidence showing that fMRI is a better proxy of synaptic responses to inputs than spiking activity output in the case of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lauritzen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mathiesen et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, identifying learning related neural activity is likely to be a blind spot of cerebellar fMRI. This means we need direct measurement of spiking activity to compare animal and human studies. Second, eyeblink conditioning undergoes changes across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Solomon et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Woodruff-Pak &amp; Thompson, 1988</xref>) and in various neurodegenerative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">van Gaalen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Woodruff-Pak, 2001</xref>) and neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Reeb-Sutherland &amp; Fox, 2015</xref>). Thus, electrophysiological markers of eyeblink conditioning may well have wider clinical implications.</p><p id="P6">Importantly, there is an increasing awareness that impaired eyeblink conditioning often starts in the pre-clinical stage of neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">van Gaalen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Woodruff-Pak, 2001</xref>). Therefore, electrophysiological markers can enhance our chances of early detection and intervention of these diseases.</p><p id="P7">Two recent studies discussed the feasibility of recording cerebellar electrical signals extracranially. Anderson and colleagues (2020) revisited a small number of reports which have detected cerebellar activity in M/EEG while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Samuelsson and colleagues (2020)</xref> simulated M/EEG signals using a realistic cerebellar model based on high resolution MRI. Both studies concluded that cerebellar activity should be detectable in M/EEG. Indeed, the new type of on-scalp MEG system based on optically pumped magnetometers – OP-MEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Boto et al., 2018</xref>) has shown great potential, enhancing the signal intensity and spatial resolution of deep brain areas including the cerebellum. And a recent EEG study has identified cerebellar activity in a classical conditioning paradigm using the otolith-evoked blink reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Todd et al., 2021</xref>). Given the complementary distribution of sensitivity for MEG and for EEG over the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Samuelsson et al., 2020</xref>), we believe there is scope for additional MEG focused work in this area.</p><p id="P8">Previously, we recorded event-related OP-MEG responses to air-puff stimulation of the eyes, in the absence of classical conditioning. We used on-scalp OPM sensors placed over the posterior cranium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lin et al., 2019</xref>), and source analysis indicated the responses most likely originated from the cerebellum. In this study, we paired air-puffs (US) with auditory tones (CS) and record changes of OP-MEG in accordance with conditioning. We then infer the nature of these OP-MEG responses based on the changes we expect from animal recordings. First, we expected to see reduced US-evoked responses, irrespective of the degree of eyelid closure at the time of US. Second, in the CS-US interval, we expect change due to CS-related complex spikes concurrent with simple spike depression in the cerebellar cortex and pause and excitation in the nucleus neurons. Finally, there may be newly formed CS-related responses, although it is unlikely that the temporospatial profile of CS-related responses will be similar to US-evoked responses.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P9">Four healthy adult human participants (1 female, 3 male) aged 29-52, took part in the experiment. None of them had neurological or psychiatric disorders except for participant 4 who reported a history of common migraine, which was not active and not treated with any pharmaceutics during the study. Two participants (participants 1 and 2) took part in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lin et al., 2019</xref>) so they were experienced with the unpaired air-puff and sound-tone stimulation used in the protocol; the other two participants were naïve to the stimulation conditions. Specifically, three participants were naïve to the paired CS-US stimulation that would induce eyeblink conditioning, whereas participant 1 had experienced one session of paired stimulation, about 7 months prior to these recordings.</p><p id="P10">The study conformed to the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki, except for registration in a database. The protocol was approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee and the University of Birmingham Research Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The experiments took place at the University College London.</p><p id="P11"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> shows the experimental setup. We used a standard delayed conditioning protocol developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gormezano &amp; Kehoe (1975)</xref>. The US was a brief air-puff delivered through a nozzle mounted on the helmet worn by the participant. The nozzle was connected to a pressurised air cylinder (1 Bar) through a 10 m semi-rigid plastic tube (2mm internal diameter). Under the control of a bespoke pneumatic valve controller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Leonardelli et al., 2015</xref>), the arrival time of the air-puff was estimated to lag the valve opening by 33 ms, calibrated off-line using a microphone, and was relatively insensitive to the nozzle-to-eye distance over a limited range (~1 ms/cm). The nozzle directed the air-puff to the outer canthus of the left eye at approximately 2-4 cm from the eye. The distance was individually set such that the puff was able to evoke a visible blink after each delivery, but without causing discomfort. The CS was a 550-ms binaural tone (2800 Hz). There were two phases to each experiment, a baseline and an acquisition phase. Specifically, participants received a baseline block of trials followed by four acquisition blocks, each block lasting approximately 12 minutes; the interval between blocks was ~1 minute. The baseline block constituted of 200 trials: 140 US-only trials, 50 CS-only trials, and 10 CS-US paired trials, with the air-puff triggered 500 ms after tone onset. The acquisition block also constituted of 200 trials: 190 CS-US trials and 10 CS-only trials. In every block, trial order was randomized in sets of 20. Every trial began with a random wait of 1-2.5 seconds to avoid habituation and anticipation; inter-stimulus intervals averaged to 3.6 s.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>OP-MEG data recording</title><p id="P12">During the experiment, biomagnetic signals, as well as stimulus timing signals and eyeblink responses were recorded using the OP-MEG system at the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging (University College London, UK). The use of an OP-MEG system for the eyeblink paradigm has been previously described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, the system used 15-20 QuSpin optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs) (QuSpin Inc., Louisville, CO, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Shah, Osborne, Orton, &amp; Alem, 2018</xref>). Each OPM sensor served as a one MEG channel recording electromagnetic signals radial to the scalp. Sensors were mounted on individually tailored rigid sensor helmets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Meyer et al., 2017</xref>), with sockets around the outer surface to hold the OPM sensors. The inner surface of each ‘scannercast’ helmet was based on each participant’s scalp extracted from a T1-weighted MRI image. Therefore, sensor sockets are in the same coordinate space as the MRI image of the brain. This means sensor positions and orientations were accurately co-registered to individual participant’s brain anatomy. Here, with limited numbers of sensors available, we used the MRI-derived 3D mesh of each individual’s brain surface and of the helmet to select sockets positioned proximal to the cerebellar cortex. Across the 4 participants, 12 to 14 posterior sensors were used. Additionally, one sensor was placed in the left infra-orbital socket to detect eye-blink. Due to excessive noise, 2 or 3 posterior sensors were removed from further data analysis for participant 1 and 4. This left 12, 14, 13 and 11 posterior sensors for participants 1 to 4, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> shows sensor position and orientation on the heads. Another four OPMs were placed close to the head to serve as a reference array providing ambient field strength and gradient for sensor calibration and interference rejection.</p><p id="P13">Recording was performed in an OPM-dedicated 4-layer magnetically shielded room (MSR) (Magnetic Shields, Ltd.; internal dimensions 3 m × 4 m × 2.2 m). Participants were seated with their head approximately central within the room during recording. The static field within the central 1 cubic metre of the OPM room is approximately 2 nT and the field gradient is approximately 1 nT·m<sup>-1</sup> (Mellor <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021). No additional active shielding was used.</p><p id="P14">OPM data were recorded using custom acquisition software, built in Labview. Each OPM channel was measured as a voltage (±5 V, 500 Hz antialiasing hardware filter) and sampled at 6 kHz by a National Instruments analogue-to-digital converter (NI-9205, 16-bit, ± 10 V input range) using QuSpin’s adapter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://quspin.com/products-qzfm/ni-9205-data-acquisition-unit/">https://quspin.com/products-qzfm/ni-9205-data-acquisition-unit/</ext-link>). This signal was then scaled by a calibration factor to represent the recorded magnetic field. The time-to-live signals triggering the air-puff valve and the audio buzzer were acquired simultaneously through the same data acquisition system and sent to the OP-MEG data acquisition PCs to align air-puff triggers and OP-MEG data.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="P15">All of the data analysis was performed using SPM12 within the MATLAB environment (Release 2019b, Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA).</p><sec id="S6"><title>OP-MEG data pre-processing</title><p id="P16">OP-MEG data were first filtered between 5 and 80 Hz using a 4<sup>th</sup> order Butterworth filter and then notch filtered at 50 Hz using a 3<sup>rd</sup> order Butterworth filter to remove the power line noise. Reference noise cancellation was used to linearly regress the signal recorded by the reference array from the signal recorded at the scalp array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Boto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fife et al., 1999</xref>). After reference noise cancellation, we examined the power spectrum density (psd) to identify any remaining residual noise peaks. One additional notch filter at 100 Hz was used to the acquisition phase data of one participant (participant 3) based on the psd. Epochs of data for each trial were extracted between -1000 and +1000 ms relative to air-puff onset for the US trials, and relative to the tone onset for the CS trials. Thereafter, acquisition phase data were concatenated across the four blocks. Trials from the baseline and acquisition phase were ranked separately according to signal variance, for each participant. These rankings were then used in a median absolute deviation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Leys et al., 2013</xref>) for the rejection of outliers.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Eyeblink data analysis</title><p id="P17">Eyeblink responses were analysed on a trial-by-trial basis using the following custom pipeline. We began with the processed and epoched data from the infraorbital sensor, as described in the <italic>OP-MEG data pre-processing</italic> section. The data was then downsampled to 1200 Hz using SPM12 and low pass filtered at 100 Hz. Thereafter, we performed full wave rectification and low pass filtering at 10 Hz. Blink data outliners were then rejected using the same median absolute deviation criterion that was applied to OP-MEG data. For both baseline and acquisition phases, the magnitude of the unconditioned eyeblink response (UR) was defined as the peak after US onset. Conditioned eyeblink responses (CR) were identified in the acquisition phase using the following amplitude criteria: response onset was automatically detected as being when signal amplitude within the CS–US interval first deviated 3 SDs from the baseline level in the 500 ms before the CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Thurling et al., 2015</xref>). In trials where pre-CS baseline was not stable and hence the no CR was identified by the onset criterion, a CR peak was identified when a response one-twentieth (or greater) of the mean UR magnitude occurred 150-500 ms after CS onset; responses &lt;150 ms after CS onset are excluded as reflexive responses to the tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Woodruff-Pak et al., 1996</xref>). For a CR that were identified using the peak amplitude criterion, the onset was then identified as the closest trough that preceded the CR peak. All trials were then visually inspected and implausible CRs were excluded. Trials were classified for further analysis as CR+/UR-, CR-/UR+ or CR+/UR+. Trials with no identifiable CR or UR due to excessive noise were marked as bad trials.</p><p id="P18">We calculated the percentage incidence of UR during baseline US-only trials and acquisition CS-US trials as well as the percentage incidence CR during CS-US and CS-only trials of both phases. We then compared the incidence of UR and CR between the baseline and acquisition phases to examine the effect of learning using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. CR incidence should ideally rise from 0 to 1 as conditioned responses become established while UR incidence should decrease. Friedman tests were used to analyse changes across consecutive blocks. <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Evoked response analysis</title><p id="P19">All the trials surviving blink and OP-MEG outlier rejection were used. For some analyses, CR+ and CR- trials were separated and compared. To identify evoked responses, trials were averaged, and baseline corrected to the mean of the window 100 ms prior to stimulus onset. In some analyses, to examine the effect of blinks on evoked response and to identify responses that were potentially time-locked to blinks, the data were re-aligned to blink onset, baseline corrected and averaged. Paired t-tests were used to examine if the peak amplitudes of evoked responses at each sensor were different from the 100 ms pre-stimulus/pre-CR time windows; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 was considered significant. The global field power (GFP) was estimated for each participant from the average signal of each experimental condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lehmann &amp; Skrandies, 1980</xref>). Because field strengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A &amp; 3B</xref>) and sensor layouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) differed significantly across participants, to quantitatively compare field strengths of different conditions, we normalised GFP such that the maximum for each participant was 1. The GFP difference between baseline and acquisition or between CR+ and CR- trials was determined with paired t-tests at each time point with a criterion set at p &lt; 0.05. To minimise false-positive results, we only accepted periods significantly different at &gt;60 contiguous samples, i.e. &gt;10 ms. For source level analysis the subject-specific latencies of identifiable evoked responses were calculated using peaks in the GFP amplitudes. Data from all posterior sensors were then averaged across a time window ± 2ms from the peak and were then used for source localisation.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Induced responses analysis</title><p id="P20">For induced spectral power changes, single trial time-frequency (TF) decompositions in sensor space were calculated for each subject using a Morlet wavelet transform (Tallon-Baudry et al.,1998) and then averaged across trials and the power of the evoked responses subtracted out. We used CR trials in the acquisition phase for this response analysis. Data was down-sampled to 1200 Hz before wavelet transform. The wavelet transform was calculated for each time-point between -1000 and +1000 ms, with 76 scale bins corresponding to frequencies between 5 and 80 Hz. For each trial and frequency, the mean power in the interval 100 ms before stimulus onset was considered as a baseline. The power change in each frequency band post-stimulus was expressed as the relative percentage change from the baseline. Paired t-tests were used to analyse the changes of power and p&lt;0.001 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>OP-MEG source localisation - dipole fitting</title><p id="P21">We evaluated the locus of the average evoked response using a dipole fit analysis.

In brief, the inversion scheme assigned initial means and variances of dipole positions and moments (also called ‘priors’). The final dipole locations and moments were optimised using variational free energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Friston et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">López et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Penny, 2012</xref>).

The reductions can be seen in the average of both CR-/UR+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> left panel) and CR+/UR- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> right panel) trials. Therefore, this effect was not likely to be only a result of decreased response to air puffs because of the pre-emptive closure of the eyelids. When taking the average OP-MEG of all CS-US trials, other than reduced post-US evoked fields, two small dipolar responses can be seen in 50-150 ms post-CS in participant 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). No dipolar response was observed in the CS-US interval among the other three participants (figures not shown). The post-US response reduction can be summarised by the Grand averaged GFP waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Comparing normalised GFPs between the baseline and acquisition phases, there were two time windows where statistically significant difference was found using a criterion of p&lt; 0.05 for more than 60 contiguous samples (i.e. &gt;10 ms). At 113-124 ms after the onset of CS, a higher level of activation in the acquisition phase was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). At 87-99 ms after the onset of US, activation in the acquisition phase was significantly lower than the baseline phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). We also found a significantly lower level of activation in CR+/UR- trials, as compared to CR-/UR+ trials, at about 62-72 ms post-US (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>); this was close to but slightly earlier than the acquisition-baseline difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Each sensor that showed a peak response statistically different from the 100 ms pre-US time window (paired-t tests) is displayed on the field map as a black dot. For both early and late peaks, significant responses were identified in more than half of the sensors in all participants (Early peaks: 9/12, 7/14, 7/13 and 10/11 sensors for each participant. Late peaks: 10/12, 10/14, 10/13 and 9/11). Free energy values for the eight single dipole models were averaged across participants, with models fitted for subject-specific 4 ms windows of early (64–68, 54–58, 61–6, and 37-41 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> upper panel) and late responses (115–119, 81–85, 87–91, and 101-105 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> lower panel).

For the late peak, the right (contralateral) cerebellum lobule VI model was the winning model, but not significantly better than the right interposed nucleus model (△F=1.41, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> lower panel).

To explore the possibility that some activity may be temporally correlated to CRs, as previously found in animal recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">2017</xref>), we re-aligned the data using the CR onset of each CR+ trial and examined the average waveform.

To minimise false activations, we only accepted responses exceeding 50 ms in duration and 5 adjacent frequencies bins (5 Hz). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> shows the average time–frequency spectrograms (as percentage change of power from baseline) for the two sensors with the largest power change in participant 1-3. No significant power increase was found in participant 4’s data. We identified increased power in a frequency band of 5-35 Hz and a time window between 100-483 ms post-CS, with some individual differences. However, source analyses suggested the signals were from generators outside the brain (figure not shown). We consider the small number of sensors used in the experiment may have affected the performance of beamformer negatively. Noticeably, the sensors carrying the strongest signal were in the left hemisphere for 2/3 participants, unlike the right-hemisphere evoked responses for all 3 participants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).

Our aim was to identify electrophysiological markers for eyeblink conditioning in neurotypical adults. To begin with, we found multiphasic bipolar cerebellar evoked responses to the unconditioned air puff stimulus (US). We then showed that this US-related response attenuated in the acquisition phase and the attenuation was more pronounced in trials with conditioned responses (CRs). We however only found evoked responses in the CS-US interval when aligning trials to the onset of CRs. In a time-frequency analysis, there was no induced power-change response that we could attribute to a cerebellar origin.</p><p id="P35">The post-US evoked response was close to our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lin et al., 2019</xref>), with similar latencies and a multiphasic appearance. We again localised the sources within the cerebellum. In our previous study, we showed that this response did not originate from the somatosensory cortex or the eyes. We again found these evoked responses had no temporal correlation with the blink responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). We believe the response is most likely to be Purkinje cell activity. The dendritic trees of Purkinje cells align in the sagittal plane of the cerebellar cortex and have a high degree of synchrony within the same functional zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</xref>). Both features mean that Purkinje cells are likely to contribute to magnetic fields that can be detectable extracranially. In addition, the very powerful complex spike of Purkinje cells is a characteristic US-related activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ohmae &amp; Medina, 2015</xref>) and so may contribute to the US-related potentials. While the US also elicits neuronal activity in the deep nuclei, post-US responses in the nuclei were expected to be enhanced rather than attenuated by learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nicholson &amp; Freeman, 2000</xref>), which is at odds with the findings in this study.</p><p id="P36">Questions remain to be answered regarding the nature of some features of US-related responses. One thing that stood out is that we consistently observed multiple peaks, with early and late peaks evident in each participant. Our initial hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lin et al., 2019</xref>) was that we would detect complex spike responses. Animal studies have repeatedly found multiphasic complex spikes – hence the name – (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Eccles, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jirenhed et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Mostofi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Offenhauser et al., 2005</xref>) which have functional importance to learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Rasmussen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Rasmussen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Zang &amp; Schutter, 2019</xref>). However, these bursts are typically only of 5-10 ms duration and unlikely to directly explain the longer 50-100 ms timing of our responses. Unlike complex spikes, simple spikes are typically modulated around a high baseline firing rate, and simple spike firing is known to be increased by the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Nicholson &amp; Freeman, 2004</xref>) immediately before US-driven complex spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Burroughs et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the earlier component represents the modulation of simple spikes as has been suggested in a previous cerebellar MEG by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hashimoto et al., 2003</xref>). However, after learning, the simple spike rate typically reduces prior to the CR, releasing the cerebellar nuclear cells from inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jirenhed et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kotani et al., 2006</xref>). Hence it is difficult to disentangle possible bidirectional modulation of the simple spike rate. An alternative explanation could even reverse these suggestions. There is some evidence of an early complex spike response followed by a later simple spike burst responsible for the termination of the eye-blink (Ohmae et al 2021). If so, one would expect the early response to decline and the late response to shift, as the CR gradually replaces the UR; we cannot confirm this with our current results.</p><p id="P37">One of the main concerns regarding our hypothesis that the post-US response is driven by complex spikes is the latencies of the peaks observed in our studies (this paper and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lin et al, 2019</xref>). In small mammal recordings, the latencies of US-triggered complex spikes are around 25 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ohmae &amp; Medina, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref>) although they could range as far as 60 ms. Some of our responses, especially the late component, occurred much later, at 100-150 ms. Therefore, while the reduced GFP amplitudes in the acquisition phase together with a more prominent decrease of GFP in CR+ trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E &amp; F</xref>) are consistent with the expected reduction of complex spike activity after associative learning, as evident from animal recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Nicholson &amp; Freeman, 2003</xref>), our current evidence is not enough to conclude that the US-related evoked response is driven by complex spikes per se. Nor was it related to simple spike enhancement. Future studies are needed to further understand the neuronal sources of the response.</p><p id="P38">There were significant between-subject differences in the spatiotemporal distributions of these US-related responses. Comparison is challenging because the sensor layouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) on individual scannercasts differed substantially; additionally, the number of sensors available was low, hence spatial resolution is low. We calculated the average waveform from a single sensor in each dataset, chosen to have similar on-scalp position across participants and we showed these responses were largely comparable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), with a small negative deflation followed by a larger positive and then negative peak. For future studies, we plan to build composite helmets, so that we can maintain identical sensor layout when recording different people. By doing so, we can systematically study the spatiotemporal map of the US-related waveform and build norms in the general population.</p><p id="P39">CS-related complex spikes have been reported after acquisition of eye-blink conditioning in multiple animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Mostofi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ohmae &amp; Medina, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref>), typically with a peak of complex spike probability somewhat later and broader than that following the US. However, there was no visible peak in the CS-US interval in our data, except in participant 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Several reasons may be behind the result. First, learning is marked not only by CS-evoked complex spikes by also by strong simple spike suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hesslow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jirenhed et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Rasmussen et al., 2014</xref>) together with the pause and subsequent activation of nuclear neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref>). These concurrent responses may weaken signals in extracranial recordings. Second, there was only moderate evidence of conditioned behaviour in our experiment, implying learning may have not reached an optimal level. It is suggestive that the increase in post-CS potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) is greatest in participant 1 who had experienced one session of paired CS-US trials several months before. It may be valuable to adopt a pre- and post-acquisition design, in future experiments, to ensure stronger acquisition. Third, many studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Rasmussen et al., 2014</xref>) find that few Purkinje cells display enhanced complex spikes on every trial, after learning. Importantly, in their observations, simple spike suppression temporally proceeded the CS-driven complex spikes, when they were present, and was strongly correlated with the near absence of complex spikes in the later time points of CS-US intervals. Therefore, our findings raise an interesting question about how the intricate balance between enhanced and suppressed Purkinje cell activity is evident at population level, which is not easily answered by single unit recordings alone.</p><p id="P40">The nature of the small but significant cerebellar evoked responses identified in 3 out of 4 participants, when trial data were aligned to the onset of CRs, remains to be determined. The responses peaked immediately (&lt; 10 ms) before the peak of the CR eye blink, instead of at CR onset, so they were unlikely to be CS-driven complex spikes. One potential source may be conditioning-related spikes in the nuclear neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Rasmussen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">ten Brinke et al., 2017</xref>). However, the surface model we used for source reconstruction cannot differentiate between cortical and nuclear sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). We also found neither temporal nor amplitude correlation between individuals’ overall OP-MEG and their blink data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Correlations between neural activity and conditioned behaviours have been discovered in simple spike suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref>) and nuclear neuron facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">ten Brinke et al., 2017</xref>). Taking all evidence together, it is difficult to conclude on the functional implication or the neural generator of these CR-related responses.</p><p id="P41">A well-documented change of Purkinje cell activity after conditioning is the suppression of simple spikes during the CS-US interval, maximal just before the CR. The mechanism for this delayed response is still debated: it may be associated with delayed firing within the granule cell/Golgi cell/molecular layer interneuronal circuit, or to intrinsic dynamics of the Purkinje cells themselves. We analysed the induced power spectrogram in the CS-US time window. A previous EEG study observed reduction of power from beta-band (13-30 Hz), gamma-band (30-80 Hz), and up to 320 Hz that may be related to spike suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Todd et al., 2019</xref>). While beta and low-gamma bands are within the range of our analysis, frequencies beyond 80 Hz were not observable in the current study because of the limited bandwidth of the OPM sensors we used. Our analysis therefore searched for changes between 5-80 Hz. However, we could not find significantly decreased power in our data, and in fact 3 participants showed increase in power at 5-35 Hz and no source of theses power change was found inside the brain. Further studies are still much needed to find the neural representation of simple spike suppression after acquisition in the domain of M/EEG.</p><p id="P42">To summarise, for the first time we used OP-MEG to identify neural responses that are associated with classic eyeblink conditioning. We found attenuated US-related response after conditioning, with similarities to the complex spike firing rate changes observed in animal studies. We did not find strong evidence of other neural substrates, such as correlates of simple spike suppression or nuclear activity. Future studies could include (1) using a generic helmet to increase sample size; (2) ensuring stronger conditioning, potentially over several experimental sessions; (3) applying a high resolution cerebellar surface model that can enhance the spatial resolution of source location; (4) applying a neural mass model such as the dynamic causal modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kiebel, Garrido, et al., 2008</xref>) and (5) concomitant OP-MEG/EEG recording that can help us to better understand the neural signatures for eyeblink conditioning in OP-MEG, and hence to better understand the human cerebellar computation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS156209-supplement-Supplementary_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d87aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a Wellcome collaborative award to GRB, Matthew J.

conditioning experimental setup. The participant was seated inside a magnetically shielded room (MSR) wearing a customized ‘scannercast’. OPM sensors were inserted into slots covering the cerebellum. One more sensor was placed in the left infra-orbital slot to measure eyeblinks. Air-puffs were delivered to the outer canthus of the participant’s left eye via a nozzle connected to a bespoke air compressor. Both the air compressor and tone (CS) delivering speaker were controlled by a PC, which ran the custom-built experimental code. The data acquisition (DAQ) system recorded and synchronised OPM and trigger signals and then sent data to a data acquisition PC in real time. <bold>B</bold> Posterior sensor positions for the OP-MEG recordings. Positions on participant-specific ‘scannercasts’ that are most close to the cerebellum among all available slots were chosen based on each individual’s T1-weighted brain MRI.
