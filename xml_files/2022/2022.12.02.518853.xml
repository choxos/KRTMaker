SWDs begin in a cortical initiation network in both humans and animal models, including the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), where it is located in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). The behavioral manifestation of an AS occurs when SWDs spread from the cortical initiation site to the whole brain, however, the mechanisms behind this rapid propagation remain unclear. Here we investigated these processes beyond the principal CTC network, in higher-order (HO) thalamic nuclei (lateral posterior (LP) and posterior (PO) nuclei) since their diffuse connectivity and known facilitation of intracortical communications make these nuclei key candidates to support SWD generation and maintenance. In freely moving GAERS, multi-site LFP in LP, PO and multiple cortical regions revealed a novel feature of SWDs: during SWDs there are short periods (named SWD-breaks) when cortical regions far from S1, such the primary visual cortex (V1), become transiently unsynchronized from the ongoing EEG rhythm. Inactivation of HO nuclei with local muscimol injections or optogenetic perturbation of HO nuclei activity increased the occurrence of SWD-breaks and the former intervention also increased the SWD propagation-time from S1. The neural underpinnings of these findings were explored further by silicon probe recordings from single units of PO which uncovered two previously unknown groups of excitatory neurons based on their burst firing dynamics at SWD onset. Moreover, a switch from tonic to burst firing at SWD onset was shown to be an important feature since it was much less prominent for non-generalized events, i.e. SWDs that remained local to S1. Additionally, one group of neurons showed a reverse of this switch during SWD-breaks, demonstrating the importance of this firing pattern throughout the SWD. In summary, these results support the view that multiple HO thalamic nuclei are utilized at SWD onset and contribute to cortical synchrony throughout the paroxysmal discharge.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Epilepsy</kwd><kwd>somatosensory cortex</kwd><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>higher-order thalamic nuclei</kwd><kwd>ensemble recordings</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Absence seizures (ASs) are characterized by a transient lapse in consciousness and are present in several epilepsies including childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Crunelli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Panayiotopoulos et al., 1989</xref>). Despite a seizure remission rate of 60% in CAE, the impact of ASs remains evident in other facets of life as this epilepsy is co-morbid with social and learning difficulties as well as neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Caplan et al., 2008</xref>) including anxiety, depression and learning deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Caplan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Vega et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, approximately 30% of CAE patients are refractory to monotherapy with current first-choice treatments including ethosuximide, valproate and lamotrigine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Glauser et al., 2013</xref>), each with unwanted side-effects. The need for more effective treatments is clear and improving our understanding of the epileptogenic and ictogenic mechanisms of ASs will make this goal more achievable.</p><p id="P4">Spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs), the EEG hallmark of ASs, are thalamo-cortical driven oscillations that originate in cortical initiation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Benuzzi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Tenney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Westmijse et al., 2009</xref>) before propagating rapidly across the brain. This phenomenon was originally observed in multiple rat models, where the initiation site is the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Meeren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Polack et al., 2007</xref>). Due to the location of SWD initiation, the majority of research in animal models has been conducted on the somatosensory thalamo-cortical module including S1, the first-order (FO) ventrobasal thalamus (VB) and the inhibitory nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT). There are numerous changes in this network at SWD onset including increased cortico-cortical associations, led by S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Meeren et al., 2002</xref>) and feedforward inhibition to the FO VB nucleus via the NRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">McCafferty et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P5">However, this thalamic-cortical module also includes the higher-order (HO) thalamic nucleus, the posterior thalamic group (PO), which has recently come into focus. Being a HO nucleus, the PO receives direct driving input from deep layers of S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Sherman and Guillery, 1998</xref>) and even prior to SWD onset, there is an increased bidirectional communication between these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lüttjohann and Pape, 2019</xref>) that is maintained for the first 500 ms of a seizure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lüttjohann and van Luijtelaar, 2012</xref>). This feature has not been observed in the VB or NRT and thus could be unique to PO or reflect a potential reverberant excitatory role of HO nuclei in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lüttjohann and Pape, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lüttjohann and van Luijtelaar, 2012</xref>). Additionally, HO projections are not specific like FO nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Sherman and Guillery, 1998</xref>) since PO neurons project not only back to S1, but also to the primary motor cortex (M1) and higher-cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Casas-Torremocha et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ohno et al., 2012</xref>). These features make HO nuclei serious candidates to facilitate synchronization across the cortex but the extent to which they do this remains unknown.</p><p id="P6">Using freely-moving Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), a well-established polygenic model of ASs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Depaulis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Vergnes et al., 1986</xref>), this study provides causal evidence, via local pharmacological inhibition and selective optogenetic manipulation, that LP and PO facilitates the propagation and maintenance of SWDs from S1 to M1 and the primary visual cortex (V1). Moreover, single-unit recordings revealed that PO neurons are heterogeneous in their dynamics throughout SWDs and that the burst firing pattern is closely related to SWD onset and is utilized during SWD maintenance. Overall, this work highlights that multiple HO nuclei are potential targets to prevent the generalization and thus, the behavioral manifestation of ASs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animals</title><p id="P7">Experiments on male GAERS were undertaken in two establishments, the School of Biosciences, Neuroscience Division, Cardiff University, UK and the Department of Physiology, University of Szeged, Hungary.

A total of 94 PO units from 4 freely-moving GAERS were recorded with 4-shank silicon probes. As a population, the total firing rate began to decrease approximately 1.7 s before SWD start from 15.2 ± 1.1 Hz reaching a local minimum of 10.4 ± 0.6 Hz at 0.2 s before SWD onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).

At SWD onset, the burst firing of one group of units increased to ∼2 ± 0.2 Hz and continued at this rate throughout the entire discharge: these neurons were named persistent bursting (PB) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). The second group, named transient bursting (TB) neurons, had a similar increase in burst rate at SWD onset but then it reduced shortly after SWD onset from 1.7 ± 0.2 Hz to 0.5 ± 0.05 Hz which was maintained throughout the rest of the ictal period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). This dichotomy in PO ictal burst firing was quantified and cells were split in PB (n=64) or TB (n=30) groups using a gaussian mixture model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A, B</xref>). Both cellular groups returned to pre-ictal burst firing rates (&lt;0.25 Hz) by SWD offset.

Both groups went from an inter-ictal tonic rate of ∼12.5 Hz to an ictal rate of less than 5 Hz. During the switch from tonic to burst firing there was a transient decrease in total firing from approximately 15 to 11 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>) which reached a local minimum of ∼10 Hz at ∼300 ms before SWD onset. PB cells had sustained firing at 9.8 ± 0.5 Hz whereas TB cells had a drop in total firing that reflected the burst firing pattern and reached an ictal total firing rate of 4.2 ± 0.5 Hz. Notably, despite the ictal switch from tonic to burst firing, tonic firing remained the dominant firing pattern during SWD onset and throughout and, additionally, there was a large incidence of silence, particular in the TB cellular group associated with many SWCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p id="P38">Peri-SWC-spike histograms revealed that PB neurons preferentially fired action potentials from -1 to +3 ms with respect to the SWC-spike, whereas TB neurons fired from 0 - 5 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). A cumulative distribution function was also applied since it is less affected by variations in firing rate and this analysis showed both cellular groups were more likely to fire after the SWC-spike with only a 0.2 probability of firing before the SWC-spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). The tonic to burst firing switch of PO neurons was less prominent at the onset of non-generalized events when compared to successful SWDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).

These differences lasted for about 1 s after onset, i.e. the approximate duration of a non-generalized event, and the total firing rate was the same in both events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C, F</xref>).</p><p id="P39">The tonic to burst switch observed at SWD onset was transiently reversed during V1 SWD-breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A-C</xref>). In PB neurons, burst firing declined from approximately 1 s prior to the onset of SWD-breaks from 1.58±0.6 Hz to 1.25± 0.5 Hz at break onset which was balanced by an increase in tonic firing. During this period, rhythmicity also changed, as observed by differences in autocorrelations obtained from spikes during the break compared to pre-break epochs of similar duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D, E</xref>). This was quantified by comparing the co-efficient at non-zero maximal peaks: the first maximum peak was highest at -2 to -1s and there was no difference between -1 to 0 s and the break period. The reduction in rhythmicity is exaggerated by the second side-peak of the autocorrelation with both pre-break epochs being higher than that of the V1 SWD-break. TB cells showed an increase in tonic and total firing at SWD-break onset and had low rhythmicity throughout: therefore, maximal peaks were not compared to V1 SWD-breaks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S26" sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P40">This study provides causal evidence that HO nuclei are involved in the propagation and maintenance of generalized SWDs. Pharmacological manipulations via local muscimol infusions in LP and PO increase the SWD onset times and the occurrence of non-generalized events. Similarly, brief optogenetic perturbation of PO activity initiate SWD-breaks in various cortical regions. Interestingly, perturbations of LP and PO yield similar effects, despite the former not receiving direct input from the S1 initiation site. Furthermore, the neural basis of this influence was explored using single-unit recordings and we identified two PO neuronal sub-populations that differ in their ictal burst firing dynamics for the first time.</p><p id="P41">The contribution of PO to the generation of SWDs within the cortical initiation zone has already been indicated by observations of increased bidirectional coupling from a second before SWD onset and throughout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lüttjohann and van Luijtelaar, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">2012</xref>), potentially via direct excitatory reciprocal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Casas-Torremocha et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ohno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Veinante et al., 2000</xref>). Multiple studies show that PO stimulation results in excitation and sensitivity of cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Audette et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mease et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Zhang and Bruno, 2019</xref>), which in GAERS, are intrinsically hyperexcitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Polack et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, there is evidence of an increased driver synapse efficacy from S1 to PO in GAERS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Çavdar et al., 2012</xref>) and thus, both S1 and PO could be more prone to generating recurrent excitation. However, our results challenge the necessity of S1-PO interactions for generating SWDs, as following PO silencing, the number of SWDs do not change significantly. This could be because PO has a facilitatory role rather than a critical one, resulting in more subtle changes such as the increased onset delays observed in our study. Alternatively, the number of PO neurons effected in this study may not have been sufficient to completely stop SWD generation, instead, the duration of SWD generation could have increased due to lower number of functional PO neurons. Notably, the intralaminar nuclei have recently been shown to provoke ASs under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Salvati et al., 2022</xref>) and thus even HO thalamic nuclei without recurrent connections with the initiation site can be important in SWD generation.</p><p id="P42">In addition to affecting SWD generation, there are multiple ways the HO thalamus can be facilitating cortical synchrony throughout the SWD. The spike component of SWCs represents synchronized cortical firing and when HO, but not FO, thalamic nuclei are inhibited, the spike component is reduced in regions outside the initiation site (Terlau and Luttjohann, 2020), a finding that strongly supports a wider synchronizing role of the HO thalamus. This is corroborated by the result of our study showing that LP and PO manipulations cause a strong reduction in cortical SWD power, another measure of neuronal synchrony. Furthermore, our study highlights that even HO nuclei that do not receive projections from S1, i.e. LP, are involved in SWD propagation and maintenance, further indicating that cortical synchrony is not occurring solely by cortico-cortical connections from the initiation site. These findings therefore argue that to accurately model the generalization of SWD, HO nuclei and their topographic cortical regions need to be included (see Martynas and Crunelli, 2023).</p><p id="P43">Topographic recurrent loops between cortical regions and their related HO nuclei is an emerging feature of cortico-thalamic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). While PO-S1 excitation contributes to SWD generation, other thalamo-cortical modules do not have hyperexcitable pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Polack et al., 2007</xref>) and therefore these loops likely amplify rhythmic cortico-cortical excitation by entraining more neurons at every thalamocortical cycle until sufficient synchrony is obtained to result in an observable SWD. This process can explain the onset delays observed in our study. Although there is little overlap observed between these loops, such that S1 corticothalamic neurons project primarily to S1-projecting TC neurons in PO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Guo et al., 2020</xref>), there are PO neurons that do directly connect S1 to M1 and M2 via strong driver synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Mo and Sherman, 2019</xref>) as well as evidence of PO neurons projecting to both S1 and M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ohno et al., 2012</xref>). This creates an additional opportunity of SWD propagation via trans-thalamic communication from the cortical initiation site to other cortical regions, particularly if the overlap zone is larger in GAERS, which is yet to be investigated.</p><p id="P44">Alternatively, HO nuclei can potentiate cortical input via projections to the apical tufts of layer V pyramidal cells located in layer I (Ledderose et al., 2021, Diamond ME., 1995). Activation of these dendrites is known to trigger back-propagating calcium spikes that can increase the activity of the pyramidal cells when coincident with feedforward cortico-cortical input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Larkum et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, these superficial projections are not limited to specific cortical columns and thus provides a means of trans-thalamic communication and synchronization between thalamo-cortical modules. In these ways, each HO nuclei can be contributing locally to the integration of rhythmic cortical input during SWDs and the subsequent manifestation of an AS.</p><p id="P45">Our work provides the first insight of PO neuronal firing during SWDs in a freely moving GAERS. Sorokin et al. (2020) recorded from a mouse model of ASs and observed a ramp in PO firing preceding the onset, but this feature was variable and not observed here. However, overall firing rates were similar and alike Sorokin et al. (2020), a reduction in firing, followed by a sharp increase was observed just prior to SWD onset. Our work provides a major step forward to these results since we show that these dynamics represent an underlying shift from tonic to burst firing in the PO neuronal population.</p><p id="P46">We observed two sub-populations of PO neurons: TB neurons that fire bursts for the first second after SWD onset, the approximate duration of SWD generalization, and PB that fire bursts throughout the SWD. There was not a clear anatomical segregation between the groups as both cell types could be recorded during the same session and on the same shank. PO Connectivity and intrinsic cell dynamics are not homogeneous across PO, instead, there are distinct but overlapping input and output profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Casas-Torremocha et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Guo et al., 2020</xref>) as well as highly varied burst patterns, that could explain the heterogeneity observed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Desai and Varela, 2021</xref>). The complexity of thalamic neuronal dynamics at SWD onset extends to FO nuclei, where in VB neurons four groups of cells have been reported, including ‘onset peak’ and ‘sustained increase’ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">McCafferty et al., 2021</xref>), similar to those reported here.</p><p id="P47">The tonic to burst shift observed in PO neurons is much weaker at the onset of non-generalized events and is reversed during V1 SWD-breaks, suggesting that the burst firing pattern is key for PO to facilitate SWD generalization. As the burst firing can generate larger EPSPs in its downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hu and Agmon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Swadlow and Gusev, 2001</xref>), this may be a contributing factor to its associations with S1. These dynamics must be governed by an inhibitory input as hyperpolarization is necessary for burst firing. As S1 input is excitatory, this inhibition must occur via NRT or other extra-thalamic inhibitory afferents from the anterior pretectal nucleus or the zona incerta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Barthó et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bokor et al., 2005</xref>). Notably, the zona incerta has reciprocal connections with the initiation site and when inhibited, reduces SWD occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Liang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Shaw et al., 2013</xref>). Although S1 has been shown to affect VB neurons via the NRT during SWD (McCaff), this cannot be generalised to the PO since NRT microcircuits between FO and HO differ in their location and properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Martinez-Garcia et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P48">In conclusion, our study provides causal evidence that HO nuclei, both those with and those without reciprocal connectivity with the cortical initiation site, are involved in SWD propagation. Therefore, the generalization of SWDs, and thus the manifestation of ASs, is not only determined by cortico-cortical connections, but also on more local thalamo-cortical modules and potentially trans-thalamic communication. These facilitatory mechanisms co-occur with a shift from tonic to burst firing of PO neurons and the complexity of thalamic neuronal activity during ASs is reflected in sub-populations of PO neurons. We now understand that SWD generalization and maintenance goes beyond the somatosensory loop and that there is a need for more detailed investigations into HO nuclei as a whole in the context of absence epilepsy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS158085-supplement-Supplementary_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d82aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust PhD studentship to ZA (grant 204014/A/16/Z to VC), the Ester Floridia Neuroscience Research Foundation (grant 1502 to VC), the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (Grants NN125601 and FK123831 to M.L.L.), the Hungarian Brain Research Program (grant KTIA_NAP_13-2-2014-0014), UNKP-20-5 New National Excellence Program of the Ministry for Innovation and Technology from the source of the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund to MLL.
