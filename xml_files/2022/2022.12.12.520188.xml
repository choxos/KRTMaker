In line with dual-process theory, animal studies have provided convincing evidence for dissociable neural mechanisms, mainly manifested in cortico-striatal regions, involved in goal-directed and habitual action control. While substantial progress has been made in characterizing the neural mechanism underlying habit learning in animals, we still lack knowledge on how habits are formed and maintained in the human brain. Thus far only one study, conducted more than a decade ago by Tricomi et al. (2009), has been able to induce habitual behavior in humans via extensive training. This study also implicated the posterior putamen in the process, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, recent attempts to replicate the behavioral results of this study were not successful. This leaves the research of human habits, and particularly the research of their formation through extensive repetition, as well as their neural basis, limited and far behind the animal research in the field. This motivated us to (1) attempt to replicate the behavioral and imaging main findings of Tricomi et al., (2) identify further functional and microstructural neural modifications associated with habit formation and manifestation, and (3) investigate the relationships between functional and structural plasticity and individual differences in habit expression. To this end, in this registered report we used Tricomi et al.’s free-operant task along with multi-modal MRI methods in a well-powered sample (n=123). In this task participants’ sensitivity to outcome devaluation (an index of goal-directed/habitual action control) is tested following either short or extensive training. In contrast to our hypothesis, we were not able to demonstrate habit formation as a function of training duration nor were we able to relate any functional or microstructural plasticity in the putamen with individual habit expression. We found that a pattern of increased activations in the left head of caudate that re-occurred across each day’s training is associated with goal directed behavior and that increased processing of devalued cues in low-level visual regions was indicative of goal-directed behavior (and vice versa). In a follow-up exploratory analysis comparing habitual and goal-directed subgroups within each experimental group, we found that elevated activations in frontoparietal regions during early stages of training, as well as increased reactivity towards still-valued cues in somatosensory and superior parietal regions were found in individuals that were more inclined to perform goal-directed behavior (compared with more habitual individuals). Taken together, regions commonly implicated in goal-directed behavior were most predictive of individual habit expression. Finally, we also found that differential patterns of training-related microstructural plasticity, as measured with diffusion MRI, in midbrain dopaminergic regions were associated with habit expression. This work provides new insights into the neural dynamics involved in individual habit formation/expression and encourages the development and testing of new, more sensitive, procedures for experimental habit induction in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Habit</kwd><kwd>goal-directed behavior</kwd><kwd>functional plasticity</kwd><kwd>microstructural plasticity</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>visual cortex</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Action control, acquired through instrumental learning, is hypothesized to be determined by an interplay between two distinct systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>: one responsible for goal-directed behaviors and another that forms and executes habitual behaviors. Goal-directed behavior relies on a relatively careful consideration of the available information and is particularly dependent on the association between a response and its outcome (R-O)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Therefore, it allows executing carefully planned actions and the flexibility to adjust them in order to maximize desired outcomes when circumstances change (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>). However, this behavior is cognitively taxing. In contrast, habitual behavior is considered to be automatic and is cognitively undemanding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. It relies on the association between a stimulus and a response (S-R) and thus relatively fixed and insensitive to changes in outcome value. Newly acquired instrumental actions are at first goal-directed and are sensitive to changes in outcome value. However, with extensive training, namely through behavioral repetition, a qualitative shift emerges as responding becomes autonomous and is automatically triggered by an associated stimulus, regardless of changes in outcome value or in R-O contingency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> (for review see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>). Notably, the vast majority of the evidence supporting this dual-system account of action control and its dynamics has been accumulated from animal research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> (mostly rats), whereas it is yet to be well-established and characterized in humans.</p><p id="P3">Habitual action control is typically adaptive, liberating mental resources while automating usually beneficial actions. However, an imbalance with the goal-directed system in the “struggle” for action control and more specifically, overreliance on the habitual system, constitutes a key feature in several psychopathologies. Such malfunction has been implicated in addiction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, social anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, Tourette syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, characterizing the interplay between these two systems and specifically the shift from goal-directed to habitual control, as well as understanding the underlying neural mechanisms, are of great importance for psychotherapeutical and clinical interventions.</p><p id="P4">A substantial landmark in the habit learning field has been the development of the reinforcer devaluation paradigm in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. This paradigm successfully dissociates goal-directed from habitual behavior, based on whether a learned action had become insensitive to outcome devaluation (usually through food satiation or conditioned taste aversion). It became a pivotal measurement method of habits, yielding fruitful insights in animal research. A major contribution of this paradigm has been its capacity to demonstrate the transition from goal-directed behavior (sensitive to outcome devaluation) to habitual behavior (insensitive to outcome devaluation), as a result of extensive instrumental training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Different human paradigms, aimed to utilize the devaluation sensitivity criterion, have been developed since (e.g. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>). The majority of these tasks aimed to distinguish S-R from R-O action control to point at inter-individual differences or pathologic group tendencies (e.g. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>), identify relevant modulators (e.g. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>), or discern their neural correlates (e.g. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>). However, apart from the one study conducted by Tricomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, habit learning, as acquired through behavioral repetition, has not been clearly demonstrated.</p><p id="P5">Neuroscientific research has identified distinct brain regions corresponding with the formation and execution of goal-directed behavior and habits. In rodents, the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), the prelimbic cortex (PL) and the nucleus accumbens are the main regions implicated in goal-directed control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. The execution of habitual responding is particularly dependent on the dorsolateral striatum (DLS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, gradually gaining response-control across the course of learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. In humans, homologous to the rodent DMS, the anterior caudate nucleus, and homologous to the PL, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, were implicated in goal directed behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In contrast, the research of the neural mechanisms underlying habitual control in humans is limited. There is evidence that the human putamen is homologous to the rodent DLS in habitual action control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. McNamee et al. implicated the posterior putamen in stimulus-triggered actions, suggesting it has a specific role in habit-associated S-R encoding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. De Wit et al. found that elevated gray matter density in the posterior putamen and white matter tract strength between this region and the premotor cortex are linked to individual tendency to habit-like performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. However, thus far only Tricomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> implicated the posterior putamen in habit learning, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).</p><p id="P6">Based on accumulated knowledge, demonstrating habit induction in healthy humans and as follows, characterizing its underlying neural mechanisms, is still a considerable challenge. Although it was extensively demonstrated in animals for decades, only the above-mentioned procedure by Tricomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> was able thus far to demonstrate the shift from goal-directed to habitual control through extensive training in humans and point at relevant neural mechanisms. However, these prominent findings have yet to be successfully replicated. Moreover, a recent study reported five failures in experimental habit induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, two of which were attempts to replicate the behavioral findings of Tricomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Thus, the reliability of the habit induction procedure utilized by Tricomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> is currently unclear. Furthermore, to date, there is no other paradigm that has been able to reliably induce habits through extensive training in humans. Consequently, the neural mechanisms underlying the formation (through behavioral repetition) and manifestation of habits have yet to be characterized.</p><p id="P7">The discrepancy in results across human research, the gap between animal and human literature on habits and the fact that habits are such a fundamental feature of human behavior, motivated us to establish the experimental induction of habit learning and characterize its underlying neural mechanisms in humans.</p><p id="P8">In the current work we aimed to replicate and expand the findings of Tricomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> with a well-powered sample using multi-modal MRI methods. We conducted a power analysis using the <italic>fMRIPower</italic> tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> of the effect demonstrated by Tricomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> in the right putamen, as defined by the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. This analysis yielded an n=61 for the extensive training group where the effect in the posterior putamen was observed. Therefore, we aimed to obtain data from 122 valid participants: 61 in each of two groups, differ in their training duration: short vs. extensive. Apart from the replication attempt of the Tricomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> findings, this well-powered sample also allowed us to test for further functional correlates with habit formation and manifestation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">Materials and methods</xref>). Additionally, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans to probe micro-structural brain plasticity related to habit formation. We chose to use this method as in recent years it has been repeatedly shown that DTI indices can point at learning-induced neuroplasticity in gray matter regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Finally, we constructed a parametric index based on task performance, that measures the level of individual habit expression and correlated this measure with structural and functional measurements to identify neural determinants of habit formation. Our target sample size was four times larger than the one used by Tricomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and thus had the potential to reliably identify relevant effects at both the individual and group levels that were not possible in the original study.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Hypothesis</title><p id="P9">We hypothesized that extensive training will render responding habitual. The study conducted by Tricomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> was carried out in a considerably different environment than the unsuccessful replication attempts of its behavioral findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. The original study was performed inside an MRI scanner, whereas the replication attempts were performed in common behavioral setting. Critically, such discrepancy with regard to the induction of habits, which heavily rely on the associations between responses and cues and contexts, may have led to different behavioral effects. Factors that may have potentially biased the behavioral effect as a function of the different environment include: (1) participants inside the MRI scanner may experience more stress which promotes habit formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>; (2) on the other hand, volunteers for MRI experiments may be self-selected to have low rates of stress and anxiety, allowing the manifestation of more goal-directed behavior following short training, thereby sharpening the differential effect of short and extensive training on action control; (3) The unusual and salient context of the MRI environment may impose S-R associations more robustly; (4) The loud noise in the MRI scanner may exploit some cognitive resources which may reduce the reliance on the goal-directed system (As evidenced by the effect of cognitive load on characteristics and strategies related to goal-directed action control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>); (5) reduced arousal inside the MRI scanner may negatively affect goal directed action control. Taken together, we presumed that at least some of these factors enhance the formation and/or manifestation of habitual responding as a function of training duration. Thus, we expected to successfully replicate the behavioral findings of Tricomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">Nonetheless, we considered the consequences of the possibility that the behavioral data would not support our hypothesis. This should not affect the individual level analyses we planned to perform; however, it is crucial for the interpretation of the group level analyses of the imaging data. Therefore, we stated that in case we would not observe the hypothesized behavioral effect, we will conduct an exploratory analysis, in which we will define two well-distinct subgroups for each experimental group. One subgroup will include participants who had expressed habitual responding and the other will include those who had not. The clustering will be based on a habit index calculated from the behavioral data (see in Individual differences in functional MRI for details on the generation of this index). Then, we will compare these subgroups within training conditions to identify functional and micro-structural differences.</p><p id="P11">We hypothesized that regions within the corticostriatal network will be implicated in habit formation and expression. For an elaborated depiction of the hypotheses and their corresponding confirmatory analyses of the neuroimaging data see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. We expected that changes in activity and micro-structural plasticity in the putamen will be involved in habit learning while similar indices in the anterior caudate and vmPFC will be implicated in goal-directed action control. Nevertheless, the (goal-directed action control associated) R-O contingencies in our task are very easy to learn. Thus, it is highly likely that the anterior caudate and the vmPFC would not be employed differentially enough throughout the task to yield an effect in most of our planned analyses (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Data analysis</xref>). Therefore, the analysis of these regions is considered exploratory unless noted differently in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p id="P12">In point 1 the ROI analysis is based on the automated anatomical labeling atlas, which was used for the power analysis of the effect demonstrated by Tricomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> in the right putamen. For all other analyses we used small volume correction analysis using a mask based on the Harvard-Oxford atlas. All the within-group and between-group analyses require that the behavioral results demonstrate habitual responding as a function of training duration (when comparing sensitivity to outcome devaluation between groups) in order to relate their neuroimaging results to habits.

Failing to comply with any of these criteria prevented participation in the experiment. They also rated their liking on a Likert pleasantness scale (ranging from -5, very unpleasant, to 5, very pleasant) toward three sweet and three savory snacks which were later used to choose from at the beginning of the experiment. To ensure participants’ desire to earn and eat snacks, participants who did not rate the highest sweet and highest savory snacks with at least +2 did not participate in the study. Finally, participants were asked to fill out the eating attitudes test (EAT-26<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>) to account for eating disorders.

Upon their arrival and before scanning, participants were asked to taste three sweet and three savory snacks and choose their favorite one of each type. We used snacks comprised of small pieces: the sweet set included M&amp;M, Skittles and a Maltesers-like Israeli snack of small chocolate balls; the savory set included potato chips, Doritos and cashews. The one sweet and one savory snacks chosen by each participant were then used throughout the entire experiment. Afterwards, participants entered the MRI scanner and first underwent DTI and resting-state scans. Then, they performed the free-operant task, consisting of three main stages: (1) training, (2) outcome devaluation and (3) extinction test. The training was comprised of 8-minute sessions. The amount of training sessions was varied between two experimental groups: either two sessions on a single day (1-day group) or 12 sessions, four on each of three consecutive days (3-day group). During all training sessions and the extinction test, participants were scanned using fMRI, whereas the devaluation procedure was conducted outside the scanner. Before starting and after completing the task phase on each day, participants’ DTI data was obtained. Anatomical scans were completed at the end of each day. An additional resting-state scan was performed after completing the task phase on the last day. Following the completion of the free-operant task and all scanning procedures, participants underwent a working memory capacity assessment and were asked to fill out a battery of questionnaires aimed at estimating the relationships between individual factors and tendencies to manifest habits as well as obtain self-report indices of habits. Participants also performed a variant of the two-step sequential decision- making task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, which has been shown to dissociate the use of model-free and model-based decision-making strategies. These strategies are hypothesized to reflect goal-directed and habitual action control. The experiment was programmed and run in Matlab (The MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) using the Psychophysics toolbox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. For the working memory capacity assessment, we used a computerized task (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Working memory assessment</xref>) programmed and run using Inquisit Lab (Millisecond Software, Seattle, WA, USA).</p><sec id="S7"><title>Free-operant task</title><sec id="S8"><title>Training</title><p id="P18">Each training session was comprised of 12 task blocks of 20 or 40 seconds and eight rest blocks of 20 seconds. During the task blocks, participants were trained on two Stimulus-Response-Outcome (S-R-O) associative structures to induce instrumental learning of two sets, each including a different discriminative stimulus. During each task block, participants were presented with a fractal (stimulus) along with an illustration of a corresponding button. Pressing this button (response) either yielded a snack reward (outcome), represented by its picture, to be consumed following the training, or a gray circle appearing briefly, indicating no reward. If any other button was pressed, the display did not change. Participants were instructed that they can press the button as often or as little as they like during the presentation of the fractal. We further instructed them that if they do not want any more of their favorite savory or sweet snack, they do not have to continue pressing and that otherwise they should try to earn as much reward as possible. Participants were also instructed to pay attention to the pairings of fractals and foods and that they will be tested on them later. Rewards were delivered on a 10-second variable interval (VI) schedule, implemented as 0.1 probability of reward becoming available every second. If a reward had become available, it was delivered on the next button press. Each fractal was associated with a particular button press and a particular snack consistently throughout the entire experiment for each participant, but counterbalanced across participants. A different fractal was used to indicate the rest blocks, where participants were asked not to respond. Each fractal appearance and disappearance marked the beginning and the end of a block, respectively. Block order was pseudo-randomized such that the same block type would not occur consecutively. At the beginning of the first day, before entering the scanner, participants were presented with the instructions for the training and underwent a short practice round. After completing each day’s training, participants received 0.5 snack pieces for their consumption for every snack reward won. <italic>Outcome devaluation</italic>. Following completion of all training sessions, participants underwent a selective satiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> outside the scanner, in order to devalue either the sweet or the savory snack (counterbalanced across participants). To accomplish that, participants received a large amount of one of the snacks, provided in a large bowl (~1.4 liter), and were encouraged to consume it until it is no longer pleasant to them. Participants were further instructed that the size of the bowl is arbitrary and that they should ask for a refill if it has become empty and the snack is still pleasant to them. When deciding to stop eating, participants were asked if they are sure. The instructions accompanying this procedure were aimed to ensure that participants’ report of satiety is genuine and not due to the potentially intimidating laboratory setting.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Extinction</title><p id="P19">Subsequent to outcome devaluation, participants were placed back in the scanner, where they performed a three-minute extinction test. The extinction test was implemented in the same manner as the training phase and accordingly, participants were told that they will perform the same task as before. However, during this phase, responses were not rewarded. This phase consisted of nine 20-seconds blocks: three task blocks for each of the two associative structures and three rest blocks.</p><p id="P20">The goal of this part was to test whether responding has been rendered habitual, as measured by comparing the change in the response rate toward the valued outcome following devaluation with the change in response rate toward the devalued outcome following devaluation. A selective reduction in response rate toward the devalued outcome relative to the valued outcome serves as an evidence for goal-directed behavior, whereas the lack of such differentiation indicates insensitivity to outcome value and thus considered as an evidence for habitual control.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Reacquisition</title><p id="P21">We added a reacquisition test to exploratory evaluate the extent to which the selective satiation procedure is effective, and to examine how outcome presentation affects responding. Following extinction, participants performed another run comprised of nine 20-second blocks, three of each type, during which the outcomes were available again (as in the training stage). This phase was conducted inside the scanner to avoid context-related confounds.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Manipulation check</title><p id="P22">Participants were asked to rate on Likert scales their hunger (1, very full; 10, very hungry) and pleasantness towards each of the two snacks (-5, very unpleasant; 5, very pleasant) prior to each day’s training, following the devaluation procedure and at the end of the experiment upon completion of post-task scans. Regarding the pleasantness ratings, they were instructed not to rate the general pleasantness of each snack but rather to rate how pleasant a piece of each snack would have been pleasant to them at that moment. This allowed us to conduct a manipulation check for the outcome devaluation procedure, verifying it had indeed reduced the pleasantness for the devalued snack relative to the valued snack. Following devaluation, we used a similar pleasantness rating to obtain participants’ pleasantness toward the fractal images. Additionally, following the first day’s training, we assessed participants’ contingency awareness by presenting them each fractal and asking them to rate which of the snacks was more likely to be earned when pressing the corresponding button (-5, the specified sweet snack was more likely; 5, the specified savory snack was more likely) on a Likert-scale.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Working memory assessment</title><p id="P23">After completing the experiment, the participants were asked to perform a working memory capacity task. We used an automatic version of the Operation Span (OSPAN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> procedure to assess working memory capacity for each participant. In this task, participants were asked to remember a series of letters while solving arithmetic problems.

Participants were asked to choose between two actions, and according to their choice, they were stochastically transitioned into a visually identifiable outcome state where a reward (ranging from 0-100 points) is delivered following a key press. The task includes two key modifications to the original two-step task, each designed to improve task sensitivity to the action selection strategy used by individual participants. Firstly, participants were not asked to make a choice at the second level state; rather, they simply press a key to receive the reward associated with the outcome state. This design both simplifies the learning task from the perspective of the participant, and improves model identifiability by exacerbating the value discrepancy between first-level actions (see Kool et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> for a detailed discussion). Second, like the original two-step task, participants are asked to learn the probability of obtaining a reward at each outcome state; however, reward magnitudes will randomly vary from 1-100 point (0 being considered a loss). This modification exaggerates the learning signals associated with model-free (which learns according to observed reward magnitudes), and model-based (which learns about observed reward probability) controllers, further dissociating the behavioral signature associated with each strategy.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Questionnaires</title><p id="P25">After completing the experiment, participants were asked to fill out a battery of questionnaires aimed to explore potential moderators of behavioral and neural effects (or an interaction between them) observed in the experiment.

Similarly, non-diffusion images of opposite phase-encoding direction were not acquired for five participants (four in the extensive training group and one in the short training group). Therefore, we preprocessed their DTI data without the susceptibility-induced distortion correction. In both cases, we tested whether the inclusion of these participants has a substantial influence on our findings by repeating all analyses without them. We found that removing these participants did not affect the pattern of any of our main fMRI and DTI results.

This suggests that this procedure, at least with the currently used training parameters, may not be sensitive enough to either differentially induce or identify differences in habit formation as a function of training duration.</p><p id="P61">Although we did not find a group x outcome type interaction effect, we did find a main effect of outcome type (valued vs. devalued; F<sub>1,121</sub> = 40.73, p &lt; 0.001, ω<sup>2</sup> = 0.07), driven by a smaller reduction in response rate for the still-valued outcome compared to the devalued outcome following outcome devaluation (t<sub>60</sub> = 5.26 for the short training group, t<sub>61</sub> = 3.88 for the extensive training group; p &lt; 0.001). A comparison of the response-rate for the two outcomes strictly during the test phase (after devaluation) followed the same pattern (t<sub>60</sub> = 5.13 for the short training group, t<sub>61</sub> = 4.25 for the extensive training group; p &lt; 0.001). We also verified that the difference between outcome types was not present prior to outcome devaluation (short training group: t<sub>60</sub> = -0.87, p = 0.389; extensive training group: t<sub>61</sub> = 0.72, p = 0.472). While these results are aligned with the interpretation that participants in both groups were goal-directed, this effect was mainly driven by a small subset of participants in each group, whereas the majority of participants (in both groups) responded habitually (See Exploratory subgroup analysis). Additionally, we found a main effect of group (F<sub>1,121</sub> = 7.34, p = 0.008, ω<sup>2</sup> = 0.05). This effect stems from a lower response rate in the short-training group compared to the extensive-training group prior to the outcome devaluation (t<sub>120.3</sub> = -2.93, p = 0.004; see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

A detailed description of the method and results of this analysis can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material</xref>. Briefly, to adhere to the analysis used by Pool et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup> we first conducted an exploratory factorial analysis on the relevant questionnaire data (STAI, TICS and BIS-11) to identify relevant factors and specifically to look for a factor that largely corresponds with stress affect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We then included the factor most corresponding with stress affect along with Devaluation (valued or devalued outcome), Group (1-day or 3-day) and all possible interactions as independent variables in a mixed-effects linear regression model where the dependent measure is the change in response rate following outcome devaluation. We used participant as a random factor. We found a trending interaction between the stress affect, devaluation and group (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 3.55, p=0.059), indicating stress affect may modulate the interaction between devaluation and training length. We followed this analysis with a simple slope approach and tested the interaction between devaluation and group for participants low (-1 SD) and high (+1 SD) on the stress affect measure. We did not find an effect (though a weak trend) for participants with low levels of this measure (<italic>β</italic>= -0.38, 95%CI [-0.82, 0.06], <italic>p</italic>=0.097) and no significant effect for those with high levels (<italic>β</italic>= 0.24, 95%CI [-0.21, 0.68], <italic>p</italic>=0.304; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).

The results of this analysis descriptively indicate a trend in increase in bilateral putamen reactivity to learned cues following extensive training (t<sub>61</sub> = 1.923, p=0.059). Moreover, a visual inspection of the unthresholded z-score maps of the same contrast reveal a clear differential response profile of the anterior and posterior subregions of the bilateral putamen, such that activation (to learned cues) decreases following extensive training in the anterior parts and appears to increase (though to a smaller extent) in the posterior parts (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).

As noted above, when observing the behavioral data from the pre-registered analyses we noticed that the devaluation-induced effects indicating goal-directed behavior in both groups were driven only by a distinct subset of participants, whereas many participants in both groups actually responded habitually. This further motivated the following goal-directed vs. habitual subgroup analysis approach.</p><sec id="S55"><title>Clustering participants into subgroups based on their habit index</title><p id="P79">In this exploratory analysis we performed the following steps: (1) We removed extremely unengaged participants (with &lt; 3SD response rate during the last training run from their group average). This resulted in the removal of three participants from the extensive training group. (2) A decrease in responding towards both outcomes to some extent could be probably best explained by a general motivational effect and thus be aligned with the interpretation of habitual behavior. However, our habit index calculation would also characterize participants who extremely reduced their response rate toward both outcomes as habitual. We surmise such cases most likely represent goal-directed behavior that accounts for general satiety. Thus, we re-calculated the habit index for participants who reduced their responding towards both snacks in more than 90% following outcome devaluation, by measuring the difference between the mean response rate toward both snacks after devaluation minus the same measure before devaluation. (3) Following previous work by some of the coauthors of this manuscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>, to identify latent subgroup in each training group we ran a finite mixture model on the habit index using the Flexmix R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup>. We ran the model using k=1 to 5 clusters and found that two clusters within each group were best suited to explain the habit index data (based on the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). The two clusters appear to separately capture habitual participants (with values around 0) and goal-directed participants (with larger values). (4) As a final step we exploited the results of the cluster analysis to identify and remove a minority of participants who appeared to respond irrationally (responding much more for the devalued compared to the still-valued outcome during the extinction test). To achieve this, we removed participants that were classified in the “goal-directed” cluster despite their habit index being lower (rather than higher) than participants in the “habitual cluster” (See the left tail of the “goal-directed” clusters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>).

Similar to previous attempts to induce habits using this procedure in behavioral settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>, we did not find the hypothesized effect of decreased devaluation sensitivity (as an index of habit formation) following extensive compared with short training. Surprisingly, we found that in the original contrast used, the putamen reduced, rather than increased, its activity following extensive training to cues associated with a rewarded action. Nevertheless, focusing specifically on the posterior putamen (in an exploratory follow-up analysis), the sub-region of the putamen in which Tricomi et al. 23 found the increased activation (the posterior part), we found an effect trending in the same direction as in the original study (but given the absence of the main hypothesized behavioral effect we cannot relate it to habits). Furthermore, we used our relatively large sample, to identify functional and micro-structural neural correlates of individual habit expression. We found that within-day increased activity (that is, an increase across each of the three training days throughout the daily training, averaged across days) in the left head of caudate toward cues paired with rewarded actions was associated with goal-directed behavior and vice versa. Additionally, we found that a low-level visual region (the left intracalcarine sulcus) was more reactive toward devalued vs. still-valued cues in goal-directed participants but not in habitual participants. We did not identify any micro-structural plasticity (as indexed by changes in MD and FA) related with individual habit expression. Finally, as planned for the case of null behavioral effect, we conducted an exploratory analysis comparing goal-directed and habitual subgroups (clustered based on the behavioral data) within each experimental group. We found a reduction in activation in the bilateral intraparietal sulcus towards cues associated with rewarded actions as training progressed in goal-directed participants but not in habitual ones (within the extensive training group). Additionally, within the short training group, we found that parietal regions (right superior parietal lobule and postcentral gyrus) became more reactive toward still-valued vs. devalued cues following outcome devaluation in goal-directed participants compared with habitual participants.

Although not conclusive, we found a trend indicating a moderating role for the affective component of stress on habit formation as a function of training extension (for an elaborated discussion on this potential moderating role see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>). As Pool et al. had a substantially larger sample, the fact that this effect was only trending in the present data may reflect reduced power of this smaller sample size. Still, taken together, the present work together with the aforementioned previous replication attempts form a solid body of evidence suggesting that the Tricomi et al. paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> is of limited utility in terms of its capacity to elicit training-related effects on the behavioral expression of habits in a robust manner.</p><p id="P88">Particular contributions of the present work to determining the efficacy of Tricomi et al.’s procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> include the involvement of two of the original study’s coauthors (first and last authors) which helps to prevent significant misalignments of the methods and analyses between the original and the present work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup>. Another important and unique contribution of this work is that, while the previous replication attempts were behavior-only studies, in the present work the behavioral task was performed during fMRI scans, similar to the original study. As mentioned above, Pool et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup> found that participants with lower rates of the affective component of stress (which includes anxiety) exemplify the hypothesized effect of training extension on habit formation. In light of recent evidence showing lower rates of anxiety in participants enrolling in fMRI studies compared to participants enrolling in behavioral studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup>, it has been suggested that a self-selection bias may have been responsible for the contradictory results obtained when utilizing the Tricomi et al.’s procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> in different experimental settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>. Specifically, in the behavior-only replication attempts participants may have been self-selected to have higher anxiety rates compared with participants in the original fMRI study. Such an explanation could have potentially reconciled the discrepancies between the effect observed in Tricomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and the lack of similar effects in De Wit et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> and Pool et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>. Here, by using an fMRI setting, we tested this possibility directly and our results provide evidence that the experimental setting along with potential anxiety-based self-selection biases are not sufficient to account for the discrepancy between the original study and subsequent replication attempts. Whether or not a selection bias does occur in a given fMRI study will depend on the specific recruitment procedures used at particular research centers, and thus it remains possible that this bias did contribute to differences between the behavioral effects observed in the current and the original study. However, it is most parsimonious to assume that either the main behavioral result of the original study was a false positive or that the discrepancies in results are attributable to other unknown factors.</p><p id="P89">Similar to Pool et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>, and largely consistent with the results obtained by De Wit et al. when the researchers used the same procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, close inspection of the data obtained in our study (supported by empirical evidence obtained by the cluster analysis of the habit index) revealed an interesting finding. In both groups, while the statistical analysis indicated the presence of sensitivity to outcome devaluation and thereby the dominance of goal-directed behavior, in practice, only a small subset of participants that responded in a goal-directed manner drove this effect, whereas the majority of participants responded habitually (i.e., were insensitive to outcome devaluation). This suggests, perhaps counterintuitively, that this paradigm fails to exemplify habit formation as a function of training duration due to it being too prone to rapidly induce habits, instead of not being able to induce habits following extensive training. At least as it is currently being used, this paradigm appears not to be sensitive enough to capture sufficient variability in sensitivity to outcome devaluation. Participants’ rapid development of habit-like behavior (insensitivity to outcome devaluation) hinders the detection of effects induced by the additional training sessions in the 3-day group. Therefore, future efforts to change this procedure or establish a new one to reliably induce habits through training extension, may benefit from initially focusing on methods to prevent rapid manifestation of insensitivity to outcome devolution. One clear target for modification in future studies is the reinforcement schedule. The Tricomi et al. paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> uses a variable interval (VI) reinforcement schedule which has been shown to enhance habit formation compared with variable ratio (VR) reinforcement schedule in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref></sup>. While the capacity of these two reinforcement schedules in forming habits have not been directly compared in humans, our evidence may imply that a similar effect in humans exists and motivates the use of VR schedules in future studies in order to avoid rapid habit formation. Furthermore, based on other studies and the present study, it appears that habit formation and expression vary considerably across individuals and seem to be susceptible to multiple individual differences factors and moderating effects (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref></sup>). Investing more effort in identifying these factors and, in turn, accounting for them, may be necessary in order to establish experimental habit induction in humans.</p><p id="P90">Another possible limitation of this paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> is that it is unclear whether the devaluation test as implemented, is sufficient to adequately distinguish goal-directed from habitual behavior. Using a test that can confidently attribute “goal-directedness” to observed actions (to ensure that an unchanged response pattern following outcome devaluation is indeed habitual) was recently suggested as a criterion that has to be satisfied in order to reliably interpret the results of research in the field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref></sup>. It is possible that the procedure we used here does not satisfy this criterion for various possible reasons, including the following: (1) Participants were most likely aware that they did not have to eat their potential devalued winnings during the test session; (2) Responding during the test toward the devalued outcome imposed little to no cost at all on participants. The only cost was the supposedly physical effort of pressing a keyboard button. We suggest that it is likely that at least some of the participants may have responded toward the devalued outcome simply as it had no tangible cost and the only viable alternative was to sit and stare at a static fractal image (which may not be preferable for some); (3) Similarly, the potential cognitive effort of withholding the signaled response may have been larger than the physical effort of pressing the button, and these two types of efforts may have been thoughtfully considered in a goal-directed manner rather than being automatically executed. Therefore, we suggest that future attempts to establish experimental habit induction procedures in humans could put more of an emphasis on aligning participants' incentives with their actions. To achieve this, future procedures could incorporate a tangible cost imposed on each action (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref></sup> for such implementation in the context of the two-step task with incorporated outcome devaluation) and allow the utilization of other actions beside choosing between responding or doing nothing.</p></sec><sec id="S64"><title>The putamen’s role in training and habitual action control</title><p id="P91">A key neural hub thought to be dominant in acquiring and executing habitual behavior is the putamen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. This motivated us to place it in the center of various analyses conducted as part of this research and to hypothesize it would be correlated with habit expression at both the group and individual levels. Comparing cue-related BOLD activations in early vs. final stages of extensive training, similar to the analysis conducted by Tricomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, did not reveal a similar effect in the putamen. This, by itself, can be simply explained as consistent with the lack of stronger habit formation following extensive training observed in the current work (in contrast to the Tricomi et al.’s finding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>). However, not only did we not find an increase, but the bilateral putamen reduced its BOLD activation as training progressed. Notably, while this result is consistent with a body of research reporting a reduction in the putamen activation as training progresses (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref></sup>, for review see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref></sup>) it is inconsistent with Tricomi et al. and other research showing increased activity in the putamen as training progresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">102</xref></sup>. This discrepancy can be reconciled by taking into consideration the specific subregions in the putamen where the activations were observed. In the Tricomi et al. study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, the posterior putamen was specifically found to show an increasing activation profile with training. This region is anatomically distinct from the more anterior aspects of the putamen in which the decreasing activation profile was found in the present study. In an exploratory analysis focusing on the smaller specific region of the posterior putamen reported by Tricomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, we did find a statistical trend toward increasing activity as a function of training (albeit not quite reaching statistical significance). Accordingly, differential response profiles between the anterior and posterior parts of the putamen were also clearly observed when visually inspecting raw training-induced activations across the bilateral putamen. Those results could be interpreted as being broadly consistent with previous literature finding decreasing activation in the anterior (associative) putamen and increasing activation in the posterior (sensorimotor) putamen with training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">102</xref></sup>. Indeed, a transfer of motor representations is suggested to occur from anterior to posterior putamen as a function of training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">105</xref></sup>. These opposing effects have not often been seen side by side in the same study and further research is needed to disentangle the specific role of different putamen subregions and their time-dependent engagement patterns in human action control. Perhaps a further functional subdivision of both the associative and particularly the sensorimotor putamen is required to gain a detailed understanding of the putamen’s contribution to instrumental learning. In the present study, it should be emphasized that due to the lack of behavioral effects of training duration on sensitivity to outcome devaluation, any training duration-induced changes in the putamen observed at the group level could not be attributed to the expression of habitual/goal-directed behavior but solely to the effects of training.</p><p id="P92">Contrary to our hypotheses, we did not find any evidence for functional or microstructural plasticity in the putamen associated with individual habit expression (measured as sensitivity to outcome devaluation), not even when we clustered participants into goal-directed and habitual sub-groups. In rodents, convincing evidence dissociating the contributions of the dorsomedial striatum (homologous to the human anterior caudate) to goal-directed behavior and dorsolateral striatum (homologous to the human putamen) to habitual responding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> have spurred the idea of a shift in action control between these regions (from the former to the latter) as goal-directed behavior shifts into habits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">106</xref></sup>. Similarly, it is thought that a corresponding shift from goal-directed to habitual behavior in humans predominantly results from a transition in action control from the anterior caudate to the putamen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. While some evidence, although correlational, supports this idea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">107</xref></sup>, our findings join a growing body of findings that do not find evidence for such a transition in healthy individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">108</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R110">110</xref></sup>. Notably, targeting individual differences also yielded mixed results regarding the putamen’s role in determining habitual performance. While De wit et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> found that putamen-premotor cortex white matter tract strength, as well as putamen gray matter density, were associated with habitual slip of actions in healthy individuals, other more recent studies have not found functional or structural neural correlates between the putamen and individual differences in habit expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">109</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">111</xref></sup>. One potential explanation could be that the procedures used to operationalize and measure habits do not capture well or in a consistent manner the construct they intend to. This could lead to mixed results regarding the neural substrates of human habitual control. Alternatively, habit expression may be subject to multiple environmental and psychological transient as well as stable factors, rendering related effects subtle and unstable. In that eventuality, even if a more effective task paradigm were to be used, large sample sizes are likely to be required to reliably implicate and characterize the underlying neural mechanisms. Relatedly, the striatum may be differentially recruited as a function of the nature of the task involved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112">112</xref></sup>. Tasks employing a sequence of actions often find increased activation in the sensorimotor striatum (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref></sup>), whereas single-motor action tasks in rodents report a training duration- related reduction in the amount of task-related active neurons in this region (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113">113</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R114">114</xref></sup>). Helie et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref></sup> suggested that increased activation in the sensorimotor striatum following extensive training occurs after response selection and is in fact associated with response-response associations required for automatically executing a sequence of actions. Outcome devaluation studies in humans typically use a single action, such as a simple button press, which may thereby not be controlled by the putamen or alternatively, introduce a very subtle effect, frequently undetected. Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility that the role of the human (posterior) putamen in habitual control is not equivalent to the role of the dorsolateral striatum in rodents as commonly assumed. It is possible that humans’ advanced ability to engage in goal-directed planning and execution implies and/or generates different neural implementations of habitual control. Alternatively, changes in neural regions and circuits associated with goal-directed behavior as behavior becomes habitual may be more robust and thus more readily captured in the current available methods, as seen in the present and other studies (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">111</xref></sup>). As a final note, it is certainly possible that the putamen plays a role in habit learning but that whether or not habits are expressed in a given situation is contingent on factors or gated by brain regions that are not directly associated with the level of training-induced functional or microstructural plasticity in the putamen.</p></sec><sec id="S65"><title>Neural correlates of the individual tendency to form/express habits</title><p id="P93">We found that patterns of daily activation changes in the left head of caudate (but not changes across the entire three days of training) predicted individuals’ sensitivity to outcome devaluation. This is consistent with the notion that sensitivity to outcome devaluation may be manifested in differential neural activity in goal-directed regions (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">111</xref></sup>). This finding is also aligned with evidence relating caudate-vmPFC white matter tract strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and caudate increased activation during trials involving a valued outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">109</xref></sup> with individual goal-directed action control. An important distinction regarding the novelty of this finding is that it illustrates the importance of re-occurring patterns of within-session activation changes in general and the implication (through such a process) of the head of caudate in maintaining goal-directed behavior. Our results suggest that each training session is to some extent a new context that re-initiates the engagement of the head of caudate. Decreased reactivity of this region is indicative of reduced sensitivity to outcome devaluation whereas an increase is associated with goal-directed behavior. This finding perhaps implies that if the training would have continued (i.e., involve further sessions), at some point (varied across individuals), as the slightly new contexts that each day constitute generalize (and a habit is simultaneously formed), the activation patterns in the head of caudate of the initially more “goal-directed” participants would become similar to those of the “habitual” participants and render their behavior habitual. This idea is supported by research showing that the caudate encodes the contingency between actions and outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R115">115</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116">116</xref></sup> which is crucial for goal-directed behavior. However, our results here are correlational and this idea is speculative and should be directly tested to be verified. Yet, if indeed verified, the head of caudate may putatively be used as an online within-session/day marker of habit formation. Notably, in contrast to the caudate, we did not find any functional or structural effects associated with sensitivity to outcome devaluation in the vmPFC. This region has been largely implicated in goal-directed behavior (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R117">117</xref></sup>). Perhaps as most participants in our study had become habitual already after a short training, there was not enough variance in the data to observe an effect in the vmPFC. This region is known to have a major role in processing the value of an outcome (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118">118</xref></sup>), which, taken together with the effect found in the head of caudate, may indicate that in the current procedure value signals are less predictive of action control than contingency signals.</p><p id="P94">Another novel finding of this work is that individual sensitivity to outcome devaluation involves differential processing of valued vs. devalued cues in the left primary visual cortex. Goal-directed behavior was associated with greater activation in this region toward a devalued cue (as a function of the value reduction). This suggests that action control is directly related to differential neural processing of predictive stimuli in lower-level sensory regions and thus during earlier stages of the neural processing of external information than had been previously thought. To the best of our knowledge, to date only one study implicated visual regions in goal-directed/habitual behavior in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. That research demonstrated greater activation in the middle and superior occipital cortex toward a condition that involved stimulus-response encoding (which presumably underlies habitual action control) vs. a condition that encouraged the utilization of response-outcome associations (which presumably underlie goal-directed action control). However, that study implicated different occipital regions (of higher visual processing levels) than the regions identified in the current study (the primary visual cortex). Also, as there are known projections from the primary visual cortex to the dorsomedial striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R119">119</xref></sup> (the rodent homologue of the human caudate), it is possible that the differential processing of cue values in this region contributes to the effect we found in the left head of caudate. Finally, this finding can be possibly integrated with the exploratory finding showing that (within the short training group) the right postcentral gyrus and right superior parietal lobule were more reactive to valued vs. devalued cues in goal-directed participants but not in habitual ones. In primates, the superior parietal lobule is suggested to integrate visual and somatosensory information to control goal-directed actions executed by the arms (See<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R120">120</xref></sup> for review). Taken together, it is possible that increased sensitivity to devalued cues in low-level visual regions in individuals with higher tendency for goal-directed behavior is, at least to some extent, directly associated with the increased sensitivity in the postcentral gyrus and superior parietal lobule. For example, the increased activity toward devalued cues in the lower-level visual regions may inhibit activations in the superior parietal lobule and postcentral gyrus, which in turn results in a differential activation in favor of the valued cues in these regions.</p><p id="P95">Our subgroup-based analysis, in which we divided participants in each experimental group to goal-directed and habitual subgroups based on their demonstrated sensitivity to outcome devaluation, has related a few other regions of both the sensorimotor and associative parts of the cortico-striatal circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">106</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R121">121</xref></sup> to habit expression. We found that the bilateral intraparietal sulci, the left supramarginal gyrus (part of the inferior parietal lobule) and the dlPFC decreased their activity as training progressed in participants that maintained goal-directed behavior (but not in those that responded habitually) following extensive training. This decrease in activation was derived from elevated activation levels in early stages of training in goal-directed participants but it was absent in habitual participants. Both the inferior posterior parietal lobe and dlPFC play a major role in goal-directed behavior by implementing related required processes. They both constitute a prominent part of the fronto-parietal brain network (a component of the cognitive control network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R122">122</xref></sup>) which facilitates cognitive control and flexible adaptation to task demands (adaptive control)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R123">123</xref></sup>. They have also been directly associated with planning processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">102</xref></sup>, have shown to be involved in state space representation (and model-based learning)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R124">124</xref></sup> and were implicated in stimulus-dependent attentional shift (exogenous adjustment)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R125">125</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P96">The role of these regions (the inferior posterior parietal lobe and dlPFC) in the context of habit learning was highlighted by a few studies. Evidence implicating the inferior parietal lobule in sensitivity to outcome devaluation was provided by Liljeholm et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> that found that greater discriminatory activation in this region between stimulus-response and response-outcome pairings predicted sensitivity to outcome devaluation. Contradictory findings (at first glance) to our work were found by Poldrack et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref></sup> and Zwosta et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">111</xref></sup>. Poldrack et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref></sup> found practice-related decreased activity in the both parietal and dlPFC regions, which were indirectly associated with the formation of behavioral automaticity (as indicated by dual-task interference elimination). Nevertheless, that study focused on skill learning and used the serial reaction time (SRT) task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R126">126</xref></sup> (either in single or dual-task conditions) which demands substantial cognitive resources, especially when compared to our non-challenging free-operant task. It is possible that when high cognitive resources are required, the dlPFC and inferior parietal lobules are more engaged in early learning stages also in individuals who tend to quickly express automatic behavior. Another key difference is that automaticity in the SRT task is constantly desired, that is, participants are not placed in a condition aimed to examine their capacity to adjust their learned behavior (in which they benefit from overcoming acquired automaticity). Goal-directed participants in our procedure may have differentiated from habitual participants not by their capacity to engage in habitual action control but rather by their ability to switch back when the circumstances have changed.</p><p id="P97">Zwosta et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">111</xref></sup> found that stronger habit expression was associated with a larger decrease in the inferior parietal lobule across training, an effect in the opposite direction than reported here. Notably, that task’s operationalization of the targeted neurobehavioral processes was very different from the one we used. It is composed of binary choice trials and change in explicit goals between task phases. Thus, the possibility of substantial involvement of the inferior parietal lobule also in participants that tended to quickly express habits, apply in this/that work as well. Importantly, that work employed a relatively short training (across one day) and therefore focused on changes within a single session rather than across multiple (spaced) sessions. This raises the possibility that across different timescales different patterns of functional plasticity in the inferior parietal lobe play a role in habit learning. Another important emphasis regarding the work by Zwosta et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">111</xref></sup> is that habitual behavior was not indexed as sensitivity to outcome devaluation but rather as increased error rates and increased response time in trials that were incongruent with respect to previous learning strategies (contrasting putative goal-directed and habitual action control). The effect in the inferior parietal lobule was only observed for the response time measure but not for the error measure. Notably, the latter is more equivalent to responses that are insensitive to outcome devaluation than the former.</p><p id="P98">Our work provides novel evidence that significant recruitment of the inferior parietal and dlPFC regions at early stages of training can lead to larger flexibility to adjust instrumental behavior when necessary in later stages. Thus, while Zwosta et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">111</xref></sup> speculated that individual differences in habit expression are mediated by inferior parietal lobule activations, which reflects the anticipation for a specific outcome at the end of training, our results suggest that there might be a critical phase at the beginning of training in which activations in this region may take part in forming the neural machinery required for later behavioral adaptations. The later use of this machinery appears to no longer require the particular involvement of the inferior parietal lobule. Such interpretation implies that activation in these regions can perhaps be used as an early-stage neural marker of the likelihood of recruiting goal-directed action control. Such neural marker could putatively be used to identify individuals’ tendency to form and express habits. More research is needed to understand whether such activations are associated with a specific state or are stable within individuals, namely reoccur over similar and different tasks, and thus represent an individual trait.</p><p id="P99">The cognitive and mental processes relating these early activations with later goal-directed performance can also be a target for future exploration. A possible explanation for the role of these early-stage activations may rely on other related findings about the role of these regions. Sohn et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R125">125</xref></sup> implicated several parietal regions, including the posterior inferior parietal lobe in task switching. Glascher et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R124">124</xref></sup> have shown that activity in the dlPFC reflects state prediction errors, thereby having a major role in encoding the model of the environment in model-based reinforcement learning, and Mcnamee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> found that this region encoded information about both the identities of actions and outcomes, suggesting it is involved in encoding such model. Taken together, it may be that increased activations in the dlPFC and inferior parietal sulcus generate a good representation (model) of the task states, action and related outcomes, and perhaps generate a different “sub task” representation for each associative structure. Establishing and rehearsing these representations at initial stages of training may have made it easier in later stages to distinguish between the different conditions (valued vs. devalued) once it had become beneficial to do so. Another important observation, made by Zwosta et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">111</xref></sup> and reinforced by the current study is that individual differences in habit expression appear to mainly stem from individual differences in regions associated with goal-directed rather than habitual action control. This may indicate that individual differences in regions of the goal-directed system are perhaps more common and more substantial than in regions of the habitual system or alternatively, that their effects on behavior are stronger.</p><p id="P100">Another novel finding of this work is the identification of differential extensive training- induced microstructural changes in midbrain dopaminergic regions (VTA/SN) and their surroundings between goal-directed and habitual participants. FA was found to elevate in these regions for habitual participants and was reduced for goal-directed ones. Dopamine is thought to play a crucial role in habit formation and in moderating the balance between goal-directed and habitual action control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R127">127</xref></sup>, but the exact mechanisms by which it acts are not yet fully understood. Most notably, research in animals and humans often ascribe a different, even opposing, role for dopamine in action control. Whereas dopamine has been shown to promote habit formation in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R128">128</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R129">129</xref></sup> (but note the D1 and D2 receptors’ dissociable effects, promoting and depressing habit formation, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R130">130</xref></sup>), it was found to enhance goal-directed behavior (and model-based learning)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R131">131</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R135">135</xref></sup> in humans (but see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R136">136</xref></sup>). As far as we know, habit research in humans has yet to uncover direct associations between habit formation and structural or functional plasticity in dopaminergic regions but rather only in their efferents’ target regions. We show here that different patterns of microstructural plasticity in midbrain dopaminergic regions may underlie shifts in action control or the ability to adjust behavior when the goal of a behavior ceases to be desired. It is important to note here, that since (1) this region is comprised of both white and gray matter and the cluster found covers a relatively large area, (2) we did not find MD changes and (3) the FA measure can be affected by various factors in the tissue microstructure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R137">137</xref></sup>, any attempt to interpret the underlying neural and cognitive processes associated with these microstructural changes would be highly speculative and further focused research is required to characterize these processes. Based on our findings, the only suggestion we can make in this context is that individual tendency to acquire and express habits may stem from differential dopaminergic modulation of goal-directed and habit neural circuits (involving the associative and sensorimotor striatum, respectively). As fMRI BOLD activations are mainly a product of neural processing localized around the afferent inputs region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R138">138</xref></sup>, in this work, by using DTI indices, we might have traced back the source of activations in cortical and striatal regions identified as implicated in goal-directed action control that dissociates individuals with different habit learning tendencies. It is important to emphasize with respect to all of the findings obtained through the subgroup analysis that this analysis, although conceptually planned for the case of null behavioral effect, is exploratory and as such its results should be further validated in targeted future research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S66" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P101">In conclusion, in this well-powered registered report, we provide further evidence that the Tricomi et al. paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> is not well-suited to reliably demonstrate the effect of habit formation as a function of training duration, potentially due to a rapid manifestation of habit-like behavior, which is expressed already after short training. Furthermore, we were not able to relate any functional or microstructural plasticity in the putamen with individual habit expression. Instead, regions commonly implicated in goal-directed regions were most predictive of individual habit expression. We show that re-occurring within-day increased activations in the head of caudate throughout training and early-stage elevated activations in frontoparietal regions (mainly in the inferior parietal lobe and the dlPFC) were associated with goal directed behavior (and vice versa). Additionally, we found evidence that larger neural reactivity toward devalued cues in the primary visual cortex and increased reactivity in favor of still-valued cues in somatosensory and superior parietal regions are related to individual tendencies to express goal-directed behavior (and vice versa). Finally, we found that differential patterns of training-related microstructural plasticity in midbrain dopaminergic regions were indicative of habit expression. Taken together, this work provides new insights regarding the underlying putative neural mechanisms involved in individual habit learning and motivates the development of novel, well-informed, procedures for experimental habit induction in humans in order to accelerate research in the field.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS158888-supplement-Supplementary_materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d39aAdFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S67"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are thankful to Jasmine Segal, Miri Goldman and Danielle Cohen who helped us with recruitment and data collection.</p><sec id="S68"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) [grant number 715016]; and the Israeli Science Foundation [grant number 1798/15 and 1996/20].
