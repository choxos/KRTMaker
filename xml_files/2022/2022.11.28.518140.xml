Clinical presentation of r-HAT in Malawi varies between the different foci and differs from East African HAT clinical phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to gain more insights into the transcriptomic profiles of patients with early stage 1 and late stage 2 HAT disease in Malawi. Whole blood from individuals infected with <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> was used for RNA-Seq. Control samples were from healthy trypanosome negative individuals matched on sex, age range, and disease focus. Illumina sequence FASTQ reads were aligned to the GRCh38 release 84 human genome sequence using HiSat2 and differential analysis was done in R using the DESeq2 package. XGR, ExpressAnalyst and InnateDB algorithms were used for functional annotation and gene enrichment analysis of significant differentially expressed genes. RNA-seq was done on 25 healthy controls and 23 r-HAT case samples of which 3 case samples were excluded for downstream analysis as outliers. 4519 genes were significantly differentially expressed (p adjusted &lt;0.05) in individuals with early stage 1 r-HAT disease (n = 12) and 1824 genes in individuals with late stage 2 r-HAT disease (n = 8). Enrichment of innate immune response genes through neutrophil activation was identified in individuals with both early and late stages of the disease. Additionally, lipid metabolism genes were enriched in late stage 2 disease. We further identified uniquely upregulated genes (log2 Fold Change 1.4 - 2.0) in stage 1 (ZNF354C) and stage 2 (TCN1 and MAGI3) blood. Our data brings new insight into the human transcriptome landscape during <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> infection. We have further identified key biological pathways and transcripts during stage 1 and stage 2 r-HAT. Lastly, we have identified potential diagnostic biomarkers that may be used for staging of r-HAT disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a protozoan disease endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and caused by <italic>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</italic> (Tbg) and <italic>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</italic> (Tbr). Tbg causes chronic HAT (g-HAT) or sleeping sickness in West and Central Africa with domesticated animals sometimes acting as intermediate hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Whereas, Tbr causes an acute HAT (r-HAT) disease phenotype and is endemic in Southern and Eastern Africa where wild life and domesticated animals are the major intermediate hosts for disease transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Tsetse flies of the genus <italic>Glossina</italic> are the vectors of HAT transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Human Tbr infections are characterized by a hemolymphatic stage 1 (early) and meningoencephalitic stage 2 (late) disease. Parasite invasion of central nervous system is a classic characteristic of stage 2 r-HAT disease and if untreated, patients die due to a dysfunctional immune response in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Early diagnosis of r-HAT is key in reducing disease burden and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Unfortunately, diagnosis of r-HAT in endemic areas is dependent on insensitive microscopic examination of blood and the invasive lumber puncture for collection of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) used in r-HAT staging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P3">There are variations in the clinical presentation of r-HAT that have been observed in endemic countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). For instance, r-HAT cases in Uganda frequently present with a more acute clinical presentation compared to r-HAT cases in Malawi that tend to present with a chronic disease phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). In Malawi HAT cases are reported at the interface of wildlife reserves with human settlements in Nkhotakota and Rumphi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Most cases in Nkhotakota present with a chronic stage 1 disease whereas in Rumphi most cases present with acute stage 2 disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Variations in clinical presentation of r-HAT have also been reported between Malawi and Uganda cases and this is associated with parasite genetic diversity and human inflammatory cytokine response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Previously, human transcriptome analysis of blood from r-HAT patients in Uganda identified functional enrichment of genes involved in innate immune response pathway to be the most differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). These genes include interleukin 21 <italic>(IL21),</italic> interleukin 1 receptor <italic>(IL1R),</italic> and tumour necrosis factor alpha <italic>TNFA,</italic> as well as immunoglobulin heavy chain variable and classical complement pathway genes, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Whereas, upregulated transcripts in the CSF of stage 2 HAT patients were predominantly coding for genes involved in neuro activation and anti-inflammatory, the study identified <italic>IGHD3–10, C1QC</italic> and <italic>MARCO</italic> genes as having a fivefold change in stage 1 r-HAT cases compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). The dual (host and parasite) transcriptome analysis of transcriptomes found in Ugandan r-HAT samples are unlikely similar to other r-HAT endemic counties such as Malawi. Firstly, Tbr parasite isolates in East Africa are genetically different from Malawi isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Secondly, clinical presentation of r-HAT in Malawi is more chronic than the acute disease observed in East Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Thirdly, there is a high level of human genetic diversity between Uganda and Malawi, which might affect human response to diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Lastly, association studies have found a protective effect of <italic>APOL1</italic> gene polymorphisms in r-HAT disease outcome in Malawi population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), in contrast to mixed results from association studies of <italic>APOL1</italic> with r-HAT disease outcome in Ugandan population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). In this study, we examined the differences in the human blood gene expression profiles of r-HAT patients in Malawi. Our results add to the current understanding of the human response to r-HAT disease and have led to identification of potential blood markers for staging of r-HAT.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>RNA-Seq Sample attributes</title><p id="P5">Samples were collected at Rumphi and Nkhotakota district hospitals during a HAT surveillance as we had previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). In Rumphi district, a total of 37 r-HAT positive cases and 25 corresponding r-HAT negative controls were recruited (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Of the 37 r-HAT positive individuals, 26 (70.3%) were males and 11 (29.7%) were females.

Among the cases, 15 (55.6%) were males and 12 (44.4%) females. The mean age of the cases and controls were 27.2±17.7 years and 33.1±11.8 years respectively. The HAT status of the participants was confirmed by microscopic examination of thick blood smears at recruitment sites and by PCR to detect the <italic>SRA</italic> gene of Tbr parasites as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P7">RNA-Seq was done on 23 r-HAT cases and 25 healthy control blood samples with RNA concentration &gt;1μg (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Distinct differences in r-HAT cases and control transcriptome profiles</title><p id="P8">To examine for differences between the blood transcriptomes of individuals infected with Tbr parasites compared with healthy controls, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) in DEseq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Three cases were identified as outliers by PCA and removed from downstream analyses. The results show that transcriptomes in individuals infected with Tbr parasites were clearly distinguished from healthy controls on a plot of principal components 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). We also observed a stratification when simultaneous comparison of female and male r-HAT cases with corresponding health controls was made using Euclidean distance correlation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1A</xref>). Lastly, we observed significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between stage 1 and stage 2 samples against controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1B</xref>). Since clinical presentation or r-HAT in Malawi is focus dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), we next compared transcriptome of infected individuals in Nkhotakota focus against infected individuals in Rumphi focus. No genes were significantly differentially expressed in infected individuals between the two r-HAT foci.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Innate Immune Response Transcripts are Elevated in Stage 1 Patients</title><p id="P9">Given the differences observed in the number of DEGs between HAT stage 1 and stage 2 blood relative to controls, we next sought to identify those genes that are significantly enriched in individuals with stage 1 r-HAT disease. First, differential transcriptome analysis was done in stage 1 cases against healthy controls using DeSeq2. A total of 4519/47546 (9.50%) genes were significant differentially expressed between stage 1 cases and healthy controls with adjusted p&lt;0.05 (padj&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). Of the 4519 genes, 54.3% (2454/4519) coded for proteins, 32.2% (1457/4519) for lncRNA and 13.5% (608/4519) for various gene types which include miRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, scaRNA, miscRNA, Tyrosine protein kinase (TEC), immunoglobulins, T cell receptor and Mt-RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2A</xref>). Of the 2454 protein coding genes, 64.6% (1585/2454) were upregulated (log2 fold change, log2FC &gt; 1), 8.2% (201/2454) were down regulated (Log2FC &lt; -1) and 27.2% (668/2454) were neither upregulated nor downregulated compared to healthy controls. Among upregulated genes: <italic>BMP6, ENOSF1, EXOSC9, SMARCB1, LCORL, EMC9, C12orf73, IFI16</italic> were significantly expressed with padj&lt;10e-15 and log2FC &gt; 2. BMP6 plays a critical role in cell proliferation and type II cytokine regulation through JAK2 signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). IFI16 has a critical role in the interaction between the innate immune system and cellular transcriptional regulation through pattern recognition of pathogens. Additionally, upregulation of immunoglobulin light chains (IGKs, IGLs) and immunoglobulin heavy chains (log2FC 2.0 – 6.0) were identified. IGKs and IGLs are involved in activation of mast cells and neutrophils which results in the release of various pro-inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>); whereas immunoglobulin heavy chains are central in presentation of antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).

For this, we observed that circadian rhythm <italic>CIPC (clock interacting pacemaker</italic>) was differentially expressed (padj&lt;1.59E-6) and down regulated (log2FC -1.9) suggesting a disruption of circadian rhythm in patients with stage 1 disease compared to healthy individuals.

Immune effector process, neutrophil activation, neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil activation involved in immune response and neutrophil mediated immunity were among differentially expressed immunological functions (p-value&lt;10E-12). Neutrophils have been previously shown to have a fundamental role in innate immune response against trypanosome parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To determine other biological processes enriched during stage 1 of Tbr infection, upregulated genes were analysed in ExpressAnalyst using the PANTHER biological process database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). This identified 18 biological process which include immune system process, immune response, macrophage activation, natural killer cell activation, response to interferon gamma, cell recognition, receptor mediated endocytosis and blood coagulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). The blood coagulation system may be activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and modulate inflammatory response to blood pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Enrichment of Lipid Metabolic Process Pathway in stage 2 r-HAT Cases</title><p id="P13">To determine blood transcriptomes that were enriched in stage 2 patients, we compared stage 2 blood against heathy controls. There were 1824/37922 (4.81%) significant DEGs (padj&lt;0.05) of which 850/1824 (46.6 %) coded for proteins, 643/1824 (35.3 %) for lncRNA and 331/1824 (18.1 %) for various gene types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1B</xref>). Additionally, 75/850 (8.8%) of the protein coding genes were highly upregulated (log2FC 2.0 - 4.3) relative to healthy controls with <italic>BMP6, ENOSF1, IFI16, SMARCB1</italic> and C12orf73 genes significantly expressed with padj&lt;9.79E-10.

We identified 632 CDS that were differentially expressed in both stage 1 and stage 2 r-HAT disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). Among the 632 CDS, <italic>ZNF354C</italic> was upregulated (log2FC 1.9) in stage 1 only, whereas <italic>TCN1</italic> (log2FC 2.0) and MAGI3 (log2FC 1.4) were upregulated in stage 2 blood only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>ZNF354C</italic> has a crucial role in inhibition of endothelial cell sprouting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). <italic>TCN1</italic> expression in blood is negatively associated with poor verbal memory performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Among CDS only expressed in stage 1 blood, 71 genes were upregulated with log2FC &gt;3.0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3A</xref>).

CD14 is an antigen receptor mainly expressed by macrophages during innate immune response and HBB is a crucial for synthesis of β-globin which form the main structure of the human haemoglobin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). To determine the biological processes enriched by genes which were differentially expressed in either stage 1 or stage 2 r-HAT, we also subjected the gene list to ExpressAnalyst in biological pathways.

We used a custom R script that uses normalised read counts produced by DESeq2 to obtain the proportions of different leukocyte types present in each sample. In a principal component analysis of the data PC1 largely separated cases from controls and explained 25% of the variance in the data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5A</xref>). The transformed bulk RNAseq to single cell proportions data had the expected normal distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5B</xref>).

To understand the immunological pathways involved in r-HAT in Malawi patients, we subjected all upregulated CDS to reactome immune system pathway visualisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).

Nonetheless, blood samples in both stages of r-HAT showed a detectable stratification between cases and healthy controls.</p><p id="P18">Our data also showed activation of innate immune system in both stage 1 and stage 2 disease. Hematopoietic progenitor neutrophils (Metamyelocytes) were the most significantly (p&lt;7.4E-6) expressed blood cells responding to Tbr infection in humans followed by NKP and hMDP which are all central in coordinating and effecting an innate immune response. Presence of Metamyelocytes in blood is an indication of acute inflammation, which is consistent with proinflammatory profiles in r-HAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Circulating neutrophil life span is about 48hrs, at the same time BMP6 which is involved in cell proliferation was a significant DEG (padj&lt;10E-11) and upregulated in both stage 1 &amp; stage 2 r-HAT. This suggests that innate immune response through neutrophil activation might have a central role in responding to blood parasitaemia in Malawi r-HAT patients. Candidate genes in neutrophil activation have also been identified to respond to <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic> infection in cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Whereas, in mice infected with <italic>T. brucei brucei</italic> (Tbb) neutrophils were recruited at the site of tsetse fly bite but were not able to immobilise motile trypanosomes but aided in the establishment of Tbb blood infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). This implicates the dynamic role of neutrophils in responding to various trypanosome parasite infections in different mammalian hosts and future research should consider delineating the role of neutrophils in human Tbr infections.</p><p id="P19">We also observed upregulation (log2FC 1.9) of CD14 transcripts in blood from stage 2 r-HAT patients. CD14 is involved in activation of macrophages and regulation of macrophage metabolic profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), which was consistent with our finding of activated lipid metabolic process, lipid transport and cellular amino acid metabolic process in stage 2 blood only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). Macrophages are involved in clearance of tissue pathogens. At the same time, trypanosomes are known to localise in adipose tissue underneath the skin when there’s an influx of host adaptive immune responses induced by trypanosome variant surface glycoproteins, thereby sustaining host infection in the absence of blood trypanosome parasitaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Our results might suggest macrophage infiltration in Tbr infected individuals in Malawi, consistent with findings in mice models infected with Tbr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Trypanosome infections are known to disrupt circadian rhythm in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), and here, we found that <italic>CIPC</italic> and <italic>PER1</italic> genes were down regulated and upregulated respectively in stage 1 blood. This suggest that subtle disruption of host circadian system by the trypanosome parasite may start early in infection during hemolymphatic stage, although sleep disturbance is only observed in late stage 2 r-HAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Comparison of DEGs in stage 1 and stage 2 blood identified <italic>ZNF354C</italic> significant differentially expressed in blood of both stages of r-HAT but upregulated in stage 1 only.

These have a diagnostic potential of being used as blood markers to diagnose stage 1 and stage 2 r-HAT cases without need of the invasive lumber puncture collection of CSF, which is currently used for diagnosis of late stage 2 disease. Unlike in a similar study in Uganda r-HAT patients which identified <italic>C1QC, MARCO</italic> and <italic>IGHD3–10</italic> upregulated in both blood and CSF, these transcripts were neither upregulated nor significantly differentially expressed in Malawi r-HAT patients. This supports the need for personalised medicine but not universal medicine in the treatment of r-HAT as infected individuals in different disease focus respond differently to trypanosome infection.</p><p id="P22">In conclusion, this study has compared transcriptomes differentially expressed and upregulated in blood of stage 1 and stage 2 r-HAT cases in Malawi. We have identified transcripts significant differentially expressed and upregulated in each stage of r-HAT disease. We have identified neutrophils as significant responders of blood trypanosome infection in both stages of the disease, and macrophages as possible responders in patients with late stage disease. We have also identified transcripts that may potentially be used as novel biomarkers in future research for diagnosis of stage 1 and stage 2 r-HAT in Malawi without the need of lumber puncture. Our study has provided insights into human responses to trypanosome infection in Malawi r-HAT patients.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Ethics, Study sites and sample collection</title><p id="P23">We have recently described r-HAT surveillance and study participants recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). This study was approved by Malawi National Health Sciences Research Committee (Protocol Number: 19/03/2248). Consent and accent were obtained from each study participant before sample collection. Briefly, sample collection was done during active and passive r-HAT surveillances conducted for 18 months from July 2019 to December 2020. Both r-HAT cases and healthy controls were confirmed to be infected with trypanosome parasites or not by microscopic examination of thick blood films during the surveillance period. Upon obtaining consent, 2ml whole blood samples were collected into Paxgene® tubes from r-HAT cases and matching trypanosome negative healthy individuals and stored at -20°C until processing. Healthy controls were matched for sex, age group and disease focus. For r-HAT positive individuals, samples were collected before initiation of HAT treatment and all patients were thereafter treated following the national HAT treatment guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>RNA sequencing and analysis</title><p id="P24">RNA was extracted from the preserved Paxgene<sup>®</sup> blood as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).

Yellow represents more significant and darker yellow less significant. Macrophages, neutrophils and NK cells participate in innate immune response which results in significant activation of cytokine signaling pathway (FDR: 2.94E -4). Dendritic cells link innate immune system and activation of adaptive immune system through activation of CD4+ TH cells. Activated CD4 cells release IL2 and IFN-gamma that activates CD8+ T cells and B cells to differentiate into plasma cells for antibody production.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS157795-f005"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="T1" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Demographic details of recruited study participants</title></caption><table rules="groups" frame="void"><thead><tr style="border-top: solid thin"><th valign="top" align="left" style="border-right: solid thin">r-HAT Focus</th><th valign="top" align="left" colspan="5" style="border-right: solid thin">r-HAT Case n=64</th><th valign="top" align="left" colspan="3">Negative Controls n=49</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-right: solid thin"/><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-top: solid thin">Male</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-top: solid thin">female</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-top: solid thin">Mean Age</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-top: solid thin">Stage 1 HAT</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-top: solid thin">Stage 2 HAT</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-top: solid thin;border-left: solid thin">Male</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-top: solid thin">Female</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-top: solid thin">Mean Age</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-right: solid thin">Rumphi</td><td valign="top" align="left">26</td><td valign="top" align="left">11</td><td valign="top" align="left">34.9±17.2</td><td valign="top" align="left">14</td><td valign="top" align="left">23</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-left: solid thin">11</td><td valign="top" align="left">14</td><td valign="top" align="left">36.0±17.7</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-right: solid thin">Nkhotakota</td><td valign="top" align="left">15</td><td valign="top" align="left">12</td><td valign="top" align="left">27.2±17.7</td><td valign="top" align="left">19</td><td valign="top" align="left">8</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-left: solid thin">13</td><td valign="top" align="left">11</td><td valign="top" align="left">33.1±11.8</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
