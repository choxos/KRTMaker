Upon TORC1 inhibition, degradative activity is increased, and protein synthesis is reduced through inhibition of translation initiation, to maintain cell viability. Here, we show that the ribosome-associated complex (RAC)/Ssb chaperone system is required to maintain proteostasis and cell viability under TORC1 inhibition, in yeast. In the absence of the Hsp40 cochaperone Zuo1, translation does not decrease in response to loss of TORC1 activity. The functional interaction between Zuo1 and its Hsp70 partner, Ssb, is required for proper translational control and proteostasis maintenance upon TORC1 inhibition. Further, we have found that the rapid degradation of eIF4G following TORC1 inhibition is prevented in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells, contributing to decreased survival in these conditions. Our findings suggest a new role for RAC/Ssb in regulating translation in response to changes in TORC1 signalling.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cells must regularly adapt their proteome in order to respond to changing environmental conditions. The coordination of cellular processes to maintain a stable and functional proteome is known as protein homeostasis (proteostasis), the dysregulation of which has been linked to various disease states, including neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>).</p><p id="P3">A key regulator of the proteostasis network is the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), which adapts the equilibrium between catabolic and anabolic processes in response to environmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). In nutrient rich conditions, TORC1 promotes transcription, translation, and ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), while restricting proteasomal and autophagic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), to ensure cellular protein requirements for growth are met. Additionally, a network of chaperones ensure that proteins reach their native conformation and prevent the accumulation of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Nascent polypeptide chains are particularly vulnerable to misfolding and aggregation. Therefore, eukaryotes utilise a specialised chaperone system composed of the ribosome associated complex (RAC) and the Ssb class of Hsp70 chaperones in yeast (cytosolic Hsp70 in mammalian cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). The RAC is anchored near the ribosome exit tunnel and consists of the Hsp40 chaperone, Zuo1 (ZRF1/MPP11 in mammals), and the atypical Hsp70, Ssz1 (HSP70L1 in mammals). The RAC recruits Ssb1 and Ssb2 (collectively known as Ssb) and stimulates their ATPase activity, facilitating their interaction with nascent chains as they emerge from the exit tunnel, protecting them from misfolding and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In response to stress, the proteome must be rapidly rewired to execute stress survival mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). The inhibition of TORC1 under various stresses including nutrient deprivation, assists with this essential rewiring and stress response. Protein degradation is increased through upregulation of proteasome activity and autophagy induction, increasing the pool of available amino acids which can be redirected towards the synthesis of stress response proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Complementing this is a global reduction of translation, which is often accompanied by translational reprogramming, resulting in only selective translation of proteins required for stress survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). In addition to that, most cytosolic chaperones are transcriptionally upregulated in response to a variety of stresses to enable protein folding to occur under more difficult conditions, with several having a well-documented role in responding to proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Notably, this is not the case for Zuo1 which is coregulated with the translational machinery and has not yet been implicated in the refolding of stress-denatured proteins. Interestingly, it has been found that <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells are sensitive to the selective inhibitor of TORC1, rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). However, the role of Zuo1 in responding to TORC1 inhibition is unknown.</p><p id="P5">Here we investigate the importance of Zuo1 for maintaining proteostasis following TORC1 inhibition in S. cerevisiae. We demonstrate a role of Zuo1 in attenuating the rate of translation following TORC1 inhibition. This is dependent on its role as a ribosome associated co-chaperone for Ssb. We further identify Zuo1 interaction partners and found that one candidate, the translation initiation factor eIF4G2 (also known as TIF4632), is misregulated following TORC1 inactivation in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells. This contributes to the loss of cell growth upon TORC1 inhibition. Together, these results define that the RAC-Ssb complex is fine-tuning the rate of translation upon TORC1 inhibition, so that proteostasis, and thereby cell viability, is maintained.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Proteostasis is impaired upon TORC1 inhibition in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells</title><p id="P6">It has previously been shown that loss of Zuo1 sensitizes cells to the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). In agreement with this, we find that functionality of the RAC is important for surviving rapamycin challenge, as loss of either complex member results in increased sensitivity to rapamycin, with <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells displaying a more acute sensitivity than <italic>ssz1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). As TORC1 is a central coordinator of the protein homeostasis network, we analysed if proteostasis was disrupted by loss of Zuo1, by assessing the load of polyubiquitinated conjugates. A decrease of polyubiquitinated conjugates was seen in WT cells following TORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), resulting from increased protein degradation and translation inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). However, this decrease in polyubiquitinated proteins following rapamycin treatment was not observed in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells. This was despite TORC1 being inhibited to a similar extent as in WT cells, with TORC1 activity assessed by phosphorylation of its target Rps6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). To examine the clearance of misfolded cytosolic proteins, we utilised the misfolded mutant of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY*) fused to GFP and lacking its endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal (Δss-CPY*GFP) as a reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). This reporter is continually degraded by the proteasome but becomes stabilized in cells with a defect in the ubiquitin proteasome system. In agreement with the impaired clearance of ubiquitinated proteins observed, clearance of Δss-CPY*GFP, is delayed in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells, following rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>). Together, this indicates that <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells are unable to properly adapt their proteostasis network in response to TORC1 inhibition by rapamycin.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Proteasomal degradation is unaffected in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells</title><p id="P7">Impaired clearance of polyubiquitinated proteins can be a sign of defective protein degradation by the proteasome. Following TORC1 inhibition, cells boost their degradative capacity by increasing proteasome assembly and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). To assess proteasome function in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells, we performed an in-gel peptidase assay. The advantage of this method is that it can resolve the activity of all proteasomal species separated on a native gel after adding an internally quenched fluorogenic peptide. Fluorescence from the peptide is only observed after cleavage by the proteasome, and hence fluorescence intensity mirrors proteasome activity. The increase in proteasome activity following rapamycin treatment is not compromised in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells, and this was true for both singly- and doubly-capped proteasomes (RP-CP and RP<sub>2</sub>-CP, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In agreement, when ribosomal translation is inhibited by cycloheximide the degradation of the proteasome reporter substrate ΔssCPY*GFP is comparable in WT and <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). Thus, the loss of proteostasis in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells is not due to a defect in proteasomal degradation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Translation is not reduced in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> mutants following TORC1 inhibition</title><p id="P8">A possible explanation as to why Δss-CPY*GFP levels remain higher in rapamycin-treated <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells, compared to WT cells, despite the clearance of this reporter being unimpeded, is that translation may be continuing despite TORC1 inhibition. Failure to reduce translation following rapamycin treatment would lead to excess production of unwanted proteins, overwhelming the proteostasis network. To test this hypothesis, we employed the SUnSET assay in which the aminoacyl tRNA analog, puromycin, is incorporated into nascent chains, reflecting the rate of translation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Following rapamycin treatment, translation decreases in WT cells, correlating with TORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Strikingly, rapamycin treatment fails to decrease translation in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells following rapamycin-induced TORC1 inhibition. Correspondingly, a decrease in polysome levels is seen in WT cells following rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). While <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells have lower polysome levels in basal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), this does not seem to affect the <italic>in vivo</italic> translation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This is consistent with previous studies reporting that overall translation rate is not impaired in RAC-deleted cells, despite polysome levels being lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Furthermore, the decrease in polysome levels observed in WT cells upon TORC1 inhibition, is not present in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>), suggesting that a failure to properly regulate translation may comprise the proteostasis defect detected. Confirming this, cycloheximide treatment inhibited translation in both WT and <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells, even in the presence of rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), and rescued the impaired clearance of polyubiquitinated proteins observed in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells following TORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, while clearance of Δss-CPY*GFP is impeded in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells treated with rapamycin alone, cotreatment with cycloheximide restores the clearance of the misfolded proteasome reporter in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells following TORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D and 3E</xref>). Together, this data demonstrates that the failure to shut down translation in response to TORC1 inhibition likely underpins the protein homeostasis defect in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Zuo1 controls translation upon TORC1 inhibition through Ssb chaperones</title><p id="P9">Having established the importance of Zuo1 in mediating a translational decrease following TORC1 inhibition, we set out to define how it achieves this. Zuo1, as a key component of the RAC, functions as a cochaperone for Ssb. However, Zuo1 is also reported to have additional functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The first is in recruitment of Ltn1, a key E3 ligase of ribosome associated quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), and the second is in the induction of pleiotropic drug resistance, through the Pdr1 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Deletion of Ltn1 or Pdr1 does not confer sensitivity to rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) or result in impaired clearance of polyubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that these roles of Zuo1 are dispensable for its role in adapting the proteostasis network in response to TORC1 inhibition. Deletion of both homologs of Ssb (ssb1 and ssb2), however, results in acute sensitivity to rapamycin and is accompanied by a defect in clearing polyubiquitinated proteins following TORC1 inhibition, analogous to <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>). Cells lacking Ssb also fail to shut down translation in response to TORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). As in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells, this seems to underpin the proteostasis defect, as restoring translation inhibition with cycloheximide in <italic>ssb1/2Δ</italic> cells improves their clearance of polyubiquitinated proteins upon rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> and <italic>ssb1/2Δ</italic> cells share sensitivity to many of the same stresses and drugs, such as translation inhibitors and cold stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). For many of these, it has been demonstrated that the sensitivity of <italic>zuo1Δssb1/2Δ</italic> cells is the same as that of <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells and is not additive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Likewise, we have found that the phenotype of <italic>zuo1Δssb1/2Δ</italic> cells resembles that of cells lacking either Zuo1 or Ssb, displaying similarly low levels of growth and impaired polyubiquitin clearance upon rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A and 5B</xref>). Additionally, translation is not shut down in <italic>zuo1Δssb1/2Δ</italic> cells following TORC1 inhibition, but the overall phenotype is not more severe than either <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells or <italic>ssb1/2Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). This further emphasises that the role of Zuo1 in maintaining proteostasis upon TORC1 inhibition is dependent on its role as a ribosome associated co-chaperone.</p><p id="P10">To confirm this result, we utilised two mutations in Zuo1 which ablate crucial functions in regulating Ssb: a ribosome binding mutant in which two key arginine residues (R247/R251) are mutated to alanine, destabilizing the interaction of Zuo1 with ribosomes (RR-AA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), and a HPD-AAA mutant in which the conserved HPD motif in the J domain of Zuo1 has been mutated, inhibiting its ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of Ssb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Expression of WT Zuo1 on a plasmid complemented the growth defect of <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells in response to rapamycin, whereas expression of either of the RR-AA or HPD-AAA Zuo1 mutants did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). However, the rapamycin sensitivity of <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells re-expressing either of these Zuo1 mutants is not as severe as cells expressing the control plasmid (EV: Empty Vector). Similarly, relative to WT cells, the clearance of ubiquitinated proteins is impaired in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells expressing either the ribosome binding or chaperone mutant of Zuo1, but to a lesser extent than in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells harbouring the control plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Translation is also not fully shut down following TORC1 inhibition in cells expressing the single Zuo1 mutants, however, the phenotype is not as severe as that displayed by <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). It has been reported that even very low levels of Zuo1 are enough to preserve its function suggesting that single mutations may not be enough to fully abrogate Zuo1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Therefore, we generated a double mutant (RR-AA/HPD-AAA; zuo1-2-mut) lacking both ribosome binding and a functional J domain to account for any residual function of the individual mutants (Zuo1-2mut). Cells expressing Zuo1-2mut displayed greater sensitivity to rapamycin than those expressing the single mutants, more akin to deletion of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Accordingly, expression of Zuo1-2mut was not able to rescue the defective clearance of polyubiquitinated proteins and shutdown of translation observed in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells upon TORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F and 5G</xref>). This confirms the importance of Zuo1 function in regulating Ssb chaperones for maintaining proteostasis in response to TORC1 inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Identification of Zuo1 partners upon TORC1 inhibition</title><p id="P11">We have determined that of the known roles of Zuo1, only its role in activating Ssb at the ribosome, appears to be necessary for regulating proteostasis in cells challenged with rapamycin. However, it is unclear if additional Zuo1 partners are important for this regulation. We therefore immunoprecipitated endogenously tagged Zuo1 from cells grown in the presence or absence of rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). We then performed tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics to identify novel interactors and analyse changes in its interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). All the members of the RAC/Ssb chaperone system and many ribosomal proteins were found to be interacting with Zuo1 in our dataset (all proteins with at least 50% peptide coverage; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). A subset of glycolytic enzymes was also identified to be interacting with Zuo1. These genes are highly expressed and, with one exception, have been shown to be RAC dependent substrates of Ssb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), which likely accounts for their identification as Zuo1 interactors. Furthermore, gene ontology analysis revealed a strong enrichment of proteins linked to translation fidelity as well as those involved in ribonucleoprotein biogenesis and localization, processes which Zuo1 is known to be involved in (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). This highlights the robustness of this dataset and gives confidence in the novel Zuo1 interactors identified.</p><p id="P12">We identified 39 and 11 proteins whose interaction with Zuo1 was significantly increased and decreased upon rapamycin treatment, respectively. Those which are known to be linked to either translation or chaperone activity have been highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref> as they are of particular interest for Zuo1’s role in proteostasis. However, in order to prevent bias, we have not limited our search to these proteins. Of the interactions which are significantly changed following rapamycin treatment, we focused on the 43 interactors which are not essential. If these interactors are important for mediating the role of Zuo1 in proteostasis, then it would be expected that their loss would confer a similar phenotype to that of <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells upon rapamycin treatment. Deletion mutants of the 43 interactors were initially screened for rapamycin sensitivity, with only <italic>trp3</italic>Δ, <italic>vps4</italic>Δ, <italic>pil1</italic>Δ, and <italic>tum1</italic>Δ cells displaying increased rapamycin sensitivity relative to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Subsequently, a proteostasis defect in response to rapamycin challenge was observed in cells lacking Vps4 but not in <italic>trp3</italic>Δ, <italic>pil1</italic>Δ, or <italic>tum1</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, in <italic>vps4</italic>Δ cells, this defect is not at the level of translation regulation as following TORC1 inhibition translation is still inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). None of the Zuo1 interactors examined seem to be involved in its role in regulating proteostasis following rapamycin treatment. Although the proteostasis defect in <italic>vps4Δ</italic> doesn’t appear to be linked to Zuo1, further study would be valuable to elucidate the defect in the proteostasis network of these cells.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Degradation of eIF4G is impeded in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells</title><p id="P13">None of the novel interactors identified appear to be involved in mediating Zuo1’s role in maintaining proteostasis in response to TORC1 inhibition. However, one interactor stood out as being particularly interesting, eIF4G2 (encoded by TIF4632 in yeast), despite the deletion mutant displaying no sensitivity towards rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). This could be due to the presence of its paralog, eIF4G1 (encoded by TIF4631), as they are functionally redundant. eIF4G1/2 are scaffold proteins in the eIF4F complex which is required for recruiting the 40S ribosomal subunit to mRNA during translation initiation (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>)). Translation initiation is the predominant target of TORC1 translational regulation. TORC1 elicits control over this process by promoting the maintenance of eIF4G levels in nutrient rich conditions, facilitating translation initiation. Following TORC1 inhibition, e.g. by rapamycin treatment, eIF4G is rapidly degraded to suppress bulk translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). In <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells, the dramatic reduction of eIF4G1 and eIF4G2 that is observed in WT cells following rapamycin treatment, is severely impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A-7D</xref>). The protein level of other eIF4F complex members, in both basal and rapamycin treated conditions, is unaffected by loss of Zuo1, indicating that this misregulation is specific to eIF4G (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Interestingly, it has been reported that eIF4G is the least abundant of the eIF4 factors and hence is rate-limiting for eIF4F activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). This suggests that <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells may be sustaining translation through the excess pool of eIF4G.</p><p id="P14">In addition to suppressing translation initiation, TORC1 inhibition elicits a large transcriptional response. This is particularly well characterised for the ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) regulon, which consists of genes linked to ribosome biogenesis and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). The mRNA levels of these genes decrease in response to TORC1 inhibition, which, in addition to shut down of bulk translation, contributes to the reduction of their synthesis. eIF4G1 is known to be a constituent of the RiBi regulon, with its gene expression being rapidly downregulated following TORC1 inhibition. Similar regulation of eIF4G2 has not been established. To determine whether the defect in downregulating the protein levels of eIF4G in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells is a result of transcriptional regulation, changes in the mRNA levels following rapamycin treatment were monitored using quantitative real-time PCR. As expected, gene expression of eIF4G1 is substantially downregulated upon rapamycin treatment in WT cells, whereas eIF4G2 mRNA levels appear to be largely unchanged by the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). The transcriptional regulation of eIF4G1 and eIF4G2 does not seem to be impacted by the loss of Zuo1, suggesting that the defect in regulating eIF4G protein levels in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells is occurring post-transcriptionally. This is consistent with the literature reporting that eIF4G proteins are selectively degraded upon TORC1 inhibition in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). To clarify whether the increased pool of eIF4G proteins observed in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells treated with rapamycin is a cause or consequence of the proteostasis defect, the effect of overexpressing eIF4G1 and eIF4G2 in WT cells was examined. Over 24 hours, overexpression of either eIF4G paralog did not lead to a notable growth defect in WT cells under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). On the other hand, overexpression of eIF4G causes a striking reduction of growth in WT cells grown in the presence of rapamycin, indicating that appropriate regulation of eIF4G is required for cells to survive rapamycin challenge. In contrast, the growth of <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells challenged with rapamycin is not further impaired by the overexpression of eIF4G-(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7G</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that failure to reduce eIF4G protein levels upon rapamycin treatment in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells contributes to the loss of proteostasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">We have examined the role of Zuo1 in maintaining proteostasis in response to TORC1 inhibition. Cells lacking Zuo1 have a major defect in translational regulation, leading to a loss of proteostasis and cell death upon TORC1 inhibition. Shutting down bulk translation in response to TORC1 inhibition helps conserve resources when conditions are not optimal for growth, and it is therefore likely that loss of this regulation in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells is causing the reduced viability in response to rapamycin treatment. Polysome levels in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells are lower in basal conditions compared to WT cells, but the overall rate of translation was not perturbed, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Zuo1 has been linked to translation previously, where it is involved in translational repression of polylysine proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) and, in mammalian cells, ribosome associated chaperones have been linked to elongation pausing upon stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). It has also been proposed that this chaperone could slow down translation elongation to facilitate effective cotranslational protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). It is therefore possible that, in the absence of Zuo1, translation elongation is proceeding faster than in WT cells, maintaining translation levels despite lower polysome levels. Failure to further decrease polysome levels upon challenge with rapamycin would therefore allow normal levels of translation to be sustained in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells and disrupt its cellular proteostasis.</p><p id="P16">It appears that Zuo1 and Ssb cooperate to maintain proteostasis upon TORC1 inhibition. Surprisingly, though, the defect in reducing translation upon TORC1 inhibition is less severe in <italic>zuo1Δssb1/2Δ</italic> cells compared to <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> or <italic>ssb1/2Δ</italic> cells. Zuo1 and Ssb share binding sites on the ribosome with other ribosome associated chaperones, including NAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). It is possible that in the complete absence of RAC/Ssb, NAC is able to interact more with ribosomes and partially substitute for the loss of this chaperone system. It has been shown that NAC from <italic>C. elegans</italic> competes for ribosome binding with RAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) and, in yeast, NAC is expressed at approximately equimolar levels to ribosomes but is not bound to all translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). In this context, the autonomous ribosomal binding of either Ssb or Zuo1 in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> and <italic>ssb1/2Δ</italic> cells, respectively, may preclude the interaction of NAC, preventing a functional chaperone system from operating at those ribosomes. However, whether NAC shows increased association with translating ribosomes in <italic>zuo1Δssb1/2Δ</italic> cells remains to be determined. Additionally, deletion of NAC enhances growth defects of <italic>ssb1/2Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), suggesting that these chaperones share overlapping functions. Further study is required to elucidate any interplay between these two chaperone systems for maintaining proteostasis upon TORC1 inhibition.</p><p id="P17">In the absence of TORC1 signalling, our results suggest that translation in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells is partly sustained through elevated eIF4G levels. The argument for this is not unprecedented. It has previously been shown that mRNA decay mutants are able to sustain translation in response to a variety of stresses which induce translational shutdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Although the mechanism has not been fully elucidated, it is thought that in these mutants, translation is maintained through increased eIF4F and mRNA interactions. In agreement with this, it was found that overexpression of eIF4G2 can prevent a decrease in polysomes, and active translation, in response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Zuo1 has not been implicated in mRNA decay, but it is possible that loss of Zuo1 may similarly confer resistance to translational inhibition by facilitating ongoing translation through the eIF4F complex.</p><p id="P18">How eIF4G levels are maintained in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells is currently unclear. It has been reported that eIF4G levels are decreased following TORC1 inhibition by increasing the rate of its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Due to the positioning of Zuo1 on the ribosome and the observation that it interacts with eIF4G2 upon rapamycin treatment, it is attractive to speculate that Zuo1 is involved in promoting the turnover of eIF4G following TORC1 inhibition. One scenario is that Zuo1 could modulate post-translational modification of eIF4G which will serve as a recognition motif for degradation. We have not yet identified an interactor which could be involved in this process as none of the Zuo1 interactors analysed displayed both rapamycin sensitivity and proteostasis defect at the level of translation. Alternatively, Zuo1 and Ssb may have a more indirect role in promoting the folding or stability of an eIF4G modulator. Another scenario could involve Zuo1 regulating the production of de novo eIF4G. The nascent chains of both eIF4G paralogs have been identified as substrates of the RAC/Ssb chaperone system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Thus, upon TORC1 inhibition, Zuo1 may contribute to suppressing translation of eIF4G, preventing the pool of eIF4G from being replenished. Future work will focus on the elucidating the exact mechanism by which eIF4G levels remain elevated in <italic>zuo1Δ</italic> cells.</p><p id="P19">Inhibiting bulk translation is a key aspect of stress response under a large variety of stresses. This work has focused on TORC1 inhibition by the selective inhibitor rapamycin, but it would be useful to determine if Zuo1 plays a similar role in inhibiting translation following other stresses. This may indeed be the case as the deletion of Ssb prevents translation inhibition in response to glucose deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). As we have seen that Zuo1’s role relies on its ability to interact with Ssb, this chaperone complex may play a more ubiquitous role in regulating translation in response to stress.</p><p id="P20">Zuo1 is conserved in higher eukaryotes where it appears to share some functionality, as loss of this protein results in growth defects and hypersensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics, analogous to its loss in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). The mammalian homolog has also been implicated in regulating translation in basal conditions and has been linked to mTORC1 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). It is therefore possible that the role of Zuo1 in regulating translation in response to TORC1 inhibition is not confined to yeast. Loss of proteostasis is linked to aging and disease progression, and so it will be important to understand the impact that the RAC complex plays in maintaining proteostasis under challenging conditions, including in cellular aging and disease contexts, in higher organisms.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="T1" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><table frame="box" rules="all"><tbody><tr style="border-top: solid thin; border-bottom: solid thin"><td align="left" valign="middle">REAGENT or RESOURCE</td><td align="left" valign="middle">SOURCE</td><td align="left" valign="middle">IDENTIFIER</td></tr><tr style="border-bottom: solid thin"><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="3">Antibodies</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-P4D1<break/>(WB: 1:500)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Santa Cruz</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat# sc-8017</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-Phospho-S6 Ribosomal Protein<break/>(Ser235/236)<break/>(WB: 1:1000)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cell signalling<break/>technology</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#2211</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse anti-GFP<break/>(WB: 1:1000)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Roche</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat #11814460001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-PGK1<break/>(WB: 1:5000)</td><td align="left" valign="top">abcam</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#ab113687</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-Puromycin<break/>(WB: 1:500)</td><td align="left" valign="top">DSHB</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat #PMY-2A4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2<break/>(WB: 1:2000)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#F3165</td></tr><tr style="border-top: solid thin; border-bottom: solid thin"><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="3">Chemicals, peptides, and recombinant proteins</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Rapamycin</td><td align="left" valign="top">LC laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat #R-5000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Cycloheximide</td><td align="left" valign="top">Santa Cruz</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat #sc-3508A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Puromycin dihydrochloride</td><td align="left" valign="top">Santa Cruz</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat #sc-108071B</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">cOmplete, Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail</td><td align="left" valign="top">Roche</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat #11836170001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase</td><td align="left" valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat #18080044</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">PowerUp SYBR green Master mix</td><td align="left" valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat #A25776</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">GFP binder beads</td><td align="left" valign="top">MRC PPU Reagents<break/>and Services</td><td align="left" valign="top">DU54283</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Ponceau S</td><td align="left" valign="top">Santa Cruz</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat #sc-301558</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Clarity Western ECL substrate</td><td align="left" valign="top">Bio-Rad</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat #170-5061</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Clarity Max Western ECL substrate</td><td align="left" valign="top">Bio-Rad</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat #170-5062</td></tr><tr style="border-top: solid thin; border-bottom: solid thin"><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="3">Critical commercial assays</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">RNeasy Mini Kit</td><td align="left" valign="top">Qiagen</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat #74104</td></tr><tr style="border-top: solid thin; border-bottom: solid thin"><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="3">Deposited data</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">The proteomic dataset for Zuo1 interactors will be<break/>deposited as soon as EMBL-EBI has solved their issue<break/>with data submission.

Multiple unpaired t-test was used to determine the significant differences between untreated and rapamycin-treated conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>qRT-PCR</title><p id="P34">Total RNA from cells grown in the presence or absence of 200nM rapamycin for 2 hours was extracted using the RNeasy Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Synthesis of cDNA from 100ng of total RNA was carried out using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase and random primers. qRT-PCR analysis was performed on a CFX384 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix. Primer sequences are listed in the key resources table. The <italic>ALG9</italic> mRNA was used to normalise gene expression in each sample and changes in gene expression after rapamycin treatment were calculated using the ΔΔCt method.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P35">Each experiment was repeated independently a minimum of three times, as indicated.
