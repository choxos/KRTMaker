However, enzymatic inhibitors often exhibit low selectivity and high toxicity due to targeting multiple enzyme paralogs, which are often involved in distinct multisubunit complexes. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a non-enzymatic small molecule inhibitor of HDAC transcriptional repression functions with comparable anti-tumor activity to the enzymatic HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, and anti-psychedelic activity of an <italic>HDAC2</italic> knockout <italic>in vivo</italic>. We highlight that these phenotypes are achieved while modulating the expression of 20- and 80-fold fewer genes than enzymatic and genetic inhibition in the respective models. Thus, by achieving the same biological outcomes as established therapeutics while impacting a dramatically smaller number of genes, inhibitors of protein-protein interactions can offer important advantages in improving the selectivity of epigenetic modulators.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P4">

While catalytic pockets are attractive binding sites to identify such compounds, specific perturbation of enzymatic activity can be complicated by: i) the co-existence of numerous enzyme paralogs with distinct functions in unrelated pathways; and ii) the fact that many enzymes work as part of different multisubunit complexes for which associated proteins, and not the enzyme itself, determine substrate specificity and regulate enzymatic functions.</p><p id="P6">Human protein interactomes are emerging frontiers for the development of new therapeutics and the number of identified protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has already surpassed that of the druggable proteome by several orders of magnitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Yet, experimental tools and concepts are lagging behind to elevate PPI targets as a mainstream drug development ground, especially for high-order multisubunit complexes such as enzymatic complexes, which are abundant in the human proteome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. They thus represent attractive targets for emerging PPI modulator drugs with potentially greater selectivity.</p><p id="P7">This is particularly relevant for histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes such as Sin3, CoREST, NuRD, SMRT/NCoR, and MiDAC, which are major epigenetic transcriptional regulators and for which identification of inhibitors originally raised great therapeutic hopes, especially for cancer treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, despite huge resources and intense research invested in the last 30 years, and nearly a thousand clinical trials, most results have been disappointing and failed to meet the original promises. To date, only a handful of HDAC inhibitors have been approved for treatments of T-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and breast cancer in combinatorial therapy, i.e. none of these molecules are currently used as first-line medicines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. While HDAC inhibitors were originally discovered via functional cell-based experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, the universal strategy used in the last decades has consisted of screening molecules in cell-free enzymatic assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. This approach has delivered compounds that potently target deacetylase enzymatic pockets but display low selectivity <italic>in vivo</italic>, in that they tend to confer widespread effects on the transcriptome of treated cells, leading to derepression and in many cases deactivation of thousands of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Such wide transcriptomic effects are thought to be at least in part responsible for serious adverse reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">As alluded to above, most currently available inhibitors bind indiscriminately to the enzymatic pockets of several if not all of the 11 zinc-dependent HDAC paralogs encoded by the human genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, which makes selective inhibition challenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In addition, even if an inhibitor specifically were able to target a single HDAC paralog, it would still disrupt the many complexes in which that particular enzyme is involved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, suggesting that higher selectivity is likely not achievable by solely targeting enzymatic activity.</p><p id="P9">Since the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of all HDAC paralogs are carried on in the context of large protein complexes generally containing dozens of subunits and organized by large numbers of PPIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, alternative strategies have emerged based on targeting particular domains involved in intra-complex interactions, such as the paired amphipathic helix (PAH) domains of SIN3, a scaffold protein of HDAC complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. This has allowed scientists to identify a handful of peptidomimetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and small molecule inhibitors with implications in Huntington’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, chronic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> or medulloblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Although these focused studies demonstrate that inhibiting intra-complex PPIs is a viable strategy, systematic PPI targeting within HDAC complexes has not been extensively investigated and the global effects of PPI inhibitors on whole cellular transcriptomes remain unknown.</p><p id="P10">Here, we have probed the druggable landscape of the conserved Sin3 HDAC complex by unbiasedly targeting its transcriptional repression functions with small molecules <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have identified structurally unique repression inhibitors that leave HDAC enzymatic activity unperturbed using a genetically engineered growth selection. We show that one of these molecules binds to the conserved PAH2 domain of the SIN3 scaffold protein, disrupting its interaction with a DNA-binding protein and recruitment of the HDAC complex to specific genes. This PPI inhibitor achieves anti-tumor and anti-psychedelic activities that parallel those of the FDA-approved HDAC enzymatic inhibitor Vorinostat, and of an <italic>HDAC2</italic> knockout mouse model, respectively. Remarkably, these beneficial effects are achieved while altering the expression of up to two orders of magnitude fewer genes compared to classical HDAC enzymatic inhibition. Our findings pave the way towards the expansion of the druggable space of macromolecular complexes, and will help improving the identification of alternative targets for the development of more selective and effective epigenetic modulators.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Targeting core subunits of the Sin3 HDAC complex</title><p id="P11">To interrogate the effect of small molecules on the repressive activity of an HDAC complex <italic>in vivo,</italic> we needed a model system that conserves critical features observed in human but in which positive selection for cell-permeable and non-toxic compounds could easily be implemented at large scale.

E6R is an experimental compound which, in addition to bind to SIN3 PAH2 domains also binds to the conserved PAH1 and PAH3 domains of yeast and human SIN3 proteins according to NMR STD, DLB, and CPMG-R<sub>2</sub> assays (data not shown).

We hypothesize that this might potentially result in reduced toxicity and fewer adverse effects during treatments of disorders in which HDAC complexes play a role. Although this appears as an important advantage, it remains to be formally demonstrated that this higher selectivity can be linked to lower toxicity in animal models and patients.

HDAC enzymatic activity was measured following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, linear ranges of the assay were determined by measuring luminescence signals, in a serial dilution manner, for semi-purified human HDAC1, or live yeast cells, diluted in the HDAC-Glo I/II buffer. For HeLa nuclear extracts, the manufacturer provided the working concentration in the assay kit protocol. For the different HDAC sources, dilution factors corresponding to signals in the linear ranges were used to work under optimal conditions of sensitivity (∼5-10x dilution for FLAG-HDAC1; ∼10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>7</sup> yeast cells/reaction). To test the effect of compounds on HDAC enzymatic activity, equal volumes of HDAC sources (5 µL), and inhibitors (5 µL) were added to the different wells of a white, flat bottom 384-well plate.

Then, 125 mM glycine was applied for 5 min at room temperature to quench cross-linking. Yeast cells were centrifuged (10 min at 1,000 g), and the resulting pellets were washed twice with 50 mL ice-cold PBS.

For each library 21 bases were sequenced in read 1, containing the cell barcode (12 bp) information and a unique molecular identifier (UMI, 8 bp), whereas 50 bases were obtained for the read 2 sequence. After sequencing, reads were demultiplexed using Illumina bcl2fastq (v2.20.0.422) and the resulting FASTQs were concatenated and aligned to the the human “GRCh38-2020-A” reference genome using StarSolo alignment pipeline (v2.7.9a) on Terra.</p></sec><sec id="S51"><title>Seurat QC/UMAP generation for scRNA-seq data</title><p id="P90">A total of 90,306 cells and 36,601 genes were obtained across 6 samples (three conditions: DMSO, TSA, E6R; each tested in duplicate). Subsequently, low quality cells were filtered out, including cells with fewer than 200 unique genes, greater than 9,000 unique genes, and greater than 40% mitochondrial reads, resulting in 46,751 cells and 25,468 genes. The data were then normalized, scaled by a factor of 10,000, and logarithmized. Following filtering, an initial dimensionality reduction was performed by performing PCA over the 2,000 most variable genes. We visualized cells from each array using a UMAP plot across 25 principal components over the highly variable genes and default parameters grouped by the treatment conditions. To identify differences between drug treatment conditions, we first obtained the differentially expressed genes between the conditions. Differentially expressed genes were determined using the FindMarkers function on Seurat 4.1.0 with “test.use=MAST” and default parameters. For these comparisons, we looked at the genes expressed by cells treated with either TSA or E6R with respect to DMSO. The genes were then filtered for adjusted p value &lt;0.05, and plotted as a volcano plot using EnhancedVolcano 1.8.0. Log fold changes of the 65 genes upregulated by both TSA and E6R and 22 genes downregulated by both TSA and E6R in the bulk RNA-seq approach were determined using the FindMarkers function on Seurat 4.1.0 with “test.use=MAST”, “logfc.threshold = 0”, and “min.pct = 0”. Python 3.8.5 was used for generating the plots.</p></sec><sec id="S52"><title>Mice xenografted with human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)-C cells</title><p id="P91">Xenograft studies were performed at the TRACE PDX platform of the Leuven Cancer Institute (LKI) at KU Leuven - UZ Leuven (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/research/50488876/54502087/Trace">https://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/research/50488876/54502087/Trace</ext-link>), according to the ARRIVE guidelines.
