In model cell lines, mRNA-1273 is swiftly degraded in a process initiated by the removal of mΨCmΨAG, followed by CCR4-NOT-mediated deadenylation. In contrast, intramuscularly inoculated mRNA-1273 undergoes more complex modifications. Notably, mRNA-1273 molecules are re-adenylated after mΨCmΨAG removal. Detailed analysis of immune cells involved in antigen production revealed that in macrophages, after mΨCmΨAG removal, vaccine mRNA is very efficiently re-adenylated, and poly(A) tails can reach up to 200A. In contrast, in dendritic cells, vaccine mRNA undergoes slow deadenylation-dependent decay. We further demonstrate that enhancement of mRNA stability in macrophages is mediated by TENT5 poly(A) polymerases, whose expression is induced by the vaccine itself.

Thankfully for humankind, mRNA vaccines were deployed at an almost unimaginable speed and at worldwide scale.</p><p id="P6">Though pressed into immediate action, the mRNA vaccine field is still at very early stages. As this method of vaccine design was entirely new, it is essentially unknown how cellular and organismal systems respond to administration of an mRNA vaccine. Successful targeting of an mRNA vaccine, such as that against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, could be vastly improved by understanding the systems responsible for disseminating the vaccine in the body; uptake of the exogenous mRNA in different cell types; how or if mRNA inside the cell is maintained or metabolized; and how the protein product of the mRNA is used to build an immune reaction.</p><p id="P7">Clarification and harnessing of even some of these factors could make a significant difference in the efficacy and utility of mRNA vaccines. These factors could be of critical importance for reducing the ongoing burden of COVID-19, and also be broadly applied to improve the action and efficacy of many viral agents. The most potent vaccines for combating COVID-19 (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) to date are based on <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed (IVT) mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. mRNA vaccines are administered encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and enter cells mainly by endocytic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. A fraction of these payloads is released from endosomes to the cytosol, where protein production occurs. Intramuscularly administered mRNA vaccines transfect neighboring resident immune cells, such as antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. These cells become activated and migrate to neighboring lymph nodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. LNPs, as well as secreted antigens produced in muscles, are also transported to local lymph nodes, where they are taken up by macrophages and resident DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Although not directly demonstrated, it is likely that vaccine antigens transported with lymph and/or locally produced in the lymph nodes are stored on the surface of follicular DCs and induce a humoral immune response. DCs, which are central for adaptive immunity, endocytose antigens produced by other cells and translate vaccine mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Peptide antigens are presented in association with class I and class II MHC molecules to T cells to induce effector CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The latter include helper (Th1) and follicular helper T (Tfh1) cells that are involved in the regulation of antiviral immunity in the periphery and development of humoral immune response in the follicles, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Many studies on mRNA vaccines have focused on DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, though macrophages/monocytes are the main cell population that take up mRNA vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, their role in mRNA vaccine efficacy is not well defined.</p><p id="P8">Therapeutic mRNA resembles normal mRNA, having both a cap structure and poly(A) tail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, but it is generated through <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription, usually by T7 polymerase on a DNA template. A breakthrough in the development of RNA therapeutics came with the discovery that replacement of uridine with N1-methyl-pseudouridine (mΨ) decreases the innate immune response and enhances mRNA stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Although most currently synthesized mRNA therapeutics contain this modification, exceptions show it is not essential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The two worldwide-approved mRNA vaccines, Bnt162b2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and mRNA-1273<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, encoding coronaviral spike protein (S protein), are produced using IVT and have all uridines replaced with mΨ, as well as a similar 5’ cap that is incorporated co-transcriptionally for Bnt162b2 and post-transcriptionally for mRNA-1273. However, they differ in their UTR sequences and 3’ tails<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Bnt162b2 vaccine has a composite poly(A) tail, with 30As followed by 10 other nucleotides, and then 70 additional As<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, whereas mRNA-1273 has a poly(A) tail of undisclosed length. Both vaccines are formulated into nanoparticles with a similar lipid composition. The immune response was characterized for primary, secondary, and third dose vaccinations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, showing potent protection against the original variants, but also against variants of concern (VOC).</p><p id="P9">Knowledge about <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in-cell</italic> metabolism of mRNA vaccines is extremely limited and is largely based on extrapolation from experiments in established cell lines with generic mRNAs. The paradigm extrapolated from data obtained on endogenous transcripts (or reporters) asserts that the stability of therapeutic mRNAs is determined by the rate of poly(A) tail removal (deadenylation). Notably, almost nothing is known regarding the metabolism of vaccines’ poly(A) tails. Herein, we implement nanopore direct RNA sequencing for a detailed dissection of mRNA-1273, revealing the complexity of its metabolism. Importantly, we show that mRNA-1273 is stabilized in macrophages by TENT5-mediated re-adenylation. We further demonstrate that TENT5A enhances the expression of the mRNA-1273 antigen <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is essential for an efficient immune response. Notably, in the past, the action of the endogenous polyadenylation machinery on mRNA therapeutics has not been reported or even considered.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Direct RNA sequencing of mRNA vaccines</title><p id="P10">Studies of therapeutic mRNA metabolism face methodological challenges and, consequently, knowledge about the <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolism of mRNA vaccines is sparse. Approaches based on sequencing are usually indirect and rely on analysis of PCR-amplified cDNA. For poly(A) tails, such studies are error-prone, due to polymerase slipping on homopolymers. Similar problems concern the quality control of mRNA therapeutics, especially their poly(A) tails. Direct RNA sequencing (DRS, Oxford Nanopore Technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>) has the potential to overcome technical barriers, as it is based on detecting electric current during the passage of single ssRNA molecules through a protein pore. Thus, DRS can provide reliable information on RNA composition with single-molecule resolution. However, the replacement of uridine with mΨ in mRNA therapeutics poses additional challenges, as this substitution perturbs current signal recorded during DRS and can result in imprecise translation into sequence (basecalling)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">Analysis of intact mRNA-1273 using a standard DRS pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) showed that a significant proportion of aligned reads covered the full-length vaccine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, blue), showing promise for comprehensive analysis of mRNA therapeutics via DRS. However, these experiments confirmed that mΨ indeed affects the basecalling process [Extended Data (ED) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>)]. Only 35.74% of reads aligned to the reference vaccine sequence, and those aligned reads had only 74.1% identity to the reference. Thus, the current data analysis pipeline is presently unsuitable for mΨ modified mRNAs.</p><p id="P12">To improve our ability to identify desired reads, we developed a subsequence Dynamic Time Warping (sDTW) approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">ED Fig. 1b</xref>], to identify ionic current signatures specific to the 3’ end of mRNA-1273.</p><p id="P13">This method, in principle, is similar to targeted nanopore sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and independent of basecalling and mapping. Compared to mapping alone, a combination of sDTW with mapping allowed the identification of twice as many sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">ED Fig. 1c</xref>), validating the feasibility and promise of this approach. It was especially valuable for identifying shorter, lower-quality 3'-terminal reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">ED Fig. 1d</xref>), which would have been missed otherwise.</p><p id="P14">Next, we focused on improving accuracy in the determination of vaccine poly(A) tails, which are essential for mRNA stability and translation. Initially, we employed the nanopolish-polya algorithm to identify and measure poly(A) tails<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, with good accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">ED Fig. 1e</xref>). This study revealed that mRNA-1273 has a poly(A) tract of ~100 adenosines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">ED Fig. 1f</xref>). However, visual inspection of the raw current revealed unexpected perturbation between the poly(A) tail and the adaptor used for library preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, bottom panel, green). Such a signal suggests the presence of terminal non-adenosine residue(s) in the mRNA-1273 vaccine. To verify whether this signature is specific to the 3’end of mRNA-1273, and not introduced during library preparation, we repeated the experiments with a vaccine RNA whose 3’ end was enzymatically extended with inosine nucleotides (I-tailing), followed by direct RNA sequencing with a custom protocol enabling the incorporation of such RNAs into the library. This analysis reproduced the same current perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">ED Fig. 1g</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Finally, Rapid Amplification of cDNA 3’ End (3’-RACE) Illumina sequencing revealed the presence of TCTAG (mΨCmΨAG in vaccine mRNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), which likely represents the residue of restriction enzyme cleavage of the DNA template. For quantitative studies of mRNA-1273, we generated an enhanced DRS pipeline (eDRS) incorporating sDTW and a modified algorithm for the detection of poly(A) tails with mΨCmΨAG. Analysis of intact vaccine RNA showed that the major fraction of vaccine RNA molecules had an intact 3’ end. We observed that roughly 20% of the analyzed reads lacked the mΨCmΨAG sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, red, bottom panel) and were characterized by a broader distribution of poly(A) lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, red, upper panel). We propose that the eDRS pipeline is well suited to the analysis of mRNA vaccines and, in principle, could serve as a quality control step for mRNA therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Rapid deadenylation of mRNA-1273 in model cell lines</title><p id="P16">We then used eDRS to monitor stability and poly(A) tail status in cells typically used for pre-clinical analysis. We first determined the optimal amount of vaccine RNA: non-toxic to cells, allows efficient protein production, and detectable in bulk RNA with eDRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">ED Fig. 2ab</xref>). Then, HEK293T and A549 cells were transfected and cultured for up to 72 h, followed by RNA extraction and DRS. eDRS efficiently separated vaccine mRNA from endogenous mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">ED Fig. 2c</xref>), allowing recovery of up to twice as many reads, compared to the standard basecalling/mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">ED Fig. 2d</xref>). Analysis of poly(A) tails revealed that mΨCmΨAG was swiftly removed in both cell lines, followed by deadenylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2bc</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">ED Fig. 2e</xref>); this was observed as a reduction in mean poly(A) length with time, accompanied by a decreased number of vaccines reads. Concordantly with the RNA decay, spike protein levels also decreased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), confirming direct relation between RNA stability and protein production.</p><p id="P17">To verify the role of deadenylation in mRNA-1273 decay, we constructed a HEK293T line with tetracycline-inducible depletion of the scaffold subunit (CNOT1) of the primary deadenylase complex CCR4-NOT. CNOT1 depletion increased global poly(A) lengths of endogenous mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">ED Fig. 2f</xref>) and also decreased poly(A) tail shortening in mRNA-1273, compared to the uninduced state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). We only observed significant changes in poly(A) length in reads lacking the terminal mΨCmΨAG pentamer. The ratio of transcripts lacking the pentamer remained the same in both conditions, implying that CCR4-NOT is not involved in pentamer removal. These observations indicate that, as previously suggested based on the analysis of endogenous transcripts, deadenylation limits the lifetime of therapeutic mRNAs in model cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Re-adenylation of mRNA-1273 <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P18">The exact fate of mRNA therapeutics depends on many factors, which are hard to recapitulate in model cell lines. The micro-environment at the site of RNA delivery and the gene expression patterns specific to cells taking up the mRNA may influence its stability and, thus, the therapeutic outcome. Hence, we intramuscularly delivered mRNA-1273 via an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model to study vaccine mRNA metabolism.</p><p id="P19">We isolated RNA from the tissues at the injection sites 2, 8, and 24 h post-immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and observed that vaccine mRNA quickly diminishes from the injection site and is barely detectable after 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). eDRS was conducted for samples where a sufficient amount of vaccine mRNA was detected (as revealed by qPCR). Of interest, the majority of mRNA-1273 poly(A) tails contained mΨCmΨAG 24 h after injection, though mild deadenylation of processed tails was noticeable at all analyzed time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). To our surprise, a substantial fraction of mRNA-1273 reads had increased poly(A) length, reaching up to 150-200As. All of these reads lacked the terminal pentamer, suggesting that re-adenylation of vaccine RNA occurs after its removal. At this juncture, most of the injected vaccine RNA would have been taken up by immune cells and transferred to draining lymph nodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, due to the overall low prevalence of mRNA-1273 in lymph nodes, compared to injection sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, we could not analyze similar poly(A) tail extension dynamics there.</p><p id="P20">To see whether mRNA-1273 re-adenylation occurs in monocyte/macrophages and DCs, which are reported to be the major cell type taking up BNT162b2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, we analyzed vaccine metabolism using eDRS in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs, further termed DCs). Both types of cells were efficiently transfected mRNA-1273 LNPs without visible toxic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">ED Fig. 3a</xref>), allowing antigen translation for up to 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Vaccine mRNA was stable and easily detectable for at least 72 h, with around 25% of molecules having an intact 3’end after 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3ef</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">ED Fig. 3bc</xref>). We observed that 24 h after transfection, the poly(A) tails of vaccine mRNAs were elongated by ~20As on average, reaching up to 200As in BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">ED Fig. 3b</xref>). The mean poly(A) length returned to the initial ~100As 72 h after transfection. Notably, dynamic change in polyadenylation was observed only for tails lacking the 3’ terminal pentamer, and mRNA-1273 reads with an intact 3’ end had, on average, the same length of poly(A) at all analyzed time points. Re-adenylation was not observed in DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">ED Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In sum, our data show that mRNA-based vaccines can be stable and even undergo poly(A) tail elongation <italic>in vivo</italic>, a novel result that has not previously been reported or considered in the literature.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Global transcriptomic responses upon mRNA-1273 administration and induction of TENT5 poly(A) polymerases</title><p id="P22">Gene expression analysis of RNA samples isolated from injection sites revealed complex transcriptomic responses following vaccination.

However, DCs express low levels of TENT5, raising the question of whether TENT5-mediated stabilization of vaccine mRNA in macrophages affects immune response. TENT5C is expressed in B cells, and was shown to regulate the humoral response by polyadenylation of immunoglobulin transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, whereas TENT5A was described only in the context of innate immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, we immunized WT and <italic>Tent5a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with mRNA-1273, and measured antigen and antibody production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Significantly lower spike (S) protein concentrations were observed in <italic>Tent5a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse serum, both at days 2 and 4 post-immunization, compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Further, the S protein concentration was significantly decreased on day 4, compared to day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">ED Fig. 5f</xref>). Thus, mRNA-1273 stabilization through TENT5A-mediated re-adenylation has a direct effect on antigen production, both the amount and the longitude. However, some effects on macrophage secretory capability caused by Tent5a KO can also contribute to decreased levels of the antigen. Importantly, the level of serum anti-spike IgG 14 days post-immunization was significantly lower in <italic>Tent5a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, and in 3 of 4 mice was barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>), despite the overall higher level of IgGs in the sera compared to WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">ED Fig. 5g</xref>). These data indicate that impaired immune response in <italic>Tent5a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals is directly related to diminished antigen translation and subsequent presentation. Moreover, since a good correlation exists between the S protein concentration in serum and spike-specific IgG in immunized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>), we postulate that secretion of the antigen by macrophages after intramuscular administration of mRNA vaccines plays a significant role in building the immune response.</p><p id="P30">Overall, our results indicate that mRNA vaccine metabolism varies across cell types and that this has a significant influence on immunization efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated vaccine technology development, and the timely introduction of mRNA vaccines has played an essential role in slowing the spread of the disease-causing virus, SARS-CoV-2. This report provides the first evidence that therapeutic mRNAs are modified in cells, such that their poly(A) tails are extended by the cellular machinery. We also demonstrate that cellular mRNA processing varies between cell types and tissues. Here, we identify TENT5A cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase as responsible for vaccine mRNA re-adenylation, and we show that re-adenylation enhances the stability of mRNA therapeutics in macrophages and affects the magnitude of the humoral immune response. Finally, we implement a highly efficient methodology based on direct RNA sequencing (DRS) for the analysis of mRNA therapeutics. Together, our results offer an explanation for the efficacy of existing mRNA vaccines and may profoundly influence the development of next-generation mRNA therapeutics.</p><p id="P32">After administration, mRNA vaccines build immune responses in a complex way. Before COVID-19, efforts related to mRNA vaccine development were primarily focused on developing anti-cancer agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Although mRNA design was usually optimized in cell lines, the aim was to target dendritic cells that are assumed to produce and present the antigen, to build both humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses. Here, for the first time, we show that macrophages play a critical role and are responsible for antigen production. Not only are monocytes/macrophages the major cell populations that take up vaccine mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, but these cells also express TENT5A, which re-adenylates mRNA-1273, thereby increasing its stability and protein output. In <italic>Tent5a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant mice, a significant drop in antigen production is observed, coinciding with the impaired development of an antigen-specific humoral response. Thus, it can be expected that spike (S) proteins produced by macrophages, either at the site of vaccine inoculation or in the draining lymph nodes (where LNPs are transported and captured by macrophages), are endocytosed by LN resident DCs, resulting in induction of Th1 and Tfh cells, and follicular DCs, resulting in induction of humoral immune response.</p><p id="P33">Although the data presented were obtained using mRNA-1273, similarity in the mode of action of BNT162b2 indicates a likely role for TENT5A for this vaccine as well. Moreover, the fact that TENT5 substrates must be terminated with poly(A) sheds new light on the different efficacies of two anti-COVID19 mRNA vaccine prototypes developed by CureVac (CV). The original prototype, which failed clinical trials due to low efficacy, had a heavily engineered 3’ end: its poly(A)64 was followed by poly(C)30 and a histone stem-loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In contrast, the second generation prototype, CV2nCoV, which was more potent in building immune response, terminates with a poly(A) tail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and thus would be amenable for TENT5 mediated re-adenylation.</p><p id="P34">Development of therapeutic mRNAs goes beyond vaccines, and intensive efforts are underway to use mRNA to treat many mendelian diseases or induce the production of therapeutic proteins. In these cases, the main target is the liver, as the transfection of hepatocytes is very efficient after intravenous delivery of LNP-encapsulated mRNAs. There are also attempts to target other organs/cell types. Here, we show that various cell types metabolize mRNA vaccines differently. Only those expressing high levels of TENT5s would be expected to stabilize mRNA through re-adenylation. Although the mechanism of substrate recognition by TENT5 is largely unknown, ER targeting is a prerequisite feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Further mechanistic research will be needed to decipher substrate recognition of TENT5 poly(A) polymerases and to explore their physiological roles. However, it is clear that target cells expressing high levels of TENT5s will be desirable for therapeutic mRNAs encoding secreted proteins. Moreover, better knowledge about substrate recognition will allow for the rational design of mRNAs much more efficiently polyadenylated by TENT5 and, therefore, more stable. Other tissue-specific mechanisms of mRNA stabilization may also be uncovered in the future. All these observations emphasize that the design of therapeutic mRNAs needs to be tailored to the target cells and the target site of the protein product.Methods</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Mice lines and immunization</title><p id="P35">All mice lines were generated by the CRISPR/Cas9-based method in the Genome Engineering Unit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://crisprmice.eu/">https://crisprmice.eu/</ext-link>) as described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.
