During ageing, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that produce immune cells are thought to decline in their regenerative capacity. However, HSPC function has been mostly assessed using transplantation assays, and it remains unclear how HSPCs age in the native bone marrow niche. To address this issue, we developed a novel <italic>in situ</italic> single cell lineage tracing technology to quantify the clonal composition and cell production of single cells in their native niche. Our results demonstrate that a pool of HSPCs with unequal output maintains myelopoiesis through overlapping waves of cell production throughout adult life. During ageing, the increased frequency of myeloid cells is explained by greater numbers of HSPCs contributing to myelopoiesis, rather than increased myeloid output of individual HSPCs. Strikingly, the myeloid output of HSPCs remained constant over time despite accumulating significant transcriptomic changes throughout adulthood. Together, these results show that, unlike emergency myelopoiesis post-transplantation, aged HSPCs in their native microenvironment do not functionally decline in their regenerative capacity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Immune cells are constantly replenished throughout an organism’s lifetime by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). While this replenishment is particularly important for short lived immune cells such as granulocytes and monocytes, longer lived immune cells such as lymphocytes also require input from hematopoiesis in addition to homeostatic proliferation. It has previously been demonstrated that during ageing blood cell production shifts toward myeloid cells at the expense of lymphoid cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, a change that correlates with a higher risk of several myeloid-associated pathologies, including myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemia.</p><p id="P4">Within the murine bone marrow, age-related changes in myeloid cell numbers are accompanied by an increase in immunophenotypic stem cell (HSC) frequency or numbers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Downstream of HSCs, lymphoid biased MPPs descrease in frequency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, followed by a decreased frequency in downstream common lymphoid progenitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and an increased frequency of granulo-monocyte progenitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. At the cellular level, the increase in myeloid production may happen through two non-exclusive mechanisms: an increase in the number of myeloid-biased hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), or an increase in the number of myeloid cells that are produced per individual HSPC. The first mechanism has been well documented post-transplantation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> whereas the second mechanism remains controversial <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. At the molecular level, aged HSPCs upregulate stress response and inflammation related gene signatures, as well as genes involved in myeloid differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Aged HSCs show increased expression of a self-renewal related gene expression program <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, while aged HSPCs increase expression of differentiation-related programs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> relative to young HSPCs. These molecular changes, together with the decreased rate of cell production of old HSCs in competitive transplantation with young HSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, the increased number of myeloid-biased HSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and the decreased self-renewal of HSC after secondary transplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> has led to a model in which aged HSPC exhaustion is a hallmark of an ageing immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Importantly, consolidating data from native and post-transplantation hematopoiesis is non-trivial, with recent reports highlighting important differences between them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Using <italic>in situ</italic> barcoding, Camargo and colleagues demonstrated that in young adult mice a larger number of HSCs contributes to steady state hematopoiesis as compared to post-transplantation hematopoiesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In addition, fate mapping studies have shown that the dynamics of HSC activation in native hematopoiesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> differ from those observed after transplantation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Given that most functional measurements of aged HSPCs come from transplantation assays, further work on the functional characterization of HSPCs within the native bone marrow microenvironment is required. One study using confetti mice showed a decrease in HSC clonal diversity with age <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> but the modest diversity of this system is insufficient to uniquely label each cell within the HSC pool, estimated to comprise 17,000 cells in a single mouse <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, HSPCs have been shown to display functional heterogeneity with respect to self-renewal, differentiation and proliferation capacity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and the definition of HSPCs has evolved recently to include several new, functionally distinct, murine MPP subsets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. In summary, existing models of HSPC ageing are based on transplantation studies or population-level assays. However, recent studies have identified important differences between native and transplantation hematopoiesis, highlighting the need for single-cell resolution assays to resolve HSPC heterogeneity. <italic>In situ</italic> barcoding approaches can address these two key limitations, and may thereby improve our understanding of the cellular dynamics that drive ageing of the immune system.</p><p id="P6">To elucidate the effect of ageing on HSPCs in their natural niche at single-cell resolution, we developed the DRAG mouse, a novel <italic>in situ</italic> single cell lineage tracing technology that exploits the process of VDJ recombination. DRAG barcoding revealed that steady state adult myelopoiesis is sustained by overlapping waves of cell production throughout adulthood. Furthermore, the increased rate of myeloid cell production during ageing is explained through an increase in the number of myeloid producing HSPCs, rather than an increase in the number of myeloid cells produced per individual HSPC. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of HSPCs across adulthood is consistent with this model, suggesting a reduced frequency of quiescent stem cells, and the emergence of age-associated active progenitor subsets. Collectively, our data reveal that, in the native bone marrow microenvironment, individual aged HSPCs produce myeloid cells at the same rate as young HSPCs, despite the accumulation of transcriptomic changes associated with stress and inflammation. These data provide evidence that HSPC in their native niche are not exhausted in their capacity to produce myeloid cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A novel quantitative in situ barcoding system</title><p id="P7">Taking advantage of the capacity of the VDJ recombination system to produce a high degree of genetic diversity in the lymphoid lineages, we designed a DNA cassette, termed DRAG (Diversity through RAG), with the aim to allow endogenous barcoding in an organism in a temporally controlled manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The DRAG system has been designed such that upon CRE induction, a segment between two loxP sites is inverted, leading to the expression of both the RAG1 and 2 enzymes and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Such expression then leads to the semi-random RAG-mediated recombination of synthetic V-, D- and J-segments, with additional diversity being generated both by nucleotide deletion and TdT-mediated N-addition at the junction sites. Notably, as the RAG/TdT cassette and recombination signal sequences (RSSs) are spliced out during this recombination step, further recombination of the DRAG locus is prevented, and any generated VDJ sequence is thus stable over time. Finally, recombination of the DRAG locus results in the removal of a BGH polyA site that precludes GFP expression in the DRAG configuration before recombination, allowing one to identify barcode<sup>+</sup> cells by flow cytometry or imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To quantify the sensitivity, specificity and fidelity of the DRAG barcoding system, we benchmarked the DRAG barcoding system <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. First, to understand DRAG recombination patterns <italic>in vitro</italic>, we isolated embryonic fibroblasts (MEF cells) from CAGCre-ER<sup>+/-</sup> DRAG<sup>+/-</sup> mice, induced DRAG recombination with tamoxifen, and derived MEF clones (n=24) that carried a single DRAG barcode by limited dilution. Recombined DRAG loci were characterized by insertions and deletions between the VDJ segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), and only 2 of the 24 barcodes were shared between MEF clones. Longitudinal analysis of barcode sequences by Sanger and deep sequencing demonstrated that recombined sequences were stable over time in all clones tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). To allow robust detection, identification and quantification of DRAG barcodes, we developed a processing platform that incorporates unique molecular identifiers (UMI) during PCR amplification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref> Sup Method) and a strict filtering pipeline of sequencing data. Application of this strategy to defined mixtures of 7 MEF clones that each contain a different barcode demonstrated that this platform allows the robust detection and quantification of barcodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). With regards to barcode specificity, in these mixtures, the number of false positive DRAG barcode events was 0 over 14, except for one mixture in which we had 1 false positive over 14. With regards to sensitivity of detection, clones equal or greater than 10 cells were efficiently identified in samples of as few as 97 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>); and clones equal or greater than 100 cells were identified in samples of 25,000 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), corresponding to as little as 0.4% of the total cell population. Furthermore, across the entire detection range, experimentally observed frequencies were highly correlated to input frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), demonstrating that DRAG permits quantitative analyses of clonal output.</p><p id="P9">To characterize the DRAG barcoding system <italic>in vivo,</italic> we induced barcode recombination by tamoxifen administration in CAGCre-ER<sup>+/-</sup> DRAG<sup>+/-</sup> mice and analysed hematopoietic cells from blood samples taken 6 months later. Induction of Cre resulted in a 5- to 6-fold increase in barcode-labeled (GFP<sup>+</sup>) myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>), relative to mock-induced DRAG mice. In addition, no variation was observed in the percentage of myeloid and lymphoid cells produced from recombined (GFP<sup>+</sup>) or unrecombined (GFP<sup>-</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>), indicating that DRAG induction appears neutral with respect to hematopoietic cell differentiation. Deep sequencing analysis of barcode sequences processed 15 months post Cre-induction confirmed the high diversity of the DRAG barcoding system <italic>in vivo</italic>. Specifically, barcodes were characterized by up to 15 nucleotide insertions and 32 nucleotide deletions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-B</xref>), and D-segment inversion was observed in 12% of cases. Lastly, to assess the likelihood that the same DRAG recombination pattern occurs independently in 2 or more cells <italic>in vivo</italic> we applied a mathematical model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> to infer the probability that a given barcode will be produced in the DRAG system (Pgen) using experimental data as input (Suppl. methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3-8</xref>). This experimentally validated approach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>, Suppl. Methods) enabled us to identify sequences with a high generation probability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>), such that they can be filtered from the data prior to downstream analyses. On the basis of these results, we selected a Pgen estimate of &lt;10<sup>-4</sup> for further data analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D-E</xref>). At this probability cut-off, 61% of barcode sequences were retained, and 92% of these retained barcodes were unique to an individual mouse, yielding hundreds of barcodes that could be used for analysis.</p><p id="P10">Together, these data show that the DRAG mouse model allows the generation for high barcode diversity <italic>in vivo</italic> without a requirement for cell transplantation, and that the prevalence of these barcodes in downstream progeny can be detected in a quantitative manner.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>DRAG labeling of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells</title><p id="P11">Having established the feasibility of in vivo barcoding in DRAG mice, we applied the system to study native hematopoiesis. Given the ubiquitous expression of the CAGCre-ER™ driver, tamoxifen-based induction will result in the labeling of both HSPCs, but also committed progenitors and differentiated cells. Importantly, at late time points (month) after induction, turnover of short-lived committed progenitors and differentiated cells, and replacement by progeny of long-lived cells, has occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Thus, the barcodes observed several months after induction will be inherited from ancestor cells that qualify as long-term repopulating cells <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Importantly, this unbiased functional definition of long-term output towards a short-lived downstream cell population is independent of surface markers or HSC-selective gene promoters to drive Cre expression. To directly test whether the DRAG system homogeneously labels the HSPC compartment, we performed 10X single cell RNA-sequencing on both GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>-</sup> bone marrow HSPCs. After data QC and processing (Suppl. methods), unsupervised Louvain clustering resulted in 8 clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A-C</xref>) that were annotated by mapping to the previously described gene expression signatures of long-term HSCs and multipotent progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B and C</xref>). GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>-</sup> HSPC cells were distributed equally among the clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D and E</xref>), with the exception of MPP3 that was enriched in GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (Fishers exact test p &lt; 0.001), but this effect was not statistically significant when the frequency of GFP labelling was assessed by flow cytometry (Fig S3D). Importantly, GFP<sup>+</sup>, and hence barcode-labeled, cells were also observed in the long-term HSC associated clusters, characterized by high expression of the long-term HSC gene signature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), high expression of <italic>Ly6a,</italic> and low expression of <italic>Cd48</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E</xref>). Thus, the DRAG system efficiently labels the HSPC compartment, including long-term hematopoietic stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Steady state myelopoiesis is maintained by overlapping waves of cell production</title><p id="P12">To study the clonal dynamics of myelopoiesis at steady state, we analysed the distribution of barcodes across different developmental compartments of the bone marrow. Specifically, bone marrow HSPCs (LSK: sca1<sup>+</sup>ckit<sup>+</sup>), myeloid progenitors (MP: myeloid progenitors, sca1<sup>-</sup>ckit<sup>+</sup>) and myeloid cells (CD11b<sup>+</sup>) were isolated at 15-month post-induction in a cohort of DRAG mice that received tamoxifen induction between 6-14 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A-B</xref>). Following initial filtering, quality checks and removal of frequently occurring barcodes, correlations between barcode abundance in duplicate samples (LSK: 0.5 +/-0.1, MP: 0.7 +/- 0.1, M: 0.6 +/-0.2) were calculated to assess the consistency between technical replicates. Following this quality control steps, barcode sharing analysis revealed a number of different fates with only 13.7% (+/-5% SD between mice) of barcodes shared across HSPCs, myeloid progenitors and myeloid cells. These multi-outcome clones were among the most prolific, producing 41.4% (+/-12.2% SD between mice) of myeloid cells, and representing 69.9% (+/-23.7% SD between mice) of HSPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C and D</xref>). Interestingly, a number of barcodes detected in HSPCs were not detected in downstream developmental compartments, suggesting that their contribution to myelopoiesis at this timepoint was limited. These HSPC-restricted barcodes produced 24.6% (+/- 19% SD between mice) of the total HSPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C and D</xref>). In addition, we detected barcodes that were abundant in myeloid progenitors and myeloid cells but below the threshold of detection in HSPCs. These MP-M restricted barcodes were producing 48% (+/-23% SD between mice) of myeloid progenitors and 43.2% (+/-8% SD between mice) of myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C and </xref>). Notably, while MP-M and HSPC-MP restricted barcodes were both observed, no barcodes were detected in both HSPC and myeloid cells without being detected in myeloid progenitors (HSPC-M class, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), arguing against stochastic detection of DRAG barcodes as a major confounder. Importantly, barcode outcomes were independent of barcode generation probability, suggesting that the barcode patterns we observed across developmental compartments were not due to limitations in detection sensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4F</xref>).</p><p id="P13">If not all HSPCs would be active at the same time, it may be expected that the numbers of clones in HSPCs could be higher than that detected in mature myeloid cells. To test for this prediction, total clone numbers were inferred from the observed diversity (chao2) numbers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, taking into account labelling efficiency (chao2 analysis in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4E</xref> for other diversity estimates and Methods). Bone marrow myeloid cells were composed of at least 1,827 +/- 430 clones (mean and SD between mice), a value similar to published estimates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, while myeloid progenitors and HSPCs were composed of more clones, (2,646 +/- 1081 clones, and 3,040 +/-953 clones respectively). This analysis suggests that not all clones present in the HSPC compartment are actively contributing to myelopoiesis, an observation that is compatible with a model of overlapping waves of myelopoiesis. Note that these estimates should be interpreted as the lower bound of total diversity, because of cell loss during extraction, limitation in the detection of small clones and the presence of recurrent barcodes. Together, these results suggest that steady state myelopoiesis is sustained by overlapping waves of HSPCs.</p><p id="P14">To explore whether individual long-term repopulating clones produce similar numbers of myeloid cells, we took advantage of our quantitative barcode detection system to determine the number of output cells per barcode clone. This analysis demonstrated that individual barcode-labeled long-term repopulating cells differ up to ~100 fold in their myeloid cell output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>), with clone sizes ranging from 100 to 10,000 cells. As a result of this, the majority of myeloid cells at an analyzed timepoint was produced by few barcoded long-term repopulating cells. This disparity in clone sizes may in part reflect temporal differences in clonal activity, but remains higher than the clonal diversity observed post-transplantation, in which ~ 100-fold fewer HSPCs are estimated to actively contribute to hematopoiesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Overall, these data demonstrate that steady state myelopoiesis is the result of the unequal cellular output of a large number of clones, and are consistent with a model in which long-term repopulating cells maintains myelopoiesis through overlapping waves of cell production.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Increase in the number of long-term repopulating cells contributing to myelopoiesis with ageing</title><p id="P15">To study the effect of ageing on the clonal composition and cell production of long-term repopulating cells, we sampled the blood of DRAG mice from month 4 until month 12 post-induction, as well as blood and bone marrow at month 15 post-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Due to limitations in the volume of blood that can be sampled at each timepoint, we observed a very low rate of barcode overlap between technical replicates in blood (9% +/- 8%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>) as compare to bone marrow samples (60% +/- 15%). Thus, within blood samples, only a small subset of all active clones are captured, precluding longitudinal analyses of individual clones, but still allowing one to follow changes in the number of contributing clones over time. Consistent with prior work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, myeloid cell numbers in the blood of DRAG mice increased over time, and this increase was observed for both GFP<sup>-</sup> and GFP<sup>+</sup> (barcode labeled) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Likewise, an increase in total myeloid cells numbers between 6.5 and 19 month-old mice was observed in bone marrow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). Most bone marrow myeloid cells were neutrophils in both young (6.5 months) and aged mice (19 months) (young = 51.95 ± 0.7% ; old = 64.6 ± 2.4%), and the frequency of neutrophils increased in old mice at the expense of macrophages and monocytes (p = 0.029) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). This result suggests an imbalance in the relative production rates of different innate immune cell subsets upon ageing.</p><p id="P16">At the cellular level, the observed increase in myeloid cell production may occur by two non-exclusive mechanisms: an increase in the number of myeloid-producing long-term repopulating cells, or an increase in the number of myeloid cells that are produced per individual long-term repopulating cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). To distinguish between these scenarios , we analyzed the number of DRAG barcodes in the blood myeloid cell compartment over time. To this end, we computed the clonal diversity in sequential blood samples using Renyi entropy indexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>) and modeled the change in diversity as a function of time using generalized mixed models, accounting for sampling (Suppl. Materials and methods). We found that a generalized linear mixed model with a break point showed the best fit to the experimental data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B</xref>). Applying this model to several diversity indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S9</xref>) showed a highly consistent trend over time. Specifically, in the first 7 months following DRAG barcoding, the number of clones contributing to the myeloid compartment decreased over time, consistent with the turn-over of shorter-lived cells that were labeled using the ubiquitous CagCre driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2A</xref>). Strikingly, after this time point, the number of barcodes contributing to myelopoiesis increased linearly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), indicating that the number of long-term repopulating cells contributing to myelopoiesis was increasing over time. This increase could not be explained by the slight preferential labeling of MPP3, as MPP3 numbers did not increase with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Furthermore, increased barcode diversity was also not explained by a delayed recombination of DRAG barcode V regions, as the majority of barcodes was associated with a single unique V region, and as the frequency of unique V regions remained constant over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6D</xref>). Strikingly, the number of myeloid cells produced per long-term repopulating clone did not change over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Collectively, these results reveal that the increase in myeloid production upon aging is due to an increased number of myeloid producing long-term repopulating cells, rather than an increased clonal output of individual long-term repopulating cells.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Age-related transcriptomic changes in HSPCs</title><p id="P17">Our <italic>in situ</italic> lineage tracing analyses show that ageing leads to an increase in the frequency of long term repopulating clones that actively contribute to myelopoiesis. To understand the cellular and molecular processes that give rise to this phenomenon, we performed single cell transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) profiling of Sca1<sup>+</sup> cKit<sup>+</sup> GFP<sup>+</sup> HSPCs purified from mice aged 6,5,12, and 19 months old (n = 6 mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis of GFP labelling in HSPCs from aged (19 months) mice showed no significant differences in GFP<sup>+/-</sup> proportions amongst the HSC and MPP1-5 subsets, confirming that the DRAG barcoding system does not preferentially label a specific HSPC subset, even in aged mice (Figure S12B). Following scRNAseq data quality control and pre-processing, we recovered the transcriptome for 16,778 cells with a median of 2,845 genes detected per cell. After data integration and non-linear dimensionality reduction (UMAP), we performed unsupervised clustering of the data, and annotated the 11 resultant clusters using published gene signatures and markers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8A-B,S9A</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S13</xref>). Consistent with reports indicating that HSPCs do not form discrete cell subsets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, we observed that many clusters co-expressed signatures of the MPP1-5 subtypes (Figure 5C, S8B). In cases where clusters could not be assigned to a single HSPC subset, we named the cluster according to the different combinations of HSC and MPP signatures that they expressed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Using this reference embedding and supervised annotation of the data, we observed an accumulation of transcriptomic changes throughout adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D-F</xref>), with several clusters enriched in either young or in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). Specifically, these analyses suggest that LT-HSCs are less frequent in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>), whereas 4 clusters were only found in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). A common feature of these ageing-associated clusters was the co-expression of the MPP3, MPP4 and MPP5 gene signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C-D</xref>) and expression of genes associated with mature myeloid cells (CD74, Ngp, Cll5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9A</xref>). Pseudotemporal ordering of the data using a diffusion map approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> predicts that HSPCs from aged-associated clusters represent a more differentiated cell state as compared to HSPCs from young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). In addition, using a supervised annotation approach in which we mapped our cell clusters onto an independent reference dataset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> (44,802 c-kit<sup>+</sup> and c-kit<sup>+</sup> sca1<sup>+</sup> cells), we observed an age-related overall reduction in the number of cells that mapped to LT-HSCs, while cells from age-associated clusters increasingly mapped to lineage restricted progenitors including, GMP, MEP and CLP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9B-C</xref>). Together these data show that ageing leads to the reduced expression of genes associated with quiescent LT-HSCs, and the emergence of MPP-like cell states with features of enhanced differentiation.</p><p id="P18">We then further characterized the transcriptomic changes accumulating with age in particular in the age-associated MPP-like cell states. To understand if ageing leads to a change in cell cycle rates, cells were classified into G1/G2+M/S phases of the cell cycle based on their gene expression patterns <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9E</xref>). We observed age-associated increases in the proportion of cells in G2/M and S phases of the cell cycle across multiple clusters, including the age associated MPP3/4/5, MPP1/3/4/5, HSC/MPP3/4/5 and the MPP2/3/Cycling clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis between HSPCs of different ages showed an overall increased expression of myeloid associated genes <italic>S100a8, S100a9, Elane, Mpo and Fcer1g</italic> with age and decreased expression of genes associated with LT-HSCs including <italic>Procr, Ltb</italic> and <italic>Tcf15</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S14</xref>). Differential expression and gene-set enrichment analyses also showed that aged HSPCs have increased expression of genes related to inflammation, cytokine stimulation, cycling, and DNA damage, in line with prior data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, as well as transcriptomic changes related to the regulation of protein ubiquitination and the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S14-15</xref>). To assess which specific compartments were most affected by ageing we aggregated genes upregulated in aged HSPCs (from 19 month old mice) into an aged HSPC signature and assessed its expression across all clusters (Figure 6D). This analysis showed that much of the transcriptomic differences between young and aged HSPCs occurred within age-associated MPP compartments and MPP3, rather than HSCs or other MPPs (Figure 6D). Collectively, these scRNAseq analyses suggest that ageing leads to a decreased number of LT-HSCs and the emergence of age-associated MPP3/4/5-like cell states. Transcriptomically, these aged HSPCs display features of increased cycling, stress and metabolic gene expression. Together with our functional DRAG barcoding analyses, our data suggests that while HSPCs in the native bone marrow accumulate transcriptomic changes with ageing, their myeloid production rates remain consistent over time, suggesting that these changes are not impacting their ability to produce cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">In this work, we present a new <italic>in situ</italic> DRAG barcoding system that allows for efficient, neutral, stable, and diverse labeling of individual hematopoietic cells. In addition, the quantitative detection of resulting barcodes in downstream cells makes it possible to enumerate clonal output. Relative to other barcoding strategies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S12</xref>), the DRAG system offers several advantages such as a straightforward PCR and sequencing strategy (through the use of UMI and Single Read 65bp illumina sequencing), and a quantitative framework to filter and analyze barcoding data with high resolution. We do note that the utility of the approach in the lymphoid system is restricted because of the expected cassette recombination during B and T cell development. The DRAG barcoding system should be of value to examine aspects of tissue generation in other cell systems, such as brain and mammary gland, in which efficient labeling with limited background is observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Using the DRAG barcoding system, we observe that HSPCs are highly heterogeneous in the time and extent they contribute to myelopoiesis, with relatively few barcodes shared across the entire myeloid developmental trajectory, and clone sizes varying by several orders of magnitude. Clone size variability was not fully explained by differences in when clones were active as large clone size variations were observed in clones that were active at the same time (clones that were found across the entire myeloid developmental trajectory - HSPC, myeloid progenitors and mature myeloid) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4G</xref>). Our results extend previous findings on the existence of differentiation-inactive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> or childless<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> HSPC from other barcoding studies in the native niche by showing quantitative heterogeneity in cell production by HSPC. Together, these data support a model in which myelopoiesis is sustained by overlapping waves of HSPC activation, with large variations in the cellular outputs of each differentiation-active HSPC clone.</p><p id="P21">Ageing of the immune system is associated with dramatic changes in the distribution and functional properties of immune cells. Broadly, there is a skewing in favour of innate vs adaptive immunity, leaving older individuals increasingly susceptible to infection and chronic tissue inflammation. A lack of tools capable of measuring the output of individual HSPCs in the native bone marrow microenvironment has complicated the research literature around this topic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, with many associations being drawn between phenotypic changes in native hematopoiesis as observed by scRNAseq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> and functional changes in cellular output as observed in post-transplantation hematopoiesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In transplantation assays, aged HSPCs display a skewed output towards the myeloid and platelet lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, have a lower rate of self-renewal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and have a decreased cell production capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> relative to young HSPCs. Coupling of these transplantation-based functional measurements with gene expression patterns associated with stress and inflammation in native hematopoiesis have led to a model in which aged HSPC exhaustion is a hallmark of an ageing immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, our results on native hematopoiesis upon ageing do not fully support this model and are consistent with studies in young mice showing that native hematopoiesis differs from post-transplantation hematopoiesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Specifically, using longitudinal monitoring of the diversity of endogenous DRAG barcodes in blood we found that the increased myeloid production occurs through an increase in the number of long-term repopulating clones, rather than through an increased number of myeloid cells produced per clone. We therefore conclude that while aged HSPCs do exhibit transcriptomic signs of cell stress, inflammation and changes in global gene expression state, these cells are still able to functionally produce the same amount of myeloid cells, contradicting the current view that HSPC in their native niche are dysfunctional in their cell-production capacity.</p><p id="P22">Not all HSCs are differentiation-active at the same time during adulthood, as shown by our findings in this study and from previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, raising the question on whether the well-documented increase in phenotypic HSC numbers with ageing corresponds to an increase in differentiation-active or inactive HSCs. Transplantation studies suggest that part of this increase corresponds to an increase in the number of differentiation-active HSCs. However transplantation assays do not inform us on whether the HSPCs that accumulate with age are actively contributing to regeneration because of the perturbation generated by transplantation. Here, we show that the number of HSPC clones actively contributing to myelopoiesis increases with age in the native bone marrow. Importantly, this increased number of differentiation-active HSPCs could favor the occurrence of genetic mutations associated with clonal hematopoiesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, increasing the risk of hematological malignancies associated with age.</p><p id="P23">The finding that differentiation-active HSPCs increase in number with age is explained at the cellular level by a decreased number of LT-HSCs and the increase in frequency of cycling MPPs as observed by scRNAseq profiling, and suggest that LT-HSCs in aged individuals exit quiescence and contribute to hematopoietic flux at a faster rate than in younger individuals. The increased entry into cycling and differentiation of HSC could potentially be caused by repeated exposures to inflammation over the course of adulthood, and the occurrence of age-associated MPPs with signs of cell stress and inflammation forms indirect evidence for such a model. Furthermore, evidence that inflammation pushes LT-HSCs to differentiate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> and that ageing induces proliferative JAK/STAT signaling in HSPCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> are in line with this proposed mechanism. Of note, the changes in HSPC composition from scRNAseq were not consistent with changes in population dynamics when defined using surface markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12</xref>), suggesting that further work is needed to develop a unified definition and nomenclature for HSPCs that is consistent throughout adult and aged hematopoiesis. As the bone marrow niche has also been shown to change upon ageing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, extrinsic factors may also contribute to the increased number of active long-term repopulating clones in aged mice.</p><p id="P24">In summary, our study highlights the utility of quantitative in situ barcoding methods, and suggests that greater caution should be exercised when extrapolating results from transplantation assays to native hematopoiesis.

Example of GFP expression in myeloid cells (CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD19CD3<sup>-</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup>) in blood 6.5 months after tamoxifen (induced) or vehicle (control) administration. Within the GFP positive gate, a GFP<sup>mid</sup> and GFP<sup>high</sup> population is observed in myeloid cells. Both populations contain successfully recombined barcodes, and heterogeneity in GFP marker expression is likely due to the labelling of heterogeneous cell types with the pan myeloid marker cd11b (Figure S5A-B). In line with this, such heterogeneous GFP expression was not observed in non-myeloid cells. C. Percentage of GFP<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells of total myeloid cells in tamoxifen-induced (green) and control (black) (n=5 and n=3 mice respectively, all sampled over 13 months). Median and interquartile range with whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values. D. False positive rate and sensitivity of barcode detection. 7 MEF clones with known DRAG barcodes, were mixed in different numbers, and the input cell numbers of all MEF clones were compared to experimentally determined numbers upon PCR, sequencing and analysis.
