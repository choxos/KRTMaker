However, measuring trophic interactions remains challenging. Among the available methods, quantifying the plant composition of a species’ diet indicates how species use their environment and their associated niche overlap. Nevertheless, most studies focusing on herbivore trophic ecology ignore the influence that landscape variability may have. Here, we explored how landscape variability influences diet composition through niche overlap. We used eDNA metabarcoding to quantify the diet composition of two large herbivores of the Bialowieza Forest, Red deer (<italic>Cervus elaphus</italic>) and European bison (<italic>Bison bonasus</italic>) to investigate how increasing habitat quality (i.e. higher abundance of deciduous forage species) and predation risk (i.e. density of wolf in the area) influence their diet composition and niche partitioning. Our findings indicate diet composition is non-homogeneous across the landscape, both within and between species. Red deer showed greater diet variability and lower niche overlap within species compared to bison. We detected a reduction of niche overlap for red deer with increasing predation risk, leading to more dissimilar diets, suggesting their feeding behaviour is affected by wolf presence. This correlation was not found for bison, which are rarely predated by wolf. Higher habitat quality was associated with higher niche overlap only within bison, probably due to their suboptimal feeding strategy as browsers. These results show the importance of integrating environment-induced diet variation in studies aimed at determining the landscape usage or niche overlap of a species. Niche overlap can therefore be a powerful tool for inferring predation risk for red deer, and estimating predator abundance or its perception. This approach has enormous potential for wildlife management in areas where predator estimates are unknown or difficult to quantify.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>eDNA</kwd><kwd>DNA metabarcoding</kwd><kwd>biomonitoring</kwd><kwd>diet composition</kwd><kwd>herbivore interactions</kwd><kwd>niche overlap</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Mammalian herbivore species, and more precisely ungulates, are important regulators of the structure and functioning of forest ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bagchi et al. 2018</xref>, Bairey et al. 2016, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Becker et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zhang et al. 2018</xref>). Environmental factors such as plant composition, herbivore and predator densities, human activity or protection regime influence each species differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Speed et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kartzinel &amp; Pringle 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Miles et al. 2019</xref>). They create a multivariate landscape of environmental influences that affect the species interactions, feeding strategy and modify their trophic ecology, i.e., feeding relationship between a species and its environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abdala-Roberts et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Yoneya et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Liu et al. 2015</xref>). Thus, understanding how environmental factors influence the trophic ecology of herbivore species is key to correctly assess their ecological needs and adjust management policies accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Suraci et al. 2022</xref>). These factors can be used as an indicator to assess the status of a particular species in their environment and their potential impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sévêque et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Jesmer et al. 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Quantifying diet composition provides a proxy for measuring species trophic ecology. It reveals the plant species consumed, and has been used to study diet selection, diet overlap and niche partitioning between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lear et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Jesmer et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sévêque et al. 2020</xref>). Traditional methods for diet quantification include micro-histology of scats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Garnick et al. 2018</xref>) or rumen content analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gebert &amp; Verheyden-Tixier 2001</xref>), but both methodologies are very labour intensive and are increasingly replaced by DNA metabarcoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Piñol et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Ruppert et al. 2019</xref>). DNA metabarcoding (i.e. PCR amplification of short but informative barcodes with universal primers and next generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Taberlet et al. 2018</xref>) allows the simultaneous identification of different species within communities. This technique can be applied using the plant DNA present in the scats of herbivores, and provides a quantitative approach of the relative presence of each plant in the diet composition of each individual herbivore. Compared to traditional diet quantification methods, DNA metabarcoding can handle many samples at once and provides detailed information on diet composition, unlocking a new path for community ecology to study ecosystem functioning. These dietary studies have the potential to unfold the relation between herbivore diet selection and the environmental variables of study, providing a non-invasive tool for wildlife management to assess the habitat use of a species in their ecosystem and the role each environmental variable has.</p><p id="P5">However, very little is known on the linkage between environmental factors, species interactions and diet composition among herbivore species (Pansu et al. 2018, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">O’Connor et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Valls-fox et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Manlick et al. 2020</xref>). The difficulties arise mainly from the many environmental variables acting simultaneously at landscape scale on each individual and how they influence diet composition. To tackle this problem, a new concept has been recently proposed to differentiate landscape-scale herbivory regimes, i.e., integrate multiple environmental variables and how they are perceived by herbivores, the so-called “herbiscapes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bubnicki et al. 2019</xref>). In the Bialowieza forest, these functional areas have been described and we aim to use the described spatial variability within environmental factors to study how they affect diet composition within and between herbivore species. Overall, this creates an interesting experimental setup, where two sympatric species have to deal with distinct combinations of environmental factors within the whole ecosystem. The herbiscape approach could be advantageous for applied community ecology studies because they condense complex multivariate spaces into distinct functional areas.</p><p id="P6">We used scat DNA metabarcoding to characterise in the Bialowieza Primaeval Forest the diet composition of two common ungulate species, red deer and bison. We tested the role of predation risk (imposed by wolf, <italic>Canis lupus</italic>) and habitat quality (i.e. proportion of deciduous forest and mean altitude) as environmental factors on the diet overlap for each species and highlighted the key discriminant plant species. We further assessed the role of the environmental variables on the niche overlap within and between the two species. We hypothesised: (i) Low predation risk and high habitat quality are associated with higher interspecies niche overlap, as both species will select high nutrient plant species in low risk areas (for example, McArthur et al. 2014); (ii) Within species niche overlap is more sensitive to the environmental factors, but overall higher in bison due to their suboptimal feeding as browsers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kowalczyk et al. 2011</xref>); (iii) Red deer behaviour changes due to wolf predation and its niche overlap is reduced with increasing predation risk compared to bison, which remains unaltered as the species is rarely predated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bubnicki et al. 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Study area</title><p id="P7">Scat sampling was conducted in the Polish part of the Bialowieza Primaeval Forest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>), in the north-western part of Poland, on the border with Belarus. It has a total extension of 600 km<sup>2</sup> and covers a well-preserved fragment of the primaeval forest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), unique in Europe for its exclusion of forestry and ungulate management since 1921. The Polish part of the forest has two distinct management zones: the Bialowieza National Park (BNP, 105 km<sup>2</sup>), without forestry and no ungulate management, and the state forest, with forestry and ungulate management. It is composed of different ecosystems, such as open grasslands, wet marshes and deadwood forests, but is mainly dominated by the primaeval forest. Deciduous forests are the dominant type and include hornbeam (<italic>Carpinus betulus</italic>), oak (<italic>Quercus robur</italic>) and lime (<italic>Tilia cordata</italic>). Tree stands in the state forest are dominated by spruce (<italic>Picea sp.</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Jedrzejewska et al. 1994</xref>). Herbivore species present include moose (<italic>Alces alces</italic>), bison (<italic>bison bonasus</italic>), roe deer (<italic>Capreolus capreolus</italic>), wild boar (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>) and red deer (<italic>Cervus elaphus</italic>). Carnivore species present are wolves (<italic>Canis lupus</italic>) and lynx (<italic>Lynx lynx</italic>). The area is mainly known for hosting a free-ranging population of approximately 500 bison. In terms of wildlife management, the forestry department applies supplementary feeding in winter and culling of bison outside the park.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Sample collection</title><p id="P8">Sampling of red deer and bison scats was done in June 2019. 10 fresh scat samples were collected per area and species, adding up to a total of 100 samples, 50 for each species.

Herbiscapes were defined using camera traps, remote-sensing technologies, human activity patterns and on-the-ground surveys. They were selected because of the high presence of red deer and bison in each of them and included two areas inside the National park and three in the managed part. These areas vary in terms of predation risk (predator encounter rate by ungulates) and habitat quality (proportion of deciduousness in the forest and altitude). Predation risk was inferred based on the landscape use of wolf and lynx (using camera traps) and habitat quality was defined based on forest composition, resource availability and its palatability. For both, the GPS locations of the scat samples were considered to associate the predation risk and habitat quality categories to each sampled area (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; for a full description, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bubnicki et al. 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>DNA extraction</title><p id="P10">We used between 0.5 and 1 g of dry scat material as the starting point for the extraction.

They have clear seasonal patterns with more woody vegetation in their diet during autumn-winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kowalczyk et al. 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Among-individual diet variation</title><p id="P24">Overlap in the diet composition between individuals and the average within species provides a straightforward method to assess the intraspecific variation in diet and thus can inform on the dietary plasticity of a species in their environment. Mean diet diversity was higher for red deer than for bison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), i.e. red deer have higher diet variation within species than bison, in line with the NMDS (non-metrical dimensional scaling, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), where greater dispersion of individuals means greater dissimilarity across their diets. In terms of their feeding strategy, we consider that the lower mean diet diversity of bison aligns to grazers because the species is less selective than typical browsers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hofmann 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bocherens et al. 2015</xref>). However, we did not detect a clear signal of meadow plant species when comparing the two species (we did not observe any clear differences in graminoid proportion between the diet of both species, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Red deer browse forest gaps with high regeneration growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Churski et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kuijper et al. 2009</xref>), which are heterogeneously spread in an old forest like the Bialowieza forest. This implies covering more distance than grazers giving them access to a greater variety of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hofmann 1989</xref>). Taking in account the differences between sampled areas, this result points to a greater pool of preferred plant species for red deer compared to bison, which could explain the mean diet diversity results.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Niche overlap</title><sec id="S19"><title>Intraspecific and interspecific interactions</title><p id="P25">We observed bison to have the highest niche overlap within species, regardless of the sampled areas. Red deer niche overlap within species was clearly lower than bison and aligned to the interspecific niche overlap. The three areas outside the National park (2,4,5) show the highest niche overlap between species, i.e. most overlapping diet composition between bison and red deer. This could be related to behavioural differences between the two herbivores. However, we cannot rule out differences in habitat composition outside the reserve, exploited for timber, which might offer a lower variety of plant species for the two species.</p><p id="P26">We associate the overall high niche overlaps within both species, particularly for bison, to the availability of food plants in the area. In fact, the abundance and diversity of resources available in spring probably exceeds the food requirements of the bison and red deer community in all the sampled areas and complicates the distinction between selectivity and competition. Niche overlap is likely to align closer to competition during periods of limiting resources (winter). Thus, extending the experimental setup presented in this study to a year-round survey could reveal the seasonal dynamics between niche overlap and competition.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Niche overlap and habitat quality</title><p id="P27">In terms of habitat quality, high quality areas show greater niche overlap within bison but not within red deer and between species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Both estimates of the model were positive, which suggests the differences in habitat quality does not affect the niche overlap within bison. This could be explained by the higher availability of their preferred plant species for bison in high quality areas, and contradicts our first hypothesis, which stated higher interspecies niche overlap would occur at low predation risk and high habitat quality, with both species selecting high nutrient plant species. Interestingly, red deer estimates diverged compared to bison, as the model indicates low habitat quality increases the predicted niche overlap within species, contrary to high habitat quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). The higher diversity in diet composition of red deer comes into play to explain this pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). More likely, the browsing behaviour of red deer provides a fine-scale choice of plant species. Our data indicate red deer have more similar diet choices in lower quality areas. We detected a significant effect of low habitat quality to increase niche overlap, i.e., red deer has its niche overlap increased in low quality areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>). This could be due to red deer selecting for the same (and more palatable) plants, thus increasing their niche overlap. However, the plant composition of the environment or the competition between individuals could be also playing a role. Between species, the model shows the same pattern as within red deer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>). This suggests more diet convergence in low quality areas compared to high quality areas, where the greater plant diversity allows for both species to be more selective. We suggest that in high quality areas the greater diversity of plant species translates into lower predicted niche overlap between both species, as they feed on their preferred plant species. Moreover, the similarities between bison-red deer and red deer-red deer niche overlap confirms the facultative browsing nature of bison. Despite the many meadows surrounding the forest, our data suggest that bison spend most of their feeding time browsing within the forest, rather than grazing on the open meadows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kowalczyk et al. 2011</xref>). Grazing bison would reveal as a low niche overlap with red deer, which is not the case and aligns to our second hypothesis, i.e., bison have higher within species niche overlap due to their feeding behaviour. This could be confirmed by crossing our results with GPS data monitoring bison habitat use and test if niche overlap within bison correlates with the proportion of time spent on meadows. Our results show higher niche overlap variability within than between species, but they are not conclusive enough to answer if interspecific interaction can be used by management authorities as a fine-scale tool to measure the role of the environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Niche overlap and predation risk</title><p id="P28">We observed a complex relation with predation risk imposed by wolf and lynx on the two herbivores in terms of niche overlap, as firstly investigated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Churski et al. 2021</xref>. Our study covers more areas and more variables interplaying along the landscape, but measuring accurately these indirect effects using dietary data remains a challenge (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Suraci et al. 2022</xref> for an overview on the advances in measuring predator-prey interactions). Between species, we detected a negative effect of predation risk on the diet overlap in high risk areas and positive in low risk areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). This trend was more pronounced when comparing diet overlap between species than within species. However, the three types of species interaction converged in similar predicted niche overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), contrary to our second hypothesis, and illustrates the complex interplay of factors in the studied system. If both species were influenced by predation risk, we would have observed niche overlap increasing together with predation risk, which is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Such confounding results could be explained by the disparity in predation risk perception between red deer and bison, which modify the diet choice of red deer but does not affect the diet choice of bison, resulting in opposite estimates in the model but not in the predicted niche overlap.</p><p id="P29">Within bison, the higher niche overlap was kept across predation risk levels. The positive estimates detected for all predation risk levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>) is likely to be an artefact of the dietary choices, i.e. match between diet preference and plant availability, rather than a consequence of predation risk since bison is rarely predated. Their diet choice is only driven by selectivity and availability, and we can use them as a reference diet to assess the role of predation risk on red deer.</p><p id="P30">Red deer are highly predated by wolves and we hypothesized higher predation risk would result in lower within species niche overlap. In line with our third hypothesis, we found red deer had lower niche overlap within species with increasing predation risk, in contrast to bison, which is rarely predated, and supports our model results. The negative estimate for high risk and positive for low risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>) indicates predation risk is an active factor driving red deer feeding strategy. We suggest these results respond to red deer reducing their selectivity and thus have a broader diet composition, leading to more dissimilar diets. The niche overlap in this species can be thus used as a tool to infer predation risk in the sampled area but also to estimate the abundance of predators, or at least the perception of predator abundance by red deer. We advocate this approach has great potential to be used in wildlife management for areas where predator estimates are not known or hard to quantify.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P31">This study shows eDNA dietary metabarcoding can be used to study herbivores’ diet variation over the landscape and how diet is affected by environmental factors and interaction with other herbivore species. The integration of this technique in ecology studies will provide a new pathway to answer complex ecological questions. Moreover, this approach yields great potential to serve as a complementary tool for wildlife monitoring and species assessment in natural environments. Through diet composition, it can bring useful information for conservation purposes on herbivores’ habitat use and feeding interactions. However, it requires an exhaustive characterization of the landscape so the diet composition of the study species can be used as a proxy to monitor the habitat use of species in their environment. We advocate future studies to explore this direction, but more comparative studies should be designed to assess the pros and cons of combining landscape ecology and dietary metabarcoding before drawing conservation and management policies using this methodology.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S23"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This project was supported by a Swiss National Science Foundation grant to LF (nr. 310030_192512).
