In the model organism <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a number of methods to control gene expression are widely practiced, including induction by metabolites, small molecules, and even light. However, all current methods suffer from at least one of a set of drawbacks, including need for specialized growth conditions, leaky expression, or the requirement of specialized equipment. Here we describe protocols using two transformations to construct strains that carry a new controller, in which all these drawbacks are overcome. In these strains, the expression of a controlled gene (gene of interest, or GOI) is repressed by the bacterial repressor TetR, and induced by anhydrotetracycline. TetR also regulates its own expression, creating an autorepression loop. This autorepression allows tight control of gene expression/ protein dosage with low cell to cell variation in expression. A second repressor, TetR-Tup1, prevents any leaky expression. We also present a protocol showing a particular workhorse application of such strains, to generate synchronized cell populations. We turn off the expression of the cell cycle regulator <italic>CDC20</italic> completely, arresting the cell population, and then back on so that the synchronized cells resume cell cycle progression. This control system can be applied to any endogenous or exogenous gene for precise expression.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Basic Protocol 1</title><p id="P2">Generating a parent WTC<sub>846</sub> strain.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Basic Protocol 2</title><p id="P3">Generating a WTC<sub>846</sub> strain with controlled expression of the targeted gene</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Alternate Protocol 1</title><p id="P4">CRISPR-mediated promoter replacement</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Basic Protocol 3</title><p id="P5">Cell cycle synchronization/Arrest and Release using the WTC<sub>846-K3</sub>::CDC20 strain</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S5" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P6">The conditional control of gene expression is a fundamental tool in biological research. It grants the researcher the ability to bring about the presence or absence of a gene product, or to tune its level of expression. Observing the resulting phenotypes frequently allows elucidation of biological function. The primary means used to effect conditional gene expression in eukaryotic cells like <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> are the use of promoters induced by chemical compounds, metabolites or other small molecules. These methods have have now been complemented by light-induced approaches. Transcription from chemically induced promoters depends on by native activator proteins (e.g. Gal4) or human-made activators (e.g. β-estradiol induced LexA-hER-B112) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Maya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Ottoz et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Taslimi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). However these methods for conditional expression typically suffer from a number of drawbacks, including leaky expression (basal expression) in the absence of induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bellí et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Garí et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Ottoz et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Taslimi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Xu et al., 2018</xref>), a reduction in cell doubling time caused by the activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gill &amp; Ptashne, 1988</xref>), off-target induction of other genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">McIsaac et al., 2014a</xref>), and high levels of cell-to-cell variation of gene expression in isogenic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Elison et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Meurer et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Ottoz et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). These limitations are particularly apparent when the research involves genes that are weakly expressed, assay of a null phenotype, or precise control of protein dosage to generate a well-behaved population to study phenotypes.</p><p id="P7">In previous work, we identified five desirable attributes for any conditional gene expression method for use in yeast, which, if made to be present together, would represent a marked improvement over previous approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azizoğlu et al., 2021</xref>). These were (1) the ability to function in all commonly used <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> growth media, (2) induction by an “orthogonal” small molecule that did not affect yeast cells, (3) lack of uninduced, basal expression (to allow generation of null phenotypes), (4) ability to generate a large range of precisely adjustable expression levels, and (5) have very high maximum expression to allow generation of overexpression phenotypes. To build this system, we modified an endogenous <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> promoter to be repressed by the bacterial protein TetR, improved the repression efficiency by fusing TetR to an endogenous yeast repressor, and incorporated an autorepression loop in our system to reduce cell-to-cell variation. We recently described and characterized the resulting system in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azizoğlu et al., 2021</xref>). We termed the collection of genetic elements that comprise this system a “well-tempered” controller, and named it WTC<sub>846</sub>, after Bach’s first Prelude and Fugue (C Major, BMV846) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The controller, WTC<sub>846</sub> controls gene expression through two repressors, TetR and TetR-Tup1, which act on an artificial, TetR-repressed promoter, P<sub>7tet.1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Derepression is achieved by addition of a tetracycline analog, anhydrotetracycline (aTc), to the medium. In WTC<sub>846</sub> strains, P7tet.1 drives expression of a controlled gene (Gene of Interest or GOI), and a second instance of P<sub>7tet.1</sub> controls expression of TetR itself. The consequence is that, at a given level of inducer, TetR and the controlled gene are expressed in synchrony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This autorepression (AR) loop results in low cell-to-cell variation in expression of TetR and the controlled gene. However, the fact that controlled gene and TetR are both driven by instances of the same TetR-repressed promoter creates a problem, namely, that the controlled gene cannot be fully repressed. Therefore, WTC<sub>846</sub> employs a second repressor that binds the same regulatory sites. This repressor, TetR-Tup1, is expressed constitutively outside of the AR loop, and so can fully repress P<sub>7tet.1</sub>. The strong repression afforded by TetR-Tup1 is likely due to the fact that the yeast Tup1 protein functions as powerful transcriptional repressor in yeast, operating by plural, reinforcing mechanisms of repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Mennella et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Zhang &amp; Reese, 2004</xref>). The use of the two repressors, TetR and TetR-Tup1, allows complete repression of the controlled gene, but with the consequence that within the expression range between zero and the aTc concentration at which the AR loop activates, repression depends on TetR-Tup1 and cell-to-cell variation is higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The system provides the researcher with an additional degree of control. WTC<sub>846</sub> strains be constructed with one of 3 different extended Kozak sequences (the last 15bp before the start codon) for expression of the controlled gene, which confer varying translation efficiencies on the transcript of the controlled gene. Even though the WTC<sub>846</sub> system has no detectable basal leakiness as assessed by flow cytometry or detectable by sensitive quantitative western blotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azizoğlu et al., 2021</xref>), certain genes that require only a few (&lt;1000) copies of their protein to function, and also have long half-lives, might still be expressed enough to function at a baseline level. In such cases, using a low efficiency extended Kozak sequence to lower the translation efficiency has proved helpful to eliminate any such residual activity. On the other hand, for proteins that are very highly expressed in the cell, or for overexpression studies, high efficiency Kozak sequences can be used.</p><p id="P10">Here, we present a detailed protocol to allow researchers to construct strains in which WTC<sub>846</sub> controls expression of a target gene in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Basic Protocol 1 describes the transformation required to incorporate the assembly of repressor elements into the genome of any auxotrophic <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> starting strain. Basic Protocol 2 then explains how to replace the promoter of an endogenous target gene within the genome with the artificial promoter construct P<sub>7tet.1</sub> using an antibiotic marker, such that the repressor elements incorporated in Basic Protocol 1 control the expression of this gene. We also present Alternate Protocol 1, which takes more time to carry out but is a transformation protocol with a higher success rate. Specifically, this alternative uses a Cas9-mediated method to increase promoter replacement efficiency, and allows replacement of the native promoter with WTC<sub>846</sub> elements without introduction of an antibiotic resistance marker. Whether generated by Basic Protocol 2 or Alternate Protocol 1, expression of the targeted gene in any resulting WTC<sub>846</sub> strain can then be precisely adjusted with the small molecule anhydrotetracycline, over a range of expression from complete absence to very high expression and with low cell-to-cell variation. We then describe Basic Protocol 3 as an example use case, in which we describe in detail the use of WTC<sub>846</sub>-regulated expression of the <italic>CDC20</italic> cell cycle progression gene to synchronize yeast cells in culture.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Strategic Planning</title><sec id="S7"><title>Strain selection</title><p id="P11">The protocols described here have been tested with the widely used strains BY4741 and BY4742, which were derived from the progenitor strain S288C. S288C is a commonly used, non-flocculent yeast strain that is the ancestor of many strains used in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mortimer &amp; Johnston, 1986</xref>), and its genome was the first eukaryotic genome to be fully sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Goffeau et al., 1996</xref>). However, any <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> strain with at least one of the auxotrophic marker deletions Δleu2, Δhis3, Δlys2, Δmet15 or Δura3 can be used to perform the protocols described below. Users can obtain strains from ATCC (atcc.org) or EUROSCARF (euroscarf.de).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Determining Required Inducer Concentration</title><p id="P12">The end product of these protocols is a strain where the expression level of a the controlled gene (Gene of Interest, GOI) depends on the extracellular concentration of anhydrotetracycline (aTc) present in the medium. If the GOI encodes a protein native to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and essential for growth, it will likely need to be expressed at endogenous levels when creating and maintaining this strain. Here we describe how to determine and appropriate aTc concentration for endogenous GOI in both liquid and solid media.</p><p id="P13">In the final strain, the GOI expression is controlled by the promoter P<sub>7tet.1</sub>. This promoter is based on the endogenous P<sub>TDH3</sub> promoter of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and has a similar maximum expression level, as assessed by fluorescence in strains where the promoters are drive expression of the a mCitrine reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azizoğlu et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the maximum protein concentration reached by fully inducing WTC<sub>846</sub> with 600 ng/mL aTc is roughly equivalent to <italic>TDH3</italic> protein concentration inside the cell, which is measured to be around 2 million in rich media (YPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Ho et al., 2018</xref>). Assuming that the GOI is under similar post-transcriptional regulation (e.g. degradation) as <italic>TDH3</italic>, protein levels will be approximately around 2 million molecules per cell at maximum induction of P<sub>7tet.1</sub> in rich medium.</p><p id="P14">However, the actual expression level of the GOI will depend also on any potential translational and post-translational regulation that might exist. For example, if the degradation rate of the controlled protein is much faster than the approximately 12h half-life measured for <italic>TDH3</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Christiano et al., 2014</xref>), the final controlled protein expression level is likely to be lower than 2 million molecules per cell at full induction.</p><p id="P15">Therefore, we suggest consulting the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database (SGD) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.yeastgenome.org/">www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>), where the endogenous expression levels and half-life information of many proteins are available under different media conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cherry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hellerstedt et al., 2017</xref>). Based on this information, an approximation can be made as to what percentage of maximal P<sub>7tet.1</sub> induction is required to maintain endogenous levels of the GOI. Then, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> in conjunction with <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> can be used to estimate the required aTc concentration in liquid YPD media and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> for solid YPD and synthetic media to achieve this activation level. In general, synthetic media-based conditions require less aTc than rich media conditions to reach the same expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azizoğlu et al., 2021</xref>) It is therefore recommended to apply a 5-10 fold reduction in aTc concentrations in synthetic liquid media compared to rich liquid media.</p><p id="P16">For example, if a protein has reported expression levels are around 200000 molecules per cell in rich media, this would be around 10% of <italic>TDH3</italic> levels. Based on fluorescence data shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, this would correspond to an aTc dose of 12 ng/mL in liquid rich media, and around 1 to 2.5 ng/mL in liquid synthetic media. Based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, solid rich media concentration would correspond to around 100ng/mL, whereas synthetic solid media concentration would be around half at 50ng/mL.</p><p id="P17">Most endogenous genes tested in our hands tolerated slight changes in their concentration well, therefore not necessitating a more precise estimation of aTc concentrations that would yield exact endogenous expression levels. Nevertheless, since the calculated aTc concentration will be an approximation, we recommend testing a range of concentrations from half the calculated amount to double the calculated amount. In cases where increased or decreased expression of the GOI results in an observable phenotype (e.g. changes in growth rate), this can be checked to determine the ideal concentration. Additionally, low expression levels measured by fluorescence is always obscured by autofluorescence, and therefore <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> cannot be used to estimate concentrations of very low expressed genes with the calculation method explained above. This applies to genes that are endogenously expressed at a level less than around 0.2% of <italic>TDH3</italic> levels. For such genes, we recommend testing 3 or 4 aTc concentrations ranging from 1-10 ng/mL for rich liquid media.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Basic Protocol 1</title><sec id="S10"><title>Generating a parent WTC<sub>846</sub> strain</title><p id="P18">This multi-day protocol explains how to create a strain in which a single copy of the assembled repressor elements of the WTC<sub>846</sub> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azizoğlu et al., 2021</xref>) is incorporated into the genome. Here, the user will decide on the auxotrophic marker to use, select the appropriate plasmid and order it from Addgene ahead of time. Plasmid preparation takes 3 days after it arrives. This protocol also requires yeast strain preparation steps three days in advance (Day -2) and one day in advance (Day 0) before the transformation can be performed. On the day the protocol is executed (Day 1), the chosen plasmid is transformed into the desired <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> starting strain background using an optimized LiAc-based transformation method. On Day 3, the colonies that appear are screened for correct integration using colony PCR.

While it takes 3 days longer than Basic Protocol 2, making this break enhances the efficiency of correct homology repair-directed integrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) and the number of recovered correctly integrated transformants. With this approach, the investigator can also decide to generate “markerless” strains that do not include an antibiotic-resistance marker. The protocol involves designing single guide oligos for targeting the Cas9 enzyme to the desired cut site and carrying out a transformation to assemble the CRISPR-Cas9 expression plasmid inside the yeast cell. This first step creates a strain we call the CRISPR Mid Strain, which is capable of cutting the genomic DNA at the targeted site but does not have the repair template. A second transformation introduces a PCR product as a repair template such that the double-stranded cut generated by Cas9 can be repaired through homology repair.</p><p id="P190">Additionally, this protocol is necessary for the construction of strains in which two or more genes are to be brought under the control of WTC<sub>846</sub>. Such constructions require serial transformations to replace different promoters with P<sub>7tet.1</sub>.

This capability has allowed elucidation of links between genotype and phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Richardson et al., 1989</xref>), gene function in temporally ordered processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hereford &amp; Hartwell, 1974</xref>), and manipulation of cell and organismic physiology to aid scientific discovery of development of therapeutics or biotechnological products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Sochor et al., 2015</xref>). These discoveries were made with gene deletions or temperature sensitive mutations, which eliminate or impair protein function. Such methods, however, cannot provide dosage control and mostly allow merely qualitative observations based on complete absence of the protein product or function. Over time, natural <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> promoters induced, for example, by sugars (Gal) or metabolites were used to more precisely vary gene dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Maya et al., 2008</xref>). More recent control schemes have included chimeric transcription factors that carry bacterial DNA binding moieties and eukaryotic transcriptional activators to induce expression of targeted genes by small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bellí et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">McIsaac et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Ottoz et al., 2014a</xref>). More recently, optogenetic systems have been implemented to control gene expression in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Figueroa et al., 2021</xref>). These systems typically involve two proteins that dimerize when stimulated by light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Salinas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). One of these partners is fused to a DNA binding domain, and the other is fused to an activation domain. Therefore, upon dimerization, they can bind a promoter with a dedicated binding site and induce transcription. Whilst these natural and artificial transcriptional controllers are widely utilized, they suffer from various drawbacks, such as persistent basal leakiness, cell-toxicity, low maximum expression capacity, high cell-to-cell variation in expression or specific media dependencies. WTC<sub>846</sub> was developed to address these drawbacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azizoğlu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P316">WTC<sub>846</sub> uses a bipartite architecture with two separate repressors to control expression of the target gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). TetR fused to Tup1 represses expression of the target gene completely, especially when used in conjunction with a low translation efficiency extended Kozak sequence. This repressor is constitutively expressed, and it is known that constitutively expressed transcription factors lead to high cell-to-cell variation upon induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Elison et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Meurer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Ottoz et al., 2014</xref>). In order to reduce this variation, we use a second repressor, TetR, which also represses itself to create an Autorepression (AR) loop. We call this architecture, which combines a constitutively expressed and a negatively autoregulated repressor, Complex AutoRepression (cAR)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azizoğlu et al., 2021</xref>). While the constitutive repressor abolishes basal leakiness of the system, the AR loop suppresses cell-to-cell variation compared to most other controllers, which use only constitutively expressed repressors/activators, and therefore exhibit high cell-to-cell variation in expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bellí et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">McIsaac et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Ottoz et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Salinas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P317">Compared to existing controllers of gene expression such as the galactose inducible system, LexA-activation domain fusions or optogenetic systems, WTC<sub>846</sub> has a number of advantages. It can be turned off completely in the absence of anhydrotetracycline and can, thus, generate reversible knockout phenotypes. At full induction, expression level rivals that of the highest expressed proteins in the yeast proteome, therefore enabling overexpression studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azizoğlu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Swaffer, Marinov, et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, WTC<sub>846</sub> works in many different growth media conditions without any observable burden on growth. Finally, expression is “clamped” by the autorepression loop, so is uniform throughout the cell population. In other words, population mean is representative of single cell behavior. While there are controllers that do fulfill one or more of these criteria, WTC<sub>846</sub> is unique in achieving all of them.</p><p id="P318">The protocols described here explain how to generate strains in which WTC<sub>846</sub> regulates the expression level of the target genes, and provide a useful example of such control, namely, to turn off and then turn on expression of a targeted cell cycle regulatory gene, <italic>CDC20,</italic> in order to synchronize the culture. Such cycle synchronization is helpful when studying gene expression or other cell functions in different cell cycle phases. The better synchronized a batch culture is, the more enriched it will be for cells in the relevant cell cycle stage. This then makes it easier to get reliable readouts of, for example, cell-cycle dependent protein phosphorylation levels or protein-protein interaction information from batch cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ewald et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P319">Furthermore, we described an optimized LiAc-based transformation protocol (Basic Protocol 1) and an alternative CRISPR-Cas9 based transformation protocol (Alternative Protocol 1) for incorporating elements of the system into the genome. The transformation methods in these protocols were extensively optimized to result in high transformation efficiencies.</p><p id="P320">Depending on the controlled gene, the WTC<sub>846</sub> system can be used to control diverse aspects of cell function, from metabolic reactions to properties like cell size and growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azizoğlu et al., 2021</xref>). The precision with which protein dosage can be controlled is likely to reveal and allow manipulation of dosage dependent phenotypes. For example, the system has been used recently to express the cell size control protein Whi5, where the authors required cell-cycle independent expression of Whi5 whilst keeping the set-point and population variance of cell size same as a wild type population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Swaffer, Kim, et al., 2021</xref>). This was only possible due to the low cell-to-cell variation in expression of WTC<sub>846</sub> strains. Another use of the system has been to place multiple genes under identical regulation. This was achieved in a recent study, where the authors placed all 12 subunits of the RNA polymerase II under the control of WTC<sub>846</sub> for overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Swaffer, Marinov, et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, genome-wide or large-scale collections of WTC<sub>846</sub> are likely to prove valuable when investigating dosage dependent epistasis interactions between genes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Costanzo et al., 2016a</xref>). Additionally, current arrest and release methods use either chemicals, temperature shifts, or inducible systems that cannot be fully shut down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Costanzo et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ewald et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, when controlling cell cycle genes to synchronize or regulate cell cycle state, WTC<sub>846</sub> represents a better, more penetrant and less physiologically perturbing alternative to current arrest and release methods.</p></sec><sec id="S51"><title>Critical Parameters</title><sec id="S52"><title>Achieving high transformation efficiency</title><p id="P321">The two main factors that will affect the success of all transformation protocols described here are the quality of the cell culture and the quality of the DNA to be used in the transformations. Cells should always be in exponential phase during transformation, having been cultured in fresh rich media for at least 3 hours or 2 cell divisions prior to beginning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Ito et al., 1983</xref>). Performing the protocol with too few (&lt;10 million/mL) or too many (&gt;30 million/mL) cells is likely to reduce the number of correct transformants. In our hands, plasmid or PCR product DNA that was recently prepared and resuspended in double distilled water gave the best results. Increasing the amount of DNA used for transformation can increase the number of correct transformants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Ito et al., 1983</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S53"><title>Achieving high efficiency with the CRISPR-based transformation</title><p id="P322">All points discussed above also apply to CRISPR-based transformations within Alternative Protocol 1. Additionally, the choice of cut site (defined in Alternative Protocol Step 4) has been reported by users to influence efficiency. There are two homologous regions between the repair template and the genome, designed in Alternative Protocol Step 1 or 2. For maximum efficiency, the cut site should be as close as possible to one of these homologies if possible (i.e. at most 20-30 bp distance between the cut site and the start of the homology region).</p><p id="P323">It is crucial to see a distinct growth rate difference between +/− β-estradiol conditions during the spotting assay before continuing with the protocol.

This is especially important for essential genes, since an increase or a decrease in their protein levels can alter growth rates as well as have other side effects. These could range from DNA damage to cell cycle arrest depending on the function of the controlled gene. See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Strategic section</xref> on how to estimate the correct aTc concentration for different controlled genes. It is important to note that on solid culture, the required inducer concentration is higher, likely due to slow diffusion of aTc into the growing colony and depletion of aTc from the immediately adjacent solid medium. For most endogenous genes, information on endogenous expression levels is available from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.yeastgenome.org/">www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="S55"><title>Non-steady state use of WTC<sub>846</sub> to shut off and induce gene expression</title><p id="P325">Induction of gene expression with anhydrotetracycline starts within 30 minutes, and depending on the degradation rate of the protein product, reaches steady state within, at most, around 7 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). Time to reach steady state depends on the protein; the more stable the protein, the more time after induction it will take to reach steady state expression level.</p><p id="P326">Shutoff of targeted gene expression requires complete removal of the inducer from the media, after which transcription of the gene will cease almost immediately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11</xref>). Regardless of whether the cells come from liquid or solid medium, careful wash steps should be performed with liquid medium without inducer. If the starting inducer concentration was high, the concentration of the targeted protein in the cells will also be high. Therefore, especially if the protein product has a low degradation rate, it may be necessary to dilute the cells into fresh medium without inducer and continue growing them until the cellular level of the starting protein drops to zero. In this case, collect, wash, and dilute a portion of the culture into fresh medium without inducer. Given that time to zero will depend on the initial inducer concentration, stability of the protein product and the thoroughness of the wash steps, a successful shutoff experiment will require trials to establish a robust protocol for each different gene being controlled.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S56"><title>Troubleshooting</title><p id="P327">See <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for a list of common problems with the protocols, their causes, and potential solutions.</p></sec><sec id="S57"><title>Understanding Results</title><p id="P328">We provide data collected using a <italic>WTC<sub>846</sub>::Citrine</italic> strain as examples of a typical liquid culture dose response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), solid media dose response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), and liquid media induction and shutoff kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11</xref>) of the WTC<sub>846</sub> system. Here, to guide use of newly constructed strains, we discuss how to extrapolate from the behavior of the well-studied <italic>WTC<sub>846</sub>::Citrine</italic> to predicting how different WTC<sub>846</sub> strains might behave regarding dose response, and induction and shutoff kinetics, and how the behavior of the strains will vary depending on the media, temperature, and other variables.</p><sec id="S58"><title>Dose response</title><p id="P329">In WTC<sub>846</sub>, the targeted gene is controlled by the promoter P<sub>7tet.1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This promoter is based on the endogenous P<sub>TDH3</sub> promoter of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and has a similar maximum expression level as assessed by fluorescence of strains where both promoters were driving Citrine expression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azizoğlu et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the maximum protein concentration reached by fully inducing WTC<sub>846</sub> with 600 ng/mL aTc is roughly equivalent to <italic>TDH3</italic> protein concentration inside the cell. Since the median TDH3 molecules per cell is estimated to be around 2 million in YPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Ho et al., 2018</xref>), appropriate aTc concentrations for desired expression levels of other genes can be calculated, provided their median expression level is known and the degradation kinetics between TDH3 and that protein are similar. This information is available for most genes on the Saccharomyces Genome Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.yeastgenome.org/">www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cherry et al., 2012</xref>).

For a stable protein like Citrine, reaching steady state takes around 6 to 7 hours. Time to steady state will, however, depend on two factors: stability of the GOI and the growth rate in the specific media used for the experiment. The higher the stability of the GOI protein product (i.e. the lower the degradation rate), the longer it will take to reach steady state. Similarly, since a slower growth rate reduces the dilution rate of the protein, the slower the growth rate, the longer it will take to reach steady state.</p><p id="P331">In terms of shutoff, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11</xref> demonstrates that transcription of the GOI ceases almost immediately, yet complete depletion of protein takes a long time. This is also apparent in the arrest and release assay depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>. In the case of Citrine, protein degradation is negligible, and fluorescence is diluted only with cell division. Additionally, the higher the starting Citrine concentration, the longer the shutoff takes. Therefore, shutoff kinetics when using WTC<sub>846</sub> with any controlled gene will depend on the degradation kinetics of the specific protein product and the initial starting concentration of the protein. Furthermore, the specific media conditions and temperature of incubation will affect the growth rate, therefore affecting shutoff kinetics. The slower the growth rate, the longer it will take to dilute all existing protein through cell division and to reach shutoff.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S60"><title>Considerations</title><p id="P332">Basic Protocol 1 and 2 both take 3 days, with a total of 1-2 hours of bench time.

Both TetR and TetR-Tup1 repress P<sub>7tet.1</sub>. However, only TetR and the Gene of Interest (GOI) are expressed from P<sub>7tet.1</sub> and are subject to this repression. This creates an Autorepression loop, where TetR represses its own expression. The P<sub>7tet</sub>.<sub>1</sub> controlled gene and TetR are both expressed from instances of the same promoter and are, thus, in synchrony. TetR-Tup1 is not subject to Autorepression, since it is constitutively expressed from the RNR2 promoter. The three different Kozak sequences (last 15bp before the start codon) lead to different translation efficiencies and can be used to further fine tune the expression levels of the controlled gene. <bold>B) Effect of aTc concentration on the expression of different elements of WTC<sub>846</sub>.</bold> The left panel shows the protein concentrations inside the cell as aTc concentration increases. The higher the aTc concentration, the higher the levels of the autorepressed TetR and the protein encoded by the controlled gene (GOI). Their concentrations increase synchronously, since they are expressed by two instances of the same promoter, P<sub>7tet</sub>.<sub>1</sub>. TetR-Tup1 is expressed constitutively; its concentration inside the cell is independent of aTc concentration. The right panel shows the contribution of each repressor to repression of P7<sub>tet</sub>.<sub>1</sub>. At low aTc concentrations, TetR-Tup1 concentration is higher than TetR concentration. Therefore, TetR-Tup1 contributes more than TetR to repression of P<sub>7tet</sub>.<sub>1</sub>. This is the Simple Repression regime of the dose response curve depicted above the plot. As aTc concentration increases, TetR contributes more and more to repression of P<sub>7tet</sub> compared to TetR-Tup1, even as total repression of P<sub>7tet.1</sub> overall is decreasing. This is the Autorepression regime of the dose response curve. <bold>C) Effect of aTc concentration on cell-to-cell variation in a strain where WTC<sub>846</sub> controls Citrine expression</bold>. The y axis indicates the variation in Citrine expression within a population measured by flow cytometry, after correcting for differences in cell size by fitting a linear model to the relationship between size and fluorescence as measured by flow cytometry (See (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azizoğlu et al., 2021</xref>) for a detailed explanation of cell-to-cell variation calculations). Variation peaks at low aTc concentrations when the Simple Repression architecture dominates. At higher concentrations of aTc, the Autorepression loop is active and suppresses this variation. The dashed line indicates the cell-to-cell variation of a strain where there is no Citrine expression. The dot-dash line indicates the variation in a strain where Citrine is expressed from the endogenous TDH3 promoter, and represents normal levels of variation in the wild type population.

Transformation 1 involves linearizing the CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid and co-transforming it together with a double stranded sgRNA oligo. These assemble inside the cell to generate the CRISPR Mid Strain. This strain is capable of generating a double stranded break at the target genomic locus upon induction of Cas9 expression by β-estradiol but cannot repair it, as it does not possess the correct repair template. The second transformation is performed on this strain to introduce the repair template. Cas9 expression is induced using 10μM β-estradiol. Cas9 then complexes with the constitutively expressed sgRNA to target a region within the GOI promoter. This creates a double stranded break in the DNA. The cell is simultaneously transformed with a PCR product that contains the P<sub>7tet.1</sub> promoter and homology arms to the region where the double stranded break was generated. The result is a strain where WTC<sub>846</sub> controls the expression of the GOI.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS158369-f007"/></fig><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>An example of a successful spotting assay after CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid assembly.</title><p>A CRISPR Mid strain was generated as described in Alternate Protocol 1 and depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>.

Citrine fluorescence was measured with flow cytometry (488nm excitation, 530/30nm emission). Circles represent the median of the population and the error bars indicated 95% confidence interval.
