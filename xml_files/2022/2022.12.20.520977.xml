Pathogenic mutations cause a disruption in epithelial bicarbonate and chloride secretion and hyperabsorption of sodium, leading to an osmotic imbalance that results in thick and sticky mucus build-up in the lungs, which is characteristic of cystic fibrosis (CF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Within the airways, the nutritionally rich environment traps bacteria and promotes their growth, while clearance via the ciliary escalator is impaired. Infection contributes to the continuous inflammation of the airways and leads to the gradual destruction of lung tissue. As lung infection shapes the clinical outcome of individuals and is the leading cause of mortality in people with CF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), it is an area of intense medical research.</p><p id="P9">Two of the most prevalent bacterial species in CF pulmonary infections are <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Paediatric CF patients are often colonised with <italic>S. aureus</italic> from an early age (&lt;1 year old). To prevent this, in the UK, CF patients are prescribed prophylactic flucloxacillin from birth or point of diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). As patients reach adulthood, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> typically overtakes <italic>S. aureus</italic> and becomes the dominant species in the lungs. However, both species are co-isolated from one third of UK adults with CF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Some studies suggest that coinfection with both species correlates with severe lung function decline and worsened patient clinical outcomes compared to patients that are monoinfected by either pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). However, it has also been found that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection results in poor patient outcome independent of the presence of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Most evidence suggests <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections in CF tend to be a marker of milder disease compared to patients infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, particularly in adults, with these patients exhibiting higher lung function, and fewer exacerbation periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). By contrast, other work has shown that <italic>S. aureus</italic> has persistence capabilities similar to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and patients with high <italic>S. aureus</italic> density in throat cultures exhibit rapid lung function decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). To date, no consensus has been reached in the literature regarding the significance of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the presence or absence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and recent reviews highlight the need to investigate clinical isolates further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Much of the previous work has helped to define the mechanisms that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> employs to chronically infect the CF lung, including loss of motility, a lack of a functional type III secretion system, and conversion to mucoid colony phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). A growing number of studies have also started to elucidate how <italic>S. aureus</italic> adapts to long-term colonisation of the CF lung. These include mutations in metabolic genes, resulting in persistent small colony variants (SCVs) and in regulatory genes, such as accessory gene regulator (<italic>agr</italic>) mutants, which present an inactive quorum-sensing <italic>agr</italic> system, and therefore reduced expression of virulence factors including haemolysins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Increased extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production facilitates the biofilm mode of growth that also contributes to persistence and antibiotic recalcitrance in the lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Furthermore, bacteriophages become mobilised with a higher frequency in infections, raising the incidence of mobile genetic elements, which include known toxins and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p><p id="P11">It is generally accepted that CF lung infection is polymicrobial, and an understanding of lung microbiome composition and interspecies interactions is critical to understand disease progression. Although historically CF pathogens have been studied in isolation, research has shown that competitive and cooperative interactions between <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can alter survival and persistence in the CF lung for example through increased antimicrobial resistance profiles and improved immune system evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Further work is required to understand the molecular basis for cooperative and competitive interactions in the CF lung and how these influence pathogeneses.</p><p id="P12">In this study we collected and characterised 25 clinical <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates from 21 chronically infected adult CF patients from the Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI, Newcastle-upon-Tyne), including determining fully assembled genome sequences. The <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates belonged to two groups, (i) from patients that had never cultured <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> since their first visit to the clinic (monoinfected patients, n=10) and (ii) from patients that had also previously isolated <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (coinfected patients, n=11). Isolates were selected from these two categories with the aim of identifying whether there were genomic signatures associated with <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates from the two different infection groups. Interestingly, we noted different <italic>S. aureus</italic> phenotypic behaviour from isolates within the same patient, despite genome analysis indicating they are the same strain, showcasing the heterogeneity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> phenotypes within the same CF lung.

We estimated the pangenome to be made up of 4,315 orthologs, with a split of (i) core as 2,070 (47.9 %), (ii) accessory as 1,564 (36.2 %), and (iii) 681 singletons (15.8 %) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). From these genes, a total of 3,534 (81.9%) were identified and assigned cluster of orthologous groups (COG) category using the eggNOG-mapper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows the distribution of the COG categories within the core, accessory, and unique genomes.</p><p id="P31">After assignment of COG groups to the genes belonging to the core, accessory and unique genomes, the enrichment of COG families was investigated within the pangenome groups. As expected, the core genome was enriched for all COG families related to metabolism, as well as translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis, and transcription, many of which are essential genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, the unique genome was significantly enriched for the replication, recombination and repair, and defence mechanism COG families (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P32">The unique genes present in each clinical <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolate were then further examined. Many were found to be unique mobile genetic elements (MGEs). The genetic plasticity of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> genome is largely attributed to MGEs, which include prophages, plasmids, pathogenicity islands (SaPIs), staphylococcal cassette chromosome <italic>mec</italic> (SCCmec), and transposons. MGEs can disseminate between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mechanisms and are particularly concerning as they can alter virulence and resistance profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Evidence of phage integration was present across the genomes of all <italic>S. aureus</italic> clinical strains, although the phage-associated methicillin resistance gene <italic>mecA</italic>, the PVL toxin and the toxic-shock syndrome (TSS) toxin were not detected in any of the isolates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). The immune evasion genes <italic>scn</italic>, <italic>chp</italic>, and <italic>sak</italic> were present in 23 (92%), 17 (68%) and 16 (64%) isolates, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Further, the <italic>sea</italic> gene encoding for staphylococcal enterotoxin A, carried on an integrated prophage, was present in eight (32%) of the strains. There was no statistically significant difference in the presence/absence of these genes between mono- and co-infection strains. Unique prophage genes made up the greatest number of unique genes and were identified in 11 (44%) of strains, suggesting that phage integration is common.</p><p id="P34">Moreover, four of these strains (SA-2, SA-5, SA-6A, SA-6B) also contained unique SaPI genes, indicating that virulence factors are harboured on MGEs within the clinical strains. Of the 13 strains that did not contain unique phage genes, four (30%) contained unique copies of genes for Type I restriction-modification (TI-RM) enzymes (SA-13, SA-9, SA-10A, SA-10B). T-I RM systems are a known barrier to HGT as they prevent DNA uptake from different species and other <italic>S. aureus</italic> lineages, therefore it is possible they are restricting phage integration in those genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>).</p><p id="P35">The <italic>agr</italic> and <italic>spa</italic> type of each isolate was also characterised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Four types of the <italic>agr</italic> accessory gene regulator system have been described (I-IV), and studies have reported <italic>agr</italic> type influence parthenogenesis and may impact clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). The strains had a near equal split between <italic>agr</italic> type I (9, 36%) and type II (10, 40%), with a lower prevalence of type III strains (6, 25%) and none belonging to type IV, which is reportedly the rarest <italic>agr</italic> type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>).</p><p id="P36">The varying numbers and base sequence of tandem repeats determines the <italic>spa</italic> type in <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), which has been used to investigate <italic>S. aureus</italic> outbreaks. The isolates represented a wide range of <italic>spa</italic> types, and only isolates that were obtained from the same patient presented the same <italic>spa</italic> variant.</p><p id="P37">Average nucleotide identity calculations suggested that isolates collected from the same patients were likely the same strain (&gt; 99.9). The maximum identity between isolates collected from two different patients was 99.98% (SA-13 and SA-15) and the minimum identity between any two clinical isolates was 97.34%. None of the isolates were closely related enough based on average nucleotide identity, <italic>agr</italic>, and <italic>spa</italic> type to suggest cross infection between patients.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Haemolytic activity</title><p id="P38">Haemolysins are cytolytic toxins which are secreted by many <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains. They have been commonly recognised as essential virulence factors in murine CF infection models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>) and previous studies suggest strains downregulate expression of virulence factors during chronic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). We therefore sought to establish whether our chronic infection isolates retained the ability to lyse ovine red blood cells (RBC), and whether there were any differences in haemolytic activity between the mono- and coinfection strains.</p><p id="P39">Eighteen (72%) of the isolates tested showed cytolytic activity against the RBC and there was no observable difference in lysis patterns between the monoinfection and coinfection <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains. However, interestingly we noted that four isolates that had lost their ability to lyse RBC came from patients that provided two separate <italic>S. aureus</italic> samples (3A, 6B, 7B and 10A), whilst the other patient sample retained its haemolytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This is further evidence that multiple strains of the same species can exhibit different phenotypes within the same CF lung.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Extracellular polysaccharide production</title><p id="P40">Another phenotype associated with chronic <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection is increased extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production, which is an important constituent of biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). <italic>S. aureus</italic> produces one dominant EPS, chemically defined as poly-N-acetyl-β-(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>)-glucosamine (PNAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). PNAG is synthesised by proteins encoded at the intercellular adhesion (<italic>icaABCD</italic>) locus and its production is regulated by IcaR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). PNAG overproduction could result in an advantageous mucoid phenotype as studies have found that mucoidy can increase intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, improve host immune-evasion and increase survival under nutrient limited conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P41">To establish whether any of the clinical isolates displayed a mucoid phenotype, EPS production was assayed by growth on Congo red agar plates. Most isolates had retained their ability to produce EPS (73%), which was also seen in a study of <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates from chronically-infected CF individuals in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Only 14% of isolates presented the overproducer mucoid colony morphology and 59% displayed normal EPS production. Separated by group, a higher number (4, 26%) of the coinfection strains presented the mucoid phenotype vs only 1 (9%) of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> monoinfection strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), non-significant, using Fisher’s exact test (p=0.36).</p><p id="P42">Jefferson <italic>et al</italic>. identified a 5-nucleotide (TATTT) deletion in the <italic>icaR-icaA</italic> intergenic region that can induce over-expression of PNAG, and results in the mucoid phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). To establish whether the clinical isolates with a mucoid phenotype lacked this sequence, the DNA sequences in this region were queried. Two isolates which lacked the 5 bp nucleotide sequence exhibited the mucoid phenotype when tested (SA-10A, SA-10B). However, strains SA-6A and SA-8 did not present the deletion but exhibited a mucoid phenotype. Previous studies have suggested other unidentified mutations may also lead to this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Additionally, although SA-6B and SA-7A lacked the 5 bp sequence, they presented a non-mucoid phenotype, this could be due to compensatory mutations elsewhere in the genome as no other mutations were detected in their <italic>ica</italic> loci. It is also noteworthy that the 5 bp nucleotide deletion was only observed in coinfection isolates, although this is non-significant using Fisher’s exact test (p=0.11).</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Antimicrobial resistance</title><p id="P43">It is being increasingly recognised that polymicrobial infections contribute to increased drug resistance of individual species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Previous work has identified modified drug resistance profiles in co-existing <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains due to higher drug efflux pump activity and altered biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). Therefore, to determine whether <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains isolated from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> coinfection presented increased antibiotic resistance, the resistance phenotypes of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> only and <italic>S. aureus</italic>/<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> coinfection strains were assayed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and the results are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>.</p><p id="P44">From the antimicrobial susceptibility phenotypes, there was some evidence that the coinfection strains showed increased resistance profiles compared to the <italic>S. aureus</italic> only strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>), however this was non-significant (p=0.0562, X<sup>2</sup>=1.91,1). A significantly higher number of coinfection isolates (10, 71.4%) showed resistance to at least one type of macrolide, compared to only two monoinfection isolates (18.1%) using Fisher’s exact test, (p&lt;0.0154). Additionally, a higher percentage of coinfection strains showed resistance to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used with CF patients, compared to monoinfection strains (6, 42.8% vs 2, 18.1%), non-significant using Fisher’s exact test (p=0.2337). This is in line with previous studies showing that antibiotic pumps for ciprofloxacin are upregulated when <italic>S. aureus</italic> grows in coexistence with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). Six coinfection isolates exhibited induced clindamycin resistance; this was established using the D-test, no monoinfection isolates presented induced clindamycin resistance, non-significant using Fisher’s exact test (<italic>p</italic> = 0.1804). Only one isolate was resistant to tetracycline (SA-17) and two isolates (SA-20 and SA-21) were sensitive to all antibiotics.</p><p id="P45">To identify the genes responsible for the resistance profile of the clinical isolates, the whole genome sequences were analysed using resistance prediction software ResFinder and MYKROBE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Comparing these predictions with our experimental testing, the programmes accurately predicted resistance profiles of 11 strains (52%). However, for the remaining isolates, they were predicted to be sensitive to macrolides (erythromycin and clindamycin), but antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) showed they exhibited resistance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). It is likely that the resistance gene may be carried on a plasmid rather than within the genome, as <italic>ermC</italic>, has been commonly identified on plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>); plasmids were not selectively extracted in our study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S26" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P46">In this study we used a genotypic and phenotypic approach to characterise clinical <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates and identify shared traits and differences between <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates that coexist with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> vs <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains from patients who are <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> negative. When comparing phylogenetic relationships and genotypes between strains, we noted that isolates of the same sequence type clustered together, however this did not correlate with the presence/absence of known virulence factors including haemolysin production, <italic>sea</italic> enterotoxin, or immune evasion genes. Additionally, in our study isolates did not group together based on their mucoid phenotype, as also noted by Bernardy <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). However, isolates did largely cluster depending on whether they were isolated from mono- or coinfections. This data is also in accord with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), and hints at a possible genetic relationship between <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates according to infection type.</p><p id="P47">Toxins and virulence factors are important for <italic>S. aureus</italic> pathogenicity, and the proportion of <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains encoding known virulence and toxin genes was high within our set of samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Although previous reports have suggested that that <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates adapted to the CF lung show reduced expression of α-haemolysin, most clinical isolates in this study retained their ability to lyse RBC, and there was no correlation between haemolytic phenotype and infection group.</p><p id="P48">The ability to produce EPS is an important factor in <italic>S. aureus</italic> persistence in the CF lung as it aids biofilm formation, provides protection from the host immune system, and increases tolerance to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). Most isolates studied here were able to produce EPS when they were phenotypically characterised. However, the remainder were categorised as non-EPS producers and isolates that presented this phenotype belonged to both the mono- and coinfection groups. EPS is energetically costly to synthesise, and it is possible these isolates may instead take advantage of other EPS producers in the lung through formation of mixed-species biofilms. Although the EPS overproducer strains showed resistance to two or three different types of antibiotics, some of the non-producers were also multidrug resistant, therefore increased drug resistance profiles were not exclusively related to mucoidy.</p><p id="P49">Resistance to macrolides (erythromycin and clindamycin) was widespread among the strains with 12 (48%) strains showing resistance to this class of antibiotics, 9 of which belonged to the coinfection group (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0154). This is interesting because although macrolides are not commonly used to combat <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections in the UK, long-term low-dose use of azithromycin is becoming a standard therapy for its anti-inflammatory properties and as a prophylactic in patients with chronic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Widespread azithromycin use in the UK may be driving increasing levels of <italic>S. aureus</italic> macrolide resistance, particularly in coinfection isolates as this treatment is more common in patients chronically infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p><p id="P50">Previous studies have reported that 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, a quorum sensing signal produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, provides <italic>S. aureus</italic> with protection against vancomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). Additionally, transcriptome studies have shown <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> induces expression of <italic>S. aureus nor</italic> genes, which encode drug efflux pumps for tetracycline and fluoroquinolone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). However, no increased resistance against any of these antibiotics in coinfection isolates was observed, although it should be noted that Nor-dependent resistance may depend on close contact between the two organisms during testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>) which was not carried out in our study.</p><p id="P51">All strains from patients that provided more than one isolate exhibited differing haemolytic abilities, and some also showed differing EPS production and antibiotic resistance phenotypes indicative of population heterogeneity within the same patient. This has previously been identified in CF sputum samples and it has been proposed that a more diverse community has increased viability and improved stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>).</p><p id="P52">In conclusion, <italic>S. aureus</italic> treatment and prophylaxis are greatly debated amongst clinicians, leading to differing treatment approaches across the world. A more detailed analysis of the nature of <italic>S. aureus</italic> CF isolates from different countries with different treatment regimes may ultimately allow for better informed and improved treatment of infections for people with CF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS158951-supplement-Supplemental_Tables.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d94aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Newcastle University Molecular Microbiology MRes 4828F programme for supporting M.M.
