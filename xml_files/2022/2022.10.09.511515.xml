How SMCs interact with DNA is however not well understood. Among the SMC complexes, Smc5/6 has dedicated roles in DNA repair and in preventing a lethal buildup of aberrant DNA junctions. Here, we describe the reconstitution of ATP-dependent topological DNA loading by Smc5/6 rings. By inserting cysteine residues at selected protein interfaces, we obtained covalently closed compartments upon chemical cross-linking. We show that two SMC subcompartments and the kleisin compartment topologically entrap a plasmid molecule, but not the full SMC compartment. This is explained by a looped DNA segment inserting into the SMC compartment with the kleisin neck gate locking the loop in place when passing between the two DNA flanks and closing. This DNA segment capture strictly requires the Nse5/6 loader, which opens the neck gate prior to DNA passage. Similar segment capture events without gate opening may provide the power stroke for DNA translocation/loop extrusion in subsequent ATP hydrolysis cycles. Our biochemical experiments thus offer a unifying principle for SMC ATPase function in loading and translocation/extrusion, which is likely relevant to other members of the family of SMC proteins too.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In eukaryotes, three distinct Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes (cohesin, condensin, and Smc5/6) share essential tasks in the maintenance of chromosome structure and the faithful transmission of genetic information during nuclear division [reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>]. Some of these ATP-powered DNA-folding machines are known to form large DNA loops by loop extrusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This is thought to allow condensin to compact chromatids in mitosis and cohesin to participate in gene regulation, DNA repair and recombination in interphase. However, loop extrusion or merely DNA translocation may well be a conserved feature of all pro- and eukaryotic relatives. Smc5/6 has indeed recently been shown to extrude DNA loops or translocate along DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (Pradhan et al., 2022), but the cellular functions and relevance of these activities remain unclear. DNA entrapment has long been considered a basic and essential feature of SMC function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. It provides a simple explanation for how SMC complexes stay <italic>in cis</italic> (on a given DNA molecule) over time, maintain directionality of translocation, and readily bypass obstacles up to few tens of nm in size that they encounter frequently on the chromosomal translocation track. However, the requirement of DNA entrapment and the exact nature of the DNA interaction remain contested with all possibilities being considered in the recent literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>): topological DNA entrapment, DNA loop entrapment (also denoted as pseudo-topological entrapment), and exclusively external DNA association. The latter scenario was bolstered by the perceived bypass of very large obstacles by purified cohesin and condensin in single molecule imaging experiments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Cryo-electron microscopy studies have not yet been able to adequately address this question and particularly little is known about how Smc5/6 associates with DNA. Resolving DNA topology will be vital to refute and refine models for how the SMC ATPase powers DNA translocation and loop extrusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Complete loss of Smc5/6 function leads to severe chromosome segregation defects in mitosis and meiosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Toxic DNA structures such as unresolved recombination intermediates, DNA intertwinings, or incompletely replicated chromosomal regions prevent proper chromosome segregation in the absence of Smc5/6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. DNA translocation by Smc5/6 may be required to detect and eliminate such DNA junctions. The Smc5/6 holo-complex comprises eight subunits: Smc5-6 and Nse1-6 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S1A</xref>). All of them cause lethality when removed by gene disruption <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Smc5-6 and Nse4 together form the conserved ATPase core with an elongated shape that is characteristic for all SMC complexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Smc5 and Smc6 proteins harbor the canonical ‘hinge’ domains for heterotypic dimerization connected via ~35 nm long anti-parallel coiled-coil ‘arms’ to globular ABC-type ‘head’ domains with highly conserved motifs for ATP-binding and hydrolysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The kleisin subunit Nse4 bridges the head of the κ-SMC protein Smc5 to the head-proximal coiled coil (‘neck’) of the ν-SMC protein Smc6. This creates the SMC/kleisin (SK) ring structure shown in other SMC complexes to be in principle capable of entrapping DNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Nse4 serves as attachment point for two kite proteins (the Nse1 and Nse3 subunits), also found in the prokaryotic SMC complexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, while the Smc5/6-specific subunit Nse2 attaches to the coiled-coil arm of Smc5 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Finally, a stable sub-complex is formed by the Nse5 and Nse6 subunits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. It contacts the Smc5/6 hexamer via multiple interfaces including one on the arms and one on the heads. Single-molecule tracking and biochemical studies suggest a function of Nse5/6 in chromosome loading <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. In <italic>S. pombe</italic> (but not in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), disruption of <italic>nse5</italic> and <italic>nse6</italic> genes cause less severe phenotypes when compared to deletion of other Smc5/6 subunits, indicating that the hexamer can partially function without Nse5/6 in fission yeast <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Curiously, loop extrusion by <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Smc5/6 does not depend on the loader Nse5/6 and is actually inhibited by it, implying that Smc5/6 has essential functions beyond loop extrusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. A dedicated loader appears to be involved in viral restriction by Smc5/6 in human cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The ATP hydrolysis cycle involves major structural rearrangements in the SMC complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Three main conformations have been delineated for Smc5/6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S1B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>: (1) In the ‘ATP-engaged state’, two molecules of ATP are sandwiched by residues of the Walker A and B motifs of the Smc5 head and the signature motif of the Smc6 head and <italic>vice versa</italic>. The engaged heads keep the two head-proximal arms at a distance, thus opening an SMC compartment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. (2) In the ‘juxtaposed state’, the heads are ATP-disengaged and the Smc5 and Smc6 arms co-align yielding a closed SMC compartment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. (3) The ‘inhibited state’ relies on the intercalation of the loader Nse5/6 between the arms and heads of Smc5/6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, thus preventing head engagement and ATP hydrolysis. The inhibition is in turn overcome by the binding of a suitable DNA substrate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. A head/DNA interface on top of the engaged heads was described for several SMC complexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.

Here we delineate the position of DNA in the Smc5/6 complex by creating covalently closed DNA compartments followed by protein-DNA co-isolation under protein-denaturing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Fig 1A</xref>). First, we tested whether the perimeter of the Smc5/6 ring entraps plasmid DNA by cross-linking the three ring interfaces to generate a covalently closed SK ring. We used structure prediction (by AlphaFold-Multimer) to position cysteine pairs at two ring interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Fig 1A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. We observed robust chemical cross-linking of the Smc5/Nse4 interface (~80 %) and the Smc6/Nse4 interface (~90 %) upon addition of BMOE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S2A</xref>, lanes 3 and 4), as shown for the Smc5/6 hinge <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. When cysteine pairs at all three ring interfaces were combined, cross-linking gave rise to a significant fraction of covalently closed Smc5/6 SK ring species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S2A</xref>, lane 8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). The cysteine mutations did not have strong effects on the Smc5/6 ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S2B</xref>). We then separated protein-DNA catenanes from free DNA species by agarose gel electrophoresis (schematics in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S3A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Cross-linking at the three SK ring interfaces resulted in a characteristic laddering of a small (1.8 kb) plasmid at an elevated Smc5/6 concentration (400 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>), presumably due to the reduced mobility of DNA molecules associated with increasing numbers of Smc5/6 complexes. The laddering was fully dependent on ATP and disappeared when plasmid DNA was linearized by a restriction enzyme prior to gel electrophoresis, as expected for a topological interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). This loading reaction reached a steady state relatively quickly (within minutes; see below). Moreover, three protein preparations lacking one of the six engineered cysteines showed little or no DNA laddering, with the residual gel shift likely explained by low levels of off-target cross-linking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S2C</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The laddering was virtually abolished in the absence of the loader Nse5/6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>) and also clearly reduced by ATP-hydrolysis deficient mutations in both Smc5 and Smc6 (‘EQ/EQ’), indicating that ATP hydrolysis promotes more robust DNA entrapment. Based on similar experiments using protein gel electrophoresis, we estimate that a large fraction of Smc5/6 entraps plasmid DNA under our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S2D</xref>). We conclude that topological DNA loading by the Smc5/6 holo-complex is a robust and efficient reaction.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>DNA entrapment in the kleisin compartment</title><p id="P8">We next wondered where DNA might be located in the Smc5/6 complex. We previously showed that under the conditions promoting salt-stable DNA binding and DNA entrapment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C-D</xref>) the complex exhibits efficient head engagement as measured by cysteine cross-linking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Head engagement produces an SMC (‘S’) and a kleisin (‘K’) compartment (see schemes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). DNA must be in at least one of the two compartments. We first combined the cysteine pair at ATP-engaged heads with cysteines at both SMC/Nse4 interfaces to generate a covalently closed K compartment, which yielded robust DNA entrapment again in an ATP and loader-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>, top panel). The efficiency of entrapment in the K compartment appeared somewhat reduced when compared to the SK ring but this is likely explained by the reduced efficiency of engaged-heads cross-linking [~25 %; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>]. A series of samples cross-linked at different time points after mixing showed that entrapment was detectable after 30 seconds and was saturated within a few minutes in both the SK ring and the K compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S2E</xref>), supporting the notion that the two types of entrapment emerge from the same biochemical reaction and possibly correspond to the same state. We conclude that the K compartment of the ATP-engaged Smc5/6 holocomplex is occupied by DNA.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>DNA segment capture in the SMC compartment</title><p id="P9">Next, we combined head and hinge cysteines to create a covalently closed S compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). Contrary to the K compartment, no loader-dependent DNA entrapment was observed for the S compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>, second panel). This may suggest that the S compartment is devoid of DNA when heads are ATP-engaged. Alternatively, a DNA loop (rather than a single DNA double helix) may thread into the S compartment with the pseudo-topologically held DNA being lost upon protein denaturation even after cross-linking. To avoid confusion with the tobe-extruded DNA loop, we designate this configuration as DNA segment capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>, right scheme) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. To test for DNA segment capture, we sought to split the S compartment into two sub-compartments that each entrap a single DNA double helix rather than a DNA loop. A cryo-EM structure showed that the Nse3 subunit may split the S compartment into halves by contacting the Smc5 as well as the Smc6 coiled coil in a DNA clamping state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. We generated cysteine pairs to cross-link Nse3 to Smc5 and to Smc6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S4</xref>) and combined them with hinge cysteines to create an upper SMC compartment (S<sup>up</sup>) and with the head cysteines to generate a lower SMC compartment (S<sup>lo</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). Intriguingly, the cysteine combinations for the S<sup>up</sup> and the S<sup>lo</sup> compartments both resulted in robust DNA laddering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>, lower panels), demonstrating that a DNA segment is efficiently captured in the SMC compartment and held as a loop with one DNA passage in the S<sup>lo</sup> compartment and another one in the S<sup>up</sup> compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The loader Nse5/6 opens the neck gate in Smc5/6</title><p id="P10">In the course of the above experiments, we noticed that the crosslinking of the cysteine pair at the Smc6/Nse4 interface, designated as neck gate, is strongly sensitive to ligands. While cross-linking was robust (~ 90%) with or without ATP and DNA in the absence of the loader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>, lanes 2-5), it was strongly hampered when the loader Nse5/6 was added, especially when plasmid DNA was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>, lanes 7 and 8). Of note, such a behavior was not observed for cysteine pairs at the hinge <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, along the coiled-coil arms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S5</xref>) or at the Smc5/Nse4 interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S6A</xref>). However, addition of the loader led to some off-target crosslinking of a native cysteine in Nse5 with Smc5(G1054C) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S6B</xref>). More importantly, however, neck gate cross-linking in the octamer was partially restored by addition of ATP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>, lane 9) and virtually fully restored by addition of both ATP and DNA (lane 10). Similar cross-linking efficiencies were observed with complexes harboring all cysteines for SK ring cross-linking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S6C</xref>). Experiments performed with complexes carrying mutations of active site residues showed that this stimulatory effect of DNA on neck gate closure requires ATP-engagement of Smc5/6 heads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S6D</xref>, lanes 9 and 10) but not ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S6E</xref>, lanes 9 and 10). Altogether, the presented results thus suggest that binding of the Smc5/6 hexamer to the loader Nse5/6 specifically detaches one of the three ring interfaces. DNA clamping, <italic>i.e</italic>., ATP-engagement of SMC heads in conjunction with DNA binding at the head/DNA interface, appears to promote gate closure. Interestingly, fusion of Nse4 to Smc6, but not to Smc5, is lethal in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, indicating that opening of the neck gate is essential for Smc5/6 function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S6F</xref> and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>). The neck gate is largely closed in the presence of ATP and DNA, implying that once loaded onto DNA, Smc5/6 holo-complexes form a ring that en compasses the DNA double helix.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>DNA clamping is a prerequisite for efficient gate closure and DNA entrapment</title><p id="P11">The above observations suggested that DNA binding plays a role in neck gate closure. We next determined whether the head/DNA interface is indeed crucial for topological DNA entrapment or important only subsequently for example for the conversion of a putative ‘DNA holding’ intermediate into the DNA segment capture state (see later). Based on sequence conservation and structure comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S7 A-C</xref>), we identified three positively charged residues on Smc5 (K89, R139, R143) and another three on Smc6 (R135, K200, K201) as putative DNA binding residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). To test whether these residues are important for DNA entrapment, we mutated them by alanine and glutamate substitution (charge removal and reversal, respectively) in isolation or in combination. Mutant alleles were tested for functional complementation of a respective deletion mutant in yeast using plasmid shuffling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. <italic>smc5</italic> alleles harboring double or triple glutamate substitutions resulted in a strong growth phenotype, while alanine mutations were apparently tolerated well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). The <italic>smc6</italic> gene was somewhat more sensitive to the mutagenesis with the triple alanine mutant also exhibiting clear growth retardation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). A selection of residues based on a recent cryo-EM map <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> resulted in similar outcomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S7D and E</xref>). The deficiencies of the single, double, and triple alanine mutants in <italic>smc6</italic> were aggravated when combined with the <italic>smc5(3A)</italic> allele, suggesting that these residues have partially overlapping functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S7F</xref>) as previously observed for bacterial Smc <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. The sextuple alanine mutant strain [<italic>smc5(3A)</italic>, <italic>smc6(3A)</italic> or 3A3A] displayed a null-like phenotype, supporting the notion that the head/DNA interface is crucial for an essential function of Smc5/6.</p><p id="P12">Selecting one partially and one fully defective mutant (<italic>smc6(3A)</italic> and 3A3A, respectively) we tested for DNA loading of Smc5/6 when DNA binding at the heads is compromised. First, we measured ATP-dependent salt-stable DNA binding by pull-down assays as described previously [<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S3B</xref>]. The Smc6(3A) variant only poorly recovered plasmid DNA, while the 3A3A variant was completely unable to do so, together strongly suggesting that DNA binding is crucial for Nse5/6 mediated DNA loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>). Next, we combined the Smc6(3A) and the 3A3A mutations with the cysteine variants for SK cross-linking and DNA entrapment. Using the standard buffer conditions (150 mM NaCl), both mutants failed to support any DNA entrapment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4E</xref>, top panel). When the reaction buffer was adjusted to mimic the conditions used for salt-stable DNA binding (150 mM KOAc; a ‘milder’ salt with larger ions), the Smc6(3A) variant supported residual DNA entrapment, while the 3A3A variant did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4E</xref>, bottom panel). These results demonstrate that the head/DNA binding interface is crucial for topological DNA entrapment by Smc5/6. Of note, the mutant complexes showed slightly reduced ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S2B</xref>). However, the defect in DNA entrapment is not explained by the lack of ATP hydrolysis, since the EQ/EQ complex quite efficiently entrapped DNA despite failing to support any noticeable ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4E</xref> and fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>). Moreover, the mutant complexes produced ring cross-linking albeit at somewhat reduced efficiency, in particular the 3A3A mutant, an effect that was more pronounced in the stringent salt buffer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S6G</xref>). The latter is likely explained by defects in neck gate closure, as the complex lacking DNA binding residues on Smc5 and Smc6 heads also failed to display DNA-stimulated neck gate closure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S6H</xref>). DNA clamping might thus serve (at least) two related purposes during DNA entrapment: guiding kleisin over clamped DNA prior to closure and promoting gate closure itself.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>DNA passage through the neck gate</title><p id="P13">We wondered whether DNA might indeed enter the Smc5/6 ring by passing through the neck gate that opens upon association with the loader Nse5/6 and closes upon DNA encounter. To test this hypothesis directly, we created an Smc6-Nse4 fusion protein. The linker peptide covalently connects the C-terminus of the Smc6 polypeptide to the N-terminus of Nse4 and includes a recognition sequence for cleavage by the 3C protease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S8A</xref>). This construct is non-functional <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S6F;</xref> as previously reported for a related construct {Serrano, 2020 #98}). The reconstituted Smc5/6 complex harboring this fusion protein hydrolyzed ATP normally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S2B</xref>). We next combined the Smc6-Nse4 fusion protein with cysteines for DNA entrapment experiments (see schematics in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S8B</xref>). When combining cysteines at the hinge and the Smc5/Nse4 interface with the Smc6-Nse4 fusion protein, the ring species failed to produce any gel shift, demonstrating that DNA entrapment is not possible when Smc6 is linked to Nse4, as expected if the neck gate indeed serves as DNA entry gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>, lanes 5-7 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S8B</xref>). Curiously, however, we recovered DNA laddering when combining the Smc6-Nse4 fusion with only the neck gate cross-link albeit with an altered laddering pattern with distinctively smaller steps, probably owing to the smaller size of the protein ring species formed with Smc6 and Nse4 protein only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>, lanes 8-10 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S8B</xref>). Combining the Smc6-Nse4 fusion with all three cysteine pairs yielded DNA laddering with larger as well as smaller laddering steps presumably due to partial cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>, lanes 11-13 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S8B</xref>). To reconcile these observations, we suggest that the linker may be long enough to embrace the incoming DNA, thus not blocking the loading reaction itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>). This would lead to pseudo-topological entrapment of a DNA loop in an expanded ‘SK-plus-linker’ compartment (see schematics of closed and denatured compartments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>), thus explaining the absence of laddering when the Smc6-Nse4 interface was only closed by the peptide linker but not by the cross-link. Cleavage of the linker peptide by 3C protease before (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S8C</xref>) or after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref>) the loading reaction eliminated the entrapment by the linker compartment and also removed the smaller-sized steps observed with the fusion protein plus all three cysteine pairs. Also consistent with the linker wrapping around DNA, we find that the Smc6-Nse4 fusion complex supported normal or near-normal salt-stable DNA binding regardless of whether the peptide linker was left intact or cleaved, whereas a control complex with an open kleisin did not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig S8D</xref>).

Experiments with entire bacterial chromosomes have provided strong evidence for DNA entrapment in the SK ring (and the K but not the S compartment) of Smc-ScpAB and MukBEF but did not reveal the mode of entrapment due to the complexity of the DNA substrate (including branches on the replicating chromosome) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

Here, we unequivocally demonstrate that the neck gate serves as major and likely only entry gate in Smc5/6. This conclusion is based on an Smc6-Nse4 fusion protein, in which the linker does not block DNA loading but entraps the incoming DNA <italic>in flagrante delicto</italic> in an artificial linker compartment. The identity of the entry gate is furthermore supported by its efficient opening upon contact of the Smc5/6 hexamer with the loader Nse5/6, and by the lethality caused by the relevant fusion <italic>in vivo</italic> in budding yeast <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Other possible gates do not seem to contribute to DNA entrapment in the reconstituted reaction [as judged by the absence of DNA entrapment by complexes harboring the Smc6-Nse4 fusion protein (as wells as cysteines for cross-linking the hinge and Smc5/Nse4)]. The situation appears more complicated in other SMC complexes. The neck gate is known to support DNA exit in cohesin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup> and has also been implicated in DNA entry in cohesin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> as well as condensin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>.

A recent study in contrast to earlier reports suggested that condensin loading does not require an entry gate at least for DNA loop extrusion.</p><p id="P20">We find that the association with the loader destabilizes the contact between Smc6 and Nse4. Knowing that the loader intercalates between Smc5 and Smc6 heads <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and that the Nse4 middle part is rather short, we propose that steric constraints prevent Nse4 from being attached to both SMC proteins simultaneously when the loader is also bound, resulting in the detachment of the least stable interface. DNA binding might reverse the effect of the loader, by evicting it from between the SMC heads and enabling productive head engagement (and ATP hydrolysis) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> as well as ring re-closure by Smc6/Nse4 association. Assuming that the presence of DNA keeps the neck gate shut also during subsequent ATP hydrolysis cycles, this would result in a stable DNA association possibly facilitating DNA translocation over extended periods of time. The neck gate interface also appears labile in purified preparations of cohesin and condensin (sub-)complexes with the binding partners detaching from one another upon ATP-head engagement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> [or incubation with cohesin unloading factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>].

Neck gate opening upon ATP binding and head engagement, however, diametrically contrasts with our finding on budding yeast Smc5/6, where ATP-dependent head engagement leads to closure rather than opening of the gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref>).

The head/DNA contacts conceivably hold a bent DNA segment in place during loading and further DNA contacts guide the kleisin subunit around DNA to ensure entrapment of a DNA double helix in the SK ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). Of note, a model proposed for cohesin DNA loading via the neck gate resembles our notion of DNA segment capture <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. However, DNA loading via the cohesin neck gate has since been shown to work regardless of the absence or presence of the loading-clamping subunit Scc2, thus challenging this notion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">Why would DNA loading of SMC complexes involve such an intricate structure rather than rely on entrapping a single DNA double helix?

We envisage that the segmentcapture states during loading and during translocation/loop extrusion are structurally related. The notion of DNA segment capture mediating DNA loading as well as translocation explains how the very same ATPase core supports two distinct biochemical reactions and thus provides a unified framework for SMC ATPase functions, possibly also applicable to other SMC-related processes. The segment-capture state is consistent with observations on the bacterial SMC complexes Smc-ScpAB and MukBEF made by <italic>in vivo</italic> cross-linking and chromosome isolation as well as a cryo-EM structure of the MukBEF complex encompassing two separate DNA molecules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.
