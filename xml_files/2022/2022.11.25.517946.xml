The doublets are made of A- and B-tubules that fuse together at two junctions. Among these, the outer junction is made of tripartite tubulin connections, while the inner junction contains distinct non-tubulin elements. The latter includes Flagellar-associated protein 20 (FAP20) and Parkin co-regulated gene protein (PACRG) that together link the A- and B- tubules at the inner junction. While the structures of doublet microtubules reveal molecular details, their assembly is poorly understood and examining proteins at the junctions can provide important clues. In this study, we purified recombinant FAP20 and characterized its effects on microtubule dynamics by TIRF microscopy. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy, we conclusively show that FAP20 recruits free tubulin to the existing microtubule, where it mediates flexible lateral interactions between the microtubule lattice and tubulin dimers. Our structure of microtubule:FAP20:tubulin complex partially resembles the inner junction architecture, further providing insights into assembly steps involved in closure of B- tubule in a doublet microtubule.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cilia</kwd><kwd>cilia- and flagella -associated protein 20</kwd><kwd>doublet microtubules</kwd><kwd>inner</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Biological motility mediated by cilia and flagella beating involves dynein mediated sliding of axonemal doublet microtubules, which are conserved across organisms from unicellular ciliates and flagellates to multicellular eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Nicastro <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sui &amp; Downing, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Viswanadha <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Defects in assembly of the doublet microtubule are associated with structural deformities and impairment of ciliary function implicated in many ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Fliegauf <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Oh &amp; Katsanis, 2012</xref>). The doublet microtubules are made of a 13-protofilament A-tubule, which resembles cytoplasmic microtubules and an additional, semi-circular B- tubule (with 10 protofilaments) fused to the A-tubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Satir &amp; Christensen, 2007</xref>). Advances in cryo-electron microscopy have led to determination of several high-resolution structures of an intact doublet microtubule from cilia/flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Khalifa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ma <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). These models have revealed intricate details about the doublet microtubule architecture, various microtubule inner proteins decorating both the A- and B-tubule as well as the outer and inner junctions between the A- and B-tubule. The outer junction is entirely mediated by tubulin components that form a tripartite lateral interaction between A- and B- tubule protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ichikawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Khalifa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ma <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). The assembly of outer junction has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> in presence of excess salts as well as in the absence of tubulin carboxy terminal tails.

However, the partially assembled B-tubule in this intermediate does not fuse with the A-tubule and presumably requires proteins of the inner junction to form the complete doublet microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Khalifa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Nicastro <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). The doublet microtubule inner junction had long been suspected to be mediated via non-tubulin subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Nicastro <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>) and the components were later identified from high-resolution structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Khalifa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ma <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). An alternating set of FAP20 and PACRG protein units forms the core of the inner junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Dymek <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Khalifa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ma <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>) and recent high-resolution cryo-electron tomography structures reveal additional protein subunits such FAP45, 52, 106, 126 and 276 further strengthening the inner junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Khalifa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Mutational studies in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> reveal that although PACRG and FAP20 proteins are not essential for the formation of flagella, their null mutants show abnormalities in the structure of axonemes (absence of beak structures and inner dynein arms) and severe defects in motility of the organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Dymek <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Yanagisawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Similar effects are also observed in case of depletion of a homologue of FAP20 in <italic>Paramecium</italic>, known as Bug22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Laligné <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Bug22 mutants in Drosophila show abnormalities associated with ciliopathies, neuronal defects and impairment of sperm differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mendes Maia <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Depletion studies also propose the link between Bug22 and posttranslational modifications of the axonemal doublet in Drosophila as well as in human RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mendes Maia <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the absence of either PACRG or FAP20 causes slower sliding velocities with respect to dynein but the effect on the double mutant is not cumulative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Dymek <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). These observations suggest that PACRG and FAP20 play a role in later stages of the inner junction assembly and contribute towards maintaining the structural integrity and functional aspects of the axoneme. So far, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of inner junction proteins has been limited to experiments with recombinant PACRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Ikeda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Khan <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) and there is little biochemical evidence to show the direct role of FAP20 in doublet formation and maintenance. To address this, we have purified a recombinant version of FAP20 and characterized its biochemical properties towards microtubules using <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution studies. Our studies with light and electron microscopy show that FAP20 recruits tubulin to the microtubule lattice independent of GTP. The reconstitution of FAP20 binding to a growing microtubule allowed us to identify flexible interactions in the microtubule:FAP20:tubulin complex and propose a model for inner junction assembly.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>FAP20 binding stabilises the microtubule lattice</title><p id="P4">The properties of FAP20 binding to microtubules <italic>in vitro</italic> have not been reported so far and to study this we cloned, expressed and purified a recombinant version of full length FAP20 from <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> by nickel-histidine affinity chromatography (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref> for details, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). First we performed copelleting assays with purified FAP20 and microtubules polymerised from goat brain tubulin in the presence of different nucleotides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). We found that FAP20 binds to all of the microtubules <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that FAP20 is insensitive to minor lattice perturbations due to different nucleotide states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). To assess whether FAP20 affects microtubule growth and stability we then carried out microtubule growth assays in the presence of FAP20 (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref> for details, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). From the kymograph analysis of TIRF images, we found that at lower concentrations, FAP20 did not induce any significant effect on the growth rate and growth length of the microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). However, the growth rates and growth lengths of microtubules increased significantly in presence of 2.5 μM and 5μM FAP20. The microtubule growth rates in the absence and presence of 2.5 μM and 5uM FAP20 were 0.54 μm min<sup>-1</sup> , 0.89 μm min <sup>-1</sup> and 0.88 μm min<sup>-1</sup> respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The microtubule growth lengths recorded were 2.93 μm in absence of FAP20 and 6.00 μm and 6.32 μm in presence of 2.5μM and 5μM FAP20 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Another striking observation apparent from the kymographs was the reduced number of catastrophe events as the concentration of FAP20 was increased in the microtubule growth assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Quantification of the frequency of catastrophe events showed marked decrease in a concentration dependent manner. In the absence of FAP20, and with 0.05 μM and 0.25μM FAP20, 80.4%, 68.3% and 54.66% of the analysed microtubules exhibited regular catastrophe events respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>). At higher concentrations of FAP20 (2.5uM and 5uM) almost no catastrophe events could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A and 1D</xref>). Thus the recombinant FAP20 protein makes stabilising interactions with the microtubule lattice increasing the growth rate, reducing the number of catastrophe events and eventually preserving the growing microtubule.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>FAP20 recruits free tubulin to microtubule lattice</title><p id="P5">In our microtubule growth assays, at higher concentrations of FAP20 we observed fluorescence signal from cy5-labelled free tubulin accumulating at the existing microtubule lattice, both GMMPCP seeds as well as the newly polymerized microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). We reasoned that FAP20 promotes lateral association of free tubulin dimers to the microtubule lattice and investigated the role of GTP in this phenomenon. Under the same conditions without GTP, similar cy5-labelled free tubulin accumulation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>) suggesting that the FAP20 protein is the basic unit that links the microtubule lattice to the soluble-tubulin dimer. Although we observed different patterns of tubulin association with the GMPCPP seeds in presence of GTP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A, B and C</xref>), the pattern of arrangement was found to be regular and continuous in case of tubulin recruitment by FAP20 when no GTP was present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3D and 3E</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To gain further understanding into the pattern of tubulin recruitment, we measured the fluorescence signal associated with bound tubulin dimers over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) and the length of the microtubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). We observed a uniform increase in tubulin recruitment over time on the GMPCPP stabilised seeds, with an increased recruitment in the presence of GTP compared to its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). This effect was also evident from intensity analysis over the length of the microtubule, where we observed several fold increase in fluorescence intensity represented by the area under the curve corresponding to the GMPCPP seed only in the presence of GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Quantification of the difference between initial and final normalised intensities of recruited tubulin to the GMPCPP seed showed a large distribution of values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) suggesting no directed pattern of recruitment in presence of GTP. The FAP20 mediated tubulin recruitment occurs rapidly as the reaction is setup and the initial stages could not be captured using TIRF imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). This is particularly evident in absence of GTP, where the difference in normalized fluorescence intensities between initial and final time points of the assay is negligible as compared to in presence of GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). The tubulin recruitment saturates almost immediately in absence of GTP, while in its presence the recruited tubulin dimers act as nucleation points for a steady state lateral association. In summary, our TIRF imaging experiments have uncovered a unique property of FAP20, where it mediates binding of a tubulin dimer to the microtubule lattice in a GTP independent manner.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>FAP20 mediates flexible interaction of microtubule lattice with tubulin dimer as well as protofilaments</title><p id="P7">We next performed cryo-electron microscopy analysis to understand the FAP20 mediated tubulin recruitment on to the microtubule lattice. Samples were prepared by adapting the steps derived from our TIRF assay on Transmission Electron Microscopy grids, which were then imaged in an electron microscope (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref> for details). In the absence of FAP20, we observed undecorated GMPCPP microtubules with a diameter between 25 – 30 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In the presence of GTP and FAP20,we observed microtubule-like structures with twice the diameter ~50 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating tubulin accumulation as observed in the TIRF images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Analysis of the raw and filtered images as well as the power spectra suggests presence of additional layers of protofilaments associated with each other on a conventional microtubule lattice structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). Attempts to obtain a consensus high resolution 3D reconstruction of this structure failed due to heterogeneity of the sample and the complexity of the arrangement in the higher order structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). However, a low resolution structure could be determined, which shows multiple stacks of protofilaments with a hollow centre similar to the diameter of a conventional microtubule (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To obtain a more homogenous sample we then turned our attention to FAP20 mediated tubulin recruitment in the absence of GTP. In the absence of GTP, the electron micrographs showed presence of the microtubule lattice (20 – 30 nm) decorated with rings and/or spirals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). From the line scan analysis of the filtered images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) and the layer lines in the power spectra of the helical segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>), a 10-11 nm regular interval of rings/spirals structures could be observed. Since the <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution system contains only microtubule, free tubulin and FAP20, and the TIRF images show tubulin recruitment on existing microtubule lattice, we deduce that the rings/spirals observed here are higher order structures composed of microtubule, FAP20 and tubulin dimers. The interaction between FAP20, tubulin dimers and microtubule however appears to be flexible as the rings/spirals were found at different angles with respect to the microtubule axis and the vertical spacing between the rings/spirals, depending on the region analysed might actually range around 11 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Hence, we conclude that FAP20 mediates flexible interactions between the microtubule lattice and tubulin dimers in the absence of GTP. This association is retained with protofilaments when GTP is added to the sample.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Binding of FAP20 to the microtubule is specific</title><p id="P9">From the TIRF experiments and electron micrographs, the microtubule:FAP20:tubulin structure (in absence of GTP) appeared to be less heterogenous compared to microtubule:FAP20:tubulin:GTP complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B and 3C</xref>). Therefore, we attempted 3D reconstruction of microtubule:FAP20:tubulin complex to deduce its architecture and possible molecular interactions (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref> for details and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>). A low resolution reconstruction of the complex revealed that it is made up of three concentric layers corresponding to the microtubule (inner), FAP20 (intermediate) and tubulin dimers (outer)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). From initial assessment, the outer and inner concentric layers form 1-start and 3-start helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), in line with our power-spectra analysis where we observed an additional layer line for microtubule:FAP20:tubulin complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). This posed a challenge during processing as imposing helical symmetry using a single set of helical parameters was not possible. To improve the resolution of the complex, we performed signal subtraction for the different layers and refined them individually with their corresponding sets of helical parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>). This process yielded a 3.9 Å resolution cryoEM map of the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>). However the particles with subtraction focussed on the FAP20 layer and outer tubulin layer did not yield EM maps with defined structures for the intermediate and outer rings/spirals (FAP20 and tubulin dimer unit), possibly because of heterogeneity and flexibility in these layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). In particular, the FAP20 layer was very poorly resolved and did not show any discernible features that could aid in fitting the model of FAP20 obtained from cryo-electron microscopy studies on the isolated doublet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Khalifa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ma <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). The outer layer corresponding to the tubulin dimers showed distinct blobs of density that could accommodate tubulin dimers horizontally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The horizontal protofilament along the ring/spiral showed better fit into the density compared to the vertical alignment of tubulin dimers along the microtubule axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). In order to obtain a composite model of the microtubule:FAP20:tubulin interaction, we attempted AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Evans <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Jumper <italic>et al</italic>, 2021a</xref>) based structure prediction of complex of FAP20 and tubulin dimer and compared the predicted models with structures of the fully assembled doublet determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The AlphaFold2 model of FAP20 bound to a tubulin dimer showed high confidence (pTM+ipTM=0.91) and was similar to the interaction of FAP20 with alpha tubulin from A1 protofilament in the atomic models of the doublet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). The distinct spacing of FAP20 mediated tubulin rings in the structure, high confidence values (pTM+ipTM between 0.89 to 0.91) for top 5 models obtained from Alpha Fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5D</xref>) and buried surface area (865.2 Å<sup>2</sup>) suggest a specific binding mode of FAP20 towards the alpha tubulin in the microtubule lattice (similar to A1 protofilament in the doublet microtubule). Using the above information, we obtained a reasonable fit of this model of tubulin and FAP20 (from AlphaFold2) in the electron density maps of subtracted particles corresponding to the microtubule and FAP20 layers and fit the horizontal tubulin protofilament in the map corresponding to the outer tubulin layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Examination of the combined model revealed that the distance between microtubule lattice and tubulin dimer was 6 nm with no linking connections in the electron density map between FAP20 and the microtubule lattice or tubulin dimer, indicating high flexibility of the interactions. The interaction between FAP20 and tubulin dimers of the outer helix does not resemble the FAP20-B-tubule interaction determined from the cryoEM structure of the doublet microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Khalifa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ma <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Analysis of the interface of FAP20 with the B-tubule in the doublet structure (PDB ID: 6u42) gave low values of buried surface areas (FAP20 : alpha tubulin-135.2 Å<sup>2</sup>, FAP20: beta tubulin-262.4 Å<sup>2</sup>) suggesting weak interactions possibly stabilised by other proteins of the inner junction. Additionally the map corresponding to the FAP20 layer showed residual gaps after fitting of the atomic models of FAP20, which can incorporate a slightly extended version of FAP20 or another molecule of FAP20 and hence might represent an intermediate in the formation of the inner junction.</p><p id="P10">In summary, we have purified FAP20 and characterized its interaction with microtubules/tubulin dimers. Using biochemistry, TIRF and electron microscopy imaging we thus conclude that FAP20 mediates flexible interactions between microtubule and tubulin dimers possibly by undergoing conformational changes or oligomerisation. Our structure of microtubule:FAP20:tubulin complex determined in absence of GTP suggests that the binding of FAP20 to the microtubule lattice is specific.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P11">The architecture of the doublet microtubule inner junction is fundamentally different from that of the outer junction and is chiefly composed of FAP20 and PACRG repeating units connecting the B-tubule to the A-tubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Dymek <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Previous studies on the inner junction have involved analysis of isolated doublet microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Khalifa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ma <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> FAP20 and PACRG mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Dymek <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Yanagisawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) and purified recombinant PACRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Khan <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>); however the properties of FAP20 have remained largely uncharacterized. In this study we recombinantly purified FAP20 and characterized its role in mediating the inner junction connections using TIRF and electron microscopy. Microtubule growth and dynamic assays in the presence of FAP20 revealed an increase in microtubule growth rate and length at high concentrations along with a stark reduction in frequency of observed catastrophe events. Similar stabilising lattice interactions are often observed in case of microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) associated with the doublet microtubules. <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> mutants of MIPs, FAP45 and FAP52 show higher depolymerisation rates of the B-tubule compared to the wildtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Owa <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Turbidity studies with recombinant FAP85, a MIP associated with the A-tubule show reduced microtubule depolymerisation rates at lower temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kirima &amp; Oiwa, 2018</xref>). Since FAP20 binds uniformly over the microtubule lattice <italic>in vitro</italic>, we conclude that this mode of microtubule polymer protection is unique to FAP20 among the microtubule doublet associated proteins that have been characterized so far.</p><p id="P12">In addition to microtubule stabilizing role of FAP20, our experiments revealed another salient property of FAP20, where it recruits free tubulin to the existing microtubule polymer. Recruitment of free tubulin to the existing polymer has been reported in microtubule repair mechanism and occurs without the aid of any MAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Schaedel <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). PACRG mediated tubulin recruitment has also been reported recently, however the tubulin has been shown to accumulate as distinct puncta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Khan <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). In contrast, our dynamic assays show that the FAP20 mediated tubulin recruitment is uniform and steadily increases over time in the presence of GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). Through cryo-electron microscopy, we further show that FAP20 mediates flexible interactions with tubulin dimers in absence of GTP as well as larger assemblies of protofilaments, when GTP is added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B and 3C</xref>). The higher order structure of microtubule:FAP20:tubulin obtained in presence of GTP appears similar to the ‘double walled microtubules’ nucleated in presence of polycations, peptides or histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Erickson &amp; Voter, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Unger <italic>et al</italic>, 1990</xref>). The tubulin rings/spirals connected by FAP20 to the microtubule lattice obtained in absence of GTP resemble similar tubulin dimer decorations in the microtubule structures determined in complex with depolymerising kinesin-13 and Ska1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Benoit <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Monda <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). The periodicity of FAP20 interaction with the microtubule lattice as evident by spacing between the FAP20-tubulin rings/spirals was found to be around 11 nm which is slightly higher than the 8 nm periodicity of FAP20 binding in the doublet microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Dymek <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Khalifa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ma <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). This difference can be attributed to a stagger of tubulin dimers in the outer ring as compared to the vertical axis of the microtubule due to FAP20 binding flexibly to alpha tubulin leading to different helical symmetries for the microtubule and outer ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, kinesin-13 binds between alpha and beta tubulin and the spirals formed of kinesin-13 and tubulin follow the helical path of the tubulin heterodimer in the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Benoit <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Tan <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P13">While absence of FAP20 affects the beak structures in axonemes, it does not appear to be critical for other associated structures of the axoneme such as radial spokes, outer and inner dynein arms and the DRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Yanagisawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). High resolution structures of the doublet microtubule suggest that FAP20 interacts with many inner junction proteins including PACRG, FAP52, FAP276, FAP106, FAP126 and FAP45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Khalifa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ma <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Extensive comparative analysis of expression patterns of these interacting proteins is lacking but studies point towards the relative independence of FAP20 expression. FAP52 mutants do not show decrease in levels of FAP20 or PACRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Khalifa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>) and reports have shown reduced levels of PACRG and Rib72 in FAP20 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Yanagisawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>), but not vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Dymek <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>) suggesting their recruitment to be sequential steps in a pathway. Since mutants of FAP20 or PACRG do not have incomplete B-tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Dymek <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), it is likely that both these proteins play a role in later stages of the doublet microtubule assembly after it has been initiated by the other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Owa <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). However, absence of FAP20 in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> leads to flaying of isolated axonemes upon addition of ATP, indicating its importance in the stability of axonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Yanagisawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Based on the above inferences, we provide a basic model of assembly of the inner junction of doublet microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). As the B-tubule extends from the A-tubule anchored at the outer junction, several MIPs lining the B-tubule and ribbon of the doublet (FAP52, FAP276, FAP106, FAP126 and FAP45) act synergistically via tubulin post translational modifications and aid addition of requisite protofilaments for reaching the inner junction site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ichikawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Khalifa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ma <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Mutations in these proteins are associated with ciliary defects in structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Gegg <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jungnickel <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Ta-Shma <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) emphasizing their role in cilia formation and maintenance. Upon expression, FAP20 and PACRG bind in different combinations to the partial doublet structure; it is still not clear if FAP20 and PACRG exist as or form heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Dymek <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Khalifa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>). However, at places along the inner junction where both of them bind, a stable intermediate is formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) which then propagates along the junction stabilising it. Although, we cannot rule out the role of a marker protein between (A13 and A1) such as FAP276 or tubulin PTMs at the carboxy-termini of B-tubules in recruiting FAP20 and PACRG to the position of the inner junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Khalifa <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>) our <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution studies as well as AlphaFold2 models suggest that FAP20 is a key molecule in mediating the interaction between the protofilaments of A- and B-tubule and PACRG. Although, higher resolution structures of <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted complexes at different stages of doublet assembly will be required to understand and validate the assembly mechanism in detail, the purification and reconstitution experiments with FAP20 in this study lay the foundation and provide a step closer towards polymerizing doublet microtubules <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Purification of proteins</title><p id="P15">Tubulin was purified by a series of polymerization and depolymerization steps from goat brain using a standard protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Castoldi &amp; Popov, 2003</xref>).

Helical segments were manually picked using Relion’s helical picker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">He &amp; Scheres, 2017</xref>) and 2x binned particles were extracted using a box size of ~780Å and overlapping inter-box distance of 82 Å. Microtubule segments containing different protofilament numbers were segregated using supervised 3D classification involving comparison with references representing microtubules made of 11 to 16 protofilaments. The 14 protofilament microtubules formed the major fraction of the population and were selected for further processing. In case of microtubule:FAP20:tubulin with GTP dataset, this subset of unbinned 14 protofilament containing microtubule segments was used for several runs of 3D refinement using a combination of cylinder and low-pass filtered microtubule as references, with and without imposing helical symmetry and in absence and presence of soft masks but a well resolved consensus structure could not be obtained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). This could be because of high levels of uncontrolled heterogeneity in the sample that could not be segregated by 3D classification. For the microtubule:FAP20:tubulin (without GTP) dataset, the set of unbinned 14 protofilament microtubules was used for 3D refinement with helical symmetry using a cylinder with inner and outer diameters of 18 and 55 nm respectively as reference. The obtained model was again refined with imposed helical symmetry and a soft mask extending between 35 to 60 nm and containing 30% of the filament to improve the alignment of the outer tubulin rings. This model was then used for 3D refinement without symmetry starting with a sampling rate of 1.8 degrees to give the C1 reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Examination of the obtained structure revealed that the different layers of microtubule, FAP20 and outer tubulin rings possibly followed different helical parameters leading to improved features in parts of the reconstruction depending on the focus and masks applied. In order to improve reconstruction of each layer, signal subtraction was applied to the particles using customised masks focussing on each concentric layer. Refinement of subtracted particles containing only the microtubule was carried out with helical symmetry using GMPCPP microtubule (EMDB 7973) low pass filtered to 15Å as the reference. A map sharpening B-factor of -163 Å<sup>2</sup> was applied to the final map. For subtracted particles focused on FAP20 and outer tubulin ring layers, 3D classification with and without symmetry was attempted to solve the problem of heterogeneity but was unsuccessful.
