However, AP models are nonlinear, complex, and can contain more than a hundred differential equations, making them difficult to parameterise. Therefore, cellular cardiac models have been limited to describing ‘average cell’ dynamics, when cell-specific models would be ideal to uncover inter-cell variability but are too experimentally challenging to be achieved. Here, we focus on automatically designing experimental protocols that allow us to better identify cell-specific maximum conductance values for each major current type—optimal experimental designs—for both voltage-clamp and current-clamp experiments. We show that optimal designs are able to perform better than many of the existing experiment designs in the literature in terms of identifying model parameters and hence model predictive power. For cardiac cellular electrophysiology, this approach will allow researchers to define their hypothesis of the dynamics of the system and automatically design experimental protocols that will result in theoretically optimal designs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>optimal experimental design</kwd><kwd>mathematical modelling</kwd><kwd>model calibration</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>action potential</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cardiac cellular electrophysiology is the study of how cells manipulate ionic concentrations and membrane voltage to initiate and synchronise heartbeats. Having demonstrated their usefulness in fundamental research, quantitative models of the action potential (AP) are increasingly being used in safety-critical applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Mirams et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Niederer et al., 2018</xref>) such as optimising patient treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Corral-Acero et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Niederer et al., 2020</xref>) or assessing drug safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Li et al., 2019</xref>). These models contain several parameters, which may represent chemical properties such as binding rates, but also patient and even cell-specific properties such as ion current conductances (which are determined by gene expression levels). In many cases such parameters are not measured directly, but <italic>inferred</italic> indirectly from experimental recordings of membrane potential or transmembrane current. To create accurate models, we need to ensure the experiments used in their creation contain sufficient information on all parameters we need to infer. However, the experiments used in this process have not usually been designed with model calibration in mind, and as a result some parameters may be poorly constrained by the available data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Clerx et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Whittaker et al., 2020</xref>). Optimal experimental design (OED) is a method of designing experiments which uses an objective approach to elicit data containing “optimal information” for model calibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Lindley et al., 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kiefer, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Smucker et al., 2018</xref>). It is extremely popular in physical sciences such as geosciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Ushijima and Yeh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Seidler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Ushijima et al., 2021</xref>), mechanical engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Wickham et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gupta and Dhingra, 2013</xref>), chemical engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Rodriguez-Fernandez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gottu Mukkula and Paulen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Schenkendorf et al., 2018</xref>), etc. In this study, we apply the techniques of OED to cardiac cellular electrophysiology to expedite the development of AP models suitable for both basic research and safety-critical applications.</p><p id="P3">The electrophysiological properties of many types of isolated cells can be studied and examined via patch clamp experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hamill et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sakmann and Neher, 1995</xref>) in which the experimenter either controls (‘clamps’) the cell’s membrane potential and measures the resulting transmembrane current (voltage clamp mode), or controls the current while measuring potential (current clamp mode). In either mode, a pre-determined waveform (i.e. a sequence of voltages or currents) is applied, which we shall refer to as the experimental <italic>protocol</italic>. OED is a methodology of designing protocols based on the intuition that a model parameter can only be estimated from a measured model output (e.g. a current or voltage trace) if that output is strongly sensitive to the parameter value during the experiment. In short, it produces protocols that <italic>maximise</italic> (in some exact sense to be chosen by the experimenter) the model output’s sensitivity to all parameters of interest.</p><p id="P4">We apply an OED strategy to design experimental protocols that allow us to better identify cellspecific maximum conductance values for the major current types in mathematical cardiac myocyte models. Using simulation results from a controllable, understandable cellular system, we show that OED can successfully be applied to both voltage-clamp and current-clamp experiments to obtain cell-specific models. Moreover, the results demonstrate how OED protocols perform better than many of the existing experiments in the literature, in terms of reducing uncertainty in model parameters and its theoretical predictive power. This study provides a road map for researchers in cardiac cellular electrophysiology to automatically design theoretically-optimal experimental protocols.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><p id="P5">In this section we briefly introduce our OED approach (a full exposition is given in Methods) before presenting 12 new protocols derived for voltage clamp and 6 new protocols for current-clamp experiments. Various ways to evaluate the ‘quality’ of these optimised protocols are explored and we discuss some of the properties that we would like or expect them to have. To check the designs, we evaluate them using both theoretical optimality measures and practical tests in which we infer parameters from simulated data. Finally, we compare the OED performance against designs found in the literature.</p><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Optimal experimental designs for patch clamp experiments</title><p id="P6">OED provides a framework for obtaining high-quality, statistically grounded designs <italic>u</italic> that are optimal with respect to a statistical criterion Φ. It is based on the assumption that we can parameterise the designs <italic>u</italic> with a <italic>control</italic> or <italic>design variable vector</italic> <bold><italic>d</italic></bold> such that it can be optimised with the criterion Φ that depends on the choice of a model <italic>M</italic>. A schematic overview of the method is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p id="P7">Several options have been proposed for Φ, usually relating to the remaining uncertainty in model parameter values <italic>θ</italic> after calibration, or to other statistically relevant properties of the design. The criteria used in this study are known as the A-criterion, the D-criterion, and the E*-criterion (see § <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">4.3</xref>). They can be interpreted as properties (the shape and size) of the <italic>confidence hyper-ellipsoid</italic> for the calibrated model parameters <italic>θ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Vanrolleghem and Dochain, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Banga and Balsa-Canto, 2008</xref>): the A-optimal design can be interpreted as minimising the average variance of the confidence ellipsoid; the D-optimal design minimises the volume of the confidence ellipsoid; and the E*-optimal design minimises the ratio of the length of the largest to the smallest axis, making the ellipsoid as spherical as possible. The confidence ellipsoid were approximated using the Fisher information matrix based on the sensitivity of the model <italic>M</italic> (see § <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">4.3</xref>). Two types of sensitivity were employed: local sensitivity analysis (LSA) calculates the sensitivity of model outputs for a <italic>given</italic> set of parameters <italic>θ</italic> (using the default model parameters from the literature), and hence its name ‘local’ (i.e. optimal in a region of parameter space which is close, or local, to the assumed parameters); on the other hand global sensitivity analysis (GSA) samples parameters across a predefined parameter space (here we used a hypercube where each model parameter <italic>θ<sub>i</sub></italic> can be scaled from <italic>e</italic><sup>−2</sup> to <italic>e</italic><sup>2</sup> times its original value).</p><p id="P8">Since the statistical criterion is evaluated based on the choice of a model, Φ<sub><italic>M</italic></sub>, we first considered using the adult human ventricular (epicardial) AP model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">O’Hara et al.

We further considered using the <italic>average</italic> of the statistical criteria Φ<sub><italic>M</italic><sub>i</sub></sub> calculated using multiple models (<italic>M<sub>i</sub></italic> = {<italic>M<sub>1</sub></italic>, <italic>M<sub>2</sub></italic>, …}), with the aim of obtaining a design that is optimal for a range of biological assumptions instead of focusing on one particular model, termed the ‘averaged model criterion’ Φ<sub>{<italic>M<sub>i</sub>}<sub>i</sub></italic></sub>. Here we used five adult ventricular (epicardial) AP models to represent an averaged behaviour: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">ten Tusscher et al.

(2017</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Tomek et al. (2019</xref>). This gives us two types of model for calculating the criterion: single model criterion and averaged model criterion.</p><p id="P9">Two types of experimental protocols (<italic><bold>u</bold></italic>) are optimised: voltage clamp and current clamp (see § <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">4.2</xref>). We defined voltage clamp protocols as sequences of steps with a magnitude and duration that could be varied by OED as the design variables <italic><bold>d</bold></italic>. Our current clamp protocols consisted of short bursts of current injection with a fixed magnitude and duration, here the interval between burst was used as design variable (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). OED can also work within a variety of constraints, such as restrictions in duration of the experiment or applied voltage ranges, to ensure the optimal designs are practically feasible.</p><p id="P10">Experiment designs <bold><italic>u</italic>(<italic>d</italic>)</bold> were optimised based on a design measure which consists of a choice of the optimal design criterion and a choice of model used to perform the design, using a global optimisation algorithm. For voltage clamp experiments, we used six design criteria (LSA A-, D-, E* - designs, and GSA A-, D-, E*-designs) and two types of model, giving us in total 12 optimal design strategies (see § <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">4.3</xref>).

We used the same criteria to assess the OEDs, and their combinations form what we refer to as the cross-measure matrix. Each design measure entry of the cross-measure matrix was normalised to 0–100% with the best and the worst values seen across all the OED protocols such that it can be compared with other design measures.</p><p id="P18">Examples of cross-measure assessments for the OEDs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> for voltage clamp and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref> for current clamp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> shows our best voltage clamp protocol design, the OED with the ‘averaged model score’ under GSA D-criterion (Protocol K), which performs well under all measures and model currents. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref> shows our best current clamp protocol design, the OED with the ‘averaged model score’ under LSA A-criterion (Protocol R), which performs well under all measures and model currents.

For voltage-clamp experiments, we used (1) a simple step protocol from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lei et al.

For current-clamp experiments, we used (1) a simple 1 Hz constant pacing protocol; or (2) derived summary statistics (biomarkers) based on 1 Hz pacing, which are commonly used in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bartolucci et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Britton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jæger et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Paci et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Tveito et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P21">For the voltage-clamp protocols, the benchmark protocol from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lei et al.

Similarly, the protocol from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Groenendaal et al.

Often the number of data samples (or data points) in the i.i.d. Gaussian likelihood that we use is a major factor determining the width of the posterior. Here even for the protocol from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lei et al. (2017)</xref> (Protocol M) which is much longer in duration (hence more data samples) than any of the optimised protocols, the width of its posterior is still bigger than most of the optimised protocols. Interestingly, even though the protocol by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Groenendaal et al. (2015</xref>) (Protocol N) was designed specifically to tease out different dynamics of the ionic currents, the width of the posterior is similar to that of the protocol from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lei et al.

Most of them were able to improve the uncertainty in the inferred parameters compared to the benchmark protocols. We tried to seek the best protocol amongst the OED generated protocols. However, we were not able to identify the best one, as each of them perform slightly differently under different situations. For example Protocol K was the best in the cross-measures comparison, whilst Protocol D was better in reducing parameter uncertainty and error. We found that the protocols based on averaged model were consistently (slightly) better than the others, which may be a better way for designing patch-clamp protocols, which implicitly makes some allowance for differences in ion current kinetics.</p><p id="P25">Fitting conductances to whole-cell recordings while using ion channel kinetics models taken (or slightly adapted) from the literature, has been commonly used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Whittaker et al., 2020</xref>). Many inference approaches and biomarkers have been adopted, including multivariate regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Sarkar and Sobie, 2010</xref>), history matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Coveney and Clayton, 2018</xref>), “population of models” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Muszkiewicz et al., 2016</xref>), and moment-matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Tixier et al., 2017</xref>), and all of them assumed “out of the box” or only slightly modified kinetics models when fitting maximum conductances. Similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Johnstone et al. (2016</xref>) adapted a Bayesian approach with MCMC to infer maximum conductances using AP recordings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Groenendaal et al. (2015</xref>) proposed to use (cell-specific) voltage-clamp and current-clamp data with a genetic algorithm to find maximum conductances in an AP model. Some of these methods were included in our benchmark comparison for our approach; we have shown that optimal designs outperform these literature methods in terms of recovering parameters from simulated data.</p><p id="P26">Amongst all the methods that we compared, the biomarker approach performed the worst, even though it has been one of the most popular approaches. We further note that some of the biases in the biomarker posteriors were due to the biases introduced in estimating the biomarkers with noisy data. Such an issue is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>, where biomarkers were estimated for 1000 noise realisations and compared against the biomarkers taken from idealised noise-free data (dashed line). For example, there are no simple ways of estimating the unbiased (i.e. neither overestimating nor underestimating) maximum voltage or the AP amplitude with noisy AP traces; if we simply define the maximum voltage as the maximum voltage value of the noisy data, as done here, then we will overestimate the actual maximum voltage most of the time. This is because we have a number of data samples (sampling time points) around the underlying maximum voltage where the noise is centred, then the noisy data will have values bigger (as well as smaller) than the mean most of the time, giving an overestimated maximum voltage value. However, if we define the maximum voltage as the averaged value over a (short) period of time around the maximum voltage value of the noisy data, then the maximum voltage will be biased differently depending on the duration of the averaging period and the shape of the AP. Therefore, depending on the data postprocessing procedure, the biomarkers, and hence model parameters inferred from these, can be biased differently.</p><p id="P27">The biases introduced during biomarker extraction therefore affect posterior predictions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref> shows such posterior predictions using the parameter posteriors shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, where grey and black (dashed) lines show the data and the underlying ground truth, blue and orange show the predictions from the posteriors estimated using Protocol U (biomarkers) and Protocol O (LSA A with single model). The inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref> shows a magnification around the apex of the AP, highlighting the biases of the posterior predictions with biomarkers (blue) as compared to the OED results (orange). These biases may in turn cause issues during model predictions for unseen situations. We illustrate these issues in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref> which attempts to predict the AP under a 90% reduction of <italic>I<sub>Kr</sub></italic> together with a 50% reduction of <italic>I<sub>Ks</sub></italic>. The huge variability and inaccuracy of the posterior prediction using biomarkers (blue) are consequences of both increased <italic>parameter unidentifiability</italic> as well as bias discussed above, as shown by comparison with the predictions with parameters inferred by fitting to the full time traces from Protocol O (orange).</p><p id="P28">Several limitations of this work suggest future studies to advance the design of experimental protocols. First, all existing OED approaches, to our knowledge, provide optimal designs only under the assumption of having a correct underlying model, meaning when there is discrepancy between the model we use and the real system, including experimental artefacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Lei et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">2021</xref>), no guarantee that the designs will work better, or even work well, as discussed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lei et al., 2020b</xref>). The results, however, have generated experimental protocols that can readily be tested experimentally, especially since these designs can be implemented in most cellcular electrophysiology laboratories. A second limitation is that although we tested 18 OEDs, most of these are ‘classical’ design criteria that relies on certain approximation of the covariance of the estimates. In future work, we intend to determine whether more complex criteria or approaches, such as Bayesian decision theoretic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Huan and Marzouk, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Liepe et al., 2013</xref>) and reinforcement approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Treloar et al., 2022</xref>), can improve the protocol design.In summary, we have demonstrated that using mechanistic mathematical modelling and optimal experimental design can improve identification of model parameters and hence its theoretical predictive power. This work offers a methodology to automatically, objectively develop experimental protocols that can alleviate the issue of model parameter unidentifiability when collecting new experimental data.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><label>4</label><title>Methods</title><p id="P29">All code and data are freely available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/chonlei/action-potential-experimental-design">https://github.com/chonlei/action-potential-experimental-design</ext-link>.</p><p id="P30">In the design of experiments, the results of OED are experimental designs that are optimal with respect to some statistical criteria—<italic>optimal design measures</italic>.
