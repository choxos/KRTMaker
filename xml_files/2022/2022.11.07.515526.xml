In mice with chronic experimental asthma (CEA), but not naïve controls, rhinovirus inoculation induced an early (1 day post infection; dpi) inflammatory response dominated by neutrophils, neutrophil-associated cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, CXCL1) and NETosis, followed by a later, type-2 inflammatory phase (3-7 dpi), characterized by eosinophils, elevated IL-4 levels, and goblet cell hyperplasia. Notably, both phases were ablated by HpARI (<italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic> Alarmin Release Inhibitor), which blocks IL-33 release and signalling.

As expected, and consistent with our findings with anti-IL-33,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> HpARI ablated the expansion of the type-2 inflammation and mucus hyper production that occurs in response to RV inoculation. However, unexpectedly, HpARI ablated the early innate inflammatory response that is dominated by neutrophilic inflammation and associated cytokines, and markedly decreased the presence of NETs in the airway mucosa. Of note, exogenous IL-33 recapitulated the response observed following RV inoculation, including the induction of NETosis by infiltrating neutrophils, and significantly, treatment with a PAD4 inhibitor conferred protection against an IL-33-induced exacerbation. Critically, <italic>ex vivo</italic> IL-33 stimulation induced NETosis and the release of asthma-related cytokines from peripheral blood neutrophils isolated from mice with CEA, whereas neutrophils from naïve mice were unresponsive, suggesting that altered transcriptional and/or chromatin changes are operational prior to neutrophil migration to the lungs.

Several clinical trials using these agents are on-going, however a recent Phase 2 trial found that anti-IL-33 lowers the incidence of exacerbations and improves lung function in moderate-to-severe asthma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> further supporting a role for IL-33 in type-2 mediated inflammation. Similarly, monoclonal antibody targeting of the ST2 (IL-33) receptor decreased the asthma exacerbation rate in patients with uncontrolled severe asthma. Of interest, this positive outcome was also observed in those with low peripheral blood eosinophils, suggesting that IL-33 blockade may be an effective treatment option for subtypes of asthma less dominated by type-2/eosinophilic inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Although neither of these clinical studies reported the effect of IL-33 blockade on neutrophil numbers or biomarkers of neutrophil activation, we previously observed that anti-IL-33 attenuates neutrophilic inflammation induced by RV exposure in mice with CEA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> Here, we observed that IL-33 blockade with HpARI ablated the RV-induced inflammatory response which appeared to occur in two phases; the first between 1-3 dpi, and the second between 7-10 dpi. The latter phase, characterized by higher numbers of CD4+ Th2 cells and eosinophils, goblet cell hyperplasia and greater IL-4 expression, was ablated by HpARI, in keeping with the known effects of IL-33 in amplifying type-2 immunity. Significantly, however, treatment with HpARI also suppressed the early neutrophilic response, characterized by a spike in lung neutrophils, innate inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (e.g. IL-1α/β, IL-6, CXCL1), type-2/3 cytokines (e.g. IL-5 and IL-17A), and diminished the number of NETs in the airway mucosa. These findings suggested that IL-33 promotes neutrophilic inflammation, and in support of this, we demonstrated that in mice with CEA, but not naive controls, exogenous IL-33 exposure is sufficient to recapitulate the early phase response induced by RV, including the marked increase in lung neutrophils, NET formation in the mucosa and elevated biomarkers of NETosis in the BAL, and an increase in the expression of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and type-2/17 cytokines. Importantly, the IL-33-induced inflammatory response and NETosis was ablated with a PAD4 inhibitor, which is significant as NETosis plays a critical pathogenic role in linking RV-induced innate inflammation to the expansion of type-2 immune responses and immunopathology in asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> The molecular pathway by which NETosis promotes type 2 inflammation remains unclear, however it is noteworthy that a number of neutrophil-derived factors released during NETosis, such as LL-37, HMGB1, and S100A8/A9, are ligands of receptor for advanced glycation end-products,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> an innate receptor that we and others have implicated in the induction and amplification of type 2 immune responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup></p><p id="P15">IL-33 acts directly on human eosinophils to promote their survival and induces the release of reactive oxygen species and cytokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> In contrast, the effects of IL-33 on human neutrophil function is less clear, with some studies reporting an absence of neutrophil ST2 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> whereas others have shown that IL-33 regulates CXCR1/CXCR2 expression and CXCL8-mediated chemotaxis, and one report in the context of liver injury has suggested that IL-33 promotes neutrophil NETosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> In support of a direct role for IL-33 in inducing neutrophil activation, we found that <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation of purified blood and bone marrow neutrophils was sufficient to induce NETosis but only when the neutrophils were obtained from mice with CEA.

In subjects experimentally inoculated with RV, nasal dsDNA levels, a biomarker of neutrophil NETosis, correlated with nasal IL-33 levels, as well as respiratory symptoms, in those with asthma, but not healthy controls, further supporting IL-33-induced NETosis as a disease-specific phenomenon. Interestingly, others have similarly reported differences in IL-33 responsiveness between subjects with asthma and healthy controls,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and although the underlying mechanism was not identified, the effect was not mediated by a difference in basal ST2 expression.</p><p id="P16">In mice with CEA, the large increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production at 1 dpi occurred concomitantly with peak lung neutrophilia, suggesting that neutrophils may contribute to this phenotype. Remarkably, even in the absence of stimulation, circulating neutrophils obtained from mice with CEA produced significantly greater levels of IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6. Given the enhanced production of type-2 cytokines, and persistently elevated IL-33 levels in mice with CEA, it is possible that IL-33 contributes to the altered neutrophil behaviour. Indeed, <italic>ex vivo</italic> IL-33 stimulation potentiated the phenotype in neutrophils from mice with CEA, whereas again, neutrophils from naïve mice were unresponsive. Collectively, our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> findings demonstrate that neutrophils from mice with experimental asthma behave differently from those isolated from naive controls. Whether this phenotype occurs as a consequence of cytokines that ‘spill over’ from the lungs, or is mediated by factors released locally in the bone marrow, for example, IL-4 produced by resident memory Th2 cells, or a combination of both, remains to be elucidated.</p><p id="P17">The role for IL-33, neutrophils and NETs in type 2 immunity has recently gained interest in the context of parasitic helminth infections. Early in <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> infection, a neutrophilic response is observed in the lungs as the parasite migrates through on its way to the intestine. This neutrophilic response is rapidly resolved, and an eosinophil-dominant type 2 response is evident at later time points.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> Intriguingly, this early neutrophilic response is required for effective type 2 anti-helminth immunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> Although the role of NETosis has not been investigated in the generation of type 2 immunity during helminth infection, NETosis also slows the migration of parasitic hookworms, and DNase treatment (degrading NETs) increases parasite burden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> Of note, in the context of the current study, many parasites (including <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>) secrete DNaseII to degrade NETs: thus HpARI, HpBARI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>and DNaseII secreted products may all be directed against the same IL-33-NET-type-2 immunity axis.</p><p id="P18">Recent ‘omics studies have shown that neutrophils express distinct gene expression patterns depending on their developmental stage and microenvironment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> and these transcriptional and epigenetic programs may support the programming of neutrophils with different effector functions. Thus, neutrophils are increasingly recognized to be more plastic and versatile than previously thought.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> For example, we previously observed that CXCR4<sup>hi</sup> neutrophils, recruited to the lungs in response to low dose LPS, are the subpopulation that undergoes NETosis and promotes allergic sensitization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> This raises the tantalizing possibility of targeting specific molecular pathways and programs that regulate the aberrant neutrophil response in asthma. A greater understanding of these molecular events will likely reveal novel tractable targets for therapeutic intervention. Before then, our findings expand the ‘IL-33 endotype’ in asthma to include virus-induced neutrophilic inflammation, and suggest that IL-33 blockade may be of therapeutic benefit to patients with asthma beyond the type 2-high and eosinophilic phenotypes, and potentially other diseases where neutrophilic inflammation is detrimental.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Mouse Strains and treatments</title><p id="P19">BALB/c mice were maintained under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute Animal Facility.
