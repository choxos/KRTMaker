We investigated humoral and cellular immunity induced by Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV) in a region of high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence.</p><p id="P2">Levels of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) were determined 24-weeks. Cellular immunity was investigated using a commercially available IFN-γ release assay to SARS-CoV-2 spike (Ag1 and 2) and extended genome antigens (Ag3).</p><p id="P3">Increasing IgG seropositivity to Spike protein and RBD was observed post-vaccination. Seropositivity was reduced in those over 50 years and raised in females and those with prior COVID-19. After 20 weeks post-vaccination, only one third of participants had positive T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Prior COVID-19 impacted IFNγ responses, with reactivity enhanced in those infected earlier. The frequency of IFNγ responses was highest to extended genome antigen set.</p><p id="P4">Overall, BBIBP-CorV- induced antibody responses were impacted by age, gender and prior COVID-19. Cellular immunity was present in a limited number of individuals after 20 weeks but was enhanced by prior infection. This suggests the need for booster vaccinations in older individuals. BBIBP-CorV-induced cellular activation is broader than to spike, requiring further study to understand how to monitor vaccine effectiveness.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>IgG antibodies</kwd><kwd>spike protein</kwd><kwd>RBD</kwd><kwd>BBIBP-CorV</kwd><kwd>seroprevalence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">COVID-19 has resulted in over 6.3 million deaths globally as a consequence of more than 643 million infections (22 November 2022) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Vaccinations against COVID-19 were first introduced at the start of 2021 and rolled out in stages based on both access and availability in different populations. COVID-19 vaccines included formulations based on mRNA expression of spike protein, adenovirus vector-based vaccines, and inactivated vaccine types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). They have had a major impact on controlling both morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), leading to what in 2022 is thought to be the tail end of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Case fatality rates (CFR) from COVID-19 have varied greatly, ranging during the first wave in March 2020 from, 6.2% in Italy and 3.6% in Iran, to 0.79% in South Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). However, the CFR in Pakistan did not rise above 2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). In a country of over 200 million, there were 30,600 deaths reported due to COVID-19 (22 November 2022) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), with a relatively low related morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Pakistan has a young population, with 64% of individuals aged &lt; 30 years. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Younger age has been associated with favorable outcomes in COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). However, the reasons for differential CFRs between countries and regions are unclear but have been related to life expectancy, population pyramids, potential exposure to other coronaviruses, and prior immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection is dependent on appropriate activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly immunogenic and antibodies to spike protein are associated with protective immunity against the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). High seropositivity rates following natural infection have been associated with high population densities and rapid transmission resulting in high rates of infection. Studies from 2020 showed antibody seroprevalence to range between 15 to 21% in some areas of Karachi, the largest urban center in Pakistan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). By December 2020, we observed IgG antibodies to spike protein to be present in greater than 50% of unvaccinated healthy blood donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). By April 2021, we observed IgG antibody seroprevalence to be up to 83% in an uninfected health care cohort in Karachi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Early activation of T cell producing IFN-γ and IL-2 indicates robust T cell effector response in patients with COVID-19 are associated with decreased disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). The induction of effective SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells is also linked with effective activation of antibody responses. T cell reactivity associated with viral clearance is linked with recognition of spike and nucleocapsid proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p><p id="P9">About 12 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccinations have been administered worldwide, with 66% of the global population having received one dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Most of the studies on vaccine efficacy and immunological responses are based on the analysis of populations vaccinated by mRNA type (Pfizer-BNT162b2-, Moderna mRNA-1273) and vector-based vaccines (ChAdOx nCoV-19). The vaccine, Sinopharm (inactivated) prepared by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co-Ltd. (BBIBP) also called BBIBP-CorV (Vero cells) is an aluminum-hydroxide-adjuvanted, inactivated whole-virus vaccine. It is administered in two doses, given four weeks apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). 1.65 billion doses of Sinopharm have been delivered to 79 countries worldwide (22 November 2022) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). There is limited data on inactivated vaccines such as those administered in many low-middle income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).</p><p id="P10">In Pakistan, 139 million individuals (70%) of the population have received their first dose of vaccination, with 132 million (66%) individuals fully vaccinated (22 November 2022) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Vaccinations were rolled out in February 2021 as emergency use authorization (EUA) was obtained by BBIBP-CorV as one of the primary vaccines administered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Vaccinations were given in a stratified manner that is first, to health care workers and then to older age groups in the country.</p><p id="P11">A recent study from Pakistan has shown that full vaccination with BBIBP-CorV was effective in reducing the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection (94.3%), hospitalisations (60.5%) and mortality (98.6%), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Studies on immune response induced by BBIBP-CorV have shown differing results. In Sri Lanka, more than 90% seropositivity was observed 6 weeks post-vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). A study from the United Arab Emirates showed seropositivity of 78% in the general population after full vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), with a similar result in a report from Pakistan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 are driven both by natural infection and COVID-19 vaccinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). It is particularly important to have data from high infectious disease burden regions with limited COVID-19 vaccine access where primarily inactivated vaccines were administered. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of BBIBP-CorV -induced IgG responses to spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins for up to 25 weeks post-vaccination in a healthcare associated cohort in Karachi, Pakistan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).

Subjects were recruited by a consecutive convenience sampling method. They included healthcare workers, Aga Khan University (AKU) employees, and their family members who volunteered to participate in the study. A verbal history of prior COVID-19 infection was taken at the time of recruitment. A SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was used to identify laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in all cases. Positive antibody results if available were also documented. There was no bias in selection of cases based on any prior COVID-19 history. During the study period, active surveillance of infection was not performed. However, subjects were encouraged to inform the study team if they had PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection during the post-vaccination study period.</p><p id="P16">AKUH provided SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing to all employees through the pandemic. Therefore, individuals with symptoms associated with COVID-19 and those who had exposure to laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases were able to get themselves tested free of cost.</p><p id="P17">In total, we enrolled 312 participants to the study. All of them were requested to give blood samples for up to four time points during the study period, 24 weeks after their first dose of BBIBP-CorV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The number of samples given by participants varied as some refused subsequent blood draws.

Chicago, IL, USA, 2013) was used to carry out descriptive statistics of participants for demographic variables (gender, age). In addition, a history of previous COVID-19 infection was analysed. The normality of data was checked through Shapiro-Wilk test; mean ±SD was used to describe normally distributed and median (IQR) for skewed continuous data. Data are presented in both frequencies and percentages. Chi-square test was used to compare the frequencies of IgG antibodies with respect to age groups (either less than 50 years or those 50 years and above), gender and COVID-19 infection as variables.

Such studies are critical to evaluating vaccine efficacy, identifying high risk groups and necessity for spacing and number of boosters required for optimal impact. Humoral responses focused on IgG antibody responses to spike protein and RBD while T cell stimulated IFN γ responses were analyzed to CD4 and CD8 epitopes from Spike and other proteins. We show that cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens were observed in only one third of individuals without a history of COVID-19 infection. Notably, antigen-stimulated IFN-γ secretion was evident to - other than spike protein, demonstrating the effect of inactivated vaccines.</p><p id="P49">BBIBP-CorV vaccinations were rolled out in February 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) first in healthcare workers and then elderly in the Pakistani population. Our study subjects were healthy adults without any significant co-morbid conditions. We observed a significant trend towards increased IgG antibodies to Spike and RBD upto 24 weeks post-vaccination with BBIBP-CorV. Notably, the seropositivity levels were slightly higher to Spike protein compared to RBD. IgG to spike and RBD showed a significant positive correlation at each of the time intervals. We found that the relative levels of IgG antibodies were higher to spike as compared to RBD at both 4- and 8- weeks post-vaccination. Differences in antibody responses to Spike and RBD are likely reflective of the increased recognition of the number of epitopes present in Spike protein as compared with its RBD sub-unit, leading to differential recognition of epitopes. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 shares sequence homology with other coronaviruses as well as some of the proteins in commensal gut microbiota of humans and prime immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Antibodies to spike protein are also likely due to cross-reactive responses to other pathogens such as, human coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). We have previously observed higher titers of IgG Spike as compared with RBD in healthy uninfected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Cross-reactivity to Spike has been demonstrated in the context of antibody responses to full-length spike proteins using a peptide microarray system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>).</p><p id="P50">Full vaccination period is considered as 2 weeks or more after the second dose of a two-dose vaccine regimen. We found seropositivity to be 87.3% to Spike and 61.5% to RBD at 8 weeks post-vaccination. Our data differ from those reported in a study from Sri Lanka by Jeewandara <italic>et al</italic>. of BBIBP-CorV vaccinated group at 0, 4 and 6 weeks, which reported 95% seroconversion at 6 weeks and also found these associated with neutralizing activity to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). However, it correlates with the lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) antibody responses to BBIBP-CorV measured in dialysis patients in the UAE measured at 6 weeks of vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Also, with data from Pakistan that showed 78% of antibody responses to RBD in individuals vaccinated with BBIBP-CorV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).</p><p id="P51">BBIBP-CorV vaccination-induced IgG seropositivity to spike protein followed the same trend in those aged below 50 years as compared with those aged 50 years and above but seropositivity were significantly higher in the younger age group. Similarly, younger individuals had higher seropositivity to RBD than those who were older. These data correlate with those reported by Ferenci <italic>et al</italic>. from Hungary who showed that RBD-specific antibody responses after 2 doses of BBIBP-CorV were present in 90% of cases below 50 years but were reduced in those who were older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). BBIBP-CorV vaccination data from Sri Lanka also shows reduced immune responses in individuals aged 60 years and above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Such finding warrant a relook at boosters among different age group.</p><p id="P52">IgG to RBD is associated with neutralizing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). We found IgG to RBD measured in both COVID-19 convalescent and healthy individuals to be associated with neutralizing activity to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Aijaz et al. reported from Pakistan that antibodies to RBD after BBIBP-CorV vaccination were associated with neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx vaccinations have been shown to effectively induce IgG antibodies to spike and neutralizing antibodies, within 14 days of the second dose, or full vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). The slower rise in BBIBP-CorV -induced IgG to RBD we observed correlates with earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).</p><p id="P53">A possible explanation for the difference observed between early post-vaccination responses between younger and older age groups may be related to T independent B cell expansion (TI). T cell activation may occur earlier in the younger age group (&lt;50 years). T follicular helper cell independent expansion has been shown to occur in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice, resulting in high affinity antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Therefore, resident T cells may drive antigen specific B cell expansion. In the older age group, T cell activation is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) and therefore, the antibody response dramatically drops with removal of antigen antibody complexes. However, the T independent responses continue to produce IgG antibodies as likely indicated by slow rise of IgG antibodies to RBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>).</p><p id="P54">We found that seropositivity of IgG to spike and RBD in females was greater than males after vaccination. A comparison of antibody responses to ChAdOx1 has been shown to induce higher levels in females than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Sex-specific differences related to COVID-19 have been observed between males and females, with increased COVID-19 morbidity in males. Inflammatory cytokine levels shown to be raised in females than males (51-53).</p><p id="P55">Those with a history of COVID-19 displayed significantly greater higher antibody seropositivity than vaccinees without infection. This correlates with reports by Aijaz et al who observed that seropositivity rates from natural infection were greater than those induced by Sinopharm vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Antibody positivity protects against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection for at least 7 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). The IgG response to natural infection by SARS-CoV-2 is thought to last up to 10 months or more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Difference in dynamics of IgG responses with and without prior COVID-19 may be due to the re-activation of T cell responses present due to natural infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>), with cellular immunity activating B cell class switching leading to increased IgG production.</p><p id="P56">Another consideration that may impact the quality of neutralizing antibodies generated by BBIBP-CorV could be the effect of inactivation on the spike protein. Cai et al. have shown that the antigenic epitopes presented by the glycoprotein are dependent on its structural integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Therefore, virus inactivated vaccines may contain proteins that do not have the RBD domain in the open conformation required to serve as effective antigenic epitopes.</p><p id="P57">Vaccine efficacy studies of inactivated types such as, BBIBP-CorV and CoronaVac conducted in China, India, and Chile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>), shown that these are effective against preventing hospitalisations and severe COVID-19. In Pakistan, BBIBP-CorV vaccination was shown to reduce hospitalization, mortality and symptomatic COVID-19 in the older age group however, this was based on testing after 14 days of the second dose, or 6 weeks post-vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p><p id="P58">We did not observe any waning of antibodies to RBD. This differs from reports of waning humoral immune responses to BNT162b2 over 6 months in Israel demonstrated by decreased IgG levels and neutralizing antibodies over 3 months, accompanied by breakthrough infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). A case control study of vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants using BNT162b2 in Qatar also showed protective antibody levels to decrease after vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). A study in Sri Lanka showed a waning of BBIBP-CorV induced antibodies by 12 weeks after vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).</p><p id="P59">The absence of antibody waning may be a consequence of continued SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the community, boosting cross-reactive responses. The period studied was alpha and then delta variants were predominant leading to a peak in morbidity and mortality by June 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). Whilst BBIBP-CorV vaccination been shown to be effective in reducing hospitalization and symptomatic COVID-19, it is also shown that induced levels of IgG to RBD are lower than other vaccinations and therefore booster vaccinations are recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>).</p><p id="P60">T cell immunity is associated with long term memory responses and is the hallmark of protection induced by natural infections and vaccines. The T cell responses show durable and polyfunctional virus specific memory CD4 and CD8+ T cells in infected patients up to 8 months after infection, with specificity was observed to a range of SARS-CoV-2 antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>).</p><p id="P61">We used a whole blood based assay to measure cellular immunity. Previous reports have shown that for measuring cellular immunity to SARS-COV-2, it is effective to detect IFN-γ to different Nucleocapsid, Membrane, Spike proteins but the spike antigen was the most efficient at detecting T cell specific response in COVID19 cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). The commercial assay we used has been shown to effectively determine T cell responses to BNT2162b2 mRNA vaccination responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). Preliminary evaluation of QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>) after mRNA vaccination showed that there was a strong cellular response is seen after the first dose, then does wane after 2 months. Enhanced cellular immunity in those with COVID infection history and vaccination has previously been shown to be the case for mRNA vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>). The IFN-γ release assay can be used to measures memory responses in COVID-19 convalescent individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>).</p><p id="P62">We show here that only one third of individuals had T cell reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens 24 weeks after vaccination with BBIBP-CorV. This was doubled in individuals with a prior history of COVID-19. Earlier reports from Sri Lanka that Sinopharm vaccination elicited a strong cellular response after 4 weeks of the first dose of vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). However, there is currently no data on subsequent cellular immunity after a 6 month period.</p><p id="P63">Importantly, in our participants, we observed the strongest cellular reactivity to antigens of the extended set which included Membrane and Envelope proteins in addition to Spike antigens. This trend was evident in individuals with and without prior COVID-19. This highlights the broad nature of T cell responses to inactivated vaccines such as BBIBP-CorV.</p><p id="P64">Our study has some limitations. The vaccination rollout was rapid and on an emergency basis in our study population, healthcare worker and older age group populations. Due to the time taken for regulatory and ethical approvals for the study at the time of the urgent roll-out of BBIBP-CorV vaccination in Pakistan, we could not unfortunately determine baseline data exactly for the subjects in the BBIBP-CorV vaccine study. However, this study population is similar to the one in which we investigated seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in an uninfected healthcare associated cohort tested prior to vaccinations (conducted March to October 2020). We had observed that seropositivity to spike to be 35% and 21.3% to RBD in our healthy uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). As, many vaccinees here belonged to the larger study we expect that their baseline seroprevalence would be comparable. Neutralizing assays against SARS-CoV-2 were not conducted in this cohort. However, we have shown previously that sera samples positive for IgG to RBD had neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>). Therefore, IgG to RBD would be associated with greater protection against disease. We were unable to sample each study subject multiple times during the study period and for some we only have one or two serial samples available.</p></sec><sec id="S19" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P65">Our study provides the important immunological insights as to the effect of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine type, BBIBP-CorV from South Asia. It informs on dynamics and magnitude of antibody responses to vaccination. It also informs on cellular immunity to vaccination and the variability of IFNγ-reactivity to different SARS-CoV-2 antigens, Spike as compared with additional genomic determinants. We observed an age-dependent effect with reduced humoral and cellular responses in those aged 50 years and over, supporting a role for booster vaccinations in this group. The effect of COVID-19 infection immunity after vaccination was evident. It also guides that monitoring vaccination induced immunity to vaccines that include genome wide antigens other than Spike would need to be different from that for Spike mRNA or vector based formulations. Hence, recommendations for COVID-19 vaccinations should be made in the context of local immunity and ongoing transmission in the population.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by the Provost’s Academic Priorities Fund, Aga Khan University.
