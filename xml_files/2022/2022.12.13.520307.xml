This highlights the need for broad-spectrum antivirals to further combat COVID-19 and to be prepared for a new pandemic with a (re-)emerging coronavirus. An interesting target for antiviral drug development is the fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes, a crucial early step in the replication cycle of enveloped viruses. In this study, we explored the use of cellular electrical impedance (CEI) to quantitatively monitor morphological changes in real time, resulting from cell-cell fusion elicited by SARS-CoV-2 spike. The impedance signal in CEI-quantified cell-cell fusion correlated with the expression level of SARS-CoV-2 spike in transfected HEK293T cells. For antiviral assessment, we validated the CEI assay with the fusion inhibitor EK1 and measured a concentration-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike mediated cell-cell fusion (IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.13 μM). In addition, CEI was used to confirm the fusion inhibitory activity of the carbohydrate-binding plant lectin UDA against SARS-CoV-2 (IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.55 μM), which complements prior in-house profiling activities. Finally, we explored the utility of CEI in quantifying the fusogenic potential of mutant spike proteins and in comparing the fusion efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. In summary, we demonstrate that CEI is a powerful and sensitive technology that can be applied to studying the fusion process of SARS-CoV-2 and to screening and characterizing fusion inhibitors in a label-free and non-invasive manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cellular electrical impedance</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>cell-cell fusion</kwd><kwd>spike</kwd><kwd>entry inhibitor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Abbreviations</title><glossary><def-list><def-item><term>ACE2</term><def><p id="P3">angiotensin-converting enzyme 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEI</term><def><p id="P4">cellular electrical impedance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="P5">cell index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COVID-19</term><def><p id="P6">coronavirus disease 2019</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTS</term><def><p id="P7">cathepsin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FP</term><def><p id="P8">fusion peptide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MFI</term><def><p id="P9">mean fluorescence intensity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RBD</term><def><p id="P10">receptor-binding domain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SARS-CoV-2</term><def><p id="P11">severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>S</term><def><p id="P12">spike</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TMPRSS2</term><def><p id="P13">transmembrane serine protease 2</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P14">Despite the successful COVID-19 vaccination campaign, we are still unable to control the spread of new variants and/or prevent re-infections. This underlines the need to continue with the development of effective antiviral compounds against SARS-CoV-2. An appealing target for drug development is the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 viral envelope with host cell membranes, an essential early step in the coronavirus life cycle.</p><p id="P15">Entry of SARS-CoV-2 in target cells involves several sequential steps that are mediated by the spike (S) protein that drives the fusion process by a series of coordinated conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The S protein is cleaved into two subunits: the S1 subunit, which recognizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through binding via its receptor-binding domain (RBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), and the S2 subunit, which harbors the fusion machinery. Generally, these two subunits are post-translationally cleaved at the S1-S2 site of the S protein by the host serine protease furin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), however, it is still debatable if the Omicron S protein is less cleavable by furin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). After binding to human ACE2, a transmembrane receptor that is highly expressed in lung epithelial cells, a second cleavage event at the S2’ site must take place to render the S protein fully fusion-competent. For the initial SARS-CoV-2 variants (e.g., the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain), S2’ cleavage occurs preferably at the cell surface by type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Alternative to the furin/TMPRSS2 proteolytic activation, SARS-CoV-2 can enter via endocytosis with cathepsin B or L (CTSB/L) cleaving the S protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), an entry route proposed for the recent Omicron variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Either way, receptor binding and S2’ cleavage result in the formation of an elongated intermediate spike protein with its hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP) exposed, followed by the insertion of the activated fusion protein into the target host membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The subsequent collapse of the metastable spike intermediate into an energetically stable (low energy) hairpin-like configuration, the so-called 6-helix bundle complex of the S2 trimer, brings the viral and cellular membrane in close proximity for their merger and the completion of membrane fusion. Finally, the viral genome is released into the cytosol of the host cell to initiate the replication cycle.</p><p id="P16">Cellular electrical impedance (CEI) is a label-free, quantitative analytical method used to study cell morphological changes in real time. When an electrical circuit is applied to a cell monolayer grown in microtiter plates embedded with gold electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), the continuous sweeping of non-invasive alternating current (AC) voltages over a predefined set of frequencies allows us to measure the impedance (Z) on this current. Cell Index (CI) is a quantitative measure of the status of the cells in an electrode-containing well and is based on the measured cell-electrode impedance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). When cells are attached to and spread out over the electrodes, they act as insulating particles that will resist or impede the flow of the current. As a result, the impedance of the system (and its CI value) will increase when the cell monolayer becomes more confluent. On the other hand, when cells of a confluent cell culture die and lyse, the disruption of the cell monolayer facilitates current flow, which translates in a decrease in impedance over time. CEI has gained popularity in recent years as a method to monitor dynamic responses of cells. Among other areas of research, CEI has proven effective for cytotoxicity measurements and signalling pathway studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), and is recently gaining popularity for virological studies as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). For instance, CEI has been proposed as a generic screening method for fusion inhibitors targeting respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), dengue virus (DENV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which are representatives of three viral fusion classes within the enveloped viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Since the fusion of viral and cellular membranes induces changes in cell morphology, we explored the feasibility of CEI to monitor the fusion process of SARS-CoV-2 in real time in a cell-to-cell fusion format. In this work we (i) successfully optimized and validated an impedance-based fusion assay to quantifiable measure SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion, (ii) evaluated potential SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors, and, (iii) compared the fusogenic potential of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs).</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S4"><title>SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion</title><p id="P18">In previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 viral entry can be mimicked by a cell-cell fusion system in which acceptor cells express the cellular human ACE2 receptor and donor cells the complementary viral spike protein. In our current work, the lung epithelial cell line A549 (stably transduced with human ACE2 to elevate the endogenous receptor level) was chosen as acceptor cell, whereas spike-transfected HEK293T cells were selected as donor cells because of the high plasmid transfection efficiency of the latter. Co-cultivation of both cell types results in fusion of the cells with the generation of multinucleated giant cells, the so-called syncytia that can be microscopically observed.</p><p id="P19">To better visualize this cell-cell fusion event, we previously designed and reported a split neon green assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Real time microscopy can be used to monitor the fusion event (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary movie 1</xref>) and to evaluate the inhibitory effect of a fusion inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, as the read-out of this assay is the fluorescence of the neongreen protein, a certain delay has to be taken into account between the initial cell-cell membrane fusion and the ultimate formation of an active fluorescent protein, which largely depends on the intermingling of the cytosolic content of both cells and the migration and assembly of both neongreen subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>; compare 3h with 12h condition for untreated spike-transfected cells). Furthermore, when a single spike-transfected cell fuses with multiple ACE2-expressing cells (or vice versa), the fluorescent signal might not accurately reflect the number of fusion events because of a possible imbalance in the amount of the two neongreen subunits in the cytosol of the multinucleated cell. Therefore, an alternative fusion assay based on cellular electrical impedance (CEI) was explored.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cellular electrical impedance as a measure for SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion</title><p id="P20">In order to measure CEI, experiments are performed in specialized impedance E-plates, i.e., microtiter plates with embedded golden microelectrodes. A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup> cells are first seeded into E-plates to obtain a confluent cell monolayer. When monitoring the impedance signal of this growing monolayer, a slow but steady increase in the cell index (CI) was observed during the initial adherence phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, grey line). At 24h post plating, the A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup> cells are overlayed with HEK293T cells either transfected with empty vector (mock) or with a vector encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; phase #1). Cell-cell fusion is then triggered by the interaction of the viral fusion glycoproteins at the HEK293T cell surface with ACE2 receptor molecules on a neighbouring A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup> cell. The CI value of the A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup> cells exposed to mock-transfected control HEK293T cells slowly increases (because of residual cell proliferation and/or maturation of the cell layer, <italic>i.e.,</italic> more compact cell-to-cell contacts) until a nearly steady state is reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, grey line). However, when spike-transfected HEK293T cells are added on top of the A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup> cells, fusion already manifests within a few hours of cell overlay and the CI value sharply increases as a result of the generated syncytia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, blue line). When cells fuse, the electrical current can no longer pass in between them because of a decrease in cell-cell borders and tight junctions in the cell monolayer. This CI increase correlates nicely with the formation of syncytia as determined by microscopy (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary movie 2</xref>). Once a maximum in cell-cell fusion is reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, blue line; phase #2), the CI value starts to decline because of the instability of the multinucleated cell membrane, and the subsequent cell lysis and destruction of the cell monolayer. At 24h post overlay, the cell monolayer is completely destroyed and the CI has returned to baseline level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, blue line; phase #3).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Optimization of CEI for SARS-CoV-2 spike induced cell-cell fusion</title><p id="P21">In a first set of optimization experiments, different parameters of our CEI assay were investigated to reach optimal fusion and to obtain higher CI values. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, the kinetics of cell-cell fusion depended on the ratio of acceptor:donor cells. Generally, an excess of spike-transfected donor cells enhanced the fusion process. An acceptor:donor cell ratio of 1:1 resulted in a nice response and was selected for further experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, blue curve). As expected, cell-cell fusion and the related impedance response relied on the complementary expression of ACE2 and S. This was evidenced by the absence of fusion either when A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup> cells were combined with mock-transfected HEK293T cells, or when native A549 control cells (with low endogenous ACE2 levels) were combined with S-expressing HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, trypsinization of the transfected HEK293T cells (as compared to collection of the cells by simply resuspending the easy detaching cell monolayer) had a positive outcome on cell-cell fusion, with a faster and more uniformily response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). Lowering the incubation temperature of the HEK293T cells from 37 to 34°C during the spike biogenesis after transfection did not impact the initial phase of fusion but appears to somewhat reduce the maximum response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, the expression level of spike on the HEK293T cells was a crucial determinant for CI signal. Cell surface levels of spike not only affected the amplitude of CI but also the kinetics of cell-cell fusion in a concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>). Although TMPRSS2 has been reported to be an important cellular protease for the activation of S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), in the context of a cell-cell fusion assay transfection of the A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup> cells for additional exogenous expression of TMPRSS2 was not a prerequisite to obtain fusion, as also seen by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). However, enhanced expression of TMPRSS2 seemed to accelerate and amplify the fusion response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Validation of CEI as a quantifiable method of SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion</title><p id="P22">We next explored if our CEI-based fusion assay could be implemented for the evaluation of fusion inhibitors and the profiling of entry inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2. First, we examined the reported SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitor EK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), a peptide that mimics the Heptad Repeat domain 2 (HR2) of the viral S protein and interferes with the formation of the 6-helix bundle hairpin complex during fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Administration of EK1 inhibited cell-cell fusion, with a nearly complete protection at 10 μM concentration (92% reduction in max CI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), and in a concentration-dependent manner (IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.13 μM; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>), thus, validating our CEI-based fusion assay for the analysis of fusion inhibitors. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of a S-neutralizing antibody (Ab) that binds to the RBD of S (Ab R001) was rather limited and depended strongly on the intrinsic efficiency and kinetics of the experimental cell-cell fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). Even a saturating Ab concentration of 10 μg/ml, that completely prevents virus entry of authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells, as shown earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), reduced the fusion response by only 45% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, when Ab R001 was tested in an additional experiment in which cell-cell fusion occurred more efficiently and rapidly because of exogenous TMPRSS2 (as evidenced by the CI response), no reduction in maximum impedance response could be recorded and only a delay in the fusion kinetics was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). Also, when a peptide that represents the RBD of S was tested in our fusion assay, a comparable shift in the CI peak was observed, presumably because of a competition between soluble RBD and cellular-expressed S for the interaction with ACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>; red curve). These data suggest that attachment inhibitors are less potent in the prevention of the fusion event, and indicate that a CEI-based fusion assay might distinguish between fusion inhibitors and attachment inhibitors. Of note, in the absence of S expressing HEK293T cells, CEI detected some cell morphological changes in the A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup> monolayer because of RBD binding to the ACE2 receptor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>; green curve).</p><p id="P23">In a previous study, we investigated the antiviral potential of the plant lectin UDA against SARS-CoV-2 and reported a profound inhibitory effect of UDA on virus entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Evaluation of UDA in our CEI assay clearly demonstrated deceleration and inhibition of S-induced fusion in a concentration-dependent way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.55 μM, that correlates well with its reported antiviral potency against authentic SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). In line with that report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), UDA pretreatment of the ACE2<sup>+</sup> acceptor cells (followed by compound wash-out) had little impact on cell-cell fusion whereas pre-incubation of the S-expressing cells with UDA (followed by compound wash-out) profoundly protected the fusion event (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), confirming our observation that UDA binds to the glycosylated viral S protein rather than the cellular receptor.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>CEI to analyze the fusogenic potential of SARS-CoV-2 spike variants</title><p id="P24">One of the advantages of our CEI assay is the flexibility and easy-to-adapt format of the protocol. For example, mutants of SARS-CoV-2 spike can be easily designed and used for the transfection of the HEK293T cells. Hence, with CEI spikes from different SARS-CoV-2 VOCs can be compared for their fusogenic potential. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, spikes carrying the D614G mutation, as present in all variants since early 2020 (Nextstrain clade 20A and its descendants), retained a similar fusogenic efficiency as compared to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain S. In contrast, the Omicron VOC circulating in 2022 has been reported to possess a reduced fusogenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Interestingly, our CEI assay also confirmed the reduced fusion of Omicron S (BA.1 variant) as compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), as evidenced by a slower and attenuated impedance response. This reduced fusogenic potential of Omicron was also observed when an excess of spike-expressing plasmid was used for the transfection of the HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). In fact, the reduced fusion potential of Omicron as compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 could not directly be linked to attenuated spike expression, as evidenced by the comparable levels of S protein that could be detected by flow cytometry on the surface of HEK293T cells transfected with similar amounts (2.5 μg) of plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Finally, we used CEI to analyze different SARS-CoV-2 spike glycosylation deletions to complement previous work on the plant lectin UDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, a fusion assay with 3 different double-glycosylation mutants confirmed the preserved activity of UDA against spike variants with depleted glycans in the S2 unit, indicating that removal of N-glycosylation sites in the S2 subunit will not result in SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants for UDA. Of note, the difference in the CI amplitude that was observed between the untreated S-transfected control samples of the different N-glycosylation mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>) was simply related to different levels of S expression on the HEK293T cells, as verified by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4D</xref>), presumably because N-glycosylation depletion affected S protein stability and subsequent cell surface expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">In this study, we have implemented cell-based electrical impedance to measure SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion in real time and have demonstrated that CEI can be used to characterize fusion inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we have shown its feasibility to analyze the fusogenic properties of spike proteins from different circulating SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. The technique measures the kinetics of the fusion process in real-time, in a label-free and in a non-invasive format, allowing further down-stream analysis of the samples (e.g., qPCR or Western blot analysis). Although CEI does not require expensive detection reagents or artificial detection systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), specialized microtiter plates embedded with gold electrodes are needed for the experimental set-up, which may affect the cost of this alternative fusion assay. A big advantage of CEI as compared with other cell-cell fusion detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., split neongreen; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) is the real-time quantification of membrane fusion, which does not depend on the intermingling of the cytosolic content of the fused cells and the formation of an active fluorescent protein or translation of a reporter enzyme (e.g., luciferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>)). Generally, S induced cell-cell fusion already manifests within the first hours of cell overlay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>; syncytia visible at 3h), but needs several more hours of incubation to obtain a quantifiable reporter signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>; fluorescent signal at 12h). In contrast, with CEI even a small delay or minor reduction in the cell-cell fusion process can be monitored for inhibitors or mutant spike proteins.</p><p id="P27">Routine antiviral screens often rely on phenotypic assays, such as the reduction in virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) or plaque formation, and generally make use of a microscopic, luminescent, fluorescent, or colorimetric readout. Some of the disadvantages of these techniques are that can be slow (multiple days), are typically time consuming, require multiple handling steps and rely on optimal endpoint selection in order to achieve good assay quality. CEI offers a valuable addition to this array of antiviral methods with real-time measurements and an objective readout. Furthermore, CEI is able to measure nanoscale morphological changes and is thus a more sensitive tool to analyze cellular processes such as highly dynamic membrane fusion. Also, a CEI-based fusion assay can be performed with fusion protein-expressing cells as an alternative to authentic virus, allowing antiviral analysis of entry inhibitors at a lower biosafety level, which might be of particular interest for pathogens that require BSL3 facilities.</p><p id="P28">Entry of viruses into host target cells is an attractive target for antiviral intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Inhibiting the virus before it enters the host cell, e.g., by targeting the viral fusion machinery, is a potent antiviral strategy that has been successful for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Furthermore, as these membrane fusion processes are critical for viral infection, targets are often well conserved across different viral families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), suggesting the potential for developing pan-viral broad spectrum inhibitors.</p><p id="P29">Here, we exploited CEI to analyze the activity of fusion inhibitors. In our comparative study of entry inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2, we observed differential potency in our CEI-based cell-cell fusion assay between an attachment inhibitor (Ab R001) and a fusion inhibitor (EK1). The limited fusion inhibitory effect of the S-binding R001 might be related to the excessive expression of the spike protein on the surface of transfected HEK293T cells, which greatly differs from the number of fusion proteins on the viral envelop in antiviral CPE-based cellular assays. In that perspective the concentration Ab (10 μg/ml) used in our cell-cell fusion experiments was most likely suboptimal. Accordingly, Zhao <italic>et al.</italic> observed for anti-spike monoclonal antibodies 15-20 fold less activity against cell-cell fusion as compared to pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). In addition, in a recent reported luciferase-based reporter gene fusion assay for SARS-CoV-2, a concentration of 28 μg/ml Ab R001 resulted in approximately 60-70% inhibition of cell-cell fusion, thus, still no complete protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), however, the spike-expressing cells were pre-incubated with the Ab before the overlay. Thus, it seems that attachment inhibitors have less opportunity to prevent the initiation of the fusion process once the spike proteins are being triggered by ACE2. Nevertheless, antivirals that interfere with the conformational changes and refolding of the S2 subunit have a stronger inhibitory effect on membrane fusion and can be clearly identified through CEI. Our data also indicated that expression of TMPRSS2 is not a prerequisite to obtain S-mediated cell-cell fusion. In a CEI experimental setting, other host proteases, such as matrix metalloproteases might activate the SARS-Cov-2 S glycoprotein during the process of syncytium formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Interestingly, CEI can also be employed to study the fusogenic properties of spike proteins from different SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. In line with several reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), with our CEI based cell-cell fusion assay we also measured a reduced fusion activity for the spike protein of the Omicron BA.1 variant. Although subsequent flow cytometric analysis of the spike levels on the surface of the transfected HEK293T cells did not indicate an attenuated protein expression for Omicron (as compared to the original Wuhan-Hu-1), flow cytometry does not provide details on the amount of processed (S1/S2 cleaved) spike or the trimeric nature of the SARS-CoV-2 fusion protein. As we demonstrated that the cell-cell fusion process is strongly depending on the amount of wild-type spike protein expressed on the surface of the HEK293T cells, the proteolytic state of S will undoubtedbly contribute to the efficiency of the fusion process.</p><p id="P31">In summary, we have developed an assay that makes use of cell-based electrical impedance to monitor in real time cell-cell fusion for SARS-CoV-2, which provides a powerful tool to investigate specific cell membrane fusion events. The CEI technique can add valuable information on the fusion process of circulating enveloped viruses and on the mode of action of new antivirals. As such, CEI can support profiling efforts of novel potent fusion inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2, and in turn can help in the development of next generation inhibitors with improved antiviral activity.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P32">Human Embryonic Kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells (Cat.

Briefly, RTCA E-plate VIEW 16 plates with embedded golden electrodes (#300600880, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used for the experiments. First a blank measurement of a sensor E-Plate VIEW 16 PET was performed (only medium). This was followed by the addition of 15,000 A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup> cells (in growth medium supplemented with 2% FBS) to each well. E-plates were placed at room temperature for 15 min and then transferred to the xCELLigence RTCA instrument, located in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The attachment and overnight growth of the cells was monitored (measurement every 20 min). Cell adherence and growth result in an increase in CI followed by a flattening of the curve when the cells reach confluency. In parallel, HEK293T cells (400,000 cells per well in growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS) were transfected with an S-expressing plasmid. Following overnight incubation, a short CEI normalisation measurement (5 consecutive measurements, every 5 s) was performed on the A549 cell monolayer. In parallel, spike-expressing transfected HEK293T cells were collected, digested with 0.25% trypsin, washed, resuspended, counted and administered to the A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup> cells at 15,000 cells per well (= overlay step), simultaneously with the test compounds or vehicle control. To quantify spike-independent CI changes resulting from the overlay, an equal number of HEK293T cells mock-transfected with empty vector is added to the A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup> cells instead.

Spike-dependent fusion was calculated by subtracting the CI values of A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup>:HEK293T.empty_vector overlay (spike independent) from the CI changes of the A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup>:HEK293T.spike overlay (spike-dependent + independent). This results in a baseline-corrected normalized CI measure. The maximal CI change of the A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup>:HEK293T.spike overlay (of the baseline corrected CI value) in the absence of compound, is then set to 100% and the maximal CI change of the conditions with compound are reported relative to this value.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Importance</title></caption><p>Despite the success of the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, new variants of the virus are still emerging and spreading, underlining the need for additional effective antiviral countermeasures. An interesting antiviral target for enveloped viruses is the fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes, a crucial early step in the life cycle of coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2. Here, we present a sensitive impedance-based method to monitor in real-time cell-cell fusion elicited by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. With this technique we can profile entry inhibitors and determine the inhibitory potential of fusion inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, with cellular electrical impedance we can evaluate the fusogenic properties of new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Overall, the impedance technology adds valuable information on the fusion process of circulating coronaviruses and helps unravel the mode of action of new antivirals, opening new avenues for the development of next generation fusion inhibitors with improved antiviral activity.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>SARS-CoV-2 spike-transfected cells mimic viral envelope for fusion with ACE2<sup>+</sup> target cell membrane.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the fusion process for SARS-CoV-2 and a potential target for fusion inhibitors.

(<bold>B</bold>) Schematic representation of a split neongreen fusion assay (figure adapted from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>)). A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup> cells (transfected to express the first 10 betasheets of neongreen) were overlayed with HEK293T cells co-transfected with a plasmid encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a plasmid encoding the 11<sup>th</sup> betasheet of neongreen. Only cell-cell fusion of an A549 cell with a HEK293T cell will result in the assembly of a functional neongreen protein and give a green fluorescence signal as the former expresses spike and the latter human ACE2. Light microscopic picture shows fused cells with neongeen expression (20x magnification). (<bold>C</bold>) Same as in (B). A549.ACE2<sup>+</sup> cells were overlayed with HEK293T cells either transfected (TF) with an empty vector (left panels; mock-TF), or with Wuhan-Hu-1 S protein and left untreated (middle) or treated with the fusion inhibitor EK1 (2 μM; right panels). Light microscopic pictures were taken at 3 and 12 hours post overlay (20x magnification). Note that cell-cell fusion in the untreated spike-transfected condition is already visible at 3h post overlay but that neongreen fluorescence is still absent.
