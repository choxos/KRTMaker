The minimal RISC consists of an ARGONAUTE (AGO) protein bound to a small non-coding RNA that guides RISC to complementary target RNAs by base pairing. In turn, RISCs repress gene expression sequence-specifically using a variety of mechanisms operating at either transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. The exact properties of RISCs in these contexts are determined by several factors including the identity of the AGO protein, RISC co-factors, and the degree of small RNA:target RNA base pairing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In animals, two distinct phylogenetic clades of AGO proteins exist. The Piwi clade is primarily used for silencing of transposable elements in the germline via Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The Ago clade carries out endogenous gene regulation, in the main via microRNAs (miRNAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, and, in particular in invertebrates, basic antiviral defense via virus-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Plants encode only Ago-clade proteins, and use several distinct, functionally specialized AGO proteins. For example, the AGO4/6/9 clade binds to siRNAs from transposable elements to form RISCs that affect transcriptional silencing by directing DNA methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. miRNAs mediate post-transcriptional regulation via cleavage or translational repression of mRNAs mainly in association with AGO1 with additional specialized, yet important, roles of AGO2, AGO7 and AGO10 (reviewed in [6]). Finally, antiviral RNA interference is carried out by AGO1, AGO2 and AGO5, and, potentially, by several additional AGO proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">All AGO proteins consist of four separate domains called N, PAZ, MID and Piwi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. They fold into a two-lobed structure in the small RNA-bound state with N and PAZ together in one lobe and MID/Piwi in the other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The ends of the small RNA are tethered in dedicated binding pockets in the MID and PAZ domains such that the 5’-end is bound to MID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and the 3’-end to PAZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. PAZ and MID are connected by a long linker sequence called L2 that also interacts extensively with the small RNA backbone and with other AGO domains in the small RNA-bound state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The assembly of RISC by incorporation of a small RNA into AGO, referred to as “RISC loading”, is a critical event in all RNA silencing pathways. This process requires the Hsp40-Hsp70-Hsp90 chaperone assembly line in such a way that association of unloaded AGO with chaperones extends the dwell time of encounters between AGO and small RNA duplexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The chaperone assistance vastly increases the probability of a small RNA duplex:AGO encounter to lead to formation of a long-lived AGO:small RNA duplex intermediate that subsequently matures into RISC with a single-stranded RNA by duplex unwinding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, sometimes requiring passenger strand cleavage catalyzed by AGO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The loading process constitutes a key regulatory point in RNA silencing. First, it is rate-limiting for biogenesis of many miRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Second, in many organisms including mammals, <italic>C. elegans, Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, it is decisive for the stability of AGO proteins. Small RNA-bound AGO (RISC) is stable, but unloaded AGO is rapidly degraded <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, unless it exists as an Hsp90 complex <italic>en route</italic> to loading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Although it is clear that both the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and selective autophagy are involved in turnover of unloaded AGO both in plants and animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, two key questions remain poorly elucidated: (1) What are the molecular determinants that distinguish loaded from unloaded AGO to allow selective degradation of unloaded AGO? (2) What is the biological importance of eliminating unloaded AGO?</p><p id="P6">The first question has been approached in studies of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> miRNA effector Ago1, whose unloaded form is ubiquitinated in the L2 region by the RING finger protein Iruka<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. This finding highlights L2 as a region of importance for distinction between loaded and unloaded AGO. It is, however, unlikely to be easily generalized to other systems, because the site of ubiquitination is non-conserved, and, in particular, is adjacent to a <italic>Dm</italic>Ago1-specific deletion in L2 compared to other miRNA-interacting AGO proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>). The second question remains unresolved, but it is widely assumed that avoidance of loading of RNA degradation fragments into AGO that may initiate unwanted RISC-mediated repression or compete with <italic>bona fide</italic> miRNAs for AGO binding is a major driver of mechanisms targeting unloaded AGO for proteolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. This hypothesis is indirectly supported by several lines of evidence, although clear observations of ectopic or reduced RISC function upon inactivation of factors involved in AGO degradation have not been reported. For example, mutation of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> F-box protein FBW2 restores steady-state levels of an AGO1 mutant protein predicted to have a destabilized fold of the PAZ domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. It is, however, unclear whether FBW2 targets AGO1 directly, and whether it specifically mediates degradation of unloaded, but functional AGO1, or plays a more general role in chaperone-assisted protein degradation elicited as a consequence of partial unfolding of the PAZ domain in the point mutant analyzed. In addition, mutations in key components of miRNA biogenesis had to be introduced to observe relatively minor changes in populations of AGO1-loaded small RNAs upon inactivation of <italic>FBW2</italic>, and no causal relationships between illegitimate siRNAs bound to AGO1 and phenotypes could be established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Similarly, the efficiency of miRNA-guided target mRNA repression was only modestly reduced in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells upon depletion of Iruka<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">In this study, we use the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> miRNA effector AGO1 to define a region of crucial importance in the distinction between eukaryotic AGO proteins in the RNA-bound and in the free state. We show that the N-coil, a small, highly conserved linear region towards the N-terminus of AGO1, yet part of the MID-Piwi lobe in the loaded conformation, is preferentially accessible in unloaded AGO1. Furthermore, the N-coil functions as a direct binding site for the autophagy cargo receptor ATG8 INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (ATI1). This highlights the N-coil as a key determinant of the distinction between loaded and unloaded AGO1, and, given its conservation and structural properties, probably in other eukaryotic AGO proteins in both Ago and Piwi clades.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Definition and properties of structural units of the N-terminal part of AGO1</title><p id="P8"><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (At) AGO1 has a 176-aa extension at its N-terminus, in addition to the canonical N-PAZ-MID-PIWI domains found in all AGO proteins. Because this extension is predicted to be an intrinsically disordered region (IDR, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>), we term this part of AGO1 the N-IDR. The N-IDR is followed by a 14-aa region (F177-K190) that we previously termed the N-coil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The N-coil is of interest for a number of reasons: (i) Despite its location in the N-terminal part of AGO in sequence, it is part of the MID-PIWI lobe in structures of AGO-small RNA complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). (ii) The N-coil assumes an extended conformation with no secondary structure, yet has low structural flexibility, and reaches across the width of the entire AGO-small RNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). (iii) Residues in the conserved N-coil are structurally fixed by numerous inter-domain interactions in the AGO-small RNA complex, and the N-coil interface is only moderately hydrophobic with several residues calculated to prefer a hydrophilic environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). For example, R182 participates in a salt bridge deep inside of the PIWI domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), perhaps suggesting that the conformation of the N-coil revealed in the crystal structures of AGO-small RNA complexes is but one of several possible conformations of this region. (iv) The N-coil is functionally important because two mutations in this region have been recovered in forward screens in plants: <italic>ago1-38</italic> (G186R) that exhibits relatively weak loss of function, and shows lower abundance in membrane compartments compared to wild type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, and <italic>ago1-55</italic> (G189E) that exhibits stronger loss of AGO1 function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. The N-coil is followed by two β-strands and the globular N-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The key functional importance of the N-coil and the connecting β-strands is underscored by the observation that substitution of this part of the catalytically inactive human Ago1 by the corresponding part of the catalytically active Ago2 is sufficient to confer activity on an Ago1 variant containing all four residues required for coordination of the two catalytic metal ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Despite these indications of functional importance of the N-coil region, the precise functions of the entire N-coil-Globular N (NcGN) part of AGO proteins remain ill-defined. Functions of the globular N-domain itself are particularly poorly understood, although the absence of mutations recovered in this part in forward genetic screens reporting on siRNA/miRNA function in plants hints that its functions are not central to the core biochemical properties such as small RNA binding and target RNA cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The N-coil-Globular N part of AGO1 interacts with multiple factors implicated in regulated proteolysis and functions as a degron</title><p id="P9">To reveal functions of the poorly understood NcGN part of Arabidopsis AGO1, we first conducted yeast two-hybrid screens with NcGN as a bait against three prey cDNA libraries. This effort yielded 15 potential AGO1-NcGN interactors, all validated in the two-hybrid system by isolation of the prey plasmid and re-transformation with AGO1 NcGN bait into the reporter strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). Several candidate interactors had predicted biochemical functions related to regulated proteolysis via either the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway or via autophagy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). This also included the two intrinsically disordered, transmembrane autophagy cargo receptor proteins ATI1 and ATI2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> that were previously shown to be implicated in degradation of AGO1 via the poleroviral RNAi suppressor P0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. The trend towards protein degradation was not exclusive, however, as other interactors were also recovered, including Hsp90, a protein phosphatase, and vesicle trafficking and membrane contact proteins (VAP27, NTMC2T5.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). Nonetheless, since “Regulated proteolysis” was the clearest common functional category among candidate interactors, we carried out pulse labeling experiments with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and NcGN-YFP fusions stably expressed in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> to see whether the NcGN in isolation could cause rapid degradation. When lines with similar YFP steady state levels were compared, the synthesis rate (and hence also the degradation rate) of the NcGN-YFP fusion protein was indeed 6.6-fold higher than YFP alone, demonstrating that the NcGN is subject to rapid proteolysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 4</xref>). We note that recognition of NcGN by the chaperone-assisted protein degradation machinery as a consequence of its detachment from normally interacting domains in native AGO1 is unlikely, because the Gal4<sup>BD</sup>-NcGN fusion protein was easily detectable in yeast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 4</xref>), and was sufficiently stable for yeast two-hybrid analyses to be carried out. Thus, we focused our attention on the role of the NcGN in regulated proteolysis of the AGO1 protein.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Most candidate NcGN interactors are specific for AGO1</title><p id="P10">The AGO protein family contains 10 paralogs in Arabidopsis, of which AGO4 is distantly related while AGO10 is very closely related to AGO1. We therefore first used the NcGNs of AGO4 and AGO10 to test whether a subset of the identified candidate interactors (ATI1, ATI2, AUF1, AUF3, UBI, HUB1, PP2C and Hsp90-3, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>) were specific to the NcGN of AGO1 or whether they represented generic AGO NcGN binding proteins. Seven of the candidates (ATI1, ATI2, AUF1, AUF3, UBI, HUB1, PP2C) showed yeast two-hybrid interactions preferentially or exclusively with the NcGN of AGO1, while one (Hsp90-3) interacted with the NcGN of all three proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 5</xref>). These results indicate that most of the candidate interactors isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening are specific to AGO1. We also note that the more general AGO NcGN interaction observed with Hsp90-3 is consistent with the involvement of Hsp90 in the loading of different AGO proteins across organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The N-coil is of special importance for interactions via the NcGN</title><p id="P11">Since two mutations with functional impact have been identified in the N-coil of AGO1 (G186R, G189E) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, we tested whether the 14-aa N-coil may play a role in binding to some of the interactors. We initially screened the interactors for ability to interact with the NcGN carrying the G186R mutation. Surprisingly, this point mutation in the N-coil resulted in strongly reduced interaction with most candidates as measured by β-galactosidase activity originating from <italic>lacZ</italic> expressed under UASGal control in the reporter strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Indeed, of five proteins tested (ATI1, ATI2, TCTP, AUF1 and Hsp90) only Hsp90 and AUF1 showed clear interaction upon deletion of the N-coil (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 6</xref>). On the other hand, with the exception of Hsp90, the N-coil was not sufficient for interaction with any candidate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 6</xref>). Because these results point to a special importance of the 14-aa N-coil in several protein-protein interactions, we focus the remainder of the study on defining the properties of the N-coil that underlie its importance in protein-protein interactions involving AGO1. To this end, we chose the NcGN-mediated interaction with the transmembrane ATI1 and ATI2 proteins as our model system, and focused on the IDRs of those proteins, because they define their cytoplasmic part<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Furthermore, conditions for their heterologous expression and purification have been established <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Mapping of residues important for ATI1/ATI2 interaction across the entire NcGN</title><p id="P12">To identify amino acid residues in the AGO1 NcGN required for ATI1/2 interaction, we first inspected alignments between AGO1 orthologues from many different plant species and between <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AGO1 and its closest paralogue, AGO10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This analysis revealed multiple sites of variation between AGO1 and AGO10 concentrated in the N-coil and in distinct sites in the GN-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Several of these sites corresponded to surface-exposed patches, consistent with an involvement in protein-protein interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). We therefore constructed a series of point mutants in AGO1 NcGN residues variable between AGO1 and AGO10, and tested the interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system with ATI1 and ATI2. The results showed that multiple residues in the N-coil (K178, K185, K190) and in a few surface-exposed patches of the globular N-domain (P259, M304/E307, especially E307) are required for interaction with ATI1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 7-8</xref>). In particular, mutation of either lysine residue to glutamic acid throughout the N-coil (K178E, K185E, K190E) disrupted the NcGN-ATI interaction. We therefore moved on to assess the effect of these residues more quantitatively, and to test whether they interacted directly with the IDR of ATI1.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The K178E N-coil mutation decreases the NcGN:ATI1-IDR affinity by about 4-fold</title><p id="P13">We first expressed and purified the IDR of ATI1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> and wild type and K178E mutant versions of the NcGN of AGO1 fused to SUMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), and used these purified proteins for quantitative binding assays by microscale thermophoresis. This assay uses the distinct thermophoretic mobility of different molecular entities to measure the percentage of complex formed between a fluorescently labeled component, and a partner protein added in increasing concentrations from none (0% complex) to an estimated 100-fold molar excess (~100% complex). In our experimental set-up, His6-SUMO-AGO1 NcGN (WT or K178E) was fluorescently labeled on the unique Cys192 residue close to the N-coil, and the unlabeled IDR of ATI1 was added in increasing quantities. Using this set-up, we confirmed that the interaction between AGO1 NcGN and ATI1-IDR is direct, and measured the dissociation constant to be 11±2 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Remarkably, these affinity measurements did not necessitate application of a thermal field to measure differential molecular movement, because the fluorescence intensity itself was sensitive to addition of ATI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This observation suggests that in the AGO1 NcGN-ATI1-IDR complex, the C192-linked fluorophore is located in a distinct chemical environment compared to the free AGO1 NcGN, and thus, close to an interaction site. Indeed, when the N-coil mutant K178E was analysed in the same assay, both the affinity of the ATI1-IDR interaction (47±12 μM), and, especially, the change of fluorescence upon complex formation were substantially reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>). Taken together with the results of the mutational analyses conducted using yeast two-hybrid assays, these observations indicate that the N-coil is a direct site of interaction between AGO1-NcGN and ATI1-IDR, and that it contributes substantially to the affinity of the interaction.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Residues in the N-coil interact directly with the IDR of ATI1</title><p id="P14">To show conclusively that the N-coil is a direct interaction site of ATI1-IDR, we expressed and purified an <sup>15</sup>N-labeled N-coil peptide (172-SSSKAFKFPMRPGKGQSGKRC-192) to perform 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in the presence and absence of the ATI1-IDR. These experiments showed that the signal intensities from backbone amide N-H nuclei of several residues in the N-coil, in particular the N-terminal part from F177-K185, and to a lesser extent the C-terminal K190, were strongly reduced upon addition of ATI1-IDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d,f</xref>), indicating that these residues participate directly in the interaction. Consistent with the importance of K178 for the ATI1-IDR interaction, such loss of signal was markedly less pronounced upon addition of ATI1-IDR to an <sup>15</sup>N-labeled N-coil peptide containing the K178E mutation, in particular for the amide group of residue 178 (K/E) itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d-h</xref>). We conclude that the N-coil is a direct interaction site of the ATI1-IDR, and that the interaction involves contacts along the entire N-coil, including the K178, K185, and K190 residues. This is noteworthy, because these residues are not spatially close in the high-confidence Alphafold structure of AGO1 in the small RNA-bound conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Rather, the positions of these residues span the entire width of AGO1, and, given the close N-coil-Piwi domain contacts, define a large surface area of AGO1 in this conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Taken together with the observation that each of these lysines contributes measurably to the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 7</xref>), it is a plausible hypothesis that in the ATI1-interacting conformation of AGO1, the N-coil is detached from the remainder of the AGO1 protein, i.e. different from the small RNA-bound conformations captured by X-ray crystallography. We therefore moved on to study the AGO1-ATI1-IDR interaction in the context of full length AGO1, and set out to include analyses of both small RNA-bound and free AGO1.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>ATI1 interacts with unloaded AGO1 in vivo and the binding implicates N-coil residues</title><p id="P15">To generate small RNA-free AGO1, we engineered the Y691E mutant, mutated in a key residue in the MID domain that stacks with the 5’-uridine ring of the small RNA, and coordinates the 5’-phosphate of the small RNA.

In addition, immunoprecipitation of wild type and Y691E mutant protein followed by polynucleotide kinase-mediated labeling of co-purified small RNA showed that in contrast to AGO1<sup>WT</sup>, no small RNA was bound by the AGO1<sup>Y691E</sup> protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Because heterologous expression of AGO1 failed, even with the use of a variety of expression hosts (<italic>E. coli</italic>, baculovirus/<italic>Sf-9</italic>, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>) and affinity/solubilization tags, we used bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays upon transient expression in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> for assessment of ATI1 interaction with AGO1<sup>WT</sup> and AGO1<sup>Y691E</sup>. The close AGO1 paralogue, AGO10, was used as a negative control. With AGO1<sup>WT</sup> fused to the C-terminal part of YFP and ATI1 fused to its N-terminal part (C-YFP-AGO1<sup>WT</sup> and N-YFP-ATI1), weak, but specific signal was detected in association with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), consistent with previous reports of ATI1-localization to ER-associated ATI-bodies, and with peripheral ER-association of AGO1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. We detected a consistent and statistically significant reduction in intensity of the BiFC signal when the C-YFP-AGO1<sup>K185E/K190E</sup> mutant containing substitutions in N-coil residues implicated in ATI1 binding was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 10</xref>). We next compared patterns of BiFC signal obtained with C-YFP-AGO1<sup>Y691E</sup>/N-YFP-ATI1 and C-YFP-AGO1<sup>Y691E/K185E/K190E</sup>/N-YFP-ATI1. With both forms, specific signal was detected, and, similar to what we observed with the wild type AGO1 capable of small RNA binding, the K185E/K190E N-coil mutations resulted in significantly reduced BiFC signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). These results demonstrate that ATI1 interacts with the unloaded form of AGO1, and that N-coil residues contribute to this interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>. We note that complete disruption of ATI1-AGO1 interaction is not expected upon mutation of N-coil residues, because a previous study showed yeast two-hybrid interactions between ATI1 and AGO1 involving both N-PAZ and MID-Piwi lobes of the protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. We also note that the results show that ATI1 is capable of interacting with unloaded AGO1, and may possibly only interact with the unloaded form, because wild type AGO1 exists as a mixed population <italic>in vivo</italic>, mostly of the RNA-bound form, but also with a minor fraction in the unloaded form (see below). Clearly, however, such possible exclusive interaction with unloaded AGO1 is not established by the BiFC assays.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Defective ATI1 interaction sites in the NcGN reduce the degradation rate of unloaded AGO1</title><p id="P17">We next asked whether the interaction sites in the AGO1 NcGN defined by our analyses thus far had an effect on the turnover of unloaded AGO1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. We first generated stable transgenic plants constitutively expressing NcGN-YFP fusions with or without mutations found to disrupt ATI1/ATI2 binding. The AGO1-NcGN wild type construct was also expressed in <italic>ati1/ati2</italic> double knockout backgrounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 11</xref>) to test the possible implication of these two specific NcGN interactors in the turnover of AGO1. Comparisons of NcGN<sup>WT</sup>-YFP, NcGN<sup>K178E/K185E/K190E</sup>-YFP and NcGN<sup>K178E/K185E/K190E/P259E/M304E/E307A</sup> protein and mRNA levels showed that the NcGN mutants indeed had higher protein/mRNA ratios than their wild type counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 11</xref>). This effect could not be explained by different YFP siRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 11</xref>), and is therefore consistent with slower protein degradation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Higher protein/mRNA ratios were also found for AGO1 NcGN in the <italic>ati1</italic>/<italic>ati2</italic> knockout background compared to wild type, although the effect was less pronounced than with NcGN mutants, as expected. Thus, we moved on to test the relevance of the NcGN for degradation of the full-length, unloaded AGO1 protein using pulse-labeling analysis to extract kinetic information directly. To maximize chances of measuring an effect <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used the K185E/K190E/M304E/E307A (henceforth, KKME) mutant with residues important for ATI1/2 interaction substituted both in the N-coil and in the globular N-domain. Thus, stable transgenic lines expressing equal steady-state levels of FLAG-AGO1<sup>WT</sup>, FLAG-AGO1<sup>Y691E</sup>, and FLAG-AGO1<sup>Y691E/KKME</sup> were selected as material for kinetic analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 12</xref>). We first considered the possible kinetic pathways of newly synthesized AGO1<sup>WT</sup> and AGO1<sup>Y691E</sup>. Because AGO1<sup>WT</sup> can be degraded either prior to or after small RNA loading, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>), the labeling data must be fitted to a sum of two exponentials, with half-lives corresponding to unloaded (minor fraction, 8.5±1.8%, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>) and loaded states (major fraction, 91.5±1.8%, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>), respectively. In contrast, labeling of the unloaded AGO1<sup>Y691E</sup> is expected to follow mono-exponential kinetics. Initial analyses indicated that <sup>35</sup>S-Met/Cys labeling of entire seedlings resulted in uniform distribution of label within 15 minutes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 13</xref>), but that a classical pulse-chase set-up was not feasible, because incorporation continued after addition of the chase. Since synthesis and degradation rates are equal at steady state, we decided to do pulse-labeling experiments and measure protein half-lives from incorporation rates of <sup>35</sup>S-label/total AGO1 protein in FLAG immunoprecipitations following addition of <sup>35</sup>S-Met/Cys label (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>). We first compared FLAG-AGO1<sup>WT</sup> and FLAG-AGO1<sup>Y691E</sup> lines expressing comparable levels of FLAG-AGO1 at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). This analysis showed that wild type AGO1 indeed exhibits two-phase kinetic behavior. Gratifyingly, the half-life of the rapid phase roughly matches that of unloaded AGO1 measured with the Y691E mutant [<italic>t</italic><sup>1/2</sup>(WT, rapid) = 1.6±0.6 h, <italic>t</italic>1/2(Y691E) = 2.5±0.5 h]. We therefore repeated the pulse-labeling experiments with wild type and NcGN interaction site mutants in the unloaded FLAG-AGO1<sup>Y691E</sup> version, i.e. FLAG-AGO1<sup>Y691E</sup> vs FLAG-AGO1<sup>Y691E/KKME</sup>. These experiments showed a modest, but reproducible reduction in degradation rate of the mutant with the defective NcGN interaction site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c,e</xref>; results of two independent experiments shown to convey their quantitative variability). We conclude that intact NcGN interaction sites, including the N-coil, are necessary for maximal turnover rates of unloaded AGO1 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>The N-coil is uniquely accessible in unloaded AGO1</title><p id="P18">The results presented thus far establish that residues in the N-coil make direct contacts to the ATI1-IDR, that the ATI1-IDR can interact with the RNA-free state of AGO1, and that ATI1-IDR interaction sites in the NcGN of unloaded AGO1 contribute measurably, if modestly, to its rapid turnover <italic>in vivo</italic>. Because of the unique structural properties of the N-coil, we hypothesized that this part of AGO proteins could be a site with substantially altered accessibility between loaded and unloaded conformations of AGO that would allow specific recognition of unloaded AGO for degradation. To test this hypothesis, we raised antibodies against a 16-aa N-coil peptide (F177-C192). This polyclonal antibody specifically recognized the N-coil as demonstrated by its clear reactivity towards FLAG-immuno-purified, denatured AGO1 with a wild type N-coil, but substantial loss of reactivity with FLAG-AGO1 carrying the K185E/K190E mutations in the N-coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). We next used this antibody to probe the accessibility of the N-coil in AGO1 in two different ways. First, we observed that binding of equal amounts of N-coil antibody required 10-fold higher amounts of immuno-purified, native, immobilized FLAG-AGO1<sup>WT</sup> (largely small RNA-bound) than of similarly purified unloaded AGO1 (FLAG-AGO1<sup>Y691E</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b,c</xref>). We note that this difference cannot be explained by potentially different patterns of post-translational modifications in the N-coil, because the antibody recognized denatured forms of the two AGO1 variants equally efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Second, direct immunoprecipitation from total lysates using the N-coil antibody resulted in markedly more efficient recovery (~10 fold) of FLAG-AGO1<sup>Y691E</sup> than of FLAG-AGO1<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>), in contrast to the result obtained with FLAG antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). These observations provide clear evidence that the N-coil of AGO1 is preferentially accessible in the unloaded state.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Conformational flexibility of the N-coil is widespread in eukaryotic Ago- and Piwi-clade proteins</title><p id="P19">We finally inspected existing structural data on eukaryotic AGO proteins both of the Ago and Piwi clades for information on potential structural flexibility of the N-coil, if possible dependent on the loading status. The structures of the human miRNA-associated Ago proteins, Ago1-Ago4 in the loaded state all show the N-coil in a nearly identical conformation firmly associated with the Piwi domain as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, and are, therefore, not informative in this regard. However, several regions of differential solvent exposure between RNA-free and guide RNA-associated human Ago2 can be identified from recent data on hydrogen-deuterium exchange rates in these two states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref>). These include the N-coil and, in particular, the nearby hydrophilic environment caging the guanidium group of the conserved R182 side chain in the RNA-bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This observation on HsAgo2 extends the conclusion reached here with AtAGO1 that the N-coil assumes different conformations depending on the loading status of AGO.</p><p id="P20">In the Piwi-clade, three structures of piRNA-bound proteins are available: silkworm (<italic>Bombyx mori</italic>) Siwi, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (Dm) Piwi, and the sea sponge <italic>Ephydatia fluviatilis</italic> (Ef) Piwi. The Siwi structure shows an N-coil from I130 to G148 (ISILRTRPEAVTSKKGTSG) associated with the MID-Piwi lobe much like in Ago-clade structures, while <italic>Ef</italic> Piwi shows a partial and <italic>Dm</italic> Piwi no N-coil at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8b</xref>), presumably due to proteolytic cleavage prior to crystallization. These indications of facultative association of Piwi-clade N-coils with the MID-Piwi lobe domain suggest that the N-coil exhibits conformational flexibility, perhaps accompanying conformational differences of the proteins upon piRNA binding, as in the case of Ago-clade AGO proteins. Strikingly, the compactness of the Piwi:piRNA complexes increases progressively from the <italic>Dm</italic> Piwi structure (no N-coil present) to the Siwi structure (full N-coil present) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8b,c</xref>), lending support to the idea that the N-coil/MID-Piwi lobe association is an important step in reaching the final conformation of mature RISC across both Piwi and Ago clades.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S15"><title>Distinction between loaded and unloaded AGO via the N-coil</title><p id="P21">Our results demonstrate that the N-coil is exposed for interaction uniquely in the unloaded state of AGO1. This is important, because it defines a conformational change that accompanies the AGO loading process, and, thereby, confers distinct protein-protein interaction properties on the two forms of AGO. Three different aspects are worth further comments in this regard. First, as demonstrated here, it offers a precise molecular explanation to the longstanding observation that unloaded AGO proteins in plants and animals turn over much more rapidly than the small RNA-bound form. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, this is illustrated by the identification of many interactors involved in regulated proteolysis, most clearly ATI1, that depend on the N-coil for interaction with the NcGN fragment of AGO1. Given the structural conservation of the N-coil in widely different AGO proteins, it is likely that this same molecular principle operates in many different organisms, and, thus, contributes to the rapid turnover of unloaded AGO more generally. Second, because the N-coil is a recurrent structural element in all AGO proteins, including the Piwi clade, its exposure in unloaded forms may also explain other molecular properties distinct from rapid turnover of unloaded AGO. For instance, in insect germline cells, Piwi proteins engage in a so-called ping-pong amplification cycle of piRNAs derived from transposable elements. Ping-pong amplification entails cleavage of a sense piRNA precursor transcript by a mature piRISC containing the Piwi protein Aubergine (Aub) bound to a primary, anti-sense piRNA, and subsequent loading of the sense cleavage fragment onto another Piwi-clade protein, Ago3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Ago3 is precluded from primary piRNA association by the protein Krimper that associates with Ago3 specifically in the free state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. The definition of the molecular determinants of the recognition of the unloaded state of Ago3 by Krimper remains incomplete<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, but it is now an obvious possibility that the N-coil of Ago3 is one of those determinants. Third, the demonstration that the N-coil becomes inaccessible to antibodies after loading reveals new insight into the molecular mechanics of the loading process itself. It is a reasonable interpretation of our data that attachment of the N-coil to the Piwi domain is a key step in reaching the compact conformation of the loaded structure observed in human Ago1-4, in particular via the salt bridge deep inside of the Piwi domain involving the universally conserved R182 in the Arabidopsis AGO1 N-coil. Our inspection of available Piwi protein structures lends support to this interpretation, because the compactness of the structures follows the degree of N-coil/MID-Piwi association, consistent with the N-coil acting as a zipper that holds the two lobes together in a compact conformation. Finally, we note that our identification of Hsp90 as an interactor of the N-coil also suggests a simple explanation for why chaperone interaction protects AGO proteins from rapid proteolysis. If the N-coil, and potentially other structural determinants with similar exclusive exposure in the unloaded state of AGO, are concealed via chaperone interaction, chaperone binding to an AGO protein would preclude its interaction with the factors targeting its unloaded form for proteolysis.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Possible roles of N-coil-mediated degradation of unloaded AGO1</title><p id="P22">While our study provides a clear answer to the question of how RNA-free AGO1 can be specifically targeted for rapid proteolysis, it does not provide insight into the biological importance of such clearance of unloaded AGO1. The most straightforward explanation for the importance of rapid proteolysis of free AGO proteins is that it precludes loading of illegitimate small RNA species such as degradation fragments, and thereby eliminates potentially dangerous unwanted AGO-mediated gene repression and competition with <italic>bona fide</italic> regulatory small RNAs. Although this explanation is plausible, it may not be the only reason underlying the rapid degradation of free AGO proteins. Protection from loading of endogenous RNA degradation fragments is a fundamental molecular property required in the earliest ancestors in which AGO proteins are present, and the machinery responsible for degradation of unloaded AGO may therefore be expected to be deeply conserved in eukaryotes. However, with the exception of the histone ubiquitin ligase HUB1 and the Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein (TCTP), the AGO1 NcGN interactors isolated here are generally not conserved beyond plants, including proteins with roles in regulated proteolysis such as ATI1 and ATI2. Which additional factors may drive the evolution of systems to rapidly degrade unloaded AGOs? Since there is now evidence indicating that several plant and animal pathogens, including fungi, oomycetes, parasitic plants, and nematodes, use small RNAs as virulence factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, it is an attractive possibility that rapid proteolysis of unloaded AGO proteins also evolved as a protective mechanism to defend against those pathogens whose virulence is enhanced by reshaping host gene expression using secreted siRNAs. Clearly, the identification of the N-coil as a site of protein-protein interaction accessible only in RNA-free AGO should facilitate tests of this hypothesis across plant and animal kingdoms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Methods</label><media xlink:href="EMS156304-supplement-Methods.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d31aAdDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Figures and Table</label><media xlink:href="EMS156304-supplement-Supplemental_Figures_and_Table.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d31aAdDcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplemental Table 2 (Oligonucleotides)</label><media xlink:href="EMS156304-supplement-Supplemental_Table_2__Oligonucleotides_.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d31aAdDdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Theo Bølsterli and his team are thanked for plant care and Signe A.
