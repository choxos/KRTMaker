amino acid substitutions at five critical residues in the spike protein. Here, we illuminated the evolutionary rules underlying the convergent evolution of Omicron subvariants and the properties of one of the latest lineages of concern, BQ.1.1. Our phylogenetic and epidemic dynamics analyses suggest that Omicron subvariants independently increased their viral fitness by acquiring the convergent substitutions. Particularly, BQ.1.1, which harbors all five convergent substitutions, shows the highest fitness among the viruses investigated. Neutralization assays show that BQ.1.1 is more resistant to breakthrough BA.2/5 infection sera than BA.5. The BQ.1.1 spike exhibits enhanced binding affinity to human ACE2 receptor and greater fusogenicity than the BA.5 spike. However, the pathogenicity of BQ.1.1 in hamsters is comparable to or even lower than that of BA.5. Our multiscale investigations provide insights into the evolutionary trajectory of Omicron subvariants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Omicron</kwd><kwd>BQ.1.1</kwd><kwd>convergent evolution</kwd><kwd>transmissibility</kwd><kwd>immune resistance</kwd><kwd>pathogenicity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">As of November 2022, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529 and BA lineages) is the only current variant of concern (VOC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. At the end of November 2021, Omicron BA.1 rapidly outcompeted Delta, a prior VOC. Soon after the global spread of Omicron BA.1 lineage, Omicron BA.2 became predominant in the world. Thereafter, a variety of BA.2 descendants, such as BA.5 and BA.2.75, emerged and are becoming predominant in certain countries.</p><p id="P3">Omicron BA.2 is highly diversified after emergence and is the origin of other recently emerging Omicron subvariants. Although both BA.5 and BA.2.75 diversified from BA.2, these two Omicron subvariants are phylogenetically independent to each other, suggesting that these two variants emerged independently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. However, recent studies including ours have demonstrated that the spike (S) proteins of these two variants exhibit similar evolutionary patterns: one is amino acid substitutions to evade antiviral humoral immunity, while the other is the substitution to increase the binding affinity to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. For BA.5, the F486V substitution contributes to evasion from antiviral humoral immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, while the L452R substitution increases ACE2 binding affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. For BA.2.75, the G446S substitution is responsible for evasion from antiviral humoral immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, while the N460K substitution increases ACE2 binding affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Because the substitutions in the S protein, that confer resistance to antiviral immunity, such as F486V and G446S, reduce the affinity to human ACE2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, it is conceivable to assume that the additional substitutions, such as L452R and N460K, compensate the decreased ACE2 binding affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Another common feature of BA.5 and BA.2.75 we found is the greater pathogenicity compared to BA.2 in a hamster model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Because BA.5 and BA.2.75 are descendants of BA.2, our observations suggest that these two variants evolved to increase intrinsic pathogenicity. Importantly, our previous studies that focused on Delta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, Omicron BA.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, Omicron BA.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, Omicron BA.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, and Omicron BA.2.75<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> suggested that viral intrinsic pathogenicity in hamsters is closely associated with viral fusogenicity in cell culture system.

However, as of November 2022, although a variety of Omicron BA.2 subvariants, including BA.2.75, have emerged after BA.5, none of them have successfully outcompeted BA.5 yet. Instead of the emergence of an outstanding SARS-CoV-2 variant, recently emerging Omicron subvariants are under convergent evolution: most variants have acquired substitutions at the same site of S, such as R346, K444, L452, N460, or F486. Notably, BQ.1.1 is a descendant of BA.5 and bears all five recent convergent mutations: R346T, K444T, L452R, N460K, or F486V.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, BQ.1.1, a latest lineage of concern, emerged from the BA.5 cluster. Notably, the substitutions in S protein, particularly R346X, K444X, L452X, N460X, and F486X, seem to have convergently occurred in a variety of Omicron lineages (hereafter we refer to these five amino acid residues as “convergent sites” and substitutions at the residues as “convergent substitutions”)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.

Additionally, BQ.1.1 possesses six substitutions in the non-S region when compared to the parental BA.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, right</xref>). To investigate the substitutions at these five convergent sites during Omicron evolution in depth, we constructed phylogenetic trees for BA.1, BA.2 (including BA.2.75), BA.4, and BA.5 (including BQ.1.1) and identified the branches on the trees where the convergent substitutions occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The R346 residue showed relatively higher substitution frequency compared to the other residues in all Omicron lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c–e</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we modeled the relationship between viral epidemic dynamics and the substitutions in S protein and estimated the effects of all S substitutions on viral fitness [i.e., relative effective reproduction number (R<sub>e</sub>)]. We classified the viral sequences of Omicron according to the combination of amino acid substitutions (referred to as “S haplotype”). Subsequently, we established a Bayesian hierarchal model, which represents the epidemic dynamics of the S haplotype-based viral groups according to relative R<sub>e</sub> represented by a linear combination of the effect of S substitutions (see <bold>Methods</bold>). This model can simultaneously estimate i) the effect of each S substitution on R<sub>e</sub> and ii) the relative R<sub>e</sub> of a viral group represented by each S haplotype. We analyzed the dataset for 375,121 Omicron sequences collected in the United Kingdom (UK) from March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2022, to October 15<sup>th</sup>, 2022, which includes 254 S haplotypes according to the pattern of 107 substitutions in S protein [or substitution clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>)].

Utilizing this property of this model, we next inferred the evolutionary change in viral fitness during BA.5 diversification. We reconstructed the ancestral profile of S substitutions for each node in the BA.5 tree. Subsequently, we predicted relative viral fitness for each node according to the reconstructed S substitution profile using the model above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). This analysis suggested that the viral fitness was independently elevated in multiple lineages during BA.5 diversification, coupled with the substitution events at the convergent sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i, left</xref>). Finally, we inferred the evolutionary changes in viral fitness specific to the emergence of BQ.1.1 and revealed that the ancestral lineage of BQ.1.1 has acquired the K444T, N460K, and R346T substitutions in this order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i, right</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.

However, the immune resistance of BQ.1.1 to breakthrough infections or prior Omicron subvariants after mRNA vaccine treatment remains unaddressed. To experimentally investigate the virological features of BQ.1.1, we first evaluated the immune resistance of BQ.1.1 using HIV-1-based pseudoviruses. Consistent with our recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, BA.5 (2.5-fold) and BQ.1.1 (6.9-fold) were significantly more resistant to breakthrough BA.2 infection sera than BA.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Additionally, BQ.1.1 exhibited more profound resistance to breakthrough BA.2 infection sera than BA.5 (2.7-fold, p=0.0076) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, the BQ.1.1 S harbors three additional substitutions in the BA.5 S: R346T, K444T and N460K. To determine the responsible substitution(s) for immune resistance of BQ.1.1 to breakthrough BA.2 infection sera, we prepared the BA.5 derivatives bearing either of these three substitutions. However, any BA.5-based derivatives prepared did not exhibit resistance to breakthrough BA.2 infection sera compared to BA.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), suggesting that multiple substitutions cooperatively contribute to the immune resistance of BQ.1.1 to breakthrough BA.2 infection sera. In the case of breakthrough BA.5 infection sera, BQ.1.1 was significantly (5.6-fold) more resistant to breakthrough BA.5 infection sera than BA.5 (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Importantly, the breakthrough BA.5 infection sera obtained from six individuals (five breakthrough infection cases after 3-dose vaccination and a breakthrough infection case after 2-dose vaccination) did not exhibit antiviral effect against BQ.1.1 in this experimental setup. We then assessed the determinant substitutions to be resistant to breakthrough BA.5 infection sera. The N460K substitution conferred significant resistance to breakthrough BA.5 infection sera (1.6-fold, p=0.016), while the other two substitutions did not affect the immune resistance to breakthrough BA.5 infection sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). When compared to the immune resistance of BQ.1.1 to breakthrough BA.5 infection sera (5.6-fold), the resistance acquired by the N460K substitution (1.6-fold) is relatively less robust (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).

Our modeling analysis suggested that these five frequent substitutions at the convergent sites increase viral fitness, R<sub>e</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), and a larger proportion (81.6%) of the R<sub>e</sub> variation within Omicron can be explained by substitutions in the convergent sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Intriguingly, the viral groups harboring the substitutions in convergent sites showed higher Re, and BQ.1.1, which harbors all convergent substitutions, showed the highest R<sub>e</sub> among viral groups investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Moreover, the reconstruction of ancestral viral fitness suggests that the ancestral lineage of BQ.1.1 has increased viral fitness by acquiring substitutions at the convergent sites in a stepwise manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). Altogether, our integrated approach of phylogenetic and epidemic dynamics modeling analyses provides insights into the evolutionary rules underlying the outstanding convergent evolution observed in Omicron subvariants.</p><p id="P21">Our data provide two possibilities that explain the accumulated amino acid substitutions at the convergent sites in relatively younger Omicron lineages, such as BA.4, BA.5 and BA.2.75. One possibility is the epistasis among amino acid substitutions: the fitness of a substitution differs dependent on the presence of the other substitutions and/or the backbone sequence (similar to how the original Omicron genotype likely emerged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>). In our previous studies, the L452R substitution in the BA.4/5 S<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and the N460K substitution in the BA.2.75 S<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> increase their binding ability to human ACE2. More importantly, we showed that these substitutions can compensate for the negative effects of the other substitutions that contribute to evasion from antiviral humoral immunity but decrease ACE2 binding ability: for BA.4/5, L452R compensates for the attenuated ACE2 binding affinity by the F486V substitution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, while for BA.2.75, N460K compensates for the attenuated ACE2 binding affinity by the G446S substitution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Acquiring substitutions that potentially increase ACE2 binding ability, such as L452R and N460K, can be one of the factors that increases substitution frequency at the convergent sites in BA.4, BA.5, and BA.2.75. The other possibility is that the effect of substitutions on viral fitness can be changed over time due to changes in immune selective pressures in the human population by vaccinations and/or natural infections with a variety of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The substitutions at R346, K444, and F486 closely associate with the escape from antiviral humoral immunity and monoclonal antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In fact, here we demonstrated that the antigenicity of BQ.1.1 is different from that of parental BA.5 and BQ.1.1 is more robustly resistant to the antiviral humoral immunity induced by BA.2 and BA.5 breakthrough infections than BA.5. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the effect of substitutions at these sites on viral fitness likely differs depending on the immune status in the human population. These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and these two factors could contribute to the accelerated substitutions at the convergent sites.</p><p id="P22">Based on our experimental results as well as recent reports, it is convincing that BQ.1.1 is one of the variants exhibiting profound resistance to the antiviral humoral immunity induced by breakthrough infections of BA.2 and BA.5 as well as therapeutic monoclonal antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Additionally, our experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> showed that the BQ.1.1 S exhibits higher affinity to human ACE2 and greater fusogenicity than BA.5, and these abilities are conferred by two substitutions, R346T and N460K. As expected, because BQ.1.1 bears two substitutions, L452R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and N460K<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, both of which augment ACE2 binding affinity, BQ.1.1 has evolved to augment its fusogenicity. Moreover, the R346T substitution, while contributing to enhanced ACE2 affinity and augmented fusogenicity, also concomitantly contributes, perhaps unexpectedly, to immune evasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">Our previous studies focusing on Delta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, Omicron BA.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, BA.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, and BA.2.75<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, showed that the intrinsic pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants is closely related to the fusogenicity of viral S proteins. Therefore, the observations showing the higher fusogenicity of BQ.1.1 S than the BA.5 S based on the S-based fusion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>) and the experiments using airway-on-a-chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3m</xref>) suggested the increased intrinsic pathogenicity of BQ.1.1 when compared to BA.5. However, it was unexpected that the intrinsic pathogenicity of BQ.1.1 in a hamster model is comparable or even lower than that of BA.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This discrepancy between viral fusogenicity and viral intrinsic pathogenicity is reminiscent of the previous two studies on Omicron BA.2 variant. We first showed that the BA.2 S is more fusogenic than the BA.1 S<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. We then artificially generated a BA.2 S-bearing recombinant SARS-CoV-2, in which the non-S region of viral genome is derived from ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrated that the BA.2 S-bearing virus is more pathogenic than the BA.1 S-bearing virus in hamsters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. On the other hand, Uraki et al. showed that the intrinsic pathogenicity of clinical BA.2 isolates is comparable to clinical BA.1 isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Because the difference between our study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> is the viral genome sequence in the non-S region, it is suggested that the BA.2 S bears the potential to exhibit augmented pathogenicity when compared to the BA.1 S, whereas the mutations in non-S region of BA.2 genome potentially attenuate viral pathogenicity. In fact, we found there are at least six substitutions in the non-S region of BQ.1.1 when compared to that of BA.5. Therefore, it would be conceivable to assume that there are factors potentially modulate viral intrinsic pathogenicity other than S protein.</p><p id="P24">There are two evolutionary scenarios that possibly explain the discrepancy between viral fusogenicity and intrinsic pathogenicity observed in BQ.1.1. One scenario is that BQ.1.1 acquired mutation(s) in the non-S region of viral genome that can attenuate viral pathogenicity and cancel the pathogenicity elevated by the higher fusogenicity compared with the parental BA.5. This is reminiscent to the observations in the two BA.2 studies as mentioned above<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. This scenario also provides a possibility that the increased fusogenicity of viral S protein can reduce viral fitness in the human population because greater fusogenicity can result in elevating pathogenicity. Another scenario is brought from a theoretical study by Sasaki, Lion, and Boots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. This study provides a possibility that antigenic escape can augment viral pathogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Since we demonstrated that at least two descendants of BA.2, BA.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, and BA.2.75<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, increased their intrinsic pathogenicity, this theory may fit the evolution of Omicron. More importantly, this theory also predicts that there is a limitation to increase viral pathogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Together with our observations, it might be possible to assume that the pathogenicity of Omicron lineage already reaches a plateau.</p><p id="P25">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased intrinsic pathogenicity may not be so critical for the immunized segment of the population. However, the variants bearing greater intrinsic pathogenicity can be a meaningful risk for people who do not have anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, most conspicuously the unvaccinated population, including children. Therefore, continued in-depth viral genomic surveillance and real-time evaluation of the risk of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants should be crucial.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="P26">All experiments with hamsters were performed in accordance with the Science Council of Japan’s Guidelines for the Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments.

We excluded S substitutions commonly (≥90%) detected in sequences analyzed. According to the criteria above, 123 S substitutions were retrieved. Subsequently, we classified the sequences according to the profile of S substitutions above (referred to as S haplotype). We excluded S haplotypes with ≤30 sequences from the downstream analyses. According to the criterion above, 254 S haplotypes, composed of 375,121 sequences, were retrieved. The substitution profile was represented as a matrix, where the rows and columns depict S haplotypes and S substitutions, respectively. An element in the matrix represents the status [presence (1) or absence (0)] of one S substitution in one S haplotype. Next, we identified a group of highly co-occurring substitutions (i.e., a pair of substitutions with &gt;0.9 Pearson’s correlation in the substitution profile matrix) and clustered these substitutions as a substitution cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). For example, the L452R:F486V cluster represents the L452R and F486V substitutions. For one substitution cluster, the mean value of the substitution statuses (0 or 1) of the members of substitutions was calculated for each S haplotype, and the mean value was used as the substitution status of the substitution cluster. For example, if one S haplotype has L452R but not F486V, the substitution status of the L452R:F486V cluster of the haplotype was set at 0.5. Consequently, our dataset included the profile of 107 S substitutions/substitution clusters for 254 S haplotypes. Next, to set the major S haplotype of BA.2 as the reference S haplotype (or lineage) in the statistical model described below, we transformed the S substitution profile matrix by subtracting the substitution profile of the major S haplotype of BA.2 from those for all S haplotypes. Consequently, elements in the transformed S substitution profile matrix were converted to -1, 0, or 1: The zero value means that the status of a substitution in one haplotype is the same as that in the reference haplotype. The one value means that a substitution is present in one haplotype but not in the reference haplotype.

For preparation of the airway-on-a-chip, first, the bottom channel of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) device was precoated with fibronectin (3 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# F1141). The microfluidic device was generated according to our previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. HMVEC-L cells were suspended at 5,000,000 cells/ml in EGM2-MV medium. Then, 10 μl of suspension medium was injected into the fibronectin-coated bottom channel of the PDMS device. Then, the PDMS device was turned upside down and incubated. After 1 hour, the device was turned over, and the EGM2-MV medium was added into the bottom channel. After 4 days, AOs were dissociated and seeded into the top channel.

Briefly, the microfluidic device consisted of two layers of microchannels separated by a semipermeable membrane. The microchannel layers were fabricated from PDMS using a soft lithographic method. PDMS prepolymer (Dow Corning, Cat# SYLGARD 184) at a base to curing agent ratio of 10:1 was cast against a mold composed of SU-8 2150 (MicroChem, Cat# SU-8 2150) patterns formed on a silicon wafer. The cross-sectional size of the microchannels was 1 mm in width and 330 μm in height. Access holes were punched through the PDMS using a 6-mm biopsy punch (Kai Corporation, Cat# BP-L60K) to introduce solutions into the microchannels. Two PDMS layers were bonded to a PET membrane containing 3.0-μm pores (Falcon, Cat# 353091) using a thin layer of liquid PDMS prepolymer as the mortar. PDMS prepolymer was spin-coated (4000 rpm for 60 sec) onto a glass slide. Subsequently, both the top and bottom channel layers were placed on the glass slide to transfer the thin layer of PDMS prepolymer onto the embossed PDMS surfaces. The membrane was then placed onto the bottom layer and sandwiched with the top layer. The combined layers were left at room temperature for 1 day to remove air bubbles and then placed in an oven at 60°C overnight to cure the PDMS glue. The PDMS devices were sterilized by placing them under UV light for 1 hour before the cell culture.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>SARS-CoV-2 infection</title><p id="P62">One day before infection, Vero cells (10,000 cells), VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (10,000 cells) and Calu-3 cells (10,000 cells) were seeded into a 96-well plate.
