It can modulate cell cycle progression, override DNA damage checkpoint signalling and increase chronological lifespan (CLS) in various model systems. Early studies suggested that caffeine inhibits the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) Rad3 to override DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest in fission yeast. We have previously suggested that caffeine modulates cell cycle progression and lifespan by inhibiting the Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1). Nevertheless, whether this inhibition is direct or not, has remained elusive. TORC1 controls metabolism and mitosis timing by integrating nutrients and environmental stress response (ESR) signalling. Nutritional or other stresses activate the Sty1-Ssp1-Ssp2 (AMP-activated protein kinase complex, AMPK) pathway, which inhibits TORC1 and accelerates mitosis through Sck2 inhibition. Additionally, activation of the ESR pathway can extend lifespan in fission yeast. Here, we demonstrate that caffeine activates Ssp1, Ssp2 and the AMPKβ regulatory subunit Amk2 to advance mitosis. Ssp2 is phosphorylated in an Ssp1-dependent manner following exposure to caffeine. Furthermore, Ssp1 and Amk2, are required for resistance to caffeine under conditions of prolonged genotoxic stress. The effects of caffeine on DNA damage sensitivity are uncoupled from mitosis in AMPK pathway mutants. We propose that caffeine interacts synergistically with other genotoxic agents to increase DNA damage sensitivity. Our findings suggest that caffeine accelerates mitotic division and is beneficial for CLS through AMPK. Direct pharmacological targeting of AMPK may serve towards health span and lifespan benefits beyond yeasts, given the highly conserved nature of this key regulatory cellular energy sensor.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>chronological lifespan</kwd><kwd>Torin1</kwd><kwd>Gsk3</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The widely consumed neuroactive methylxanthine compound caffeine, has been linked to increased chronological lifespan (CLS), protective effects against diseases such as cancer and improved responses to clinical therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Alao and Sunnerhagen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Bode and Dong, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Cross and Gunter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Löf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Rallis et al., 2013</xref>). Deciphering the mechanisms by which caffeine overrides DNA damage checkpoint signalling has been of particular interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Alao and Sunnerhagen, 2020</xref>). While extensively studied over the last three decades, the precise mechanisms whereby caffeine exerts its activity on cell cycle regulation have remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Alao et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Alao and Sunnerhagen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bentley et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Eukaryotic cells are subject to continuous DNA damage, resulting from the effects of metabolic processes as well as exposure to environmental agents such as ionizing radiation, UV radiation, cigarette smoke or chemotherapeutic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Carusillo and Mussolino, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Paviolo et al., 2019</xref>). The <italic>S. pombe</italic> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related serine/threonine kinase (PIKK) Rad3 (a homologue of mammalian ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM related kinase (ATR)), is activated in response to DNA damage or replication stress. Rad3 activation and phosphorylation creates binding sites for adapter proteins that facilitate the activation of downstream kinases Cds1 and Chk1 in the S phase and G2 phases of the cell cycle, respectively. During S phase Cds1 phosphorylates Cdc25 on serine and threonine residues resulting in its activation and sequestration within the cytoplasm following binding of the 14-3-3-related, Rad24 protein. Rad3 and Cds1 also activate the Mik1 kinase during S phase which directly inhibits Cdc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bentley et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Christensen et al., 2000</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the reciprocal activity of the Cdc25 phosphatase and Wee1 kinase on Cdc2 activity, determines the actual timing of mitosis. Additionally, environmental cues such as nutrient limitation and environmental stress can influence the timing of mitosis through target of Rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Atkin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Davie et al., 2015</xref>). The inhibition of TORC1 activity results in the activation of the Greatwall related-kinases Ppk18 and Cek1. Ppk18 and Cek1 in turn activate the endosulphine Igo1 which inhibits PP2A<sup>pab1</sup> to induce mitosis (Pab1 being the regulatory subunit in <italic>S. pombe</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Aono et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Chica et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Initial studies suggested that caffeine inhibits Rad3 and its homologues to override DNA damage checkpoint signalling in both yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Moser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Osman and McCready, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Wang et al., 1999</xref>). These findings, based on <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments demonstrating that caffeine can inhibit Rad3 and ATM, have been proven controversial. Firstly, caffeine has been shown to override DNA damage checkpoint signalling without blocking ATM and Rad3 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Alao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Cortez, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kunoh et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, caffeine can also inhibit other members of the PIKK family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Sarkaria et al., 1999</xref>). More recent studies indicate that caffeine inhibits TORC1 signalling in yeast and mammalian cells. Indeed, TORC1 inhibition in <italic>S. pombe</italic> is sufficient to override DNA damage checkpoint signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Davie et al., 2015</xref>). It remains unclear, if caffeine directly inhibits TORC1 by acting as a low intensity ATP competitor or indirectly via the <italic>S. pombe</italic> AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) Ssp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Reinke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Wanke et al., 2008</xref>). Caffeine has also been shown to extend CLS in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and induce in combination with Rapamycin, gene expression patterns similar to nitrogen-starved cells or cells in which <italic>tor2</italic> is conditionally deleted (through a temperature sensitive (TS) mutation). Mutants lacking <italic>ssp2</italic> display a shortened CLS. It remains unclear if caffeine alters gene expression or extends CLS directly, or through Ssp2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Rallis et al., 2017</xref>, 2014).</p><p id="P5">In the current study, we have identified novel roles for the Ssp1 and Ssp2 kinases in facilitating the indirect inhibition of TORC1 by caffeine. Caffeine failed to override DNA damage checkpoint signalling in <italic>ssp1</italic>Δ and <italic>ssp2</italic>Δ mutants. We demonstrate that caffeine interacts with Ssp1 signalling and induces Ssp2 phosphorylation in an Ssp1-dependent manner. We also identify a specific role for Amk2, the β-regulatory subunit of the AMPK complex, in mediating resistance to caffeine, possibly through chromatin remodelling modulation and DNA damage repair. Downstream of TORC1, caffeine induced mitosis in <italic>ppk18</italic>Δ and <italic>cek1</italic>Δ <italic>ppk18</italic>Δ but not <italic>igo1</italic>Δ mutants, but this activity did not correlate with its effect on DNA damage sensitivity. Caffeine may, thus, enhance DNA damage sensitivity independently of mitosis by interfering with DNA damage repair. TORC1 inhibition with Torin1 also potently sensitized <italic>ppk18</italic>Δ, <italic>cek1</italic>Δ <italic>ppk18</italic>Δ and <italic>igo1</italic>Δ mutants to DNA damage. These observations suggest roles for Ppk18, the related kinase Cek1, an unknown kinase and possibly an unidentified probable role for Igo1 in DNA damage repair and/or checkpoint recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Amar-Schwartz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Campos and Clemente-Blanco, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Ramos et al., 2019</xref>). Exposure to caffeine also suppressed Sck2 expression. Sck2 functions downstream of TORC1 to regulate the timing of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Chica et al., 2016b</xref>) and plays a role in regulating CLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Roux et al., 2006</xref>). We previously demonstrated that caffeine prolongs CLS in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Rallis et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, whether this is due to direct TORC1 inhibition or through stress response induction has remained elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that the caffeine-mediated CLS extension is Ssp1, Ssp2 and Amk2-dependent. Together these findings provide evidence for the Ssp1-AMKP-TORC1 signalling axis in mediating the effects of caffeine on both cell cycle progression and chronological ageing in <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>S. pombe</italic> Ssp1 and Ssp2 mediate the effect of caffeine on the G2 DNA damage checkpoint</title><p id="P6">As previously reported, both caffeine (10mM) and Torin1 (5μM) override the cell cycle arrest induced by 5μg/mL phleomycin in wild type <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells. In contrast, cells exposed to phleomycin or left untreated remained arrested while control cultures proliferated with steady state kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alao et al., 2020</xref>). We hypothesized that caffeine overrides DNA damage checkpoint signalling at least partially, via inhibition of TORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alao et al., 2020</xref>). Direct inhibition of TORC1 activity with Torin1 is more effective than exposure to caffeine raising the possibility that the latter may act indirectly. We, therefore, wondered about the implication of AMPK and investigated the possible role of Ssp1 and Ssp2 in modulating the mitotic effects of caffeine. Nutrient deprivation or exposure to environmental stress indirectly inhibits TORC1 activity, via activation of the Ssp1-Ssp2 (AMPK catalytic (α) subunit) pathway. Deletion of <italic>ssp1</italic> or <italic>ssp2</italic> inhibited the effect of caffeine on DNA damage induced cell cycle arrest in cells exposed to phleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). It is likely, that deletion of <italic>ssp1</italic> or <italic>ssp2</italic> affects TORC1 activity and hence the kinetics of Torin1- induced mitosis relative to <italic>wt</italic> cells. In contrast, the effect of Torin1 under similar conditions was partially suppressed (or dampened) but not inhibited until after 120 min. TORC1 inhibition leads to activation of the Greatwall homologue Ppk18 which activates Igo1. Igo1 in turn, inhibits PP2A<sup>Pab1</sup> activity causing cells to enter mitosis prematurely with a shortened cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Aono et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Chica et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Davie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Pérez-Hidalgo and Moreno, 2017</xref>). Deletion of <italic>ppk18</italic> did not suppress the ability of either caffeine or Torin1 to override DNA damage checkpoints. We noted however, that the <italic>ppk18</italic>Δ mutant reached the maximum level of septation more slowly than wild type cells exposed to phleomycin and caffeine or Torin1 (90 min versus 60 min in <italic>ppk18</italic>Δ and <italic>wt</italic> strains respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Surprisingly, absence of both <italic>cek1</italic> with <italic>ppk18</italic> (regulating Igo1, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Aono et al., 2019</xref>)) suppressed the effects of Torin1 but not caffeine on phleomycin-induced cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). It should be noted, that Torin1 induces cell cycle arrest while caffeine does not. It is possible that these differential results are due to TORC2 inhibition by Torin1 but not caffeine. In contrast, deletion of <italic>igo1</italic> markedly reduced the ability of both caffeine and Torin1 to override DNA damage checkpoint signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Wild type and <italic>ssp1</italic>Δ strains were sequentially exposed to phleomycin and caffeine or Torin1 and subjected to FACS analysis. No changes in wild type DAPI intensity were observed when cells were exposed to phleomycin alone (1.03% vs 0,83% of cells passing a 40K DAPI intensity arbitrary cutoff in time 0 and 120min respectively and with geometric means of fluorescent intensity 22,755 and 23,329, respectively). An increase in the case of <italic>ssp1</italic>Δ was observed with phleomycin exposure (1.09% vs 6.34% of cells passing a 40K DAPI intensity arbitrary cutoff in time 0 and 120min respectively and with geometric means of 24,581 and 28986 respectively). Exposure of <italic>wt</italic> cells to caffeine in the presence of phleomycin clearly resulted in an increase in DAPI intensity above 40K point (0.69% vs 21.4% of cells above 40K respectively and geometric means 22,611 vs 31,766). This effect was suppressed in <italic>ssp1</italic>Δ mutants where the increase above 40K was from 0.69% to 9.49% (geometric means from 22,897 to 30212). Given that phleomycin alone, induces an increase of DAPI intensity in <italic>ssp1</italic>Δ, the change attributable to caffeine is even lower compared to wild type cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 1</xref>). No notable changes can be observed for wild type or <italic>ssp1</italic>Δ cells treated with phleomycin and Torin1. Taken together (see also relevant septation index measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>), our results may indicate that following phleomycin treatment, caffeine can drive DNA replication and mitosis in an Ssp1-dependent manner. Interestingly, we could not detect differences in DNA damage sensitivity in <italic>wt, ssp1</italic>Δ, <italic>ssp2</italic>Δ, <italic>cek1</italic>Δ <italic>ppk18</italic>Δ or <italic>igo1</italic>Δ mutants co-exposed to phleomycin and caffeine or Torin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P8">As previously reported, both caffeine and Torin1 increase sensitivity to phleomycin in liquid culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Alao et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We have consistently observed, that Torin1 is more effective at enhancing DNA damage sensitivity. TORC2 is required resistance to DNA damage, hence its inhibition by Torin1 might exert different effects on viability. Although deletion of <italic>ssp1, ssp2</italic> and <italic>igo1</italic> abrogated the effect of caffeine on mitosis, we did not detect a reduction in DNA damage sensitivity relative to <italic>wt</italic> cells under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Both drugs clearly enhanced the sensitivity of <italic>ssp2</italic>Δ, <italic>cek1</italic>Δ <italic>ppk18</italic>Δ, <italic>igo1</italic>Δ mutants to phleomycin, despite the lack of mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). While Ssp1 cells may display slightly higher resistance to phleomycin with caffeine, we did not detect a clear relationship between mitosis and viability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 2A to 2C</xref>). Similarly, both caffeine and Torin1 sensitized <italic>igo1</italic>Δ mutants to phleomycin like <italic>wt</italic> cells, despite the marked difference in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F, 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2D and 2E</xref>). Caffeine also slightly enhanced the DNA damage sensitivity of <italic>wt</italic> cells exposed to phleomycin in cultures treated in stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, caffeine and Torin1 exert differential effects on DNA damage sensitivity in a context dependent manner. As caffeine can increase HU sensitivity in a Cdc25-dependent manner (2D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Alao et al., 2014</xref>), we next examined the effect of caffeine on <italic>wt</italic> and mutant cells under chronic genotoxic conditions. Under these conditions, <italic>ssp2</italic> and <italic>amk2</italic> mutants showed increased sensitivity to HU combined with caffeine. Furthermore, <italic>ssp2</italic> and <italic>amk2</italic> mutants showed increased sensitivity to phleomycin alone while co-exposure to caffeine was lethal to all strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Caffeine has been reported to be genotoxic and can enhance DNA damage sensitivity without advancing mitosis. These observations suggest that caffeine may induce a specific form of DNA damage when combined with genotoxic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Calvo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Rowley and Zhang, 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Caffeine induces Ssp1-dependent Ssp2 phosphorylation on Thr169</title><p id="P9">To further investigate the effect of caffeine on Ssp2 signalling, we used a previously reported phospho-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Schutt and Moseley, 2017</xref>). Ssp2 phosphorylation was clearly induced in <italic>wt</italic> cells expressing Myc-tagged Ssp2 when exposed to 10mM caffeine for 2h, albeit to a lesser degree than glucose deprivation. Ssp2 phosphorylation was suppressed in cells exposed to 5μM Torin1 under similar conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, 3B and 3C</xref>). Environmental stresses induce Ssp1-mediated phosphorylation of Ssp2. In contrast to the previously reported transient effect of 1M KCl on Ssp2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Schutt and Moseley, 2017</xref>), this effect was sustained in cells exposed to caffeine over a 2h period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Caffeine also increased the amount of Ssp2 phosphorylation in cells previously exposed to phleomycin, while co-exposure to Torin1 exhibited the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Although Ssp2 is activated by changes in the ratio of AMP to ATP, it can also be activated by cellular stresses. Exposure to 1M KCl, has previously been shown to suppress cellular ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Schutt and Moseley, 2017</xref>). This suggests that caffeine indirectly inhibits TORC1 via Ssp2 in contrast to Torin1. It is unclear why ATP suppresses sensitivity to phleomycin but supports our contention that viability is independent of mitosis in this context. The effect of caffeine on Ssp2 phosphorylation was largely independent of ATP in cells previously exposed to phleomycin, while Torin1 suppressed phospho-Ssp2 levels. ATP slightly suppressed the caffeine- induced phosphorylation of Ssp2. Additionally, ATP also increased phospho- Ssp2 levels in cells exposed to phleomycin and Torin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Together, these finding suggest that caffeine activates Ssp2 independently of ATP although it may suppress Torin1 activity. ATP did not affect the ability of caffeine or Torin1 to drive phleomycin-arrested cells into mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). We noted however, that septated cells exposed to ATP in the presence of phleomycin and caffeine were longer than cells exposed to the latter alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Additionally, ATP suppressed the effect of caffeine and Torin1 on phleomycin sensitivity independently of its effects on cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). Caffeine in contrast to 1M KCl, thus, appears to induce Ssp2 phosphorylation and cell cycle progression independently of ATP.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Caffeine modulates TORC1-regulated mitotic signalling</title><p id="P10">Indirect inhibition of TORC1 by Ssp2 results in the suppression of Sck2 activity, Ppk18 and Cek1 activation, Igo1 activation and downstream inhibition of PP2A activity leading to mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Chica et al., 2016b</xref>). We, thus, examined the effect of caffeine on TORC1-regulated cell signalling. Caffeine clearly suppressed Sck2 but not Sck1 (an Sck2 homologue that plays a minor role in regulating the timing of mitosis) expression in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). A similar effect was observed in cells previously exposed to phleomycin, where caffeine may be able to induce the accumulation of Sck1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) but suppresses Sck2 expression in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Caffeine may thus indirectly induce Cdc25 activation, Wee1 inhibition and consequently, mitosis via suppression of Sck2 expression and, consequently, reduction of its corresponding enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). We did not detect an appreciable level of reduced Maf1 phosphorylation in cells exposed to caffeine alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). The output of caffeine-mediated TORC1 inhibition, may thus differ from those of Rapamycin and Torin1. Caffeine may affect Cdc25 activity independently of TORC1. We previously reported that caffeine stabilizes Cdc25 in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Alao and Sunnerhagen, 2020</xref>). We note that HU but not phleomycin induces degradation of the Cdc25(12A)-GFPint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F and 4G</xref>). Inappropriate Cdc25 activity during S- phase may interfere with DNA replication and repair. Caffeine likely drives mitosis via TORC1 inhibition to activate PP2A while simultaneously stabilizing Cdc25 via activation of TORC2 (See below).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ssp2 mediates the effect of caffeine on cell cycle progression in the absence of checkpoint signalling</title><p id="P11">We next investigated the role of Ssp2 in mediating the cell cycle effects of caffeine under normal growth conditions.

We have previously demonstrated that caffeine drives mitosis by modulating Cdc25 and Wee1 activity in a manner reminiscent of TORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alao et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">2014</xref>).

However, caffeine stabilises Cdc25 independently of inhibitory phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Alao et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F and 4G</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Ssp1 is required for TORC1 inhibition and cell cycle re-entry following exposure to environmental stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Freitag et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Gómez-Hierro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Schutt and Moseley, 2017</xref>). Our findings indicated that caffeine strongly interacts with Ssp1 to regulate mitosis and resistance to environmental stress. We also demonstrated that caffeine activates Ssp2 in an Ssp1-dependent manner. Ssp2 activation is required for the mitotic effects of caffeine in both log phase and DNA damage checkpoint-activated cell populations. Ssp2-mediated TORC1 inhibition relieves the inhibition of Sck2 on Ppk18 and Cek1, to drive cells into mitosis due to the downstream inhibition of PP2A<sup>Pab1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Aono et al., 2019</xref>). Surprisingly <italic>ppk18 cek1</italic> co-deletion suppressed the mitotic effects of Torin1 but not those of caffeine. Thus, an additional kinase such as Ppk31 may mediate the effects of caffeine on mitotic progression. In contrast, <italic>igo1</italic> deletion suppressed the mitotic effects of both caffeine and Torin1. Igo1 is indispensable for rapid mitotic progression and proper cell cycle exit following TORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Aono et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings suggest that caffeine mediates cell cycle progression in an Igo1-dependent manner, but this may be due to increased intrinsic PP2A<sup>Pab1</sup> activity in <italic>igo1</italic>Δ mutants independently of Cek1/ Ppk18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8F</xref>). It should be noted that caffeine differs from other stresses such as glucose deprivation and ionic stress by driving cells into mitosis, rather than delaying mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Masuda et al., 2016</xref>), partially mimicking the effects of Rapamycin-induced TORC1 inhibition on cell cycle progression. However, signalling outputs downstream of TORC1 may differ between caffeine and direct TORC1 and/or TORC2 inhibitors. We noted for instance, that caffeine does not inhibit Maf1 phosphorylation but clearly suppresses Sck2 expression. 10mM caffeine has only a modest effect on cell growth in <italic>S. pombe</italic> compared to caffeine in combination with 100ng/mL Rapamycin or 5μM Torin1 exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Rallis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Rodríguez-López et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, ATP did not block the effects of caffeine on Ssp2 phosphorylation or mitosis. In contrast, ATP counteracted the negative effect of Torin1 on Ssp2 phosphorylation and mimicked the effect of <italic>ssp1</italic> or <italic>ssp2</italic> deletion on mitosis. In fact, addition of ATP mimicked the effect of ssp2 deletion on Torin1-induced mitosis. These observations suggest that caffeine activates Ssp2 independently of intracellular ATP levels. Caffeine induced mitochondrial fission in a manner similar to KCl as previously reported with the effect of KCl occurring independently of Ssp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Schutt and Moseley, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P20">FACS analyses suggest that while caffeine drives cells into mitosis in an Ssp1-dependent manner, DNA replication may not be completely inhibited in <italic>ssp1</italic> mutants co-exposed to phleomycin. Deletion of <italic>ssp1</italic>, thus, may uncouple cytokinesis from DNA replication when these mutants are exposed to caffeine in the presence of phleomycin. Aside from <italic>gsk3</italic> mutants, we did not detect a differential decrease in DNA damage sensitivity in any of the Ssp1-Ssp2-TORC1 axis mutants. Interestingly, <italic>ssp2</italic>Δ and <italic>amk2</italic>Δ mutants showed enhanced sensitivity to phleomycin and were more sensitive to the effects of caffeine in the presence of HU. Caffeine-mediated activation of Ssp2 and Amk2 may thus have a protective effect during activation of the DNA damage response. Caffeine is clearly genotoxic in <italic>S. pombe</italic> at 10mM. Resistance to caffeine requires Rad3 and the Homologous Recombination (HR) DNA Damage Repair proteins Rad51 and Rhp54 as well as the 26S proteasome nuclear tether Cut8 required for DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Calvo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Rowley and Zhang, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, caffeine appears to induce Cds1 and Chk1 signalling and clearly enhances phleomycin sensitivity even in stationary phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Alao et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2h</xref>). Early studies have, indeed, identified caffeine as a genotoxic agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lehmann, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Prakash, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Rowley and Zhang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Ts’o and Lu, 1964</xref>). Our studies suggest that caffeine may be inducing a specific type of DNA damage in HU-exposed cells. We have confirmed that the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> RAD6 homologue Rhp6 is required for the effects of caffeine on the HU-induced DNA damage checkpoint. Rhp6 is a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme required for post replication repair (PRR), while also mediating mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Rowley and Zhang, 1999</xref>). Crucially, caffeine enhanced the sensitivity of <italic>rhp6</italic>Δ mutants to HU despite its inability to advance mitosis under these conditions. Rhp6 regulates the abundance of the 26S proteasome within the nucleus by regulating the stability of its nuclear tether Cut8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Takeda and Yanagida, 2005</xref>). We also noted that caffeine suppresses Cut8 expression in the presence of phleomycin. Caffeine may, thus, interfere with ubiquitin-dependent degradation within the nucleus in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. These findings are consistent with our previous finding that caffeine advances mitosis by stabilising Cdc25 within the nucleus. Our observation, that this activity is more evident in HU-treated than in phleomycin-treated cells hints at cell cycle phase specific effects. When Cdc25 activity is high (High Cdc2 activity), caffeine is readily able to drive cells into mitosis in a manner partially dependent on Ssp2. When Cdc25 activity is low, however, (low Cdc2 activity), caffeine requires the Ssp1-dependent activation of Ssp2 to drive cells into mitosis via inactivation of Srk1 and PP2A<sup>Pab1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Chica et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Gómez-Hierro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Schonbrun et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8F</xref>). Enhanced Cdc2 activity in cells exposed to caffeine may be sufficient to drive DNA replication in the absence of mitosis in <italic>ssp1</italic>Δ and <italic>ssp2</italic>Δ mutants. The ability of caffeine to enhance phleomycin sensitivity even in stationary phase cells, suggests it might interfere with DNA damage repair. Additionally, PP2A<sup>Pab1</sup> and other phosphatases in this family regulate DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Ramos et al., 2019</xref>). Caffeine and other TORC1 inhibitors may, therefore, drive cells into mitosis, while inhibiting their ability to mediate DNA damage repair and TORC2 crosstalk. TORC2 has been reported to regulate stress and DNA damage resistance by modulating chromatin remodelling, gene expression particularly in S-phase and exit from DNA damage cell cycle checkpoints. Caffeine may, thus, also impact on DNA damage sensitivity due to its effects on TORC2 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Schonbrun et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In this study, we identified a role for the AMPK β-subunit Amk2 in specifically mediating the resistance of stationary phase <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells when plated on YES media that contain caffeine. The AMPK β-subunit Amk2 is required for heterotrimer formation and its subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Valbuena and Moreno, 2012</xref>). Ssp2 regulates the localisation of transcription factors and transcriptional repressors in fission yeast. When activated, Ssp2 also suppresses the expression of genes involved in ATP-dependent processes such as DNA replication, DNA repair, translation and the expression of genes required for cell cycle exit and sexual development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Valbuena and Moreno, 2012</xref>). Ssp2 is not strictly required for progression through mitosis, however, it may enhance it. These reports are consistent with our finding, that caffeine can induce mitosis in <italic>ssp2</italic> mutants exposed to phleomycin when Gsk3 is expressed.

The AMPK β and γ subunits are not required for the induction of mitosis following nitrogen stress. In contrast, all three subunits appear to be required for cell cycle resumption following exposure to osmotic stress through KCl. This suggests that Ssp2 differentially modulates mitosis in a context-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Davie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Forte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Rallis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Schutt and Moseley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Valbuena and Moreno, 2012</xref>).

Rather, AMPK/Ssp2 migrates to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates the Scr1 transcriptional repressor to induce its nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Saitoh et al., 2015</xref>). This facilitates the increased expression of high affinity hexose transporters in response to glucose deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Saitoh et al., 2015</xref>). We did not observe any effect of caffeine on Ght5 expression (data not shown, separate manuscript in preparation). Conversely, ATP did not affect caffeine-induced Ssp2 phosphorylation or cell cycle progression. Caffeine did induce mitochondrial fission similarly to KCl. Indirect caffeine-induced Ssp2 activation may sufficiently inhibit TORC1 activity, to drive mitosis via the inhibition of Sck2 and Igo1. This would lead to caffeine stabilised Cdc25 activation and its subsequent degradation, to permit activation of the Septation Initiation Network (SIN) and exit from or further rounds of cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Chica et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Esteban et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">García-Blanco et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We have previously demonstrated, that caffeine-induces Cdc25 nuclear accumulation independently of DNA damage checkpoint-induced phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Alao et al., 2014</xref>).

TORC2 regulates protein stability by regulating Gsk3-mediated stabilization of the Pub1 E3-ligase, which in turn regulates Cdc25 stability. Torin1-mediated TORC2 inhibition, has been shown to induce Pub1 stabilisation in a Gsk3-dependent manner.

Several studies have suggested that caffeine is a genotoxic agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lehmann and Kirk-Bell, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Prakash, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Ts’o and Lu, 1964</xref>). Caffeine can clearly enhance DNA damage sensitivity independently of its effects on mitosis. This is clearly observable in <italic>rhp6</italic> mutants which are defective in DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). It has been suggested, that caffeine may interfere with DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Rowley and Zhang, 1999</xref>). Alternatively, caffeine could synergistically induce DNA damage in the presence of other genotoxins. This could lead to the activation of DNA damage response pathways that are incompatible with HU for instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bakuradze et al., 2016</xref>). We also noted that caffeine suppresses Cut8 expression in the presence of phleomycin. This suggests caffeine interferes with DNA damage repair, as <italic>cut8</italic>Δ mutants are extremely sensitive to phleomycin. <italic>cut8</italic>Δ mutants are also sensitive to caffeine, providing further evidence for its genotoxic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Calvo et al., 2009</xref>). The enhanced sensitivity of <italic>ssp2</italic>Δ and <italic>amk2</italic>Δ mutants to phleomycin suggests a role for these genes in the DNA damage response. of <italic>S. pombe</italic> AMPK is, therefore, required for resistance to caffeine and this is illustrated by the inability of the drug to extend CLS in this organism.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P24">The precise mechanisms by which caffeine exerts its effects on cell cycle progression, DNA damage sensitivity and CLS in <italic>S. pombe</italic> have remained obscure for many decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Alao and Sunnerhagen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Moser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Rallis et al., 2013</xref>). A clearer understanding of the molecular pharmacology of caffeine, can draw links between genes that are important in cellular physiology and pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Alao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Alao and Sunnerhagen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Osman and McCready, 1998</xref>). We have demonstrated that caffeine accelerates mitosis in a manner partially dependent on Ssp2-mediated TORC1 inhibition. Deletion of <italic>ssp2</italic> prevents caffeine-mediated DNA damage checkpoint override but not DNA replication. In contrast, deletion of <italic>ssp1</italic> which positively regulates Cdc25 activity blocked both effects of caffeine in the presence of phleomycin. This activity is dependent on Igo1, which lies downstream of TORC1 and Gsk3. The latter, functions downstream of TORC2 to regulate protein stability and TORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Pérez-Hidalgo and Moreno, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Caffeine actions depend on TORC1-TORC2 crosstalk to drive DNA replication and mitosis via Cdc25. We also demonstrate that Ssp1 and Amk2 mediate the ability of caffeine to extend CLS. Paradoxically, while Ssp2 appears to mediate the ability of caffeine to override DNA damage checkpoint signalling, it is also required for DNA damage resistance. In the presence of other genotoxins such as hydroxyurea, caffeine may act synergistically to induce DNA damage or interfere with its repair. At the same time, activation of Ssp2 may exert a protective effect masking the effects of caffeine on DNA damage sensitivity. Our findings suggest that caffeine enhances DNA damage sensitivity independently of its effects on mitosis. It would be interesting to further compare the effects of direct Ssp2 activators and caffeine on mitosis, DNA damage sensitivity and ageing in <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Strains, media, and reagents</title><p id="P25">Strains are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.
