If the End TB 2030 strategy is to be achieved, additional drugs need to be identified and made available to supplement the current treatment regimen. In addition, drug resistance is a growing issue, leading to significantly lower treatment success rates, necessitating further drug development. Vanoxerine (GBR12909), a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor, was recently identified as having anti-mycobacterial activity. Repurposing vanoxerine or its analogues to treat tuberculosis infections may allow a faster route to clinical use than novel drug discovery. However, its effects on Mycobacteria were not well characterised. Herein, we report vanoxerine as a disruptor of the membrane potential, inhibiting mycobacterial efflux and survival, with an undetectable level of resistance. This study suggests a mechanism of action for vanoxerine, which will allow for its continued development and optimisation for pre-clinical testing.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mycobacteria</kwd><kwd>Vanoxerine</kwd><kwd>Drug repurposing</kwd><kwd>RNA-sequencing</kwd><kwd>Efflux</kwd><kwd>Antibiotic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Tuberculosis is a major cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 1.6 million deaths in 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">WHO, 2022a</xref>). <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the causative agent, is a slow growing pathogenic species responsible for this deadly lung infection in over 10 million individuals every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">WHO, 2022</xref>a). Drug resistance to the current treatment regimen is a growing issue, representing 3% of new cases and 17% of re-infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">WHO, 2021</xref>). The treatment success rate against multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis is only 60% globally, necessitating new treatment options to combat this pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">WHO, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Pai et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P3">For treatment of drug susceptible tuberculosis, a combination of four front-line drugs, ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampicin, are taken for two months.

Repurposing of drugs has been used for treating MDR tuberculosis in the past, including the use of linezolid, clofazimine and fluoroquinolones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Zumla et al., 2013</xref>). Currently, one-quarter of all ongoing clinical trials, for drug validation against tuberculosis, are focussed on repurposed drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">WHO, 2022a</xref>). However, these drugs have all been known antibacterial compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Zumla et al., 2013</xref>).

Herein, we have studied the impact of vanoxerine on mycobacteria, both phenotypic effects and transcriptomic impacts. Work has been undertaken with the aim of deconvoluting the target of vanoxerine and we suggest it targets the mycobacterial membrane, causing loss of the membrane electric potential and preventing efflux. In future, the presented work may allow the repurposing of vanoxerine or its analogues for treatment of tuberculosis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>General methods</title><p id="P8">Bacterial strains (outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) were grown in Terrific broth (E. coli), BHI broth (C. glutamicum, <italic>E. faecium</italic>), LB broth (<italic>A. baumanii</italic>, <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>), 7H9 Middlebrook broth + 0.05% Tween-80 (M. smegmatis) or 7H9 Middlebrook broth + 0.05% Tween-80 + OADC (Oleic Acid Albumin Dextrose Complex, M. bovis BCG), unless stated otherwise.

Hence, this led us to investigate the impact of vanoxerine on the cell envelope, to study the impact on membrane integrity and energy requiring processes such as efflux. Ethidium bromide uptake and efflux in Mycobacteria has previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Rodrigues et al., 2021</xref>) and allows fluorescent monitoring of the impact of drugs on membrane permeability and efflux. The MIC<sub>99</sub> for ethidium bromide against both <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG was determined to be 6.25 μg/ml. For the assays, 1/10th MIC<sub>99</sub> of ethidium bromide was used, so the cell viability was not affected during the assay. In addition, glucose was added to provide an energy source, enabling the cells to efflux more ethidium bromide.</p><p id="P22">During the 60-minute assay window, vanoxerine caused a significant difference in the accumulation of ethidium bromide inside both <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Vanoxerine concentrations as low as 0.125x MIC<sub>99</sub> (3.27 μg/ml) led to more ethidium bromide accumulation than the DMSO control. The effect was also concentration dependent, with 2x MIC<sub>99</sub> (52 μg/ml) of vanoxerine causing 2.6x more fluorescence than DMSO and 1.2x more fluorescence than 0.5x MIC<sub>99</sub> (13 μg/ml) across the 60-minutes, due to ethidium bromide accumulation. As there could be several explanations for these results, including membrane disruption/lysis, efflux inhibition or cell energetic effects, further work was undertaken.</p><p id="P23">To study inhibition of efflux by vanoxerine, Mycobacterial cells were allowed to accumulate ethidium bromide in the presence of a non-toxic efflux inhibitor verapamil. The verapamil MIC99 against <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG was greater than 100 μg/ml, having limited impact on metabolic activity at the highest tested concentration. Following ethidium bromide accumulation in Mycobacteria, verapamil was removed.</p><p id="P24">The efflux could then be monitored as loss of fluorescence. In the absence of vanoxerine or verapamil, a clear decrease in fluorescence could be observed, approximately 65% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the presence of 50 μg/ml verapamil, the decrease in fluorescence was reduced to approximately 32%, indicating inhibition of ethidium bromide efflux from the cell. In the presence of 1x and 2x MIC of vanoxerine (26 or 52 μg/ml), the drop in fluorescence was further reduced to 25% and 13% respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This indicated efflux was being inhibited by vanoxerine. Normal rates of efflux (63% drop in fluorescence) were only evident at vanoxerine concentrations of 0.125x MIC (3.27 μg/ml) and lower.

It was investigated whether vanoxerine disrupts the electric potential of the membrane by measuring DiOC<sub>2</sub>(3) membrane partitioning. Hence, <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG was pre-incubated with DiOC<sub>2</sub>(3) for two hours prior to drug addition, to allow the dye to equilibrate across the membrane proportional to the Δψ. The red/green fluorescence ratio fluctuated around 1.75 in the absence of compound, reducing to 1.60 across the 60-minute assay. Vanoxerine was able to disrupt the dye partitioning in a concentration dependent manner, with 52 μg/ml vanoxerine reducing the red/green fluorescence to 1.09 after 50 minutes, suggesting disruption of the Δψ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The membrane potential was still disrupted at sub-MIC amounts of vanoxerine, with 13 μg/ml (0.5x MIC) leading to a red/green fluorescent ratio of 1.30. CCCP is a protonophore which is known the disrupt both the Δψ and proton gradient (ΔpH) of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) and had the lowest red/green fluorescent ratio in this assay, of 0.95. Vanoxerine disrupted the DiOC<sub>2</sub>(3) dye partitioning at a slower rate compared to CCCP. The assay was specific to the Δψ disruption, rather than general proton motive force (PMF) disruption. Bedaquiline confirmed the specificity as it is known to only disrupt the ΔpH of the PMF, and hence had a response similar to DMSO in this assay, a red/green fluorescent ratio of 1.63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Feng et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, kanamycin had no impact on DiOC<sub>2</sub>(3) partitioning, with a red/green fluorescent ratio of 1.63 after 50 minutes of incubation, suggesting a general bactericidal response is less likely to explain the dyes disruption.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Vanoxerine may potentiate the activity of other anti-mycobacterial drugs</title><p id="P26">As vanoxerine appears to inhibit efflux from Mycobacteria, it was hypothesised that any anti-mycobacterial drugs which are known to be pumped out by the cell, may have increased efficacy if used alongside vanoxerine.

Checkerboard MICs against <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG were set up for bedaquiline, clofazimine and FNDR-20081 against vanoxerine. In addition, to test for synergy with front-line drugs, a rifampicin vs vanoxerine checkerboard was set up. In the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of vanoxerine (10.3 μg/ml), the MIC<sub>99</sub> of rifampicin, clofazimine and FNDR-20081 were reduced by 2x (0.05 to 0.025 μg/ml, 4.8 to 2.4 μg/ml, and 24.5 to 12.3 μg/ml, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The FIC values were calculated as 0.676 for rifampicin and 0.896 for clofazimine and FNDR-20081, with vanoxerine.

Hence, transcriptomic analysis of <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG was undertaken using RNA-sequencing following 8-hours of vanoxerine treatment. Two different drug concentrations were used, to investigate if any transcriptomic differences were concentration dependent. Vanoxerine induced clear transcriptomic differences compared to the DMSO only control, with clear separation between the no drug and 30 μg/ml vanoxerine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). 96% of the variance across the eight samples was due to the treatment conditions. The transcription of over 800 genes was significantly differentially regulated at 30 μg/ml of vanoxerine compared to a DMSO only control (fold change = 2 or more, pvalue &lt;0.05, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>)). At 15 μg/ml vanoxerine, 322 of these gene transcripts were still significantly dysregulated compared to DMSO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Comparing between vanoxerine treatment conditions; there were 304 genes in common, that were significantly dysregulated. Only 17 significantly dysregulated gene transcripts were unique to 15 μg/ml vanoxerine, whilst 510 gene transcripts were uniquely dysregulated at 30 μg/ml vanoxerine. The list of 304 common genes could be narrowed down to 31 gene transcripts that were significantly dysregulated in a concentration dependent manner, when comparing 15 μg/ml vanoxerine as a baseline to 30 μg/ml vanoxerine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).</p><p id="P29">The significantly dysregulated genes at 30 μg/ml vanoxerine were functionally annotated and clustered using the DAVID server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sherman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Huang et al., 2009</xref>), to identify pathways or biological processes that were either up- or down-regulated in response to vanoxerine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).

There was little consensus of function among the significantly upregulated genes, with the majority being of unknown function. The efflux pump MmpL5 was significantly upregulated, which could be due to an increasing impact on efflux at higher vanoxerine concentrations. The majority of significantly down-regulated transcripts were part of the mycolic acid biosynthetic pathway.

The extracted lipids were separated using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and visualised using X-ray film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Loss of trehalose mono-mycolate (TMM) occurred at 0.5x MIC of vanoxerine and trehalose di-mycolate (TDM) at 2.5x MIC of vanoxerine. The loss of TMM was quantified by comparing the radioactive counts on the TLC plate in the presence or absence of vanoxerine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). A drop in TMM from 7% of the total counts to less than 1%, confirmed it is not just lower growth in the presence of vanoxerine which is caused this decrease.

Rather, vanoxerine disrupts the membrane’s electric potential, causing downstream disruption of mycobacterial energetics.

The main difference was vanoxerine did not induce transcription of the propionate detoxification genes, <italic>prpC</italic> and <italic>prpD</italic> or the <italic>sigK</italic> regulon (<italic>sigK</italic>, <italic>rv0449c</italic>, <italic>mpt83</italic>, <italic>dipZ</italic>), except for <italic>mpt70</italic>. Overall, the high similarity of the transcriptional responses of Mycobacteria to vanoxerine and 2B8, provides further evidence that vanoxerine is impacting the PMF and cellular energetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Jeon et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">2017</xref>).</p><p id="P41">Although the lipid analysis of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> showed loss of TMM and TDM following vanoxerine treatment, the evidence suggests that vanoxerine does not directly target mycolic acid biosynthesis. This is supported by the fact that vanoxerine inhibits <italic>C. glutamicum</italic>, for which mycolic acids are not essential, with a comparable MIC<sub>99</sub> to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Vanoxerine also had equal activity against <italic>C. glutamicum</italic> wild-type and the Δpks mutant. It is more likely that the PMF dissipation caused by vanoxerine has an indirect effect on the PMF-dependent transporter MmpL3, which transports TMM across the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Su et al., 2019</xref>). This indirect inhibition is in contrast to the direct MmpL3 inhibition, which has been observed for many other antimycobacterial drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Li et al., 2019</xref>, p.3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Degiacomi et al., 2020</xref>, p.3). The observed reduction in the expression of the mycolic acid biosynthesis genes could also be an indirect result of MmpL3 inhibition leading to the accumulation of TMM and precursors in the cytoplasm. Loss of mycolates and downregulation of mycolic acid biosynthesis genes was also observed for the 2-aminoimidazole compounds, which are known to target the PMF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Jeon et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P42">In summary, vanoxerine has been confirmed as an antimycobacterial drug with the ability to disrupt the membrane potential of Mycobacteria and should be included during pre-clinical testing of novel combination therapies. Future directions of research could include confirmation of electric potential disruption in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, testing vanoxerine within a macrophage infection model, or against Mycobacteria in a hypoxia-induced latent state. In addition, analogues of vanoxerine could be synthesised to increase their potency against Mycobacteria and ideally reduce their effects on other human targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS157923-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d12aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Luke Alderwick for aiding preliminary work which later evolved into the current study.
