Disease severity increases with age starting at 30 and reaches astounding mortality rates that are ~330 fold higher in persons above 85 years of age compared to those 18-39 years old.</p><p id="P4">To understand age-specific immune pathobiology of COVID-19 we have analyzed soluble mediators, cellular phenotypes, and transcriptome from over 80 COVID-19 patients of varying ages and disease severity, carefully controlling for age as a variable. We found that reticulocyte numbers and peripheral blood transcriptional signatures robustly correlated with disease severity. By contrast, decreased numbers and proportion of naïve T-cells, reported previously as a COVID-19 severity risk factor, were found to be general features of aging and not of COVID-19 severity, as they readily occurred in older participants experiencing only mild or no disease at all. Single-cell transcriptional signatures across age and severity groups showed that severe but not moderate/mild COVID-19 causes cell stress response in different T-cell populations, and some of that stress was unique to old severe participants, suggesting that in severe disease of older adults, these defenders of the organism may be disabled from performing immune protection. These findings shed new light on interactions between age and disease severity in COVID-19.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>severity</kwd><kwd>reticulocytes</kwd><kwd>lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>T-cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is asymptomatic, mild or moderate in up to 95% infected humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], and severe in 5% of patients. Outcomes of COVID-19 are remarkably age-specific, with most of the severe cases and deaths occurring in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Infection fatality rate increases in a log-linear fashion with age in individuals older than 30 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], and culminates to be ~270-fold higher in those over 80 relative to the population 18-39 years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. In addition to age, risk factors for severe disease include hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes and male sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Importantly, geriatric frailty assessed by a clinical scale is associated with COVID-19 severity even more closely than chronological age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Correlates of disease severity were thoroughly studied. Severe cases display increased viral load and delayed viral clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] implying inadequate virus control by the immune system. In addition, multiple perturbations of both innate and adaptive immune parameters have been reported to predict disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Severe COVID-19 was reproducibly accompanied by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, namely interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, multiple cellular immunity defects were associated with COVID-19 severity, including decreased lymphocyte and increased neutrophil blood counts with an inverted neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio as a strong predictor of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Decreased naïve CD4 T-cell counts were also linked to severe COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. However, the major caveat affecting early cohort studies on severe COVID-19 was the lack of subject groups of comparable age experiencing moderate or mild disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] as well as uninfected age-matched controls. Multiple studies have compared older severe subjects to moderate subjects of younger age, potentially confounding interpretation. Even with advanced age, most patients will not present with severe disease. Therefore, to fully understand immune pathology associated with severe disease, proper age matched controls are essential.</p><p id="P7">Here we analyzed blood samples from patients with confirmed COVID-19 across a spectrum of age and severity, including older subjects with moderate/mild disease. We measured levels of soluble factors (IL-6, CRP, TNF-α. IL-1β); immune cell phenotypes; levels of apoptosis; single cell RNA-Seq profiles and antigen specific T-cell responses. We discovered that increased reticulocytes, neutrophils, CRP and IL-6 strongly correlate with disease severity irrespective of age. In our study, however, decreased naïve T-cell numbers were measured in older patients experiencing moderate, severe or no disease alike, confirming our prior results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] and suggesting that this is an age-associated, and not severity-associated phenotype. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) revealed a strong reticulocyte transcriptional signature selectively in severe COVID-19, and confirmed by increased circulating reticulocyte numbers, implying a critical role of oxygen deficit in severe disease. Other data from the scRNA-Seq revealed pathways consistent with general cellular stress and respiratory/metabolic crisis in immune cell subsets in severe COVID-19 of older participants.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Study participants</title><p id="P8">This study was approved by the University of Arizona IRB (protocol #1510182734 and #1410545697) and the Oregon Health and Science University IRB (protocol #00003007) and was conducted in accordance with all federal state and local regulations and guidelines. The cohort included 86 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals recruited in Tucson and Phoenix (AZ) and Indianapolis (IN); confirmed positive by PCR test and 64 age matched healthy community-dwelling individuals recruited in Tucson (AZ) and Portland (OR) prior to September 2019. Serum was collected from additional 17 patients hospitalized with non-COVID-19 related ARDS in Tucson (AZ). Healthy participants received nominal participation incentive. All SARS-CoV-2 positive participants underwent venipuncture within 3 weeks from symptom onset (mean=11.57 ± 5.04 days). COVID-19 participants were scored for disease severity according to WHO clinical progression scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Study participants were divided into the following groups; moderate adult (MOD-A), moderate old (MOD-O), severe adult (SEV-A), severe old (SEV-O), adult healthy controls (CTRL-A) and old healthy controls (CTRL-O). 47% of SARS-CoV-2 positive participants were female, and healthy controls were age- and sex-matched. Blood was drawn into BD Vacutainer Blood Collection Tubes with Sodium Heparin (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and in BD Vacutainer tubes with K<sub>2</sub>EDTA (for complete blood counts). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated by Ficoll gradient separation from heparinized blood and cryopreserved in fetal calf serum (FCS) + 10% DMSO. Cryopreserved PBMC (5 x 10<sup>6</sup>/sample) were thawed in prewarmed RPMI-1640 media supplemented with L-glutamine (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) + 10% FCS.

The overall sequence depth was ~ 50000 reads/cell using the NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The demultiplexed reads obtained from NovaSeq were first aligned to a reference human genome assembly (GRCh38-3.0.0) using the Cell Ranger pipeline (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). The feature barcode matrices, overall sample summaries and cloupe &amp; vloupe files were generated using the Cell Ranger count. Further downstream analysis was done using Seurat R package v4.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. QC analysis was performed on each individual feature barcode matrix. All the cells expressing less than 200 genes were discarded, we filtered out cells expressing &gt;10% of mitochondrial genes and performed doublet scoring and removal using the `scrublet` package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].

Group differences were calculated either by Mann Whitney U-test, one-way ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis test with post hoc correction based on model assumptions (normality of residuals, heterogeneity of variances, etc). We used multivariable linear regression to predict both severity and days from onset of symptoms. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation and predictive mean matching through the Hmisc package in R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Graphical representation of the contribution of each predictor variable to the fitted model after adjusting for all other predictors is shown by graphical representation of an ordered dot plot for each predictor (y-axis) by the partial χ<sup>2</sup> test statistic scaled by the degrees of freedom for each variable (x-axis); the partial χ<sup>2</sup> test statistic and p-values are shown on the left side of the graphs. In addition to showing relative contribution of each of the predictors, we use R<sup>2</sup> as a metric of predictive capacity of the model. With a sample size of 99 and 27 potential predictor variables there was a high degree of potential overfitting (e.g., overoptimization of model performance). We calculated overfitting by comparing R<sup>2</sup> across 200 bootstrap resamples and reported a corrected R<sup>2</sup> as the difference between the original R<sup>2</sup> and the average R<sup>2</sup> across the 200 bootstrap resamples. Additionally, to further reduce model overfitting, variable reduction was performed by penalized maximum likelihood described in Friedman et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>].

We have stratified participants into groups matched by disease severity and age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>). We scored disease severity across a range from 0 (not infected) to 10 (deceased) according to the WHO Clinical Progression Scale[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] with scores ≥6 (receiving oxygen by non-invasive ventilation) considered severe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>). If the subject progressed to a worse clinical outcome the highest recorded score was used. COVID-19 disease severity and infection fatality risk increases sharply after age 50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Therefore, we classified all the participants less than 50 years old (yo) as adults, and those over 55 as older (subjects 50-55 yo were excluded from the study). By these standards our total group size was N=18 adults with moderate disease (MOD-A, average age 34.17 ± 7.64), N=22 older adults with moderate disease (MOD-O, age 74.23 ± 9.42), N=24 adults with severe disease (SEV-A, age 39.67 ± 9.46) and N=22 (SEV-O, age 74.50 ± 6.91) older adults with severe disease. All subjects were sampled within 3 weeks of symptom onset and groups did not differ in time from onset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1C</xref>).

We found that neutrophils were increased in both COVID-19 SEV-A and SEV-O, as well as non-COVID ARDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). On the other hand, lymphopenia was pronounced only in older adults with severe disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Median lymphocyte count in SEV-A was reduced compared to CTRL-A (0.99 k/μl vs. 1.75 k/μl) but the difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). For neutrophil to lymphocytes ratios, both COVID-19 severe groups and non-COVID ARDS exhibited higher values compared to age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). We found no difference between the groups in monocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) or eosinophil counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Basophils were decreased in both severe COVID-19 groups and non-COVID ARDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Some of the cytokines previously reported to be increased in severe COVID-19 like IL-6[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], CRP and TNF-α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] are known to be increased with age even in the absence of infection.

Therefore, irrespective of age, severe COVID-19 remains characterized by increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, elevated CRP and IL-6, the features shared by non-COVID ARDS, whereas TNFα elevation is found in SEV-A and non-COVID ARDS, but not SEV-O COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>COVID-19 severity analysis with age by unbiased clustering of flow cytometry data</title><p id="P16">We designed a 32-marker flow cytometric panel to analyze PBMCs from COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls (antibody list in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>. Given the high dimensionality of our flow cytometric panel, we first applied an unbiased computational approach for subpopulation clustering by using Cytobank Citrus to identify cell subsets differentially represented between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The pamr package in R was used to classify abundance clusters necessary to differentiate the groups, resulting in four clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Cluster 1 exhibited a CD3+CD8+CD28+CD95- phenotype, corresponding to naïve CD8 T-cells, and this cluster was less abundant in all three older groups (uninfected control, moderate and severe) compared to their adult counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Cluster 2 did not express any of the markers in the staining panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) and was elevated in both SEV-A and SEV-O compared to all other groups. Cluster 3 exhibited a CD3+CD4+CD28+CD95-CD45RA+ phenotype, representing naïve CD4 T-cells and was decreased in SEV-A, SEV-O and MOD-O. Cluster 4 was CD3+CD4+CD28+CD95-CD45RA- corresponding to central memory CD4 T-cells and was decreased in SEV-O compared to all the other groups. Thus, overall unbiased clustering identified several T-cell subpopulations which differed in abundance between the groups and a cluster of unknown origin which was elevated in both severe groups irrespective of age.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Reticulocyte accumulation is a robust and age-independent predictor of COVID-19 severity</title><p id="P17">To identify the nature of the cluster 2 cells, which was elevated in severe subjects irrespective of age, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on 15 COVID patients from each group to gain insight into transcriptional signatures and pathways associated with severity. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> shows the demographics and the number of cells analyzed individually for each patient.

We thus hypothesized that nucleated cells expressing hemoglobin genes might be reticulocytes, potentially generated in response to hypoxia and anemia in severe COVID-19 cases.</p><p id="P18">Reticulocytes express the transferrin receptor (CD71) and do not express leukocyte common antigen CD45 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. We therefore performed additional flow cytometric staining for these markers in all participants. We confirmed the existence of this CD45-CD71+ population within the lymphocyte gate selectively in severe cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Given that this population was contained within the lymphocyte gate by forward and side scatter, we excluded the possibility that these are mature erythrocytes. Furthermore, this population did not express any of the classical lineage markers of immune cells such as CD3, CD19, CD16, CD11b and CD15 but did express higher levels of CD147 (Basigin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), known to be highly expressed on reticulocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. This cell population was elevated in both severe groups irrespective of age compared to all the other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Naïve CD8 T-cell loss is an age-sensitive trait not linked to COVID-19 severity</title><p id="P19">To further confirm Citrus clustering, we performed traditional manual gating of T-cell phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Similar to Citrus clustering, flow cytometric gating showed that decreased proportion of naïve CD8 T-cells was a characteristic of all three advanced age groups (CTRL-O, MOD-O and SEV-O) and not associated with COVID-19 severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). When translated into absolute counts per μL of blood, due to overall lower lymphocyte counts, the severe cases did have lower naïve T-cell counts than their age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). However, older adult controls also had lower naïve CD8 counts compared to their adult counterparts. Moreover, naïve CD4s were also decreased in MOD-O, thus we cannot conclude that a decrease in naïve T-cells is a general feature of severity. Other T-cell subsets, such as central memory T-cells, were decreased in absolute count in severe cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">3B</xref>) although not decreased as a proportion of total T-cells. The proportion of CD8+ T-cells with effector/memory (Tem) phenotype was increased in severe adults (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3C</xref>), but there was no difference in proportion of terminally differentiated Temra cells. In both cases this did not translate into any difference in absolute numbers between the groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3D</xref>). Additionally, we measured antigen-specific T-cells reactive to overlapping peptide pools spanning the entire Spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) by ELISPOT. There was no difference in number of N, M, or S antigen-specific T-cells between SARS-CoV-2 positive groups by age or severity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3E</xref>). Moreover, we observed very few cross-reactive T-cells in samples from control participants recruited prior to the pandemic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Reticulocytes, CRP levels and neutrophil count are the variables most predictive of COVID-19 severity</title><p id="P20">To integrate and directly compare severity-related parameters for their predictive strength, we analyzed how all cytokine and cell flow cytometry variables correlated to patient severity scores and time from disease onset as a potential confounder. Variable selection was performed using regularized regression and selected variables were visualized by ranking the “importance” based on Wald χ<sup>2</sup> test statistics. We calculate overfitting by comparing R<sup>2</sup> across 200 bootstrap resamples and report a corrected R<sup>2</sup> as the difference between the original R<sup>2</sup> and the average R<sup>2</sup>, this measure can be used as an internal validation. Bootstrap resampling on all 27 predictor variables resulted in poor model performance for both outcome variables. RBC and CRP displayed the highest adjusted Wald test statistics for severity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4A</xref>) and percentage of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells for days since onset of COVID-10 symptoms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4B</xref>); For both severity and time from onset there were only two variables that were statistically significant when all measured variables were included. Therefore, we used regularized regression to reduce the number of variables and comparisons; selected variables included percent reticulocytes; Ba; RBC; % TEM of CD8; % TEMRA; TNFα; IL6; and CRP for the severity outcome. For the days from COVID-19 symptom onset Mo; Eo, Ba; and IL6 were selected. The severity outcome resulted in 6 statistically significant variables with p-values &lt; 0.05 and a corrected R<sup>2</sup> of 0.575, with reticulocytes, CRP and neutrophil counts were most predictive of disease severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Days from symptom onset was not associated with any potential predictors, and also demonstrated by a poor predictive fit (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.20) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). We assume that observed differences were not influenced by individual differences in time from disease onset between COVID19 groups, with means (SD) in the MOD-A, MOD-O, SEV-A and SEV-O of 13.5 (5.9); 13.11 (7.1); 14.2 (6.9); and 11.9 (6.5), respectfully. Thus, we conclude that in all severe subjects, irrespective of age, reticulocytes, CRP levels and neutrophil counts were the variables most robustly associated with COVID-19 severity scores.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Cellular stress and crisis signatures characterize transcriptomes of multiple T-cell subsets in older participants with severe COVID-19 (SEV-O)</title><p id="P21">To begin to address the condition- and age-wise transcriptional differences across the samples, we performed additional scRNA-seq analysis on a subset of patients (described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and applied differential expression analysis genes between the pairwise categories such as SEV-O and MOD-O (Methods). Differentially expressed genes with an adjusted p-value (adj. p-val) □ 00001 obtained from such comparisons, along with their log2 fold change (logFC) values were subjected to pathway analysis. GSEA was used to identify the pathways that were enriched for either severity or for age. Individual pathway enrichment comparisons are shown in Figure 8 for selected CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets comparing SEV-O to MOD-O and SEV-O to SEV-A groups. We found consistent enrichment of cellular and oxidative stress, catabolism, starvation and negative regulation of biosynthetic processes (including RNA metabolism) pathways in five T-cell subsets of SEV-O patients: CD8 naïve (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5A</xref>) and effector memory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">5C</xref>), and CD4 central memory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5D</xref>), effector memory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">5F</xref>) and cytotoxic (CTL) clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">5H</xref>). By contrast, in these same cell subsets MOD-O and SEV-A participants exhibited enrichment for antiviral immune pathways, including negative regulation of viral processes, upregulation of interferon response and cytokine responses, and defense responses to microorganisms. While these results require detailed experimental substantiation, overall pathway enrichment suggests that while COVID-19 transcriptional profiles in T-cells of MOD-O and even SEV-A patients involved immune defense pathway activation across T-cell subsets, their SEV-O counterparts were unable to mount such defense and were instead engaged in cell survival in the face of severe cellular stress.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>CD8 but not CD4 T-cell apoptosis characterizes COVID-19, and naïve CD8 T-cell apoptosis selectively predicts disease severity</title><p id="P22">Significantly enriched pathways related to cellular stress, catabolism and death prompted us to examine whether COVID-19 severity also mechanistically correlated to lymphocyte death. We plotted the expression of caspase 3 (CASP3), a member of the final effector enzyme complex that mediates apoptotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] within the scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) and found its expression to be even across multiple cell types. We assessed functional importance of these observations by measuring Annexin V and CASP-3 staining by flow cytometry. Annexin V is commonly used for staining of apoptotic cells due to its ability to bind phosphatidylserine which is translocated on the outer membrane in apoptotic cells while caspase-3 is a part of apoptosis signaling in T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] (see gating strategy for flow cytometric analysis of T-cell apoptosis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>. We found that caspase-3 was significantly elevated in CD8+ T-cells but not CD4+ T-cells selectively in SEV-O T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), whereas Annexin-V staining showed a similar trend but was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Upon closer examination of CD8+ T-cell subsets it was revealed that caspase-3 was elevated only in naïve and Tcm CD8+ T-cells but not Tem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that severe COVID-19 may result in bystander T-cell apoptosis. Pathway enrichment analysis showed a positive correlation (FDR q-value &lt;0.1) for intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway supporting the above observation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 6A</xref>). Top genes from the leading edge for this pathway clearly show higher expression in SEV-O participants as compared to other participants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 6B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">COVID-19 severity is associated with impaired viral control, as severe cases have been found to have higher viral titers and delayed viral clearance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], uncoordinated adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] and hyperinflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. To gain further insight into immune phenotypes associated with COVID-19 severity we recruited a cohort which included adult and older demographic groups with severe COVID-19 and age matched controls with moderate disease. In many previous studies participants with severe COVID-19 were on average much older than participants with moderate disease, potentially confounding interpretation of results. We show that decreased proportion and absolute number of naïve T-cells are manifested by participants with severe COVID-19 but also by older adults with moderate disease and even older adult healthy controls. On the other hand, we show that neutrophilia and increased neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio is characteristic for all severe subjects irrespective age. This was not surprising, as abundant evidence implicated neutrophils and increased neutrophil extracellular trap formation as playing a central role in coagulopathy, organ damage, and immunothrombosis in severe COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>].

To our knowledge this is the first report documenting association of increased reticulocytes with COVID-19 severity score. One previous study showed increased reticulocyte counts in critically ill hospitalized patients compared to non-critical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. However, multiple studies have shown that anemia is associated with severe illness in COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Thus, an increase in erythrocyte precursors can be viewed as an adaptation to anemia. scRNA-Seq confirmed the reticulocyte signature and revealed signaling pathways associated with cell stress and apoptosis were elevated in severe COVID-19, which was then confirmed by apoptosis assays, documenting selective upregulation particularly in old participants.</p><p id="P25">Overall, our results document new biomarkers of COVID-19 severity (reticulocytes) and further confirm the value of some (CRP, IL-6, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios) biomarkers of COVID-19 severity as being universally applicable regardless of age, while refuting predictive values of others (numbers of Tn CD8 cells, which are solely sensitive to age). Finally, our results also contribute to mechanistic understanding of severe COVID-19 by identification of cellular stress and apoptotic responses in the very cells that are supposed to be defending the organism against the virus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS159033-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d74aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Supported in part by the USPHS awards from the National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging, R37AG020719 and the Bowman Professorship in Medical Sciences to J.N-Ž.
