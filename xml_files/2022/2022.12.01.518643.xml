The emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and most recently SARS-CoV-2 has prompted increased attention to coronavirus biology and immunopathology, but identification and characterization of the T cell response to seasonal human coronaviruses remain largely uncharacterized. Here we report the repertoire of viral peptides that are naturally processed and presented upon infection of a model cell line with seasonal human coronavirus OC43. We identified MHC-I and MHC-II bound peptides derived from the viral spike, nucleocapsid, hemagglutinin-esterase, 3C-like proteinase, and envelope proteins. Only three MHC-I bound OC43-derived peptides were observed, possibly due to the potent MHC-I downregulation induced by OC43 infection. By contrast, 80 MHC-II bound peptides corresponding to 14 distinct OC43-derived epitopes were identified, including many at very high abundance within the overall MHC-II peptidome. These peptides elicited low-abundance recall T cell responses in most donors tested. In vitro assays confirmed that the peptides were recognized by CD4+ T cells and identified the presenting HLA alleles. T cell responses cross-reactive between OC43, SARS-CoV-2, and the other seasonal coronaviruses were confirmed in samples of peripheral blood and peptide-expanded T cell lines. Among the validated epitopes, S<sub>903-917</sub> presented by DPA1*01:03/DPB1*04:01 and S<sub>1085-1099</sub> presented by DRB1*15:01 shared substantial homology to other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and were targeted by cross-reactive CD4 T cells. N<sub>54-68</sub> and HE<sub>128-142</sub> presented by DRB1*15:01 and HE<sub>259-273</sub> presented by DPA1*01:03/DPB1*04:01 are immunodominant epitopes with low coronavirus homology that are not cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the set of naturally processed and presented OC43 epitopes comprise both OC43-specific and human coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes, which can be used to follow T cell cross-reactivity after infection or vaccination and could aid in the selection of epitopes for inclusion in pan-coronavirus vaccines.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses of the genus <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, family <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> that infect vertebrates. Seven species in the <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic> sub-family are known to infect humans, with a wide range of pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E and NL63 in the <italic>alpha-coronavirus</italic> genus, and OC43 and HKU1 in the <italic>beta-coronavirus</italic> genus, are associated with mild upper-respiratory-tract infections and common colds. In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, all in the <italic>beta-coronavirus</italic> genus, are associated with a severe respiratory syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Common-cold-associated seasonal HCoVs are widespread and infect humans in seasonal waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. OC43 is closely related to bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and was initially isolated in 1967 from individuals with upper respiratory tract infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Among the seasonal human coronaviruses, OC43 is believed to have emerged most recently. Molecular clock analysis of the spike gene sequences suggests a relatively recent zoonotic transmission event and dates their most recent common ancestor between 1890 to 1923 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. This led to the proposal that the 1898 pandemic (“Russian Flu”), which caused a worldwide multi-wave outbreak killing preferentially older individuals similar to COVID-19, may have been the result of the emergence of OC43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The OC43 reference genome (ATCC-VR-759) spans 30,738 kbp, encoding 10 ORFs which are translated into 24 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Before the emergence of the pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, few studies characterized the immune response to the seasonal HCoVs, which account for ∼10-30% of common colds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Studies of T cell responses to HCoVs and the identification of epitopes driving them are scarce. Before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, Nilges et al. identified a coronavirus MHC-I epitope derived from the OC43 NS2 protein using MHC-binding prediction algorithms and showed that T cell responses were cross-reactive with a human papillomavirus 16 epitope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Later, Boucher et al. studied T cell responses to OC43 and 229E viral antigens and to multiple sclerosis (MS) autoantigens in MS patients. Virus-specific T cell clones were isolated, including 34 clones responding to OC43, as well as 10 T cell clones cross-reactive with HCoV and MS autoantigens, but the specific viral epitopes were not identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. More recently, after the rise of SARS-CoV-2, Woldemeskel et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] reported T cell responses to pools of spike, nucleoprotein, and membrane proteins of the four seasonal coronaviruses. Peptide responses to the spike protein of NL63 were deconvoluted resulting in the identification of 22 target peptides, of which 3 are SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive and the remaining 19 are HCoV-specific novel epitopes.</p><p id="P4">Studies of T-cell responses to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have reported that responding T cell populations are present in blood samples collected before the emergence of these viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. This led to the suggestion that pre-existing immunity, potentially elicited by a previous infection(s) with seasonal HCoVs, could be responsible for these responses, and prompted a search for the cross-reactive epitopes responsible. In fact, most OC43 epitopes reported in the Immune Epitope Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] were identified in the context of HCoV/SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactivity studies. Schmidt et al. used a highly conserved peptide derived from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein to identify cross-reactive MHC-I responses and found that homologous HCoV peptides, including one from OC43, also were recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Mateus et al. used overlapping SARS-CoV-2 peptides to screen for cross-reactive responses in unexposed donors and identified six MHC-II epitopes from five source proteins, for which responses to the OC43 homologs could also be observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Keller et al. identified a cross-reactive OC43 epitope derived from the nucleocapsid, which induced responses in SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells expanded from COVID-19 recovered donors using SARS-CoV-2 antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Ferretti et al. reported a cross-reactive MHC-I epitope derived from the nucleocapsid, highly conserved among beta-coronaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], and Lineburg et al. found that the immunodominant response to this peptide is widespread in HLA-B7+ individuals, both recovered COVID-19 and unexposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] identified a highly conserved and cross-reactive MHC-II SARS-CoV-2 epitope (S<sub>811-831</sub>), derived from a conserved region in the spike protein and presented in the context of HLA-DP4 (DPA1*01:03/DPB1*04:01), HLA-DP2 (DPA1*01:03/DPB1*02:01), and HLA-DQ5 (DQA1*01:01/DQB1*05:01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Despite these advances, an unbiased approach to the identification of OC43 T cell epitopes independent of SARS-CoV-2 reactivity has not been reported.</p><p id="P5">T cell epitope identification can be approached in different ways, including screening of overlapping peptide libraries, predicting potential epitopes using MHC-binding prediction algorithms, or identifying naturally processed and presented peptides eluted from purified MHC molecules isolated from infected cells. In this work, we used the latter method, which has proven to be very efficient in identifying immunogenic peptides in human T cell responses to vaccinia virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], HHV-6B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], measles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], EBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], and SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] and in mouse responses to vaccinia virus where this was validated extensively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Here, we identified and characterized naturally-processed viral epitopes presented by HEK293 cells transfected with master transcriptional regulator CIITA and infected with OC43. CIITA served to upregulate the expression of MHC-II molecules and associated antigen presentation machinery (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]), as in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,41–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Overall, 83 naturally processed viral peptides were identified: 3 peptides were identified as associated with the MHC-I proteins HLA-A*02:01 or HLA-B*07:02, and 80 viral peptides representing length variants of 14 unique MHC-II epitopes were identified as associated with HLA-DRB1*15:01, HLA-DRB5*01:01, or HLA-DPA1*01:03/DPB1*04:02. T cell responses to 11 of the peptides were observed in partially HLA-matched donors, confirming the immunogenicity of these peptides. Among the naturally presented peptides identified was S<sub>901-920</sub>, orthologous to a highly conserved, frequently identified, cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 epitope S<sub>811-831</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Characterization of MHC-I and MHC-II immunopeptidomes presented in OC43-infected cells</title><p id="P6">Our experimental approach to the identification and characterization of naturally processed epitopes is diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>. Peptide-MHC complexes carrying naturally processed and presented peptides were isolated by immunoaffinity from OC43-infected cells, and bound peptides were eluted and characterized by mass spectrometry. Next, peptides corresponding to the naturally processed epitopes were synthesized, tested for HLA binding, and used for evaluation of T cell responses in mononuclear cells from peripheral blood samples. We used the cell line HEK293, which is homozygous in all MHC-I and MHC-II loci and susceptible to being infected with the OC43 virus. The HLA alleles present in this cell line are: A*02:01 (A2), B*07:02 (B7), C*07:02 (C7), DRB1*15:01 (DR2b), DRB5*01:01 (DR2a), DPA1*01:03/DPB1*04:02 (DP4.2), and DQA1*01:02/DQB1*06:02 (DQ6.2).</p><p id="P7">We measured the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II on the surface of HEK293 cells using antibodies recognizing the three MHC-I proteins HLA-ABC or the individual MHC-II proteins HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP. Expression of HLA-ABC was detected, but levels of HLA-DR, HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ were very low or below detection limits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>, wild type HEK293). To induce expression of MHC-II, HEK293 cells were transduced with CIITA, the MHC-II master transcriptional regulator that controls the expression of MHC-II genes along with MHC-II processing and editing factors such as HLA-DM and cathepsins (reviewed in[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]). Transduced cells successfully upregulated the expression of HLA-DR and DP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>, HEK293.CIITA), although HLA-DQ levels remained low. To confirm the low HLA-DQ expression level, the relative amounts of total MHC proteins were measured using a quantitative proteomics analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The levels of HLA-DQ were ∼20-fold lower than HLA-DR and HLA-DP. Thus, we restricted immunopeptidome analysis to HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, and HLA-DP.</p><p id="P8">HEK293.CIITA cells were infected with OC43 strain VR-759 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 and harvested on day 3 post-infection. Intracellular staining for OC43 nucleoprotein (N) showed a clear positive population of virus-infected cells at harvest, as compared to non-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). In 6 biological replicates, we observed that 11-68% of the HEK293.CIITA cells were positive for OC43 nucleoprotein expression.</p><p id="P9">Viruses have evolved many mechanisms to evade the immune system, including the downregulation of MHC proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. To assess the effect of OC43 infection on the expression of MHC-I and II on HEK293.CIITA cells, we evaluated the surface expression of HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, and HLA-DP after infection. The levels of HLA-ABC were significantly reduced after infection (an average of 60% reduction in median fluorescence intensity (MFI)), while the expression of HLA-DR and HLA-DP were mostly not affected (less than 10% reduction in MFI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>). This suggests that OC43 has a specific effect on the expression of MHC-I. While no apparent effect was observed for MHC-II, it is possible that CIITA transfection counteracts any effect of virus infection in our system as reported for SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>].</p><p id="P10">We used a conventional immunoaffinity peptidomics workflow to identify peptides presented by MHC molecules in the infected cells. We purified MHC-bound complexes of two independent infections (62 and 116 x10<sup>6</sup> cells) using immunoprecipitation after detergent solubilization of the membrane fraction of OC43-infected HEK293.CIITA cells. We used sequential immunoaffinity purification with anti-HLA-DR (LB3.1), anti-HLA-DP (B7/21), and anti-HLA-ABC (W6/32) antibodies, collecting three immunoprecipitated samples, one from each antibody, per biological replicate infection. The MHC-bound peptides were released from the purified MHC complexes by acid treatment, separated from the MHC protein subunits, and the resulting peptide mix was analyzed by LC-MS/MS for sequence identification. A database containing human and OC43 protein sequences was used for peptide assignment, with false-discovery rate (FDR) of 4.2%. The total immunopeptidome of infected cells consisted of 1,744 unique peptides (613 HLA-ABC, 629 HLA-DR, and 502 HLA-DP, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2a-c</xref>). The eluted peptides showed the expected length distribution peaking at 9 aa for HLA-ABC and 15-16 aa for HLA-DR and -DP, although HLA-DP showed a small peak of 8-11 residue peptides that might include non-specifically bound species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F</xref>). The immunopeptidome comprises both viral and host protein-derived peptides, with ∼96% of host-derived peptides.</p><p id="P11">The eluted peptide pools contain contributions from multiple MHC proteins. HLA-ABC eluted peptides were a mix of peptides eluted from the three MHC-I proteins present in HEK293.CIITA. cells. Likewise, HLA-DR peptides were a mix of peptides eluted from the genetically-linked DRB1*15:01 and DRB5*01:01 proteins. To help deconvolute these mixtures of peptides, we used unsupervised Gibbs clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>] of the eluted sequences in each sample. This analysis showed the presence of 2 motifs for MHC-I, representing 42 and 41% of the sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F</xref>, HLA-ABC). These motifs closely matched those previously characterized for A*02:01 and B*07:02 by NetMHCpan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>], as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>. The characteristic C*07:02 motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>] was not observed in the clustering analysis. We observed 2 motifs for HLA-DR, representing 73 and 24% of the sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F</xref>, HLA-DR). The more abundant motif closely matched that previously characterized for DRB1*15:01 (DR2b), and the less abundant motif matched that for DRB5*01:01 (DR2a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). For HLA-DP, one motif representing 87% of the sequences was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F</xref>, HLA-DP), closely matching the expected DPA1*01:03/DPB1*04:02 motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Sequences not present in these clusters could represent non-canonical binders, ambiguities in the clustering for motif analyses, or the presence of non-specific peptides. For each eluted peptide, binding predictions for the relevant MHC-I (NetMHCpan 4.1), or MHC-II (NetMHCIIpan 4.0) proteins are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2a-c</xref>. For DP4 we include predictions for both DPA1*01:02/DPB1*04:01 (DP4.1) and DPA1*01:02/DPB1*04:02 (DP4.2); peptides were eluted from DP4.2 cells, but the closely related DP4.1 protein was used for MHC-peptide binding studies and both DP4.1 and/or DP4.2 expressing donors were used for T cell studies (see below).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Identification of viral peptides presented by HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, and HLA-DP</title><p id="P12">Within the immunopeptidome eluted from OC43-infected HEK293.CIITA cells, a total of 83 peptides corresponded to sequences from the OC43 virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2d</xref>). Among the viral peptides, 3 were eluted from HLA-ABC, 35 from HLA-DR, and 45 from HLA-DP, representing 0.6, 5.6, and 9.4% of the peptides isolated from each type of MHC protein.

P12 peptides were predicted to bind in the top 5<sup>th</sup> percentile for both DR2b and DR2a, and P13 peptides were not predicted to bind to either DR2b or DR2a. For HLA-DP predicted binding was in the top 5<sup>th</sup> percentile for P2, P3, P5, P6, P7, and P14 peptides, but P1 and P4 were below this threshold. To experimentally assess MHC-II peptide binding for the eluted peptides, we used a fluorescence polarization competition binding assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>] with synthetic peptides and purified recombinant MHC proteins.

We selected donors with a partial HLA match to HEK293 cells (donors expressing DRB1*15:01 and DRB5*01:01 for DR peptides, and donors expressing DPA1*01:03/DPB1*04:02 or DPB1*04:01 for DP peptides, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). We expected prior exposure of these donors to OC43 or other seasonal coronaviruses, but serum was not available from these donors to confirm exposure serologically. We first assessed T cell responses directly ex vivo in PBMC samples using ELISpot assays with the same set of peptides as tested for MHC-II binding. Ex-vivo IFN-γ responses were measured in donors expressing at least one of the alleles of interest, by stimulating PBMCs with a pool of all DP or all DR peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Positive responses were observed in most donors tested (6/9 for DP and 8/9 for DR). Responding T cells were present at low frequencies, which varied considerably between donors (0.007-0.057% for DP; 0.001-0.011% for DR). Note that in this assay other HLA alleles are present in the donors besides the HEK293 alleles used for the elution studies, but with very few exceptions these alleles are the best predicted binders among the HLA-DR, HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ alleles present in each donor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To increase the frequency of OC43-responding cells for detailed assessment of the responses to individual peptides, we expanded peptide-specific T cells in vitro. Using the expanded T cell populations, we measured IFN-γ production in response to re-stimulation with the same peptides, individually presented by single-allele antigen presenting cells (DPA1*01:03/DPB1*04:01 for P1-P7 and P14, DRB1*15:01 for P8-P13, and DRB5*01:01 for P9 and P12). Eleven peptides (all except P8, P13 and P14) showed individual positive responses by IFN-γ ELISpot in at least one of the donors analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B-C</xref>, bars and filled symbols), validating the presence of T cell responses to the peptide. Not every donor responded to every peptide, and different donors showed different patterns of responses. The fraction of donors who are positive for each of the responding peptides ranged from 60-100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B-C</xref>, pies). In general, responses were more frequently observed (p=0.006) in DR15 donors (80-100%) than in DP4 donors (60-88%), while responses were slightly stronger for DP peptides (3.7 ± 2.1×10<sup>3</sup> SFU/10<sup>6</sup> cells) than DR peptides (2.2 ± 1.8×10<sup>3</sup> SFU/10<sup>6</sup> cells) when tested at 1 μg/mL peptide concentration, although this difference is not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>). There was a weak but significant correlation between the eluted peptide abundance (sum of precursor ion intensities by nested set) and the observed T cell response (r= 0.64, p= 0.009, Spearman). No correlation was observed between binding (predicted or experimental) and T cell responses, nor between binding and peptide abundance.</p><p id="P20">To explore the overall sensitivity of the different peptide-expanded T cells, dose-response experiments were performed, and the minimal activating peptide concentrations were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3E-F</xref>). In general, a wide range of minimal concentrations was observed. For instance, for P2 and P3 the minimal concentrations were 10<sup>-6</sup> μg/mL and 10<sup>-7</sup> μg/mL, respectively for expanded cells from donor 61, while for P11 (donor 07) and P9 (donor 40), the minimal concentration was 1 μg/mL. This indicates that T cells responding to P2 and P3 in donor 61 were more sensitive to lower peptide concentrations and may be able to respond more efficiently to infection. Within donors, differences in minimal concentration were observed for different peptides, suggesting a heterogeneous population that responds to different antigens with different efficiencies. In some cases, different donors showed similar sensitivity to a particular peptide, as is the case of P10 in donors 18, 22, and 40, which all responded at 10<sup>-5</sup> μg/mL. However, in other cases, there was heterogeneity in the responses to a given peptide. For instance, for P4 the minimal concentration varied between 0.1 and 10<sup>-5</sup> μg/mL in 4 donors. All these results may reflect the different history of exposure to OC43 and other coronaviruses and the evolution of the responding T cell repertoire in each individual, which translates to a lack of a clear hierarchy of functional avidity and immunodominance for most of the eluted peptides.</p><p id="P21">To characterize the T cells producing these responses, we performed intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assays using the single-peptide-expanded T cell lines. As in the ELISpot assays, peptides P8, P13, and P14 did not produce a response. For the remaining 11 peptides, IFN-γ responses were observed exclusively in CD4+ T cell populations.

Among the eluted peptides, P4, P6, and P11 are the most conserved across the 7 viruses and would be expected to have a high potential for cross-reactivity. The remaining peptides (P1, P2, P3, P5, P7, P8, P9, P10, P12, P13, and P14) were less conserved. Note that the HE protein, the source of the P1, P8, and P9 epitopes, is expressed by OC43 and HKU1 but does not have a homolog in any other HCoVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P24">To evaluate experimentally the potential for cross-reactivity we initially focused on OC43 and SARS-CoV-2. We measured responses to the eluted OC43 peptides and their SARS-CoV-2 homologs, using T cell populations expanded with individual OC43 peptides from PBMC samples banked pre-pandemic before the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 into the human population. Peptides with no homolog in SARS-CoV-2 (P1, P8, P9), or with no response in our donor pool (P8, P13, P14) were excluded. We measured T cell responses in single-peptide-expanded T cell lines using IFN-γ ELISpot assays, using partial-HLA-matched donors as before. Only the P4 and P11 SARS-CoV-2 homologs induced cross-reactive T cell responses in the single-peptide expanded lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). Across a larger set of donors, similar cross-reactive responses were observed, with somewhat lower responses to the heterologous SARS-CoV-2 homologs than the OC43 peptides used for expansion (average 2-fold, p=0.044 for P4 and average 3.5-fold, p=0.011 for P11; paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). This indicates that a substantial proportion of T cells responding to the OC43-P4 and OC43-P11 peptides can cross-react with their SARS-CoV-2 homologs. To evaluate the sensitivity of these T cell lines to cross-reactive stimulation, we measured the dose-response to cognate and heterologous peptides. Robust cross-reactivity to heterologous stimulation was observed across the dose-response range for both P4 and P11 homologs in all donors tested, including pre-pandemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>) and those with recent COVID-19 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>), with minimal stimulatory peptide concentrations in a wide range but similar for OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4E</xref>).</p><p id="P25">To explore factors that could have resulted in the observed pattern of OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive responses, we measured MHC binding of the SARS-CoV-2 homologs and compared them to the OC43 peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4F</xref>). We found weaker binding for most of the SARS-CoV-2 homologs, with the exception of P4, for which DP4.1 binding was 10-fold greater for the SARS-CoV-2 homolog. In addition to altering MHC binding affinity, amino acid substitutions can cause shifting of the preferred binding register, which would interfere with T cell recognition of homologous peptides. Of the nine peptides tested, only P3, P4, and P11 retain the predicted binding register in the SARS-CoV-2 homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4G</xref>), and only for P4 and P11 are the predicted T cell contacts completely or mostly conserved (shaded in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4G</xref>).</p><p id="P26">We extended this analysis to the other seasonal human coronaviruses, using the T cell lines expanded in vitro with P4 and P11 peptides from pre-pandemic and COVID-19 donors.

To help fill this gap we identified naturally processed and presented viral epitopes expressed in OC43-infected cells using immunoaffinity purification of MHC-peptide complexes followed by mass spectrometry of eluted peptides. Only three viral peptides presented by MHC-I molecules were identified within the overall immunopeptidome of CIITA-transfected OC43-infected HEK293 cells, possibly due to virus-induced down-regulation of MHC-I expression. A total of 83 viral peptides presented by MHC-II molecules were identified, representing 14 distinct core epitopes present in nested sets characteristic of MHC-II processing. Eleven of these OC43-derived epitopes were recognized by recall responses in partially-HLA-matched donors. Almost all of the OC43-derived MHC epitopes identified in this work are reported here for the first time, although T responses to the two highly-cross-reactive epitopes P4 and P11 have been reported previously in studies characterizing seasonal coronavirus cross-reactivity to identified SARS-CoV-2 epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>].</p><p id="P28">We identified only a few OC43-derived peptides presented by MHC-I molecules, and these were present at very low abundance within the overall MHC-I peptidome. One peptide from the spike protein and one from the 3C-like proteinase encoded by the ORF1ab polyprotein, both likely presented by HLA-A2, and a second 3C-like proteinase peptide likely presented by HLA-B7, were observed. These epitopes have not been previously reported, although a different OC43 spike epitope presented by HLA-24 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>] and two OC43-derived epitopes from other ORF1ab-derived proteins, both presented by HLA-A2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>], have been described in studies of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive CD8 T cell responses. We observed potent MHC-I down-regulation after OC43 infection, which may have limited presentation of viral epitopes on MHC-I molecules. MHC-I down-regulation has not been previously reported for OC43, but is a common feature of many viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], including SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. Current understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced MHC-I down-regulation points to a complex mechanism, with the involvement of several gene products: ORF3a reduces global trafficking of proteins including MHC-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], ORF6 inhibits induction of MHC-I by targeting the STAT1-IRF1-NLRC5 axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>], ORF7a reduces cell-surface expression of MHC-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] by acting as β2-microglobulin mimic to interact with MHC-I heavy chain and slow its egress through the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], and ORF8 also has been reported to down-regulate surface MHC-I through a direct interaction, although the specific mechanism is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. However, none of these SARS-COV-2 gene products have significant homology with OC43, and elucidating the mechanism by which OC43 down-regulates MHC-I expression will require further investigation.</p><p id="P29">By contrast, eighty OC43-derived peptides presented by MHC-II molecules were found at high abundance within the overall MHC-II peptidome. Indeed, three of the top four most intense ions in the HLA-DR peptidome mass spectrum, and the third and fourth most intense ions in the HLA-DP peptidome mass spectrum, correspond to OC43-derived peptides. Most of the OC43-derived MHC-II-bound peptides were from spike and nucleoprotein, the major coronavirus structural proteins, consistent with the over-representation of these proteins we observed in the whole-cell proteome of infected cells. Several peptides derived from the hemagglutinin-esterase protein, which is believed to be required for cleavage of sialic acid residues to promote the release of progeny virus from infected cells, similarly to hemagglutinin-esterase proteins from influenza C and certain toroviruses and orthomyxoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. Finally, one set of low-abundance peptides is derived from the small envelope protein. All the OC43-derived MHC-II-bound peptides were found as nested sets, except for three very low abundance peptides found as singletons. In each case, the nested sets surrounded the predicted nine-residue core epitope, with 1-9 residue extensions, consistent with endosomal protease trimming of MHC-bound peptides as expected in the MHC-II antigen-presentation pathway. We selected one representative peptide from each nested set to confirm binding to MHC-II, and to assign presenting MHC allotypes to the HLA-DR peptides, which could derive from either DR2a (DRB5*01:01) or DR2b (DRB1*05:01), both of which are expressed by HEK293 cells and co-purified with the LB3.1 antibody that we used for immunoaffinity. Each of the eight representative HLA-DP eluted peptides bound to DP4.1, although with varying affinity not entirely predicted by NetMHCIIpan4.1. Of the six representative HLA-DR peptides, one (P12) bound exclusively to DR2a, four exclusively to DR2b, and one to both allotypes (P9). As previously observed in another study of naturally processed MHC-II peptides in virus-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], the eluted peptides generally were among the top predicted binders for each viral protein, one exception being P1 from the hemagglutinin-esterase protein.</p><p id="P30">We tested representative eluted peptides for recognition by T cells from HLA-matched donors. Of fourteen peptides tested, we observed robust T cell responses to eleven. In other systems, characterization of naturally-processed, MHC-bound peptides by mass spectrometry of infected cells has proven to be an efficient route for T cell epitope discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. We observed a correlation between the observed T cell response and epitope abundance in the overall immunopeptidome, whereas a significant correlation was not observed for the predicted or even observed peptide binding affinity. Thus, characterization of naturally-processed peptides from virus-infected cells can be a highly efficient epitope discovery approach, particularly compared to screening comprehensive overlapping peptides libraries or large sets of predicted MHC binders, where typically T cell responses are observed to only a small fraction of the candidate epitopes. A similar trend relating T cell response to epitope abundance has been observed in some [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] but not all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>] previous studies, although it should be noted that all of these previous studies involved CD8 T cell responses. Three eluted peptides (P8, P14, and P13) were not recognized by T cells from HLA-matched donors. These peptides were present at relatively low abundance in the peptidomes, although in some cases (P6, P7, P9) peptides with even lower abundance were recognized. We examined whether these peptides might not be immunogenic because of homology to self-peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>]. The peptides that were not recognized had similar homology scores to the closest matching self-peptides as did peptides that were recognized, although the number of exact matches in the core epitope region was somewhat larger for peptides that were not recognized (mean 6.3 vs 4.6, p=0.016).</p><p id="P31">Among human and animal coronaviruses, the approach of characterizing naturally-processed peptides presented by MHC proteins in infected cells to date has only been applied to SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>]. Weingarten-Gabbay et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] eluted MHC-I bound peptides from SARS-CoV-2-infected A549 and HEK293 cell lines, and identified 28 canonical epitopes from spike, nucleoprotein, membrane, ORF7a, and several Orf1ab-derived nonstructural proteins, together with 9 non-conventional epitopes derived from out-of-frame transcripts in spike and nucleoprotein. Nagler et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>] similarly identified two MHC-I epitopes derived from out-of-frame viral transcripts together with 11 conventional epitopes from spike, nucleoprotein, NSP1, and NSP3. We searched for such out-of-frame peptides in the OC43-derived immunopeptidome but did not find convincing evidence (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">methods</xref>). As an alternative to infection, Pan et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>] transfected cell lines with membrane or NSP13 genes and identified five MHC-I epitopes.

To identify additional cross-reactive epitopes, we tested the reactivity of T cell lines expanded with the eluted OC43 peptides for cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV2 homologs. Among the nine naturally processed CD4 T cell epitopes that were robustly recognized by donors in our cohorts, only two (P4 S<sub>903-917</sub> and P11 S<sub>1085-1099</sub>) were targeted by T cells cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2. Dose-response curves were similar for both SARS-CoV-2 and OC43 versions of the cross-reactive P4 and P11 epitopes, in both pre-pandemic and COVID-19 donors. This suggests that T cells might respond similarly during infections with either virus. Notably, these same epitopes were observed previously in an unbiased screen of SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides targeted by HCoV cross-reactive T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], as well as in other studies of T cell responses cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>]. For both the P4 and P11 epitopes, the OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 homologs are predicted to bind to the respective MHC-II proteins using the same binding frame, and peptide residues at the predicted T cell contact positions are identical or conserved. For the seven OC43-derived naturally processed T cell epitopes with SARS-CoV-2 homologs that were not targeted by cross-reactive responses, six had predicted shifts of the MHC-II binding frame caused by peptide substitutions at MHC-II contact positions. The one epitope for which the predicted MHC-II binding frame was preserved (P3 S<sub>97-111</sub>) has substitutions at each of the TCR contact positions, which would be expected to abrogate cross-reactive T cell binding. Thus, the pattern of observed CD4 T cell cross-reactivity can be explained by a simple model in which the key parameters are the preservation of the MHC-II binding frame and conservation of T cell receptor contact residues.</p><p id="P33">For studies of the differential response to SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses, epitopes specific to the seasonal coronaviruses are required.

Responding CD4 T cells showed a high sensitivity, with minimal peptide concentrations of about 10 pg/mL. This epitope is not strongly conserved among the HCoVs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Fig S4</xref>) and may be a good candidate to study and follow OC43-specific responses.

We did not consider T cell responses restricted by the mismatched MHC molecules. Finally, T cell responses not associated with IFN-γ, not able to expand with peptide stimulation in vitro, or below our detection level would have been missed by our approach.</p><p id="P35">In summary, we characterized the spectrum of naturally-processed viral peptides presented by MHC molecules in HEK293.CIITA cells infected with the human seasonal coronavirus OC43. MHC-II presented peptides dominated the OC43-derived viral immunopeptidome, possibly due to the potent down-regulation of MHC-I molecules in infected cells. The spike protein is the major source of OC43-derived epitopes, with contributions from nucleoprotein and hemagglutinin-esterase. Most of the naturally-processed peptides are recognized by T cells from HLA-matched donors. Three seasonal-coronavirus-specific CD4 T cell epitopes and two SARS-CoV-2-cross-reactive CD4 epitopes were identified. These epitopes provide a basis for studies of the cellular immune response to OC43, and for evaluating the role of pre-existing seasonal coronavirus immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P36">HEK293 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth Rock (UMass Chan Medical School).

An estimated FDR of 5% was achieved by adjusting peptide identification probability. Peptides identified in a blank run were excluded from the peptidomes. Peptides with Mascot Ion score below 15 were also excluded. Only one match to the OC43 unconventional ORF database was identified for an HLA-DP-bound peptide.

Summary</title></caption><p>There is much current interest in cellular immune responses to seasonal common-cold coronaviruses because of their possible role in mediating protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection or pathology. However, identification of relevant T cell epitopes and systematic studies of the T cell responses responding to these viruses are scarce. We conducted a study to identify naturally processed and presented MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes from human cells infected with the seasonal coronavirus HCoV-OC43, and to characterize the T cell responses associated with these epitopes. We found epitopes specific to the seasonal coronaviruses, as well as epitopes cross-reactive between HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2. These epitopes should be useful in following immune responses to seasonal coronaviruses and identifying their roles in COVID-19 vaccination, infection, and pathogenesis.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Immunopeptidome workflow and HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, and HLA-DP immunopeptidomes in OC43-infected HEK293 cells.</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Experimental approach: HEK293 cells transduced with CIITA were infected with OC43.
