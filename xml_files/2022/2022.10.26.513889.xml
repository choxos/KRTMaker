The tumor microenvironment drives cancer cell plasticity and metastasis and, thus, unravelling the underlying cues may provide novel effective strategies to manage metastatic disease. Here, we show that stem cell antigen-1 positive (Sca-1<sup>+</sup>) murine breast cancer cells enriched during tumor progression and metastasis have higher <italic>in vitro</italic> cancer stem cell-like properties, enhanced <italic>in vivo</italic> metastatic ability, and initiate primary tumors rich in Gr1<sup>high</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>low</sup> cells. In turn, tumor-educated Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> (Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>) cells rapidly and transiently convert low metastatic 4T1-Sca-1<sup>-</sup> cells into highly metastatic 4T1-Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells via secreted OSM and IL6. Moreover, chemotherapy-resistant and highly metastatic 4T1-derived cells maintain high Sca-1<sup>+</sup> frequency through cell autonomous IL6 production.

To characterize the observed plasticity of 4T1-Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells, we first investigated isolated 4T1-Sca-1<sup>+</sup> and 4T1-Sca-1<sup>-</sup> cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. The abundance of Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population in 4T1-Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells enriched by MACS sorting (&gt; 75%) gradually decreased to 50% after 4 days of culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2D</xref>, upper panel), while the Sca-1<sup>-</sup> cells (negatively enriched by MACS) regenerated a Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population (from less that 1% to 19%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2E</xref>, lower panel).

To collect evidence for a potential correlation between immune cells and the Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population, we characterized the inflammatory cells infiltrating the orthotopic primary tumors. We observed a significant increase of the Gr1<sup>high</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>low</sup> population and a significant decrease of the Gr1<sup>low</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>high</sup> population in tumors derived from the 4T1-Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells, compared to tumors derived from the 4T1-Sca-1<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).

To examine the direct contribution of the tumor-educated Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells in promoting the enrichment of the Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population, we isolated Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells from primary tumors, bone marrow and spleen of 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice by MACS, and co-cultured them <italic>in vitro</italic> with parental 4T1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from tumors (Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>), but not from spleen (Spl-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>) or bone marrow (BM-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>), significantly induced the expansion of a Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population in 4T1 cells (from 12.5% to 81%, p&lt;0.001) in 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). To test whether the expansion of a Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population from 4T1 cells required direct contact with Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> or was mediated by soluble factors, we compared the induction in two different co-culture setups, either in standard wells (cell contact) or in Transwells, where Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> and 4T1 cells were separated by a filter with 0.4 µm pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). We did not observe any significant difference in the induction efficiency of Sca-1<sup>+</sup> populations (measured by flow cytometry) between the two conditions and increasing the 4T1:Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cell ratio from 1:1 to 1:3 did not further expand the Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).

More importantly, when Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells-primed 4T1 cells were injected into the tail vein, Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> primed ones showed higher lung colonization capacity compared to Spl-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> primed one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F-H</xref>).</p><p id="P18">These results imply that tumor-educated Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells induce the emergence of a highly metastatic Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population through secreted factors.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>-induced and tumor-inherent Sca-1<sup>+</sup> populations display distinct gene expression profiles</title><p id="P19">To unravel the molecular basis for the metastatic capacity of the inherent 4T1-Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population and the Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> induced Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population, we first performed transcriptomic profiling of 4T1-Sca-1<sup>+</sup> and 4T1-Sca-1<sup>-</sup> cells isolated from the parental 4T1 line. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that 4T1-Sca-1<sup>+</sup> and 4T1-Sca-1<sup>-</sup> cells expressed different genes associated with distinct signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The top 200 significantly upregulated and downregulated genes were extracted as Sca1 Positive and Sca1 Negative signatures, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Next, we performed transcriptomic profiling of Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>-primed 4T1, Spl-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>-primed 4T1 and parental 4T1 cells. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> and Spl-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> priming induced distinct transcriptomic alterations in 4T1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). To focus on the transcriptomic alternations related to the Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population conversion, we compared Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>-primed vs Spl-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>-primed cells. Interestingly, Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>-primed 4T1 cells expressed both Sca-1 Positive and Sca-1 Negative signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> may twist tumor plasticity by converting the 4T1-Sca-1<sup>-</sup> cells into 4T1-Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells, rather than expanding the pre-existing 4T1-Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population.</p><p id="P20">To test whether, despite the diverse transcriptional profiles across different Sca-1<sup>+</sup> populations, there could be a common molecular mechanism underlying their induction and metastatic capacity, we compared the significantly differentially expressed genes between 4T1-Sca-1<sup>+</sup> versus 4T1-Sca-1<sup>-</sup> and Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> primed 4T1 versus Spl-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> primed 4T1 cells. Strikingly, among a total of 1118 up- and 423 down-regulated genes found when comparing the two conditions, only 56 up- and one down- regulated genes were shared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). This observation was consistent with the notion that the Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population in Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> primed 4T1 cells was different from the inherent 4T1-Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells. Nonetheless, the fact that the 4T1-Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells and Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> primed 4T1 cells possessed similar <italic>in vivo</italic> metastatic capacity suggested that among these common pathways some were relevant for 4T1 metastases formation. To this end, we analyzed the publicly available scRNA-seq dataset from 4T1 primary tumors of Sebastian <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). In this dataset, several cell types, including cancer cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, distinct subpopulations of myeloid cells were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). To determine significant ligand-receptor interactions from the scRNA-seq data, we performed cell-cell interaction analysis with CellPhoneDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>) by focusing on the interactions between epithelial/cancer cells and myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>, F). The analysis identified 160 ligand-receptor interaction pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). Among those pairs, OSM receptor (OSMR) and pyrimidinergic receptor P2Y6 (P2RY6) were the only ones present inside the 56 common genes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>. However, P2RY6 interacts with COPA (Coatomer Complex Subunit Alpha), a membrane protein involved in membrane traffic between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) and, thus, unlikely to mediate cell-cell contact-independent induction of the Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population.

We identified OSM/IL6-JAK as a paracrine communication axis between Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> and breast cancer cells and as an autocrine loop in chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells, promoting tumor heterogeneity, CSC features and metastatic capacity. Importantly, breast cancer patients expressing high levels of the human orthologues of the gene expression signatures invoked by Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> have significantly shorter OS and RFS, reinforcing the clinical significance of our findings. While some of these elements have been reported individually before, our results extend these observations by providing an integrative view of paracrine (Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>-induced) and autocrine (chemotherapy-induced) communication in regulating tumor heterogeneity, cancer cell plasticity, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy.</p><p id="P40">A main observation stemming from this study is that Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population exists under three different conditions: as inherent 4T1-Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population, upon exposure to Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells and upon chemotherapy treatment (MR13). All these populations had higher metastatic abilities compared to their counterpart controls. GSEA analysis suggested that the Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>-induced Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population was likely to convert from the Sca-1<sup>-</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), while the Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population surviving chemotherapy (MR13) appeared to be enriched from the inherent Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). In addition, the different gene expression signature of Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>-induced Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population relative to the inherent Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells suggest a remarkable functional plasticity of these cells. This plasticity is further supported by comparing single cell gene expression of murine 4T1 and human MCF-7 breast cancer cells, using publicly available scRNA-seq datasets, before and after <italic>in vivo</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, tumor cells undergo a transformation enriching for Sca-1 (in the mouse), OSMR expressing cells, Sca1 Positive, Sca1 Negative and Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>-induced signatures, and IL6-JAK signaling pathway from precursor cells (Sca-1<sup>-</sup> in the mouse) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Gong <italic>et al.</italic> have reported that sorted Sca-1<sup>-</sup> 4T1 cells could be transiently transformed into a Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population by radiotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>).

Taken together, by demonstrating that tumor recruited and educated Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells contribute to such plasticity by inducing the conversion of low metastatic Sca-1- population into a highly metastatic Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population, our observations further consolidate the notion that cancer consists of a heterogenous and plastic tumor mass, including highly metastatic cell populations. Dedicated time course scRNA-seq analyses together with lineage tracing experiments may help to further characterize the detailed origin, development, fate, and function of these Sca-1<sup>+</sup> populations during cancer progression.</p><p id="P41">Recruitment and accumulation of Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells in the TME, particularly through the chemokines CCL2, CXCL1 and CXCL2, or IL-33, is considered a critical step for their contribution to tumor progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>).

Beyond recruitment, tumor-mediated education of Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells, appears to be necessary to gain higher metastatic activity: Only Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells recovered from primary tumors (but not from spleen or bone marrow) induced Sca-1 positivity and enhanced metastatic ability in 4T1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, E).

Recently, it was reported that neutrophils escorting blood circulating tumor cells (CTCs) expands the metastatic potential of CTCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>). While this effect was attributed to the promotion of cell cycle progression of CTCs through direct contact with the neutrophils, in light of our findings, one may also consider the possibility that clustered neutrophils may also promote the expansion of a CSCs-like phenotype with higher metastatic capacity. Interestingly, OSM was reported to be expressed by neutrophils cocultured with breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) and to promote phenotypic changes associated with mesenchymal and stem cell-like differentiation in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>). Together with our observation, these findings further reinforce the notion that boosting the <italic>Osm</italic> expression in Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells is part of their educating program prompted by the tumor. One outstanding question raised by these observations is by which mechanisms and pathways cancer cells, in particular Sca-1<sup>+</sup> ones, educate Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells to acquire cancer plasticity-promoting activity.</p><p id="P42">Besides directly activating tumor cells, OSM has also been shown to remodel macrophages and fibroblasts of the TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Araujo <italic>et al.</italic> recently reported that OSM derived from tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells reprogram fibroblasts to secrete VEGF and the chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL16, resulting in enhanced myeloid cell recruitment and breast cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Here we extend these observations by demonstrating that tumor-educated Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>-derived OSM/IL6 twist cancer cell plasticity by promoting a rapid but reversible conversion of Sca-1<sup>-</sup> cells into more metastatic Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). We further broaden the implications of the OSM/IL6-JAK axis, by demonstrating that MR13 cells that have escaped chemotherapy hijacked this paracrine mechanism in a cell autonomous manner by elevating the <italic>Il6</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). Significantly, a short <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment with Ruxolitinib effectively abrogated their metastatic capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>, F).</p><p id="P43">While OSM/OSMR is the only interaction pair identified by the cell-cell interaction analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>, G), it is possible that other molecular mechanisms may also play roles in modulating Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cell plasticity and metastasis. One candidate is the IL6/IL6R communication axis, which was less prominent in the cell-cell communication analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>, G), but highly expressed in our experimental data in Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> compared with Spl-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) and in chemotherapy-resistant MR13 cells compared with 4T1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Moreover, the neutralization of IL6 also suppressed the Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> conditioned medium induced Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cell enrichment, much alike OSM inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P44">Importantly, we demonstrated that a human orthologue signature of the 4T1 gene expression signature invoked by Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> can predict a significantly shorter OS and RFS in breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). This finding strengthens the clinical significance of the observed crosstalk between Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> and tumor cells. Strikingly, the five genes that significantly contribute to the discriminatory power of the signature are genes related to native or viral immunity or regulated by interferon. While expression of interferons and interferon response genes in breast cancer has been mainly associated with tumor suppression and improved survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>), there is evidence also correlating interferon responses with tumor promotion, therapy resistance and reduced survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>). As JAKs/STATS are activated by both IFN and OSM/IL6 receptors, it is conceivable that OSM/IL6 only activates a subset of the IFN-induced genes with tumor-promoting activity, as the case for Mx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). Consistent with our findings, JAK/STAT signaling has recently been shown to initiate the lineage plasticity in prostate cancer as well as to promote lineage plasticity-driven targeted therapy resistance in a stem-like subpopulation of prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>). On the other hand, Aouad <italic>et al.</italic> showed that epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity is essential for the generation of a dormant cell state of ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer during progression, and the activation of IL6-JAK-STAT signaling triggers tumor cell awakening and recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>).</p><p id="P45">One crucial question raised by these results is whether the OSM/IL6-JAK pathway is a potential actionable clinical target to impinge on metastatic progression and therapy resistance. In particular, the observation that a short <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment of the highly metastatic MR13 cells profoundly suppressed their metastatic capacity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>, F), suggests potential long-lasting effects consistent with an adjuvant effect. JAK inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials in breast cancer. A phase I study combining Ruxolitinib with paclitaxel in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer showed good tolerability and evidence of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>). A phase I/II trial of Ruxolitinib in combination with trastuzumab in metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer and a phase II study combining Ruxolitinib with capecitabine in advanced HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer, however, did not improve progression-free survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>). The absence of benefits in these studies in advanced breast cancer and our reported mechanistic observations on metastatic progression, raise the question of whether the JAK inhibitors should be considered in adjuvant setting in high-risk patients, to prevent progression to metastases, rather than treating patients already bearing metastases.</p><p id="P46">In conclusion, we reported here that a subpopulation of tumor cells within the tumor mass educates requited Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells to convert a low metastatic subpopulation into highly metastatic one, through the OSM/IL6-JAK signaling axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). The clinical relevance of this observation is supported by human transcriptomic data. This process is hijacked by tumor cells that survived chemotherapy and evolved toward a highly metastatic phenotype via cell autonomous IL6-JAK signaling. Importantly, a short <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment with a clinically approved JAK inhibitor, Ruxolitinib, suppresses their metastatic capacity these cells <italic>in vivo.</italic> These results should stimulate considering testing JAK inhibitors in the adjuvant setting in TNBC breast cancer patients at high-risk for metastatic progression.</p></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S16"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P47">The 4T1 murine breast cancer cell line was kindly provided by Dr Fred R.

During tumor progression, naïve Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> are recruited to the TME and educated into Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> by tumor-derived factors. In turn, Tu-Gr1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> secrete OSM and IL6 to convert Sca-1<sup>-</sup> population into a highly metastatic Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population. Chemotherapy (CTX) enriched for Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population due to its intrinsic resistance against cytotoxic treatment. Resistant cells express IL6 to maintain the high portion of Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population with high metastatic ability. JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib suppresses the conversion to Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population and metastasis. Inhibition of OSM, IL6 and the activated downstream kinase JAK are candidate therapeutic targets to impinge on metastatic breast cancer progression during natural evolution and following therapy-resistance.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS156316-f009"/></fig></floats-group></article>
