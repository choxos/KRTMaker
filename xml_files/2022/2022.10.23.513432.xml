In the short term, these stress responses minimize acute damage to cell integrity and, in the long term, they promote adaptation and resilience. Stress response programs are orchestrated by complex signal transduction systems that sense environmental fluctuations and transmit information to various effector molecules. Their dynamics are mediated by signaling networks that rely on rapid and transient activities of kinases and phosphatases to coordinate cellular functions through reversible protein phosphorylation. Due to its broad impact on cellular function, phosphorylation-dependent signaling needs to be tightly controlled and aberrant signaling is involved in many diseases, including cancer.</p><p id="P3">The unicellular yeast S<italic>accharomyces cerevisiae</italic> harbors many conserved signaling pathways, encoding 159 protein kinases and phosphatases, 136 of which have human homologs, and therefore represents a valuable model organism to study phosphorylation networks at a systems level.

While these studies have made substantial progress in our understanding of kinases and phosphosites, a systematic view of the activation states and architecture of the stress-responsive phosphorylation signaling network is still missing.</p><p id="P4">To address this gap we profiled quantitative phosphoproteomic responses in over 600 samples exposed to 101 environmental and chemical perturbations to provide one of the largest and most systematic perturbation-phosphoproteomic resources for any species. This unprecedented scaling of phosphoproteomic experiments to hundreds of samples without compromising identification depth or quantitative measurement precision was enabled by combining our recently developed high-throughput sample preparation strategies, mass spectrometry acquisition methods, and computational approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lawrence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Leutert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Searle et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">2019</xref>). The depth and high-dimensionality of our integrated resource allowed us to uncover fundamental properties of protein phosphorylation, identify shared and perturbation-specific stress response programs, reveal the extent of dephosphorylation, dissect the TOR signaling network and uncover general principles that underlie functional phosphoproteome organization.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The phosphoproteomic landscape of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> exposed to 101 cellular perturbations</title><p id="P5">To study the regulatory and functional properties of protein phosphorylation, we studied phosphoproteomic responses of haploid yeast, exposed to 101 diverse perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). These perturbations covered broad classes of environmental and chemical conditions as well as drug treatments and systematically targeted diverse aspects of yeast cell biology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). For the majority of perturbations, yeast was treated for 5 minutes, in order to capture early signaling responses. We reasoned that functional phosphorylation of specific substrates occurs rapidly following stimulation, while promiscuous phosphorylation and changes in transcript and protein abundance takes place more slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kanshin et al., 2015a</xref>). We generated an ultra-deep reference yeast phosphoproteome from a pooled sample of all 5-minute perturbations by multi-protease digestion, deep offline fractionations using two different peptide separation methods, and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) MS. The number of phosphosite identifications obtained with trypsin plateaued at ~30,000 phosphosites and use of alternative proteases provided an additional ~6,000 phosphosites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Collectively, this resulted in 36,405 high-confidence phosphosites at a peptide-spectrum match false discovery rate (FDR) of &lt;1% and localization probabilities of &gt; 95% (Ascore &gt;13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Beausoleil et al., 2006</xref>). Of the identified phosphosites, 40% (14,271 phosphosites) have not been annotated in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.yeastgenome.org/">https://www.yeastgenome.org/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Many of these novel phosphosites were derived from non-tryptic peptides (30%) and/or are of low abundance (80% of novel phosphosites were identified by a single spectrum); others might be perturbation-specific. Phosphosites that were present in the SGD but not identified here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) potentially occur under different growth conditions, or originate from differences in phosphosite localization and filtering criteria or inadequate aggregation of proteomic data leading to substantial accumulation of false positives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lanz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Ochoa et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Quantitative atlas of phosphoproteomic stress responses</title><p id="P6">To quantitatively measure the phosphoproteomes in response to all 101 perturbations, we prepared phosphoproteomic samples using our recently developed R2-P2 workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Leutert et al., 2019</xref>) and analyzed them by data-independent acquisition (DIA) MS. To control for technical variation, we performed block randomization across the whole experiment and included sample preparation and MS measurement quality control samples at every stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). We further measured the total proteomes from matching samples for 30 selected perturbations, covering all broad perturbation types. The data was filtered to a global 1% precursor FDR and phosphosite localization probabilities of &gt;75% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). Our approach enabled deep phosphoproteome coverage and robust quantitation across all samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C-S1E</xref>). On average, we identified and individually quantified 7,077 ± 2,162 (mean and standard deviation) phosphosites per phosphoproteome sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>) and 2,185 ± 154 proteins per total proteome sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The final datasets encompassed 811 mass spectrometry injections, corresponding to 51 days of effective data acquisition time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P7">A main challenge for multi-condition phosphoproteomic experiments are missing quantifications due to low phosphopeptide abundance or ambiguous phosphosite localization. We applied a stringent threshold requiring that a localized phosphosite be quantified in at least 50% of all samples, which provided a good balance between quantitative reproducibility and retained phosphosites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>). Using this filtering approach, we obtained robust quantification of 5,284 phosphosites with an overall coverage of 66.5% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). We refer to this set as the core phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We performed imputation assuming missing data is due to low intensity values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>) and showed that technical variance was largely explained by separately processed 96-well plates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E and S2F</xref>). We were able to correct the data for sample preparation batch effects, so that the treatments explained 35% of the variance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2G-S2J</xref>). Our approach resulted in a complementary pair of core phosphoproteome datasets: an uncorrected dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3</xref>) that was used for linear modeling of differential phosphosite abundance and a corrected dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S5</xref>) that was used to compare phosphosite abundances across the whole dataset and to perform co-regulation analysis.</p><p id="P8">To understand how individual perturbations affect relative phosphorylation of sites across the proteome, we performed linear modeling to test all phosphosite-treatment pairs (529,400 total tests) for differential abundance against the untreated samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S6</xref>). Considering all 5-min perturbations, a &gt;2-fold change and significance at an adjusted p-value of &lt;0.05 resulted in 24,942 regulated perturbation-phosphosite pairs distributed across 4,177 unique phosphosites on 1,155 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P9">In summary, we identified 36,405 phosphosites on 3,976 proteins, which account for 59% of all annotated open reading frames in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). At least 18% of all proteins (1,224 proteins) contain a phosphosite that was significantly regulated within 5 min of perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). This translates to 11% (4,177) of all identified phosphosites showing regulation under at least one perturbation. We integrated these high-dimensional datasets in multiple ways that showcase how this resource can used to learn about the organization of signaling systems, and provide the underlying data for further exploration at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://yeastphosphoatlas.gs.washington.edu/">https://yeastphosphoatlas.gs.washington.edu</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H and 1I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Characteristics of early stress-responsive phosphosites</title><p id="P10">We performed comparative analysis of the global and the regulated phosphoproteome to identify sequence, structural and functional characteristics of early stress-responsive phosphosites. We found no bias for protein abundance for single-, multi-, or hyperphosphorylated proteins within the reference phosphoproteome, whereas the regulated phosphoproteome showed a slight shift towards more abundant proteins. This can be explained by the reduced coverage of the core phosphoproteome together with the data completeness filter which are biased towards higher abundant peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Next, we compared unmodified Ser/Thr residues in identified phosphoproteins versus all phosphosites and all regulated phosphosites in terms of their relative position in protein sequences, relative accessibility, and occurrence within disordered protein regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Pentony et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, we found strong enrichment of phosphorylation occurring on protein N-termini and, to a lesser extent on C-termini. This effect was even more pronounced for regulated phosphosites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Enrichment in C-terminal phosphorylation has been described before in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Villén et al., 2007</xref>), whereas N-terminal phosphorylation is less defined, but might be involved in co-translational regulation. Phosphosites in general, especially regulated phosphosites, were also enriched in accessible protein regions and in disordered protein regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To assess the functional relevance of phosphosites, we extracted ‘sorting intolerant from tolerant substitutions’ (SIFT) scores from the mutfunc database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Ng and Henikoff, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Wagih et al., 2018</xref>). SIFT scores are based on sequence homology and physical properties of amino acids and predict whether an amino acid substitution affects protein function. We found that residues harboring regulated phosphosites had a higher number of amino acid substitutions predicted to be deleterious by SIFT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). This result suggests that regulated phosphosites are more likely to occur at regions of high sequence conservation and impact protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Studer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To further investigate phosphosite conservation we compared yeast protein paralogs, which arose by whole-genome or single-gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Byrne and Wolfe, 2005</xref>). We only considered phosphosites on paralog pairs that were located in paralog-specific peptides and where the modified residue was either conserved in both paralogs; mutated from Ser to Thr; or phosphorylated in one paralog and a phosphomimetic Asp or Glu residue in the other paralog. After applying these criteria, we were left with 5,754 paralog site-pairs (across 722 paralog-pairs). We find that for a third of paralog phosphosite-pairs, phosphorylation is conserved or complemented with a phosphomimetic mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). In most of these cases, only one paralog site is regulated across perturbations, suggesting that differential phosphorylation can contribute to diversification of paralog function across environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Strikingly, we also found a number of paralog pairs (13%) where a regulated phosphosite in one paralog is substituted by a phosphomimetic residue in the other paralog. Such an evolutionary switch might lead to functional diversification where one paralog is constitutively active, while the other paralog has a phosphorylation-dependent condition-specific function.</p><p id="P14">Next, we investigated which proteins and protein complexes are highly phosphorylated. We found that the nuclear pore complex (NPC) harbors the most phosphosites (383 phosphosites) with 181 regulated phosphosite-perturbation pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). The NPC is known to undergo cell cycle dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aitchison and Rout, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Holt et al., 2009</xref>) and the observed phosphoregulation is likely a consequence of stress-induced cell cycle changes. Kinases were the protein class with the most phosphosites per protein and ribosomal proteins showed the highest percentage of Ser and Thr that are phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Remarkably, several proteins showed &gt;100 regulated phosphosites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Overall, our analyses revealed that regulated phosphosites occur more frequently on protein termini and in accessible or disordered regions and have a higher probability of conservation and impact protein function.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Regulated phosphosites of the yeast kinome</title><p id="P16">We assessed the distribution of broad phosphosite motif classes across the reference and regulated phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Mok et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Villén et al., 2007</xref>). We found that ~15% of all phosphosites occurred in proline-directed motifs (targeted by members of the CMCG kinase class, which included MAPKs, CDKs and Yak1), ~25% in acidic motifs (targeted by CKs, GSK3 homologs Mrk1 and Rim11 and others) and ~20% in basic motifs (targeted by &gt;35 basophilic kinases most prominently in the AGC and CaMK kinase groups, which include PKA, Snf1 and Sch9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>). Regulated phosphosites occurred more often in proline-directed and basic motifs, accounting for &gt;50% sites and less often in acidic motifs. Phosphorylation on acidic motifs tends to have higher stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Wu et al., 2011</xref>) and our results suggest they represent constitutively active instead of stress-sensitive phosphorylation. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>). Strikingly, when considering all regulated phosphosite-perturbation pairs, we found that 35% of regulated phosphosites have a basic motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Tyrosine phosphorylation is thought to be low in yeast and dependent on a few dual-specificity kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brinkworth et al., 2006</xref>). We found 1,243 phosphotyrosine sites, although the majority of these (64%) were identified with only one spectrum match, indicating that they are either low abundant or mislocalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). Of all tyrosine phosphorylation 10% occurred on kinases. Highly-abundant phosphotyrosine sites (identified with &gt;20 spectral matches) included 7 instances of CMCG kinase activation loop phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). In the core phosphoproteome, we found only ~90 phosphotyrosine sites that were regulated in at least one perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). Taken together, our large-scale study confirms low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in yeast with increased occurrence on kinases.</p><p id="P18">Mapping phosphosites across the kinome emphasized overall high numbers of modified and regulated residues, particularly for AGC, CAMK and STE kinase families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2K</xref>). CMGC kinases mediate response to diverse signals and we find abundant phosphorylation on stress responsive Sky1, Yak1 and Hog1 kinases. Only for 6 CMGC kinases, we detected no phosphosites. Three of these, Smk1, Kdx1 and Ime2, are directly involved in sporulation and therefore unlikely to be activated under the tested conditions. Other kinases with low numbers of phosphosites such as Tor1, Tor2, and Snf1 are active within complexes and we find very high numbers of regulated phosphosites on their associated subunits (Tco89 and Kog1 for TORC1/2, and Sip1 and Gal83 for Snf1 complex). Overall, only 16 out of 129 predicted yeast kinases had no detected phosphosites.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Dissecting stress responsive phosphorylation sites</title><p id="P19">Differential phosphosite regulation across perturbations can show the extent of the global signaling response for each perturbation and give insights into the function of individual phosphosites. We analyzed core phosphosites that are significantly regulated (&gt;2-fold change and adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05) for each perturbation compared to untreated yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Phosphoproteome changes were more widespread upon pH perturbations, osmotic stresses, and nutrient perturbations; phosphosites were mostly down-regulated upon cell wall perturbations. Agents that affected proteostasis or DNA damage and most drug treatments caused overall only modest responses at core phosphosites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). Regulation of phosphosites within 5 minutes of perturbation could not be explained by changes in protein abundance. By analyzing the proteome of 30 selected perturbations we found that most perturbations regulated less than 3% of all measured proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B-S3E</xref>) and that this regulation does not correlate with changes in phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Next, we focused on individual phosphosites with well-characterized functions and investigated the regulation of these sites across all tested perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3F</xref>). We highlight here some phosphosites and describe additional examples in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Text</xref>. First we analyzed activating phosphosites within the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) MAP kinase pathway, which is well studied for its essential functions in the osmotic stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Romanov et al., 2017</xref>). In the canonical HOG pathway the MAP kinase kinase Pbs2 is activated through phosphorylation by an upstream MAP kinase kinase kinase and in turn leads to phosphorylation and activation of the MAP kinase Hog1. Hog1 phosphorylates multiple effector proteins, including Rck2 and Are2 with roles in cell cycle regulation and membrane maintenance, respectively. We found robust up-regulation of activating phosphosites on Pbs2, Hog1, Rck2 and Are2 across all four osmotic stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Whereas Pbs2, Rck2 and Are2 activation was mostly specific for osmotic stresses, Hog1 was also activated in mitochondrial perturbations, heat shock, and DNA damage conditions. These distinct activation patterns in the HOG pathway suggest there are multiple ways of inducing Hog1 and additional regulatory layers to create downstream specificity. Hog1 activation independent of upstream MAP kinase kinases could be explained by stress-specific inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases (Ptp2 and Ptp3) that maintain Hog1 in an inactive state under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lee and Levin, 2018</xref>). Additionally, we identified many other regulated phosphosites on Pbs2, Rck2, and Are2 that may modulate specific activation states.</p><p id="P21">The transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 are central mediators of the environmental stress response (ESR) gene expression program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>), integrating multiple stress and nutrient sensitive pathways, including the HOG pathway. Msn2 and Msn4 activity is dependent on their complex and transient phosphorylation states. Short-lived multisite dephosphorylation of Msn2 and Msn4 in their nuclear localization signal (NLS) is associated with Msn2/4 translocation to the nucleus and induction of ESR transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">De Wever et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Reiter et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to the specific regulation of HOG pathway effector proteins discussed above, we observe dephosphorylation of Msn2 and Msn4 phosphosites in their NLS for almost all broad perturbation types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, a wide quantitative range of dephosphorylation was observed for these phosphosites. We found strongest dephosphorylation in nutrient perturbations and lower dephosphorylation in osmotic, oxidative and proteostasis stresses. This magnitude difference is likely a consequence of pathway crosstalk and/or feedback leading to a fine-tuned regulation of ESR gene expression programs.</p><p id="P22">Strikingly, a few phosphosites showed bidirectional regulation in response to multiple perturbations. This is the case for key regulatory phosphosites on the two metabolic enzymes Elo2 and Pda1. We observed increased phosphorylation of the fatty acid elongase Elo2 at T334 upon osmotic stress, digitonin, EDTA, caffeine and pH and decreased phosphorylation under nutrient limitation and in the majority of carbon source changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Activating Elo2 phosphorylation at T334 has previously been shown to be required for modulation of sphingolipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Viéitez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Zimmermann et al., 2013</xref>). Elo2 T334 phosphorylation increases sphingolipid production to potentially enhance membrane integrity upon perturbations that impact cell membrane structure, while T334 dephosphorylation upon starvation leads to decreased sphingolipid production. The regulation we observe suggests that Elo2 T334 acts as a rapid and broad stress responsive regulator of the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway, with possible implications for metabolic fluxes, membrane dynamics and autophagy regulation. Bidirectional regulation was also found for the highly conserved, inactivating phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) subunit Pda1 on S313 that acts as a central metabolic switch between fermentation and respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Oliveira et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Uhlinger et al., 1986</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Text</xref>).</p><p id="P23">In summary, we show that integration of the phosphorylation state of individual phosphosites across a large number of perturbations can be used to understand common and specific cellular responses to different perturbations, as exemplified here for phosphosites with well-characterized functions. We observed that many phosphosites with known functions responded in an expected manner to certain perturbations, but were also regulated by seemingly unrelated or unexpected perturbations. Interestingly, we find that several key functional phosphosites show large differences in fold changes across perturbations, which can be generated by feedforward loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Goentoro et al., 2009</xref>). We believe that our resource can be used to identify potential new functions of known phosphosites and signaling network motifs that can be followed up in future experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The shared phosphorylation stress response program is defined by nutrient sensing pathways and broad dephosphorylation</title><p id="P24">We next examined general trends in regulation across the yeast phosphoproteome. We first assessed the regulatory behaviors of individual phosphosites across all perturbations, and found that most phosphosites are regulated unidirectionally (i.e. the phosphosite is either consistently up- or down-regulated compared to untreated yeast) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). When taking a perturbation-centric approach (i.e. assessing the regulatory behaviors of all phosphosites within a perturbation), we discovered that down-regulation of phosphorylation was more frequent compared to upregulation in nearly every perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). This effect did not appear to be due to data processing and imputation. Interestingly, these results suggest a central role for dephosphorylation during the initial stress response. Indeed, phosphatases occupy key positions in the stress response network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ariño et al., 2019</xref>) and phosphatase deletion strains have shown a high number of stress sensitive growth phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Viéitez et al., 2022</xref>). To investigate if dephosphorylation is a general feature of the early stress response in yeast we analyzed published temporal phosphoproteomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kanshin et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Leutert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">MacGilvray et al., 2018</xref>). We found that, for the majority of cases, down-regulation of phosphorylation outweighed up-regulation, specifically at early time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>. We also examined global phosphoproteomic responses to environmental stresses for other species (<italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, <italic>R. rattus</italic>), and found a similarly-strong dephosphorylation response, suggesting that global dephosphorylation might be a conserved stress responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4D and S4E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Needham et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Rigbolt et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P25">To dissect the impact of different kinases and phosphatases on the directionality of phosphosite regulation, we grouped phosphosites by reported upstream kinase or phosphatase and counted perturbations that led to up- or down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). This analysis revealed kinases that are strongly associated with up-regulated phosphosites such as Snf1, Rim15 and Yak1, all part of glucose sensing systems; Hog1, Pbs2 and Hal5, involved in osmo- and halotolerance; and Mec1/Tel1 involved in DNA damage and cell cycle control. Kinases and phosphatases that were associated with down-regulated phosphosites, included TOR and PKA pathway-related kinases (TORC1, Atg1, Sch9, Ypk1) and phosphatases (Tap42, Sit4), Cka2 kinase, the pH stress activated Ppz1 phosphatase, calcineurin phosphatases and the Ptc1 phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ariño et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">González and Hall, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Next, we investigated whether a shared stress response program exists across the yeast phosphoproteome. We found that the number of perturbations where a phosphosite was significantly regulated decreased exponentially and we identified a breakpoint in the exponential distribution at around 10 perturbations, with a slower dropoff after this point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Considering this, we defined phosphosites that are unidirectionally regulated in 10 or more perturbations as a shared phosphoproteomic stress response, and identified responsible kinases and phosphatases. We found that upregulated sites were enriched in Snf1 substrates whereas downregulated sites were enriched in targets of the Sch9 and Ypk1 kinases and Ppz1, calcineurin, and Tap42-PP2A/Sit4 phosphatases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). To gain insight into biological processes affected by the shared phosphorylation stress response, we mapped proteins containing at least one regulated phosphosite onto the yeast genetic-interaction network and performed Spatial Analysis of Functional Enrichment (SAFE) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Baryshnikova, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Usaj et al., 2017</xref>) to identify regions of the network that are significantly enriched for interactions with regulated phosphoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). We found enriched functions for proteins with up-regulated phosphosites in processes associated with cell polarity and proteins with down-regulated phosphosites in nuclear processes such as transcription and nuclear transport as well as mitosis.</p><p id="P27">In summary, we found that deactivation of signaling pathways that are constitutively active under exponential growth conditions (TOR, PKA) and the action of stress responsive (calcineurin, Ppz1) and TOR associated (Tap42-PP2A/Sit4) phosphatases play a major role in shaping the phosphoproteome during the initial shared stress response. This signature is consistent with a shift from biosynthetic processes to catabolic processes. Unlocking phosphatase activity upon stress exposure might provide the cell with a fast mechanism to rewire growth signaling and homeostatic functions.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Perturbation-specific phosphorylation response programs</title><p id="P28">The high dimensionality of our dataset also allowed us to identify novel regulatory connections between stress responses. We determined stress response similarities by hierarchical clustering of a correlation matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Perturbations were nearly all uncorrelated or positively correlated, which suggests that, generally, when pathways are regulated they are regulated in the same way. As expected, a series of prominent clusters of known related perturbations are visible in the data, such as the osmotic stresses, pH stresses, and nutrient perturbations. Interestingly, this approach was able to further resolve nutrient perturbations into carbon source exchange and limitation.</p><p id="P29">We find four main perturbation clusters, corresponding to major phosphorylation stress response programs that target proteins involved in functionally different biological processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). To obtain insight into the activity of signaling pathways across perturbation clusters, we used well-defined phosphosites as pathway activation markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Soste et al., 2014</xref>). Combining these pieces of information allows more detailed characterization of stress responses. For example, cluster 2 contains the high pH perturbations and shows unique activation dynamics for the Ipl1, Mck1 and Cla4/Ste20/Ypk2 kinases. Ipl1 kinase mediated phosphorylation of Dam1 S23 directly inhibits attachment of the kinetochore to the microtubules and Cla4/Ste20/Ypk2 mediated phosphorylation of Myo5 S357 is required for polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, pH changes have been associated with modulation of cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Orij et al., 2012</xref>) and actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Wioland et al., 2019</xref>), which is likely induced by the stress response defined in cluster 2. We identified 57 phosphosites that showed selective regulation in one of the perturbation clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S7</xref>). These phosphosites can serve as markers of the different stress responses and find application in investigating pathways and biological processes targeted and towards identifying stress responses in other phosphoproteomic datasets.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Activity and architecture of the TOR signaling network</title><p id="P30">To investigate the organization of major signaling hubs we chose to focus on the TOR signaling network. We selected 9 kinases and phosphatases associated with TOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dokládal et al., 2021</xref>) and matched these with sets of phosphosite targets curated from the literature to produce a list of 934 total phosphosites with which we investigated dynamics within the TOR network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S8</xref>). Given the number of phosphosites available to analyze, we employed Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Zhang and Horvath, 2005</xref>) for determining groups of co-regulated phosphosites and their dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>). The WGCNA analysis resulted in seven TOR subnetworks, which varied in size from 23 to 287 phosphosites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B-S5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S8</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Since TOR pathway is a master regulator of cell growth and metabolic state, we tested how three major perturbation groups –C/N source changes, pH perturbation and osmotic stress– drive subnetwork dynamics by measuring subnetwork phosphorylation relative to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Strikingly, all subnetworks showed clearly different response patterns across tested perturbation classes. For example subnetwork 4 is exclusively responsive to nutrient limitations whereas subnetwork 7 is exclusively responsive to pH perturbations. We hypothesized that subnetworks represent different branches of the TOR pathway defined by differential activities of TOR associated kinases and phosphatases. To test this hypothesis, we integrated gene ontology, kinase-protein interaction, linear motif and phosphosite analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C, Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5E</xref>) with a literature curated pathway map (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Text</xref> for detailed subnetwork analysis and interpretation). We found that subnetworks 3 and 5 showed close proximity to Tor1, with multiple lines of evidence suggesting that subnetwork 3 represents targets of the TORC1-Tap42-PP2A/Sit4 phosphatase branch and subnetwork 5 targets of the TORC1-Sch9 signaling branch. The two branches showed high sensitivity to most nutrient perturbations and osmotic stresses; however only the TORC1-Sch9 branch was sensitive to pH perturbations. Additionally, we were able to reveal subnetworks that likely resulted from pathway cross-talk. We found evidence for the exclusively pH-sensitive subnetwork 7 being at the downstream intersection of TORC1-Sch9 and PKA signaling pathways, and subnetwork 1 and 6 at the intersection of the SNF1 and TOR pathways. Interestingly, the analysis also identified co-regulated phosphosites on downstream effector protein targets. For example subnetwork 2 was strongly and exclusively activated by osmotic stress and contained multiple translation initiation factors, suggesting that these phosphosites might be part of the osmotic stress-induced translation inhibitory response.</p><p id="P32">It has not been possible so far to systematically assess how different stimuli affect a single pathway and leverage this information to derive pathway organization at the phosphosite level. Our analysis of the TOR pathway suggests that, while defining kinase-substrate relationships is important, measuring how phosphosites are co-regulated across perturbations allows understanding signaling network wiring. Our phosphoproteomic resource and the analysis approaches outlined here can be applied to any known or newly defined pathway to determine functional pathway organization into subnetworks and perturbation-specific activation states.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Functional organization of the stress responsive phosphoproteome</title><p id="P33">Next, we tested if functional phosphoproteome organization can be inferred from co-regulated phosphosites alone, i.e. without seeding kinases-substrate relationships. We employed phosphosite quantification of the core phosphoproteome and performed analysis in low-dimensional Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) space. UMAP embedding of individual phosphoproteomes showed clear separation of broader perturbation types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>) and matched underlying pathway activities (TOR, HOG, SNF1), as judged by pathway activation markers across embedded phosphoproteomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Using autocorrelation statistics, we defined 2,191 phosphosites that significantly vary across samples in UMAP space. We performed UMAP embedding of the quantitative values of these phosphosites across perturbations, and conducted community analysis to identify groups of co-regulated phosphosites. This resulted in 29 major phosphosite modules that contained between 20-140 phosphosites each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A and S6B</xref>). Strikingly, phosphosite motif class was a main factor for separation in UMAP space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6C</xref>), indicating that co-regulated phosphosites are modified by the same or closely-related kinases. We characterized co-regulated phosphosites within each module by performing a series of analyses, including enrichment for motif, phenotype, gene ontology, kinase-protein interactions, and kinase-substrate associations, as well as integrating modules as STRING networks. Additionally, we established relationships among the different modules by comparing: (1) overall abundance of phosphosites within a module; (2) aggregated abundance of phosphosites across perturbations; and (3) significantly regulated phosphosites versus untreated within a module. Characterization of phosphosites within each module was assembled in a comprehensive catalog (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S9</xref>). This integrated resource can greatly help identify new potential pathway substrates, as well as greatly assist other researchers with pre-selecting pathways and conditions that might regulate a specific phosphosite of interest for further investigation. To showcase the kind of knowledge that can be generated from the data, we chose a few distantly and closely related modules for more detailed analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E and 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Text</xref> for detailed analysis of selected modules).</p><p id="P34">First, co-regulation analysis allowed us to recover known kinase-substrate relationships and identify novel kinase substrates. For example, we identified module 12 to be downstream of TORC1-Sch9, characterized by a basic phosphorylation motif, a high enrichment for Tor1 and Sch9 kinase-protein interactors, and high sensitivity to nutrient perturbations. Indeed, 30% of these phosphosites were annotated to the TORC1-Sch9 signaling branch in our previous TOR signaling network analysis (TOR subnetwork 5). Importantly, 55% of phosphosites in module 12 did not contain any previous connection to the TOR pathway but are likely newly identified TORC1-Sch9 targets. Similarly module 21 had multiple lines of evidence for being targets of casein kinase 2 and Module 11 for Snf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Second, we were able to resolve differentially regulated phosphosites with similar consensus motifs. Module 5 and module 17 showed both a proline-directed motif, however module 5 is upregulated in osmotic stress and heat shock whereas module 17 shows the opposite regulation and is additionally sensitive to nutrient perturbations. We could associate module 5 to MAPK cascades and module 17 to down-regulated activity of the master cell cycle kinase Ccd28 based on the protein-protein interaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Third, we identified regulatory functions and potential novel targets for understudied kinases. Phosphosites of module 26 showed evidence for action of Kin1/Kin2 kinases (orthologous to MARK/PAR-1, AMPK family members) based on phosphorylation motif and kinase-phosphoprotein interactions. Additionally phosphoproteins in this module were enriched for plasma membrane proteins and regulation of transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). Kin1/2 kinases have been reported to localize to the plasma membrane, be associated with HOG signaling and activated upon cellular stress, and regulate exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ghosh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Romanov et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, this indicates a function for Kin1/2 in inducing plasma membrane protein phosphorylation during cell wall stress.</p><p id="P37">Fourth, we revealed effector modules consisting of co-regulated phosphosites on proteins with similar functions. For phosphoproteins in module 18 we found a striking functional enrichment of plasma membrane proteins that are involved in ion homeostasis, transport and required for proper nutrient uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F and 7G</xref>). Several identified phosphosites on these proteins are known to increase their transport activity or are required to stabilize the protein at the plasma membrane and had evidence for activity of plasma membrane bound casein kinase I. Taken together, the phosphosites contained in this module likely orchestrate ion homeostasis upon intracellular pH changes through a common mechanism.</p><p id="P38">In summary, we demonstrate that co-regulation analysis of phosphosites across many perturbations can be used to reveal functional organization of the phosphoproteome. In addition to the quantitative phosphoproteomic atlas, we created an information-rich catalog of modules that contain co-regulated phosphosites with functional and/or regulatory connections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S9</xref>) that can serve as a starting point to assemble novel signaling pathways and interrogate perturbation-specific protein functions. We anticipate that the provided resource will facilitate hypothesis generation for mechanistic protein-phosphosite and signaling studies in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P39">A global view of how signaling networks link environmental fluctuations to cellular processes is currently lacking. High-dimensional perturbation-signaling maps will be key to unbiasedly understand the complex network interactions that govern cell function.

A considerable number of phosphosites (~40%) within our reference phosphoproteome have not been reported before. We found that phosphosites occur more frequently on protein termini and disordered protein regions; and we identified ~300 proteins with &gt;30 phosphosites, suggesting a potential role in regulating liquid-liquid phase separation through bulk electrostatic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Yamazaki et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P41">Regulated phosphosites were more likely to impact protein function and had a higher probability of occurring at conserved regions within proteins. Analyzing yeast paralogs showed that a high number of phosphosites in one paralog is substituted by a phosphomimetic residue in the other paralog. Such an evolutionary switch might lead to functional diversification by introducing phosphorylation-dependent and condition-specific protein functions. Future evolutionary analysis of phosphosites can benefit from including conditional regulation along with sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Studer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P42">Regulation of the phosphoproteome agreed well with prior results of phosphorylation for individual stresses or targeted pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). For example our resource recapitulates regulation of many canonical TOR pathway targets in nutrient limited conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). However, quantifying responses of the same signal transduction network across many different perturbations gave us the power to dissect layers of regulatory connections between signaling events that remained hidden in low-dimensional studies. We were able to identify TOR subnetworks by grouping phosphosites of the TOR network according to their regulatory profile and connecting them to the activity of specific TOR kinases and phosphatases. These TOR subnetworks showed distinct responses to perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, dimensionality reduction and co-regulation analysis identified many phosphosites and proteins that have not been previously associated with TOR signaling and positioned them within the different subnetworks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Our analysis of the well-studied TOR pathway revealed a much broader involvement of TOR in the signaling response to stress than anticipated as well as the multiple ways in which the TOR network intercalates with other stress-responsive pathways.</p><p id="P43">Systematic kinase deletion studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bodenmiller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Li et al., 2019</xref>) have shown widespread changes to the proteome and phosphoproteome owing to the high interconnectivity of the signaling network. We find that even for highly selective kinases, target phosphosites partition into distinctly regulated subsets. Thus high-dimensional phosphoproteomic studies measuring early response to perturbation can enhance our understanding of direct kinase action, revealing at a systems-level, previously unappreciated subnetworks, subnetwork intersections, and subnetwork sensitivities.</p><p id="P44">Our data show that dephosphorylation is a phosphoproteomic response common to many types of perturbations when compared to untreated, exponentially growing cells. Exponential growth requires the consistent and combined activity of several major nutrient responsive and cell cycle promoting pathways (TOR, PKA, CDK). These pathways are induced if environmental conditions are favorable, and they control the activities of large sets of kinases and phosphatases to promote biosynthetic processes and repress catabolic processes. We identify hundreds of down-regulated phosphosites that have been connected to these pathways underscoring the role of phosphatases in stress response. Whereas nutrient limitations lead to a consistent and strong dephosphorylation of the TOR and PKA signaling networks, many other perturbations also lead to their dephosphorylation. Through co-regulation analysis, we find points of pathway cross-talk that might amplify this early stress response. Examples of cross-talk include the regulation of proline-directed phosphosites on TOR effector kinases that mirror activities of MAPK pathways; a signaling axis that is exclusively responsive to pH perturbation at the intersection of the TOR and PKA pathway; and reciprocal phosphorylation by TOR and SNF1 on shared substrates.</p><p id="P45">Our integrated analysis approaches uncovered many unknown or poorly-characterized stress response trajectories, such as a group of plasma membrane transporters that are presumably deactivated upon pH and nutrient perturbations; Hal5 kinase as an integrator of a multitude of stress responses; a role for Kin1/2 kinases in the pH stress response; and deactivated casein kinase 2 in heat and cold shock. As showcased throughout this study, the created resource will be invaluable for stimulating novel hypotheses: (1) for phosphosite and protein centric analyses the resource can be mined for phosphosites that occur on specific proteins, how these phosphosites are regulated and by what potential kinase or pathway; (2) for pathway centric analyses known or newly identified signaling modules are provided and can be interrogated for perturbation specific activation states; (3) for perturbation centric analyses, shared and specialized phosphorylation response programs were defined and can be used to explore regulated cellular processes.</p><p id="P46">In order to advance analysis of our data set and to assist scientists in generating hypotheses, we provide detailed analysis on identified signaling modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S9</xref>) and have developed a web-based analysis tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://yeastphosphoatlas.gs.washington.edu/">https://yeastphosphoatlas.gs.washington.edu</ext-link>) that allows easy access of regulatory profiles of individual or groups of phosphosites across perturbations.
