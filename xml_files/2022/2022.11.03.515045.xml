A large proportion of CHARGE cases are attributed to mutations in the gene encoding <italic>CHD7</italic>, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7, which remodels chromatin. While the role for CHD7 in neural crest development is well documented, it remains elusive how this seemingly ubiquitous factor is specifically upregulated in neural crest cells. Here, we use epigenomic profiling of chick neural crest to identify a cohort of enhancers regulating <italic>Chd7</italic> expression in neural crest cells and other tissues. We functionally validate upstream transcription factor binding at candidate enhancers, revealing novel epistatic relationships between neural crest master regulators and <italic>Chd7</italic>. To our knowledge, this is the first report of tissue-specific regulation of a chromatin re-modeller. Furthermore, we find conserved enhancer features in human embryonic epigenomic data and validate the activity of the human equivalent <italic>CHD7</italic> enhancers in the chick embryo. Collectively our findings embed <italic>Chd7</italic> in the neural crest gene regulatory network and offer potentially clinically relevant elements for interpreting CHARGE syndrome cases without causative allocation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chd7</kwd><kwd>neural crest</kwd><kwd>CHARGE syndrome</kwd><kwd>enhancer</kwd><kwd>chicken</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">The neural crest is a transient and migratory embryonic progenitor population that contributes derivatives to a remarkable range of neural and mesenchymal tissues in the vertebrate body. Neural neural crest derivatives include craniofacial ganglia, and both neurons and glia of the peripheral and enteric nervous systems. Mesenchymal neural crest derivatives include craniofacial cartilage and bone, as well as smooth muscle of facial blood vessels, striated muscle forming the cardiac outflow tract and septum, and the majority of body’s pigment cells. Consequently, errors in neural crest patterning, migration and differentiation result in a wide range of congenital birth anomalies collectively termed neurocristopathies. Neurocristopathies account for nearly one third of all birth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). These include CHARGE syndrome, which affects the eye, heart and facial structures(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), Hirschsprung’s disease, characterised by the loss of neural crest-derived enteric ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), Waardenburg syndrome, characterised by deafness, pigmentation and cranio-facial defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), and Treacher Collins Syndrome presenting with craniofacial defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Neurocristopathies can be caused by mutations in master neural crest regulators, for example, <italic>SOX10</italic> in Hirschsprung’s disease and Waardenburg syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) or <italic>PAX3</italic> in Waardenburg syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). However, mutations in genes encoding general cellular machinery can also result in neurocristopathies as demonstrated in Treacher Collins Syndrome caused by mutations in RNA polymerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) and CHARGE syndrome where heterozygous mutations in the chromatin remodeller <italic>CHD7</italic> (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7) are detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p id="P6">CHARGE syndrome (OMIM 214800) patients present with ocular Coloboma, Heart malformations, chonanal Atresia, Retardation of growth, Genital hypoplasia and Ear abnormalities. Over 500 different pathogenic mutations in the <italic>CHD7</italic> coding region have been described, accounting for 32% to 41% of CHARGE syndrome cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Mutations have been reported throughout the <italic>CHD7</italic> gene body, indicating premature termination of the protein is significantly detrimental to CHD7 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). CHD7 influences gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) by catalysing nucleosome repositioning in an ATP-dependant manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In keeping with this regulatory role, Chd7 associates with distal regulatory sites carrying H3K4me1 chromatin modifications characteristic of poised enhancers, in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).</p><p id="P7">While CHD7 is part of the omnipresent chromatin remodelling machinery and is broadly expressed in a multitude of embryonic tissues, the clinical features of CHARGE syndrome clearly suggest CHD7 has tissue and developmental stage-specific roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Previous studies have shown that CHD7 function is essential for proper neural crest development and migration. In human neural crest-like cells, CHD7 occupies distal regulatory elements for neural crest transcription factors <italic>SOX9</italic> and <italic>TWIST1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). In mice, <italic>Chd7</italic> heterozygotes present with CHARGE syndrome-like features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) and trunk neural crest cells require Chd7 to maintain their multipotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). In Xenopus, <italic>Chd7</italic> mutant embryos have reduced <italic>Sox9</italic>, <italic>Twist1</italic> and <italic>Snai2</italic> expression and display CHARGE syndrome like features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Recent work in the chick neural crest, employing weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), showed that <italic>Chd7</italic> expression strongly correlated with expression of neural crest regulators (<italic>Sox5, Sox9, Zeb2 and NeuroD4</italic>), other chromatin remodellers (<italic>Kdm1B, Kdm2A, Kdm3B, Kdm7A</italic>) and Semaphorins (<italic>Sema3A, Sema3E, Sema4D, Sema6D</italic>) which have previously been shown to be regulated by Chd7 in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Collectively, these findings provide strong argument for positioning <italic>Chd7</italic> within the neural crest gene regulatory network. However, the identity of tissue-specific enhancers and upstream neural crest factors mediating tissue specific enrichment of <italic>Chd7</italic> in the neural crest have not been investigated.</p><p id="P8">Here we identify super enhancer-like clusters containing multiple novel enhancers driving <italic>Chd7</italic> expression in developing chick embryos. We validate enhancer activity <italic>in vivo</italic> and functionally determine key upstream transcription factors driving <italic>Chd7</italic> enhancers in the neural crest. Using chromatin accessibility analysis of donated human embryonic tissue, we find that neural crest-specific <italic>CHD7</italic> enhancers are highly conserved. Furthermore, we demonstrate that human enhancers are active in developing chick embryos, suggesting that the tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms enhancing <italic>Chd7</italic> in the neural crest are conserved between chicken and human. Our findings provide a potential mechanism to explain the aetiology of CHARGE syndrome where the <italic>CHD7</italic> gene is unperturbed. Finally, we demonstrate, for the first time, the upstream regulation of a ubiquitous chromatin-remodeller by tissue-specific transcription factors as an important mechanism to ensure enhanced chromatin remodelling activity in the developing neural crest.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P9"><italic>Chd7</italic> was previously shown to be enriched in RNA-seq data from chick cranial neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>), where it was co-expressed with other neural crest genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>) and clustered with pre-migratory neural crest markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Here, we used fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (Hybridisation Chain Reaction, HCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) to resolve spatiotemporal <italic>Chd7</italic> expression in developing chick embryos. <italic>Chd7</italic> was detected at stage HH8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) within the cranial neural tube and pre-migratory neural crest cells as indicated by colocalisation with the neural crest marker <italic>Sox10</italic> and at low levels in the surrounding neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Chd7 transcripts continued to overlap with <italic>Sox10</italic> in delaminating and migrating neural crest cells at HH9/10 and were also detected in the forebrain and neural tube at the vagal level from HH9 through HH15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). At later stages (HH13 - HH15) <italic>Chd7</italic> was more broadly expressed, with transcripts distributed across the head regions (midbrain and hindbrain) including the trigeminal ganglia (TG), developing face mesenchyme, eye and otic vesicle as well as a portion of vagal neural crest cells. In addition, at HH15, pharyngeal arches and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells were also <italic>Chd7</italic> positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><sec id="S3"><title>Epigenomic annotation of <italic>Chd7</italic> locus identifies numerous enhancer elements</title><p id="P10"><italic>Chd7</italic> was broadly expressed during early chick development, consistent with its omnipresent function as a chromatin remodeller, however, transcripts were notably enriched in the developing neural crest in-keeping with its known role in CHARGE syndrome. We next queried whether such a pervasive factor may be regulated in a tissue-specific fashion in the neural crest. To this end we explored neural crest-specific epigenomic features depicting putative enhancers interacting with the <italic>Chd7</italic> promoter. We first determined the <italic>Chd7</italic> topological associated domain (TAD) using Next-Generation Capture-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), a high-resolution targeted 3C approach adapted for low cell numbers. Using dissected dorsal neural tube tissue from HH8-10 chick embryos and differentiated red blood cells (RBC) from 10-day old chick embryos as a control, we resolved a broad neural crest specific TAD of approximately 1.1Mb, spanning ~85Kb upstream and ~1Mb downstream from the <italic>Chd7</italic> promoter, encompassing the entire gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We next surveyed the chromatin accessibility landscapes within the <italic>Chd7</italic> TAD using ATAC-seq data obtained from chick cranial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) and vagal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) neural crest and non-neural crest control cells at HH8-HH10 and HH10/HH18, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). We selected putative <italic>Chd7</italic> enhancers based on chromatin accessibility in neural crest cells. In total 14 putative enhancers were selected (A, B, C, D, F, H, I, J, O, P, Q, R, S, T) and screened for <italic>in vivo</italic> enhancer activity, using a fluorescent enhancer reporter assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). In order to determine the full temporal range of enhancer activity we performed both <italic>ex ovo</italic> electroporation at HH4 and <italic>in ovo</italic> electroporation at HH8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). These assays revealed 11 positive enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>) of which four were specifically active in neural crest cells (enh’s A, F, H, T) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Enh-A was the only upstream enhancer positioned approximately 18kb from the promoter. This element was accessible specifically in neural crest cells and not control environing tissues at both axial levels. At HH10-12, Enh-A enhancer activity was exclusively detected in delaminating and migrating cranial neural crest cells, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>), while at HH15 enh-A activity was predominant in vagal neural crest cells migrating into the pharyngeal arches 2-4, as well as the head mesenchyme and trigeminal ganglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Enh-B is located within the second intron of <italic>Chd7</italic>, ~37kb downstream from the promoter. Two large ATAC peaks (B1 and B2) were identified in the neural crest data, with smaller peaks resolved in the non-neural crest data, suggesting this region is accessible in a greater proportion of neural crest cells compared to non-NC cells. When tested <italic>in vivo</italic>, we found enh-B1 (+35.8kb from TSS) activity in a subset of pre-migratory neural crest cells at HH8, but present more broadly in neural tissue by HH12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Enh-B2 (+36.6kb from TSS) activity was restricted to the otic placode region at HH10-HH12 and later detected throughout the head and along the entire anteroposterior axis (HH18) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Another intronic enhancer located between exons 22 and 23 (+75.3kb from promoter) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), enh-C, was pre-dominantly active in the hindbrain and trunk neural tube at HH12 and HH15, with some activity in the midbrain and migrating vagal neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), consistent with its accessibility profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Downstream of the <italic>Chd7</italic> gene locus we identified 10 putative enhancers. Enh-D, +92.3kb from the TSS (~4kb) from the 3’UTR), opened progressively in the cranial neural crest data from HH8 to HH10, and in the vagal neural crest data from HH10 to HH18. Indicating an increase in the number of cells harbouring this element over developmental time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Enh-D presented broad activity in the forebrain and hindbrain regions including neural crest cells at HH12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Hindbrain activity continued at HH18 when reporter activity was also detected in the eyes, DRGs and vagal neural crest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). We previously identified a super-enhancer-like cluster of elements within the <italic>Chd7</italic> locus (<italic>Chd7</italic> SE) using H3K27ac and Brd4 ChIP data from migratory cranial neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). <italic>Chd7</italic> SE was located +114.5kb from the promoter, immediately downstream of enh-D and contained four distinct enhancers: enh-O, enh-F, enh-P and enh-Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Enh-O (+109kb) activity was confined to the cranial neural tube at HH8-HH10 but was more broadly distributed across the cranial region including migrating neural crest cells at HH12. Later, (HH18) enh-O activity was also detected in the neural tube at the vagal level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), consistent with this enhancer’s accessibility in the vagal neural crest as well as non-neural crest cells at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Enh-F (+115kb) activity was restricted to the cranial neural tube, including pre-migratory neural crest cells, at HH8. Enh-F activity persisted in delaminating and migrating neural crest cells at HH10 and HH12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). At HH12, enh-F activity was also detected in the posterior cranial neural tube and some ectoderm cells particularly around the otic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). By HH15, enh-F activity was detected in head mesenchyme, eye and mandibular arch, but was absent from more posterior body structures consistent with the compaction of this element in vagal neural crest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). At HH10-12 Enh-Q (+127kb) was active in a small number of cells in the otic placode region and later in the neural tube at vagal and cervical levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Genomic element termed Enh-P (+121kb) did not display any enhancer activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. We next tested two element lying within a 3kb region from each other, enh-H (+153kb) and enh-I (+155kb). Enh-H accessibility was consistently restricted to neural crest cells, while enh-H was active in the cranial neural crest at HH12 as well as in the neural tube at the level of rhombomeres 3-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). At HH15, enh-H activity was recorded in the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal arch and the migrating trunk neural crest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Enh-I was accessible in neural crest cells and non-neural crest cells and was ubiquitously active at HH10-12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Enh-J (+166kb) was also ubiquitous in the head at HH12 but confined to face mesenchyme and trunk at HH15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Enh-T, the most distal downstream element tested (+255kb), was active in migrating neural crest cells as well as otic placode and vagal neural crest cells at HH12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). By HH15, enh-T activity was most prominent in pharyngeal arches, trigeminal ganglia and hindbrain, with lower activity levels in the neural tube and trunk neural crest. However, by this stage enh-T activity in the otic region was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Other putative elements tested (enh-R; +199kb and enh-S;+241kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) showed no enhancer activity.</p><p id="P12">By conducting a thorough survey of <italic>Chd7</italic> epigenomic landscape in the chick embryo, we revealed a large cohort of enhancers putatively controlling <italic>Chd7</italic> expression. Interestingly we found several enhancers specifically active in the neural crest and others displaying broader activity in other <italic>Chd7</italic>-positive tissues, thus demonstrating differential tissue-specific regulation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>Chd7</italic> enhancers are conserved in human</title><p id="P13">While a large proportion of CHARGE syndrome cases are directly linked to mutations in <italic>CHD7</italic> coding region, there remains a significant number (&gt;50%) of cases without causal annotation. We postulated that some instances of CHARGE syndrome may be indirectly linked to <italic>CHD7</italic>, via perturbation of upstream regulation of <italic>CHD7</italic> expression. To this end, we sought to identify regulatory elements controlling the expression of <italic>CHD7</italic> in human. We first examined epigenomic data obtained from <italic>in vitro</italic> derived human cranial neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Specifically, we used ChIP-seq data for histone modifications associated with active enhancers (H3K4me1, H3K27ac), promoters (H3K4me3) and repressed chromatin (H3K27me3), as well as ATAC-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We also generated ATAC-seq data from the dissected vagal region (otic placode to somite 7), cranial region and heart, as control, of a Carnegie Stage 11 (CS11) human embryo (approximately 28-30 days gestation). The sample was obtained from the Human Developmental Biology Resource, with consent from the donor for use in research of embryonic material arising from termination of the pregnancy. The homologues of chick <italic>Chd7</italic> enhancers were mapped in the human data using the LiftOver function from UCSC genome browser, with the exception of enh-A and enh-T, which were manually predicted based on synteny with other elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We found that a number of elements identified in the human data as corresponding to chick <italic>Chd7</italic> enhancers, were marked by epigenomic features indicative of enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We tested several of the human equivalent <italic>CHD7</italic> enhancers in the chick enhancer reporter assay. The chick neural crest specific enh-A was predicted to reside within the first intron of human <italic>CHD7</italic> gene. While the putative human enh-A element did not appear accessible in the <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived neural crest cells, this region was marked by H3K4me1, suggesting this was a poised element in human neural crest. This observation was corroborated by a significant accessibility (large peak) in the human embryonic ATAC-seq dataset. Human Enh-B was marked by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, and the element was accessible in <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived neural crest cells and human embryonic vagal neural crest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, human enh-B was predominantly active in the developing forebrain region at HH12 and was also seen in the midbrain and neural tube extending into the trunk region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, panel i). Compared to chick enh-B which was more predominant in the hindbrain and vagal neural tube but also active, albeit slightly weaker, in the forebrain region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, panel ii). At HH15 human enh-B was detected along the neural tube and across the developing face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, panel iii), similar to the chick element (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). At HH18 we resolved somite specific activity from both chick and human enh-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, panels iv and v). Human enh-C had no enhancer associated features in the <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived neural crest data. However, since this data was generated from cranial neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>) and enh-C was primarily active in the neural tube at the trunk level in chick this is unsurprising and indeed reiterates the tissue specificity of <italic>Chd7</italic> regulation. Human enh-C was active in the trunk neural tube at HH12 which was maintained at HH15 where we also detected enhancer activity in the pharyngeal arches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, panel ii inset). Co-electroporation of chick and human enh-C showed the human element very precisely recapitulated the pattern of chick enh-C in the trunk neural tube at HH12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> panels iii, iv, v). Enh-D and enh-Q were marked by H3K4me1, but showed no accessibility in the <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived neural crest cells, whereas enh-Q was accessible as per the human embryo data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Enh-T was also characterised by H3K4me1 modification and found accessible in both data sets; this region was also marked by H3K27me3 possibly indicative of a repressive state. Enh-O showed some accessibility in the human data sets and was marked by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac with some indication of H3K4me3 suggesting this is indeed an active enhancer in human neural crest. Enh-F was accessible in the human embryonic neural crest and whilst the region was decorated by H3K4me1, significant H3K27me3 signal was also present, again indicating repressor activity. Enh-H and enh-I could not be distinguished from each other, but this region was accessible and marked by H3K4me1.</p><p id="P14">By comparing human and chick loci, we demonstrate conserved <italic>cis</italic>-regulation of <italic>CHD7</italic> at least across amniotes.

Indeed, such interactions are the foundation for cell-type specific regulation of gene expression. In order to explore putative TF binding within the <italic>Chd7</italic> enhancers, we first scanned human TF binding motifs, allowing us to identify motif instances within each enhancer sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Next, we calculated the enrichment of binding sites within each enhancer using the log odds ratio score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The two approaches yielded broadly similar results. Across all <italic>Chd7</italic> enhancers we found an enrichment of neural crest associated TF’s, such as Tfap, SoxE (Sox8/9/10) and SoxB1 (Sox2/3) factors as well as a significant input from the Zic family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Many enhancers received input from Arnt/Arnt2 and Atf2 factors, which we previously described in our survey of core upstream TFs driving neural crest lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Given the broad spatial and temporal range of <italic>Chd7</italic> enhancers, it is likely that different TF combinations drive enhancer activity at different time points and in different locations. In particular, we noted that the neural crest specific enhancers enh-A and enh-T were differentially enriched for Tfap2 and SoxE factors respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>). Suggesting differential mechanisms for <italic>Chd7</italic> regulation within the same cell population. Enh-T was driven by the Tfap2 family members which were not predicted to bind and drive enh-A. Enh-T was the only enhancer enriched for Sox8 binding, in addition to Sox10 and Sox2/3 factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Given the activity of enh-T extends to the otic placode region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) and Sox10, Sox8 and Sox3 are all expressed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>) it is likely these transcriptional activators and repressors work to balance enh-T activity in the otic placode region. Conversely, Enh-A was enriched for Sox9 and Sox10, but not Sox8 binding with presence of repressive Sox2/3 sites, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), likely repressing enh-A activity in the otic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Enh-H shared a similar signature with enh-A, whereby both enhancers lack Tfap2 sites but are driven by Sox9/10 and Sox2/3. Enh-A is also repressed by Snai2 in the hindbrain neural tube region. Enh-F and enh-C were also enriched for Snai2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) but were active in the hindbrain neural tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), likely driven by Pax6/7 which is notably absent in enh-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Enh-T and enh-H did not contain Snai2 repressor sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), allowing enhancer activity in neural crest cells and the otic placode region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Enh-F, which is also active in the cranial neural crest was enriched for both SoxE/B and Tfap2 factors. Furthermore, both enh-F and enh-C contained a Pax6/7 motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), and both enhancers were active in the neural tube from the hindbrain region and more posteriorly at HH12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). At HH15 enh-F is active in the developing eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) consistent with Pax6 expression whereas enh-C activity continues in the trunk region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) consistent with Pax7 expression.

Only enh-F, active in early cranial neural crest cells as well as some ectoderm cells in the hindbrain region, contained binding sites for all Zic factors (Zic1, 2, 3), suggesting this family regulates non-neural crest enhancer activity, consistent with the broad expression patterns of these factors in the neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Motif analysis suggests another canonical neural crest regulator, Ets1, also plays a role in <italic>Chd7</italic> regulation. We detected an enrichment of Ets1 binding sites in enh-H, enh-F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) and also identified some sites in enh-A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Given previously established relationships between Chd7 and Sox10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) we set out to explore the possibility that Sox10 could also be acting upstream of <italic>Chd7</italic>. We profiled Sox10 binding genome-wide using Biotin-Streptavidin based Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation (biotinChIP). For this purpose, we generated constructs to facilitate Avi-tagging of transcription factors at the N- or C-terminal. Furthermore, we incorporated an enhancer cloning site upstream of the expression cassette, such that the Avi-tagged-TF would be tissue specifically expressed under the control of its cognate enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) (Addgene #110204, #110205, see methods). We used the <italic>Sox10</italic> enh-99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) to drive C-terminally tagged Sox10.

Enh-H and enh-F were also significantly bound by Sox10, driving their neural crest-specific activity. Other enhancers whose activity was not restricted to the neural crest including enh-B, enh-C, enh-D and enh-O were also bound by Sox10 suggesting Sox10 drives their activity in neural crest cells with other factors driving their activity in non-neural crest tissues.</p><p id="P18">Given the observed enrichment of Tfap2B motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) we next examined Tfap2B binding at <italic>Chd7</italic> enhancers, Tfap2B is a known neural crest specification factor. Using Tfap2B biotin-ChIP data generated from cranial and vagal neural crest of HH18 embryos, where Tfap2B-Avi was driven under the control of the Ednrb enhancer, E2, (Addgene #127776) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>).
