Results are only as good as the model they have been generated in. However, choosing cell models for <italic>in vitro</italic> work often depends on what is available in labs or what has previously been used. Despite the vast increase in coronavirus research activity over the past few years, researchers are still heavily reliant on: non-human cells, for example Vero E6, highly heterogeneous or not fully differentiated cells, such as Calu-3, or naturally unsusceptible cells requiring overexpression of receptors and other accessory factors, such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Complex cell models, such as primary cell-derived air-liquid interface epithelial models are highly representative of human tissues but are expensive and time-consuming to develop and maintain. They have limited suitability for large-scale and high-throughput analysis.</p><p id="P3">Using tissue-specific expression pattern as a selection criteria, we identified human kidney cells as an ideal target for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and broader coronavirus infection. We show the use of the highly characterized human kidney cell line Caki-1 for infection with three human coronaviruses: <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic> SARS-CoV-2 and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> human coronavirus 229E (hCoV-229E). Caki-1 cells show equal or superior susceptibility to all three coronaviruses when compared to other commonly used cell lines for the cultivation of the respective virus. Antibody staining against SARS-CoV-2 N protein shows comparable replication rates. Using a panel of 21 antibodies in infected Caki-1 cells using immunocytochemistry shows the location of viral proteins during replication. In addition, Caki-1 cells were found to be susceptible to two other human respiratory viruses, influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, making them an ideal model for cross-comparison of not only a broad range of coronaviruses but respiratory viruses in general.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses within the order <italic>Nidovirales.</italic> They are split into four genera: alpha-, beta-, delta-, and gamma- coronaviruses. <italic>Alpha-</italic> and <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic> mainly infect mammalian hosts while the <italic>Delta-</italic> and <italic>Gammacoronaviruses</italic> primarily infect avian hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Four members of the human coronaviruses (hCoV) cause mild, cold-like, upper respiratory infections: <italic>Alphacoronaviruses</italic> -229E and -NL63 and <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic> -HKU1 and -OC43. On three occasions in the last 20 years, zoonotic transmission events of <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic> lead to epidemic and pandemic disease outbreaks with higher severity pathologies: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002-2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]; Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 2012-ongoing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]; and most recently SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic 2019-ongoing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. The potential for future zoonotic events increases as human-animal reservoir interaction increases, for example through population growth, displacement due to climate change, deforestation, and finding alternative food sources.</p><p id="P5">Understanding coronavirus infections and host-pathogen interaction is paramount to developing novel antiviral strategies, and to prepare for future epidemics. This makes it imperative to find robust cell line models that are widely permissive to different coronaviruses allowing for direct comparison increasing result validity.</p><p id="P6">Important criteria for selecting model cell lines include species origin, tissue relevance, method of immortalization (i.e. presence of overexpressed viral oncogenes), genetic characterization and karyotype, versatility, and ease of culturing. A number of cell lines were identified as being naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2, most notably Vero E6, Caco-2, and Calu-3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Overexpression of the main viral entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), sometimes aided by the overexpression of the proteolytic processing factor transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) was shown to render non-susceptible cell lines permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the overexpression cell lines then are permissive to infection, there are limitations and drawbacks to their use in research. Most notably, Vero E6 cells, which have been shown to be susceptible to many human viruses including influenza A virus (IAV), SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, are of African Green Monkey (<italic>Chlorocebus aethiops</italic>) origin, making them a less clinically relevant model. More importantly, they are deficient in type I interferon production due to a large deletion in their genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Tissue culture adaptation mutations and attenuation in the viral genome, such as the loss of the S1/S2 furin-cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), have been observed when the virus was passaged on Vero E6 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Although the other notable cell lines commonly used to study SARS-CoV-2 are of human origin, viral titers obtained from Calu-3 and Caco-2 are lower than in Vero E6 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells are heterogeneous populations of not fully differentiated cells, leading to varied consistency based on culturing methods. Some people also report difficulties culturing Calu-3 cells. Other, less explored cell lines were shown to be susceptible to high-titer SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as the breast cancer cell line CAL-51 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>],</p><p id="P7">The need for consistent and comparable cell lines has been highlighted by results from several genome-scale CRISPR knock-out studies investigating host factors during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The screens used different cell lines including Vero E6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], A549-ACE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], Huh7.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], or a clone of Huh7.5 modified to overexpress both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Huh7.5.1-ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Of these studies, ACE2 and cathepsin L (CTSL) were the only gene hits to overlap across all screens. The strongest overlap was observed between screens utilizing the same cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] or clonal variants of a cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Although this suggests that there is reproducibility when using the same cell line, some cell lines modified for overexpression of cellular receptors have limited use for cross-comparison studies between viruses. For instance, while A549-ACE2 cells would be sufficient for comparing SARS-CoV and -2, both of which utilize ACE2, they could not be used to compare to other coronaviruses, such as hCoV-229E utilizing alanyl aminopeptidase (ANPEP) or MERS-CoV utilizing dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) during entry. Additional overexpression or selection of clonal populations could change properties when comparing to other viruses. Huh7.5 cells and their derivatives are more broadly useable as they are naturally infectable by both hCoV-229E, and MERS-CoV due to their expressing a wide range of cell surface receptors. However, they are not very robust and exhibit extreme cytopathic effect upon early infection, limiting the types of studies to be conducted in these cells.</p><p id="P8">We aimed to find an adherent cell line that was both easy to transfect and naturally permissible to SARS-CoV-2. Both the human protein ATLAS and gene expression data deposited on NCBI identify the kidney as a tissue with high ACE2 expression. Pathology has furthermore identified SARS-CoV-2 infection within the kidneys of infected patients. Therefore, a human cell line isolated from a male clear cell carcinoma patient, Caki-1 (ATCC HTB-46), which has been previously used in cancer and toxicology studies was identified as a candidate target cell line. It has been well characterized through a number of loss-of-function screens and omics characterizations, as well as having data on drug sensitivities through the use of compound viability screens. A complete list of datasets can be found through the depmap portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/portal/cell_line/ACH-000433">https://depmap.org/portal/cell_line/ACH-000433</ext-link>). Although Caki-1 cells have previously been reported to be permissive to two members of the family <italic>Poxviridae</italic>, myxoma virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and Tanapoxvirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], we were unable to find reports of their being tested for infection with any RNA viruses.</p><p id="P9">Here, we describe the successful infection of Caki-1 cells when challenged with coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and hCoV-229E. All viruses replicated to similar or improved levels compared to commonly used cell lines. Using a SARS-CoV-2 anti-N antibody, we could show comparable replication kinetics between Caki-1 and Vero E6 cells. A panel of 26 antibodies raised in sheep against the known structural and non-structural proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 were used to study their cellular location during the SARS-CoV-2 replication in Caki-1 cells. We found good expression of virus receptors, interferon competence and susceptibility to gene knockdown in Caki-1 cells. Furthermore, two other clinically important respiratory RNA viruses, influenza A virus (IAV, order <italic>Articulavirales</italic>), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, order <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>) were also found to infect Caki-1 cells to comparable levels with the commonly used cell lines used for these viruses.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P10">To compare the differences between infection in Caki-1 cells and the typical amplification cell line for each coronavirus, time courses of infection were performed for SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern (VOCs), MERS-CoV, and hCoV-229E.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Caki-1 cells show matching or improved infectability with SARS-CoV-2 compared to Vero E6 cells</title><p id="P11">Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 D614G or VOCs alpha, delta, or omicron (BA.1) to investigate how the growth profile differed between clinical isolates from early stages of the pandemic through to the current predominant variant, omicron (Results</p><p id="P12">A). Cells at confluence were inoculated with MOIs 0.1, 1, or 10 as determined by endpoint titration on Vero E6 cells, except for omicron, which was titrated on Caki-1 cells due to poor growth on Vero E6 cells. Following media replacement at 1.5 hours post inoculation (hpi), supernatant samples were collected and viral RNA quantities in the supernatant determined by direct lysis against a standard curve of known titer samples. The European “Original” strain EDB-2 showed a similar replication pattern in Caki-1 and Vero E6 cells at all MOIs. Both reached a plateau at 24 hpi at a relative TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml of ~10<sup>7</sup> and maintained that value until the 120 hpi time point. There was little difference in the log phase for EDB-2 between cell lines and MOIs, although the Vero E6 cells show greater variation across the time points compared to Caki-1 cells in which variation decreases as the MOI increases (Results</p><p id="P13">A). For the alpha variant, first detected in November 2020, we used strain EDB-α-1 for infection. The replication curve in Vero E6 cells flattens into a more linear phenotype peaking at 96 hpi with a relative TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml in the low 10<sup>6</sup> region for all MOIs. The MOI of 0.1 infection lags slightly behind. Contrastingly, viral replication in Caki-1 cells still shows exponential growth, with stratification between the MOIs through the log phase before all plateauing at 48 hpi with a relative TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml maintained at ~10<sup>7</sup> (Results</p><p id="P14">A). For the delta variant, which emerged in late 2020, we used strain EDB-δ-1. The delta variant did not replicate as well as either previous variant overall and shows a more linear growth phenotype, similar to the EDB-α-1 variant in Vero E6, in both Vero E6 and Caki-1 cells. In both cell lines replication plateaus at 72 hpi up to 2-3x10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml by 96 hpi. For EDB-δ-1, the increase in viral titer across the entire time course, in both cell lines, was only two logs. In contrast, in Caki-1 cells for EDB-2 and EDB-α1 the fold-change was five log<sub>10</sub> (Results</p><p id="P15">A). The last VOC, omicron, was detected in December 2021 with new subvariants emerging since. Here, using EDB-ο-BA.1-10, we saw very poor infection in Vero E6 cells, barely increasing by 10-fold across 120 hpi, and dropping thereafter, likely due to virus degradation. In Caki-1 cells, we see a growth phenotype comparable to the original EDB-2 strain with a log phase peaking at 24 hpi and stratification between the different MOIs. Once EDB-ο-BA.1-10 reaches a plateau in Caki-1 cells at a TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml of ~10<sup>6</sup>, it remains steady with very little variation for the remainder of the time course. Viral replication of EDB-ο-BA.1-10 in Caki-1 is reaching higher levels compared to Vero E6 cells (Results</p><p id="P16">A). As the virus evolved, it remained capable of replicating in the Caki-1 cells whilst progressively weaker infection is established in Vero E6 cells. The one exception is EDB-δ-1, which does not replicate well in either cell line.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Caki-1 cells show improved infectability with MERS-CoV and hCoV-229E compared to Huh-7</title><p id="P17">Since Caki-1 cells showed good permissibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses were tested to determine if Caki-1 cells could be used as a pan-coronavirus model. To this end, the highly pathogenic beta coronavirus, MERS-CoV, and the less pathogenic common cold alpha coronavirus, hCoV-229E, were tested for replication in Caki-1 cells (Results</p><p id="P18">B+C). The traditional cell line for both these viruses is Huh-7.</p><p id="P19">For MERS-CoV infection, both Caki-1 and Huh-7 cells were inoculated using titres determined on Huh-7 cells. After 2 h, inoculum was replaced and samples taken at indicated time points. Infectious virus produced was assessed by endpoint titration on Huh-7 cells. In initially infected Huh-7 cells, the viral titer for MERS-CoV rose rapidly to 24 hpi and peaks here for an MOI of 1, but is slightly delayed for the lower MOIs, peaking at 48 hpi for 0.1 and 0.01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). At all MOIs, a peak of ~1.2x10<sup>7</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml titer is achieved. After peaking, a rapid decline is observed for every MOI, crashing down to 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml by 96 hpi. Whilst the exponential phase in Caki-1 cells shows initial similarities to Huh-7 the viral titers plateau at 48 hpi for all MOIs. By that time, the cells have managed to support the virus to reach a TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml of ~2.1x10<sup>9</sup>, which is two logs higher than Huh-7 cells in any condition. Whilst MOIs of 0.1 and 1 show a decreasing titer to ~10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml, MOI 0.01 infectious titers remain high up to 96 hpi. Caki-1 cells show a strong potential with MERS-CoV to be used as a new model system for growing the virus, higher titers are achieved with lower infection concentrations and the titers do not decrease with cell apoptosis as Caki-1 cells can robustly support the infection to its completion.</p><p id="P20">To test whether Caki-1 cells are permissive to hCoV-229E, a GFP-reporter virus was used to measure infection throughout the course of infection using relative fluorescence of GFP as a proxy for viral replication rather than TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml (Results</p><p id="P21">C). Caki-1 and Huh-7 cells were inoculated at indicated virus concentrations as determined on Huh-7 cells. After 1.5 h, inoculum was replaced and plates returned to an incubating plate reader for analysis. The level of fluorescence achieved by both cell lines when infected is comparable to each other, but in Caki-1 cells, we see a quicker and more exaggerated log phase, reaching plateau at roughly 40 hpi, about 10 h before Huh-7 cells. There is also a difference in the lower MOI (0.1), which only achieves a plateau fluorescence value around 5,000 RFU in the Huh-7 cells, a &gt;2-fold reduction compared to Huh-7 cells infected at an MOI of 1, while Caki-1 cells plateau around 8,500 RFU, only 2,000 RFU lower than the MOI of 1 and within the margin of error. The Caki-1 cells also show an observable difference of GFP distribution and brightness when compared to Huh-7 cells. Caki-1 cells produce a more uniform phenotype, with less background fluorescence, the GFP is expressed to a greater extent in infected cells, and it takes longer for the cells to round up and lift off the plate. Huh-7 cells generally express the GFP very weakly and in a more punctate fashion, lifting off the plate very early on in infection, making fluorescence readings difficult and inaccurate (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Only around 50% of Caki-1 cells get infected by SARS-CoV-2 showing potential of selection for even more susceptible subpopulations</title><p id="P22">To gain greater insight into the infection in Vero E6 cells compared to the more heterogeneous Caki-1 cells, we inoculated the cells at different MOIs (determined on Vero E6 cells) and assessed infection following a single-round infection at 17 hpi through staining for intracellular N protein and analysis by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). For all MOIs analyzed, the level of infected Caki-1 cells is roughly half of the infected Vero E6 cells. The Vero E6 population manages to reach up to ~85.3% infected cells by 17 hpi at an MOI=10 and within the margin of error compared to MOI=1, whereas the Caki-1 reach an infection ~46.8%. Another cell line used for SARS-CoV-2 research is Calu-3, an epithelial lung adenocarcinoma cell line with heterogeneous ACE2 expression. The percentage of infected cells remains low in the wild-type Calu-3 population, reaching 6% infection when inoculated at MOI=10 by 24 hpi, and only increasing by 0.8% after 48 hpi. Calu-3’s which have been enriched for high expression of ACE2 through staining, fluorescence activated cell sorting, and expansion, showed a marked increase in percentage of infection cells, reaching 21% at an MOI=0.1 at 24 hpi and roughly 50% at all MOIs at 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Whilst Calu-3 cells take longer to establish an infection, if enriched with ACE2 they are capable of reaching infection levels similar to Caki-1 cells although this is most likely through a multi-round infection unlike the single-round infection in Caki-1 cells at 17 hpi.</p><p id="P23">Caki-1 cells are permissible to all tested coronaviruses and in EDB-ο-BA.1-1, MERS-CoV and hCoV-229E, show a stronger infection than in Vero E6 and Huh7 cells, respectively. As SARS-CoV-2 VOCs emerged, Caki-1 cells have become a better infection model than the Vero E6 cells. They also provide a good replication model for other coronaviruses and can outperform the standard Huh-7 cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Western blot analysis shows comparable rates of replication staining for the SARS-CoV-2 N protein</title><p id="P24">To gain a greater understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection, antibodies were raised in sheep against all major proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) by the University of Dundee MRC-Protein Phosphorylation Unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. To assess the rate of replication at the protein level, viral replication was observed through western blot analysis against N protein of lysed cells. Briefly, Vero E6 and Caki-1 cells at confluence were inoculated at MOI=1 (as determined on Vero E6 cells) for 1.5h before media replacement. At indicated time points, cells were lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. Quantification of protein levels normalized to beta-actin show comparable replication between Vero E6 cells and Caki-1 cells for EDB-2. As observed in the virus production levels, the replication of EDB-δ-1 was significantly slower with a first plateau reached at 16h, eventually increasing further to 48hpi but significantly lower in comparison to EDB-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). A background band could be observed even in uninfected cells at around 40kDa overlapping with the signal for beta-actin. This band was found to disappear when a rabbit anti-beta-actin antibody was used in later experiments (data not shown) indicating cross-reaction of the secondary anti-sheep or anti-mouse antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Localization of viral proteins in Caki-1 cells during replication may pinpoint towards functionality</title><p id="P25">To fully characterize the SARS-CoV-2 replication in Caki-1 cells the full panel of 26 antibodies targeting both structural and non-structural proteins of the virus (as described above) were used to localize the proteins at peak infection. Caki-1 cells infected at a MOI=1 with SARS-CoV-2-EDB-2 were fixed at 16 hpi and stained with antibodies targeting most non-structural proteins and the known open reading frames in the “structural” section of the genome. A compromise was found using the antibodies, which had varying stock concentrations, at 1 in 200. Concentrations are therefore not comparable and for specific use of an antibody, we recommend further optimization. Further details may be found in the materials and methods section and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>. Confocal images were acquired as z-stacks on a Zeiss LSM 880 (Airyscan) without use of the airyscan function. Imaging conditions were set for each uninfected, stained background cell with the matching primary antibody. Images depict a maximum projection of the z-stack.</p><p id="P26">Of the open reading frame (ORF)2-10 encoded “structural” proteins, ORF3a and b, ORF6 ORF8 and N (ORF9) show the strongest signals above background. Almost all SARS-CoV-2 ORF antibodies show specific staining above background with the exception of E (ORF4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The spike receptor binding domain (S RBD), ORF2, shows vesicle-like punctate throughout the cytoplasm with a slight enrichment in the enlarged perinuclear space in some cells. There is little staining for S at the plasma membrane, which is in agreement with previous findings showing that only roughly 20% of coronavirus S protein may be found at the plasma membrane in the presence of M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. In contrast to S, the M protein (ORF4) was found to be more perinuclear in localization and more punctate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The viroporin ORF3a, shows similar though stronger punctate staining with concentration around the perinuclear space. This agrees with current SARS-CoV literature and reports of it being involved in autophagy, localizing to the lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Although there is some background staining in uninfected Caki-1 cells for ORF3a, the staining in the infected control is significantly stronger and background signal is non-specifically localized indicating non-specific background binding that may be optimized using different staining conditions. The small ORF3b protein, which acts as a potent interferon antagonist, localizes in the distal cytoplasm with some vesicular patterning. ORF3b also shows staining at the plasma membrane particularly along actin filaments. This agrees with reports for SARS-CoV of it being a multi-localized protein due to its shuttling behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Co-localization studies with known interaction partners, such as IRF3, may shed further light into the role of ORF3b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. The interferon antagonist ORF6, binding and sequestering STAT1, is a known virulence factor of SARS-CoV-2, previously found to localize in the ER and at lysosomal membranes upon overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. A similar localization pattern is observed upon infection in Caki-1 cells with perinuclear concentration and distributed puncta throughout the cell. Additional staining could further substantiate localization to specific organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a and ORF7b are type-I transmembrane proteins also involved in antagonism of the interferon response. Both are expressed and retained intracellularly. Background staining is observed for both these antibodies in the uninfected Caki-1 cells, but the fluorescence is stronger in the infected cells. ORF7a shows vesicular, diffuse localization, whilst ORF7b is concentrated in the perinuclear space with some plasma membrane staining. Little is known about the function of the two proteins, but for example ORF7b was shown to be incorporated into SARS-CoV particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. The protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 gene is unique to SARS-CoV-2 containing a predicted Ig-like fold, which can interact with a variety of host proteins involved in ER-associated degradation. Caki-1 cells show a strong staining with no background in the uninfected cells, and we see a vesicular staining with a concentration towards the plasma membrane in agreement with the existing literature showing secretion of ORF8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. ORF9, the nucleocapsid protein (N), shows localization to the replication-transcription complex in the perinuclear space, where it aids packaging of the viral genome into a ribonucleoprotein particle. Staining for N is abundant across the cell, and even shows a small amount of nuclear staining (the seemingly stronger nuclear staining visible in the image is a consequence of maximum projection). N is also secreted into the extracellular space in larger amounts than ORF8, indicated by some of the vesicular and distal staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. An alternative ORF located within the N gene is ORF9b, which plays a role in suppressing innate immunity. ORF9b shows a very diffuse staining across the cell with no background in the uninfected cells. Reports have linked this protein with the mitochondrial membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], and upon close inspection, long punctate networks can be seen within some of the staining, although this is not obvious indicating mitochondrial interaction not to be a primary function of the protein. Most importantly, ORF9b shows clear nuclear localization. An second alternative ORF located within N encodes for ORF9c, a membrane-associated protein and has been associated with antiviral response suppression and suggested to be unstable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Our results show an interesting concentration of ORF9c protein at the end of what look to be actin protrusions. Accumulations near the nucleus could however indicate an unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). ORF10 is possibly one of the most obscure proteins of SARS-CoV-2, with little known about its function. We found some perinuclear aggregations of the protein and otherwise relatively evenly distributed small puncta throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P27">The SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins (NSPs) are generated through proteolytic cleavage of the ORF1a and ORF1ab polyproteins. Of these, NSPs 3, 8, 10 and 16 gave the clearest staining. However, some NSPs showed very little specific staining, primarily NSP9 for which no staining could be seen in infected Caki-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The N-terminal cleavage products NSP1 and NSP2 are conserved across the coronavirus family and are both involved in halting host translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Whilst NSP1 shows very sparse staining in very distinct puncta throughout the cytosol, staining for NSP2 is concentrated around the perinuclear space. NSP3 is responsible for cleavage of NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3 from the N-terminal region of the polyproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], and shows widespread, punctate staining. Some cells, possibly at an earlier stage in their infection cycle, show a more perinuclear focused staining, likely co-localizing with the replication transcription complex (RTC). The main proteinase NSP5 shows a very strong perinuclear, likely RTC, phenotype. NSP8 and NSP7 form a heterodimer. It is then unsurprising that staining for the proteins show similar localization. Whilst NSP7 is a relatively weak signal, NSP8 exhibits strong perinuclear staining showing big spots of protein staining, defined by its role in the RTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. NSP8 also shows some nuclear staining, however, since there is some background nuclear staining it is unlikely this is a real signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The growth-factor-like protein NSP10, which serves as a stimulatory factor for NSP14-ExoN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], shows broadly distributed punctate staining with some localization to the plasma membrane and although the staining for NSP14 is not as strong, it demonstrates a similar pattern but with no membrane localization. NSP11_12, the latter being the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase, shows staining localizing to the RTC, as do the helicase NSP13, the endoribonuclease NSP15. There may be some staining for NSP13 in the nucleus. NSP16, a methyltransferase, shows nuclear staining and punctate staining throughout the cytosol indicating vesicular localization, and potentially some secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Caki-1 cells show expression of receptors linked to SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses</title><p id="P28">To further understand the suitability of Caki-1 cells for infection assays and to account for the high permissibility to many coronaviruses, receptor expression profiling, interferon competence and siRNA knockdowns were conducted.

The viability of the Caki-1 cells after knockdown was measured by fluorescence created through mitochondrial metabolism as a proxy for cell viability. There was no difference to cell viability after knockdown of any of these genes. Neither was there any effect on cell viability due to being treated with the transfection reagent (Mock). This shows that Caki-1 cells can be transfected successfully and that it results in the desired effect on viral replication, they can also tolerate the transfection reagent without a reduction in cell viability.

With the exception of RSV, they are comparable to or outperform the current preferred cell line for viral production, whilst also providing a naturally permissible environment for the virus to replicate in. They express all the receptors needed for infection with SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and hCoV-229E, and are responsive to transfection with siRNA without significant cell death. They have a competent interferon response as demonstrated by stimulation with Poly I:C and are also permissive to other respiratory viruses. This makes them a highly useful model for direct comparison of respiratory viruses across one, unmodified (no overexpression) cell line.</p><p id="P38">The natural susceptibility of Caki-1 (human) cells to a range of respiratory viruses, although not a lung cell line, provides them with an advantage over many other cell lines used for viral research. Particularly over the much used Vero E6 cells (African Green Monkey), which, although permissive to many different viruses, do not provide a representative environment for human pathogens. The broad susceptibility of Caki-1 cells to respiratory virus infection allows for their use in comparative studies between viruses. Calu-3 cells, which have been widely used as a lung cell model for SARS-CoV-2, show a very low percentage infection and are difficult to grow. Selection for ACE2 expressing cells (Calu-3-ACE2) through FACS makes the cells more permissive to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and can also enhance growth characteristics through selection of cell subpopulations. However, this specializes the Calu-3-ACE2 cells to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and is likely impacting infectability with other viruses. Similarly though, if someone wanted a more highly permissive version of Caki-1cells to study their SARS-CoV-2 infection, selection of ACE2 cells may improve infection beyond 50%. We would however advise to keep this population as is due to its broad susceptibility to a range of respiratory viruses.</p><p id="P39">Whilst Caki-1 are still a cancer cell line, and thus contain the mutations and caveats associated with that fact, they have a well-characterized genome and expression patterns. Whilst they have a knockout mutation in the CDKN2 gene and this should be kept in mind, they also boast a fully receptive innate immune response, allowing this pathway to be interrogated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cbioportal.org/">https://www.cbioportal.org/</ext-link>, Accessed 8/10/2022, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]). This is also demonstrated by their response to intracellular Poly I:C (a viral mimic), but not to LPS which is a bacterial stimulant of immune cells, showing their response is specific and relevant to viral infections. Conversely, the Vero E6 cells are defective in its production of interferon, but remains sensitive to the action of interferon through ISGs, often making it a preferred cell line for the production of viral stocks, with the caveat that attenuation is more likely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P40">With the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants it has been found that in other cell lines, there is a change in tropism and attachment / processing factor preference leading to a loss of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Caki-1 cells are able to maintain equal levels of infection across all the VOCs tested (alpha, delta, and omicron), without a change in phenotype, whereas Vero E6 cells lose their ability to effectively support viral replication as the variants evolve. This decrease in permissibility of the Vero E6 cells runs in parallel with the decrease in severe symptoms seen with the evolution of the variants, with omicron causing the mildest disease of all the variants, likely attributed to a change in cell tropism and / or temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. As the Caki-1 cells can support infection of the omicron variant, and it has been reported that omicron has moved away from TMPRSS2 mediated entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], it could be assumed that entry into Caki-1 cells is less or not TMPRSS2 dependent. This is reflected in the knockdown phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) with 25% relative infection still occurring upon knockdown of TMPRSS2. This makes the Caki-1 cell line very valuable for future SARS-CoV-2 research as they will be useful to study the host-virus interactions of variants evolved from omicron.</p><p id="P41">The Caki-1 cell line also offers ideal growth characteristics for viral study and propagation. Whilst being permissive to transfection Caki-1 cells have a doubling time of 36 hours (preventing overgrowth), the cultures can pack tightly to form dense monolayers capable of supporting widespread viral infection, and are robust enough to be able to maintain multi rounds of infection without significant CPE development. Conversely, Vero E6, Calu-3, and Huh7 cells all develop CPE after 24 hpi with SARS-CoV-2, restricting their use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. The slower growth of Caki-1 cells compared to all other preferred cell lines, especially Vero E6 cells, also means that they are suitable for producing stocks of slower growing viruses such as the common cold coronaviruses. Here, we have also utilized Caki-1 cells to isolate clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2, specifically omicron, a methodology which usually has been achieved on Vero E6 cells for all major virus types. This negates the worry for mutation accumulation in the S1/S2 furin cleavage site that has been observed in SARS-CoV-2 within a single passage in Vero E6 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The ability of Caki-1 cells to support robust infection with multiple respiratory viruses shows that this cell line can be useful to study both coronaviruses and common cold viruses in direct comparison. The growth properties of the cells furthermore improve high-throughput readouts and methods through slower growth and overcrowding, reducing background fluorescence and changes to cell properties in a dense cell layer.</p><p id="P42">The SARS-CoV-2 antibodies developed by MRC PPU Dundee form a useful toolset to quantify and visualize viral proteins throughout the replication cycle as we have demonstrated here.

The staining and the advantage of higher resolution techniques show the vast potential to study viral protein function through localization. Particularly interesting will be the function of nuclear localization of NSP16 and ORF9b in particular. The many functions associated with proteins like N, ORF3B, NSP2, and NSP8 are indicated through their broad distribution patterns within the cell. With these antibodies being raised in sheep, they are ideal for pairing with other antibodies for co-localization studies. Here, we have used a variety of antibodies purified from different bleeds of the production sheep as they were available to us. Indications are that later bleeds show less background and more specific staining. It is clear that further optimization for some of the staining protocols is warranted for some of the proteins of interest.</p><p id="P43">The multifaceted uses of Caki-1 cells in viral research are clear; they are easy to work with and manipulate in the lab, they can support a range of viruses across multiple rounds of infection, and in most cases outperform the commonly used cell line for each virus.

The closer a model matches the host, the more conclusive results are. Complex cell systems based on primary epithelial or stem cells are the gold standard of <italic>in vitro</italic> research. However, they are expensive, time consuming, and laborious to establish. Therefore, cell lines remain the backbone of virus research.</p><p>Despite vastly increased research into human coronaviruses following the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers continue to rely on suboptimal cell line models, for example ells of non-human origin like the VeroE6 African Green Monkey cell line. Using known expression patterns of the entry factors of the COVID-19 causative agent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) we identified the Caki-1 cell line as a target for SARS-CoV-2. This cell line could be shown to be infectable with a wide range of coronaviruses including common cold virus hCoV-229E, epidemic virus MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 as well as other important respiratory viruses influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus. We could show that SARS-CoV-2 proteins can be stained for and localized in Caki-1 cells and the cells are competent of forming a cellular immune response. Together, this makes Caki-1 cells a unique tool for cross-virus comparison in one cell line.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Time course assays in coronaviruses comparing the most commonly used cell line with Caki-1.</title><p>For all graphs: circle points = MOI 10, square points = MOI 1, triangle points = MOI 0.1, diamond points = MOI 0.01, and the darker the color the higher the MOI, error bars indicate +/- SEM.
