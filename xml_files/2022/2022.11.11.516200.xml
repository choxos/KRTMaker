Despite large-scale poultry vaccination regimes across China, the H7N9 AIVs continue to persist and evolve rapidly in poultry. Recently, several strains of H7N9 AIVs have been isolated and shown the ability to escape vaccine-induced immunity. To assess the zoonotic risk of the recent H7N9 AIV isolates, we rescued viruses with hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from these H7N9 AIVs and six internal segments from PR8 virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 [H1N1]) and characterized their receptor binding, pH of fusion, thermal stability, plaque morphology and in ovo virus replication. We also assessed the cross-reactivity of the viruses with human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against H7N9 HA and ferret antisera against H7N9 AIV candidate vaccines. The H7N9 AIVs from the early epidemic waves had dual sialic acid receptor binding characteristics, whereas the more recent H7N9 AIVs completely lost or retained only weak human sialic acid receptor binding. Compared with the H7N9 AIVs from early epidemic waves (2013-2016), the recent (2020/21) viruses formed larger plaques and increased replication titres in ovo, demonstrating increased acid stability but reduced thermal stability. Further analysis showed that these recent H7N9 AIVs had poor cross-reactivity with the human mAbs and ferret antisera, highlighting the need to update the vaccine candidates. To conclude, the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs showed characteristics of typical AIVs, posing reduced zoonotic risk but a heightened threat for poultry.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">A new H7N9 virus strain emerged in China in 2013 and has resulted in more than 1500 confirmed human infections with ~40% case fatality rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). During the first four epidemic waves (2013-2016), only the low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) genotype of H7N9 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were prevalent, however, the high-pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAI) genotype emerged in the fifth epidemic wave (2016-2017) and has since been co-circulating with the LPAI H7N9 AIVs in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Compared to the LPAI, the HPAI H7N9 phenotype can cause more severe clinical diseases in chicken, ducks, mice as well as in ferrets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). In the early epidemic waves, the H7N9 AIVs were mainly reported near the Yangtze delta region and Pearl delta region in China. Surprisingly, the H7N9 AIVs spread geographically all over China during fifth epidemic wave, with 33 out of 34 provinces or municipalities in mainland China affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Furthermore, possible hospital and family clusters of H7N9 AIV have been reported and raised concern of human-to-human transmission and thus possible pandemic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Given the threat posed by H7N9 AIVs to both human and animal health, the Chinese government implemented a mass vaccination program in poultry against H7N9 from September 2017. Since then, human H7N9 AIV infection dropped sharply, with no new cases reported since 2020. The successful prevention of human infection with H7N9 AIVs by large scale vaccination of poultry relies on the following two factors: On one hand, the mass poultry vaccination substantially reduces the prevalence of H7N9 AIVs in poultry, consequently reducing the risk of human infections as the majority of human H7N9 cases are linked to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. On the other hand, when some viruses escape the vaccine-induced immunity, they pose a lower zoonotic risk to humans as the vaccine escape mutations resulted in a loss or weakened affinity to human receptor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Recently, Chen <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) isolated several H7N9 AIVs from poultry about six months post-vaccination with H7N9 H7-Re3 and H7N9 rLN79 vaccine strains in China. Compared with the vaccine strains, the recently emerged H7N9 AIVs showed an 8-to-128-fold reduction in the antigenic cross-reactivity with chicken post-vaccination sera as measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assay. Of note, the H7N9 A/Chicken/Yunnan/1004/2021 could evade the vaccine protection and caused 40%–80% mortality in immunized chickens. Due to the antigenic drift, these newly emerged H7N9 AIVs might gradually become dominant under the vaccine-induced pressure. It is therefore important to closely monitor the evolution and thus the zoonotic risk of these newly emerged H7N9 AIVs.</p><p id="P4">Studies investigating transmission of H5N1 AIVs in ferret model revealed that efficient human-to-human transmission requires shift from avian to human receptor binding preferences, reduced pH of fusion and increased HA thermal stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). The receptor binding specificity of influenza A virus is one of the major determinants of host specificity; both H2N2 and H3N2 pandemics have been linked to the preference switch from avian (α2,3-linked sialic acid) to human (α2,6-linked sialic acid) receptor specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). The H7N9 AIV isolates from the early epidemic waves showed comparable binding preferences to both receptors, a characteristic of H7N9 AIV which has been associated with the zoonotic infections of humans in China since 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The acid and thermal stability of HA have also been shown to play important role in both interspecies and intraspecies transmission of influenza viruses (reviewed in [15]). Generally, the fusion pH of AIVs ranges from 5.6 to 6.2, while human influenza viruses require relatively lower pH (5.0 to 5.4) for efficient fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). The H7N9 AIV from the early epidemic waves showed a pH of fusion of around 5.6 to 5.8. However, some HPAI H7N9 in the fifth epidemic wave appears to fuse at pH 5.4 or lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). In terms of HA thermal stability, the H7N9 AIVs appeared progressively more thermal stably, the LPAI and HPAI H7N9 AIVs from epidemic wave five have been shown to be comparable to or more thermal stable than the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In this study, we systematically investigated the risk of the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs to human and animal health by assessing the virus receptor binding, pH of fusion, HA thermal stability, virus infectivity and the cross-reactivity of these H7N9 variants with human H7N9 mAbs and ferret sera raised against World Health Organization (WHO) vaccine candidates.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Newly emerged H7N9 AIVs lost or retained weak human-like sialic acid receptor binding</title><p id="P6">The receptor binding switch from avian-like to human-like is the key prerequisite for the interspecies transmission of AIVs from birds to humans. To examine such properties of the H7N9 AIVs in China, we utilized biolayer interferometry to characterize the receptor-binding profiles of these viruses to the avian-like 3’-sialylacetyllactosamine (3SLN) and human-like 6’-sialylacetyllactosamine (6SLN) receptor analogues. Three H7N9 AIVs isolated from December 2020 to March 2021 from three different provinces in China were selected for this study; they are HPAI H7N9 A/Chicken/Yunnan/1004/2021 (referred to as YN/21) from Yunnan province, south of China, HPAI H7N9 A/Chicken/Hebei/1009/2020 (referred to as HB/20) from Hubei Province, north of China, and HPAI H7N9 A/Chicken/Shanxi/1012/2021 (referred to as SX/21) from Shanxi province, north of China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). All viruses were isolated after mass vaccination with H7N9 H7-Re3 (Harbin Weike Biotechnology Development Company) or rLN79 (Guangzhou South China Biologic Medicine) vaccines and showed reduced antigenic cross-reactivity with the vaccine strains. We also included H7N9 A/Anhui/1/2013 from the first epidemic wave (referred to as AH/13), and HPAI H7N9 AIV A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (referred to as GD/16) from epidemic wave five for reference. The recombinant viruses were generated by reverse genetics with HA and NA from these H7N9 AIVs and six internal segments from PR8 virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 [H1N1]). In agreement with our previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), the H7N9 AH/13 showed comparable binding to both 3SLN and 6SLN receptor analogues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In comparison to the AH/13, the GD/16 from the epidemic wave five showed significantly stronger binding to 3SLN and a slight increase in binding to 6SLN receptor analogues respectively (~293-fold increase to 3SLN and ~2-fold increase to 6SLN). The HB/20 and SX/21 HPAI H7N9 AIVs completely lost binding to the 6SLN receptor analogue while gaining a slight improvement of binding to the 3SLN receptor analogue when compared with AH/13 (~4-fold and 2-fold increase to 3SLN respectively). YN/21 showed similar binding affinity toward 3SLN receptor analogue as HB/20 and SX/21. However, it still bound to 6SLN analogue, though the binding affinity was ~39 folds weaker when compared with the AH/13. In conclusion, the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs showed typical receptor binding profiles of AIVs with complete loss or very weak binding toward human-like receptors.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Newly emerged H7N9 AIVs demonstrated reduced pH of fusion and HA thermal stability</title><p id="P7">The pH of fusion has been shown to play an important role in host adaptation and transmission; human-adapted influenza viruses generally fuse at a lower pH, while AIVs normally have a higher pH fusion threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Consistent with the previous report, AH/13 triggered fusion at pH 5.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Surprisingly, the GD/16 from the epidemic wave five fused at pH 5.3 or lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Compared with the AH/13, all the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs showed a lower threshold pH for HA activation, with YN/21 fused at pH 5.4 or lower and HB/20 and SX/21 fused at pH 5.5 or lower. In addition to receptor binding and pH of fusion, increased HA thermal stability has been linked to a vital role in AIV evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Previous work has shown that the HA of aerosol or respiratory droplet-transmissible influenza viruses are comparatively more thermal stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). To test the heat stability of the HA protein, the newly emerged recombinant H7N9 AIVs together with GD/16 and AH/13 viruses were incubated at 4.0°C, 50°C, 50.7°C, 51.9°C, 53.8°C, 56.1°C, 58.0°C, 59.2°C and 60°C for 30 min, after which the loss of HA activity was determined. Compared with the AH/13 from the epidemic wave one, the GD/16 showed increased thermal stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). All the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs were sensitive to high temperature, they lost HA activity more rapidly than both AH/13 and GD/16.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The newly emerged H7N9 AIV formed larger plaques and replicated robustly <italic>in ovo</italic></title><p id="P8">To assess the fitness of the virus, we assessed the plaque sizes and the virus replication in the embryonated eggs. Alike the Anhui/13 virus, the GD/16 formed relatively small size plaques in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. However, all the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs formed significantly larger size plaques than the viruses from the early epidemic waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). To further assess the effects of these mutations on virus replication, 10-day old embryonated eggs were inoculated with 100 plaque-forming units of the H7N9 AIVs for 48 hours and virus titres were determined by HA assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In agreement with the plaque morphology, all the newly emerged H7N9 AIV grew to significant higher titres than the AH/13 and GD/16. To conclude, the newly emerged H7N9 AIV formed larger plaques and replicated robustly <italic>in ovo,</italic> indicating that these newly emerged H7N9 AIVs have more replication fitness than the viruses from the early epidemic waves.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The newly emerged H7N9 AIVs reduced/lost cross-reactivity with human monoclonal antibodies</title><p id="P9">We previously isolated and generated four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from humans naturally infected with H7N9 A/Anhui/1/2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). The mAb L3A-44, K9B-122, L4A-14 and L4B-18 target HA residues 125 (Alanine (A)), 133 (Glycine (G)), 149 (Asparagine (N)), and 217 (Leucine (L)), respectively. To investigate the cross-reactivity of the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs with these mAbs, all the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs were tested by HI assay with the panel of mAbs with AH/13 and GD/16 as reference. In line with our previous reports, all four human mAbs showed high HI titres to AH/13 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The HI titres of L3A-44, L4B-18 and K9B-122 dropped dramatically while L4A-14 only showed one log2 reduction to GD/16 when compared with AH/13. All the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs completely lost their cross-reactivity with human mAb L4A-14, L3A-44 and K9B-122, with only weak cross-reactivity found with L4B-18. To investigate the cause for the reduced cross-reactivity between mAbs and the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs, the HA amino acid sequences of these H7N9 AIVs were analysed. All the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs harbour Threonine (T) at amino acid residue 125 and 151 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), which introduced an N-linked glycosylation at amino acid residues 123 and 149 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>); such introduction has been shown to abolish the binding to L3A-44 and L4A-14 respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). The drop in HI titre of L4B-18 with the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs might be due to the L217Q substitution in HA, which has been shown to reduce its cross-reactivity with L4B-18. As for K9B-122, it lost cross-reactivity in the presence of T at HA amino acid residue 123 or Q at HA amino acid residue 217 from all the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Cross-reactivity of newly emerged H7N9 AIVs with the ferret antisera against H7N9 vaccine candidates</title><p id="P10">Antigenic characterization of AIVs by ferret antisera has and continues to be used by the WHO for the selection of the candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) for influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). To test whether the CVVs are still effective against the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs, we assessed the neutralizing profile of ferret antisera against candidate vaccine virus AH/13 from epidemic wave one and GD/16 from epidemic wave five by both HI an microneutralization (MN) assay. Consistent with our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), GD/16 showed a 5 log<sub>2</sub> reduction in HI titre with AH/13 ferret antiserum when compared with the AH/13 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Likewise, the HI titre of newly emerged H7N9 AIVs YN/21, HB/20 and SX/21 also dropped significantly, except for SX/21 which displayed only a 2 log2 reduction in HI titre. As for the GD/16 ferret serum, surprisingly, the AH/13 showed 3 log<sub>2</sub> higher HI titre than the GD/16. No significant drop in cross-reactivity was observed between the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs and the GD/16; only YN/21 showed 2 log<sub>2</sub> reduction in HI titre when compared with the GD/16. Consistent with the HI assay, the MN titre of AH/13 ferret serum to the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs and GD/16 dropped dramatically to below detection level. As to the GD/16 ferret serum, no significant difference in MN titre was observed between AH/13 and GD/16, despite the 3 log<sub>2</sub> higher HI titre found with AH/13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Though only a minor difference in HI titre was observed between GD/16 and the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs, the MN titre to the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs dropped dramatically compared with the GD/16. To conclude, the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs showed poor cross-reactivity with ferret sera raised against the WHO vaccine candidate AH/13 and GD/16, and there was discrepancy in antigenicity measured by HI and MN assay</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P11">To closely monitor the zoonotic risk of the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs, we selected three newly emerged H7N9 AIVs from different provinces of China from 2020 to 2021. Here we showed that the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs had typical AIV-like receptor binding profiles and reduced thermal stability, therefore posing a reduced zoonotic risk when compared to viruses from early epidemic waves. There was very low cross-reactivity of the newly emerged H7N9 AIV with both human mAbs isolated from humans naturally infected with H7N9 AH/13 and the ferret antisera against WHO candidate vaccines AH/13 and GD/16, highlighting the need to update the candidate vaccine strain. In addition to avian-like receptor binding profile, these newly emerged H7N9 AIVs showed increased replication fitness as evidenced by larger plaque sizes and higher replication titres <italic>in ovo</italic>. Moreover, these viruses also demonstrated reduced pH fusion thresholds, which has been shown to be essential airborne transmissibility for H9N2 and H5N1 AIVs between birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Taking all these factors into account, these newly emerged H7N9 AIVs might have increased fitness in poultry than the isolates from the early waves.</p><p id="P12">The receptor binding specificity of influenza A virus is one of the major determinants of host specificity. It is a prerequisite for pandemic viruses to switch receptor binding specificity from avian receptor α2,3-SA to human receptor α2,6-SA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Here we showed that both AH/13 and GD/16 from early H7N9 AIV epidemic waves showed binding towards both avian-like 3SLN and human-like 6SLN receptor analogues. However, among these newly emerged H7N9 AIVs, HB/20 and SX/21 completely lost the receptor binding towards human-like 6SLN receptor analogues while YN/21 showed ~39 folds of reduction in its binding towards human-like 6SLN receptor analogues when compared with AH/13. We have previously shown that the threonine at residues 125 and 151 in HA formed N-linked glycosylation motifs (N-X-T/S, where X is any amino acid other than proline) and resulted in the addition of glycan to the asparagine at amino acid residue 123 and 149 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The receptor binding assay showed that the double glycosylation at amino acids 123 and 149 of H7N9 HA are responsible for the loss of the human-like receptor binding. Here the amino acid sequence analysis showed that all the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs have threonine at residues 125 and 151 of HA and form the N-linked glycosylation motifs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, the drop in binding affinity toward human-like receptor is most probably due to the double glycosylation as a result of threonine at residues 125 and 151 in HA of all the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs. Therefore, if any amino acid change in the HA of these newly emerged H7N9 AIVs that remove the N-linked glycosylation motifs probably will enable the viruses to regain the dual receptor binding properties. On that account, the amino acid changes around amino acid residue 125 and 151 must be closely monitored for the zoonotic risk assessment.</p><p id="P13">To conclude, we selected H7N9 AIVs that are antigenic distant to the vaccine strains, which are likely to become dominant in the coming years under vaccine-induced pressure.
