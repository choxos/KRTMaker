The vaccines, including lipid-based nanoparticle mRNA, inactivated virus and recombined protein, have been used to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in clinics and are immensely helpful against the epidemic. Here, we first present an oral mRNA vaccine based on bovine milk-derived exosomes (milk-exos), which encodes the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) as an immunogen.

Still, in many cases, it progresses to a more severe disease that may include acute respiratory distress, disseminated disease, and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is a homotrimeric transmembrane glycoprotein composed of S1 and S2 subunits. When spike protein interacts with specific receptors on host cells, its receptor binding domain (RBD) is located at the C-terminus of S1 and can specifically bind to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and initiates the membrane fusion between the virus and host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Studies have shown that RBD is the main target of most of the neutralizing activity in immune serum, suggesting that RBD may be a potential target for the 2019-nCoV vaccine or therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Currently, the available platforms for COVID-19 vaccines include inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, viral vector vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). In 2021, the revenue of COVID-19 vaccine products of global key enterprises showed that Pfizer and German BioNTechnology’s mRNA vaccine revenues were 367.8 billion dollars and 213.6 billion dollars, respectively, accounting for more than half of the global vaccine market share. Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine accounted for the highest proportion because it rapidly attracted great attention and promotion for its safety, high efficiency, and short production cycles. Compared with other vaccine technology platforms, the mRNA vaccine platform also has these advantages, including 1. an excellent immune effect; 2. a short R&amp;D cycle; 3. convenient large-scale production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>); 4. no risk of infection or genome integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>); 5. the human expression system expresses antigens with good immunogenic recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>); 6 the stimulation of humoral and cellular immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>); 7. no adjuvant, and so on. However, mRNA vaccines are also flawed, with high technical barriers and delivery technology patent restrictions; they are unstable and inconvenient to preserve and transport. Traditionally, it needs an intramuscular injection and a professional operation.</p><p id="P4">Most vaccines now undergoing clinical trials are injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously, restricting immune activation to the few draining lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Oral administration is thought to have a higher safety profile, better patient compliance, and lower medical costs than injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). The difficulties of the complex gastrointestinal environment and intestinal epithelial barriers have limited the use of oral vaccines. To interact with the abundant immune cells in the lamina prima, an ideal oral vaccine must tolerate the gastrointestinal environment and overcome intestinal epithelial barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Exosomes are cell-derived, membranous vesicles present in nearly all bodily fluids. With sizes ranging between 35-120 nm in diameter, exosomes are composed of a phospholipid bilayer derived from the membrane of the cell of origin. It has recently gained attention due to its natural role of shuttling molecular cargos (e.g., DNA, small RNAs, proteins, and lipids) between distant cells in the body. It has been confirmed that bovine milk is rich in exosomes and exhibits the similar potential to serve as drug-delivery nanocarriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Milk is a more affordable and accessible source compared to cell culture media. Moreover, milk-exos may provide additional benefits as naturally desirable oral delivery carriers, which indicates that milk-exos constitute a more convenient and patient-friendly therapeutic modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Taking into account the biological properties of milk exosomes and overcoming the technological challenges of mRNA vaccines, we have currently described a method for creating milk exosomes that are loaded with RBD mRNA, evaluated their effectiveness in delivering functional mRNA, developed a novel oral vaccine technology platform based on milk exosomes and investigated the preliminary efficacy of the novel oral vaccine based on milk exosomes in mice to elicit humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Preparation of bovine milk-derived exosomes</title><p id="P6">To evaluate our preparation methods, bovine milk-derived exosomes (milk-exos) were isolated and purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation (DC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Six components were collected by DC, among which F1 was about 5 mL, and F2 to F6 were all 7 mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). To characterize the isolated milk-exos biophysically, biomarkers (CD9, TGS110), and morphology was used to determine the exosomes containing fraction. Exosomes were mainly concentrated in F3 and F4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). The morphology exhibited a rich profusion of mixed populations of exosomes with predominantly intact vesicles consistent with classical exosome-like morphology and a typical cup-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Milk exosomes are characteristic of exosomes in the range of 30-150 nm in diameter were observed in 0.95 mol/L-1.30 mol/L sucrose. As fractions 3 and 4 were enriched in exosomes, they were pooled together for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Purification and characterization of bovine milk-derived exosomes by density gradient ultracentrifugation</title><p id="P7">The morphology of pooled exosomes fraction exhibited a rich profusion of exosomes consistent with classical exosome-like morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), size distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) and protein markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). A three-way Venn diagram of proteins revealed 1022 proteins common to all datasets, and 961 proteins were commonly identified in all three DC-milk-exos, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>. Proteomics analysis of the samples showed that exosome protein lysates were prepared and verified with cluster analysis for vital exosomal membrane markers CD9, CD63, CD81, and TSG101. The absence of the microvesicle surface markers GM130 and calnexin, as well as the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker calnexin, confirmed that the isolated milk-exos were not contaminated with other multivesicular bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Three batches of bovine milk-derived exosomes obtained by density gradient ultracentrifugation (DC-milk-exos) were analyzed and indicated that there were no differences between multiple batches of DC-milk-exos.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Loading of RBD mRNA Milk derived exosomes</title><p id="P8">To determine whether DC-milk-exos could be loaded with exogenous, <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized mRNAs, we designed and synthesized a test receptor binding domain (RBD) mRNA encoding immunogenic forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. The RBD coding sequence region (CDS) is 675 base pairs (bp) long and has the FLAG tag. Examination of the <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized RBD mRNA using a bioanalyzer (Agilent) confirmed that the RBD mRNA sample ran as a single band of 1100 bps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), consistent with the size that we expected to design in vitro transcription. To assess its functionality, the RBD mRNA was transfected into 293T cells, and RBD peptide expression was interrogated the next day by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). These results indicated that RBD mRNA was synthesized according to in vitro transcription (IVT) and had a translational function that could be translated into RBD protein in cells.</p><p id="P9">To load the IVT RBD mRNA into DC milk-exos, we first mixed it with cationic lipids (DOTAP) to generate lipid mRNAs. Then we loaded the lipid-mRNA into DC-milk-exos by mixing-induced partitioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Both processes are driven by the attractive force of the charge, resulting in the encapsulation of lipid-mRNAs into Milk-exos membranes. To characterize the RBD mRNA Milk-exos biophysically, the morphology and size distribution and zeta potential analysis, were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-D</xref>). To determine the loading efficiency of this process, the products of three independent mRNA-loading reactions were examined. A TaqMan-based real-time quantitative PCR assay showed that loading efficiency reached 57.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Verification of oral vaccines for RBD mRNA-DC-milk-exos <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P10">We next tested whether Milk-exos loaded with RBD mRNA could deliver functional RBD mRNA into human cells.

Like liposomes, exosomes have a bi-lipid membrane and an aqueous core; therefore, they could potentially be loaded with hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). However, the practical application of exosome-based therapeutics in clinical transformation remained an ongoing challenge. Many studies isolated exosomes from cell culture media with a low yield and cost, making scaling-up production difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).

Although the results from this study suggested the beneficial effects of an oral vaccine for the prevention of the novel coronavirus and offered a potential regimen for clinical application, we needed to expand the number of animals and further verify the efficacy of the oral vaccine in different animal models (such as large animals) in future studies. Furthermore, the precise molecular mechanisms and safety needed to be investigated further.</p><p id="P16">Although density-gradient ultracentrifugation has been the gold standard for exosome isolation and purification, there have been several studies on the extraction of exosomes from cow’s milk using differential centrifugation alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) or precipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) techniques. In conjunction with differential centrifugation, we employed the density-gradient ultracentrifugation methods to isolate exosomes from milk that were essentially free of contamination from microvesicles. The final sample purity could reach 100%. In contrast, the technique used in this study to purify exosomes is incompatible with large-scale exosome production, which is one of the obstacles to the progress of industrialization. The good news is that we have established the chromatography-based novel manufacturing process to purify exosomes from bovine milk with better quality than production by DC (data are not shown).</p><p id="P17">It will come soon that an mRNA delivery system based on milk-derived exosomes will serve as a platform for mRNA therapeutics development in the recent future.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p id="P18">293T cells (SCSP-502) (human embryonic kidney epithelial cells) were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Typical Culture Preservation Committee, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). 293T cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/strep solution at 37 ° C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in a humidified atmosphere.

All animal experimentation was performed following institutional guidelines for animal care and use and was approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Youji (Tianjin) Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd. (IACUC-20220726-05.00). Female BALB/c mice (23~26 g, Speford, Beijing, China) were housed in a pathogen-free facility with standard conditions of temperature 24 °C, a 12-hour light/dark cycle, and food and water ad libitum. Mice were employed to study the activity of RBD mRNA-DC-milk-exos administered via duodenal injection. Mice were randomly divided into 2 groups: 1) the control group (saline, 1000 μL) (N = 3); and 2) the RBD-DC-milk-exos (0.5 mg mRNA/1000 μL) group (N = 5). All treatments were started by duodenal injection on days 1, 15, and 36. All mice were sacrificed two weeks after the last treatmen with 1% isoflurane. Blood was collected at different time points (days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49). Verification of neutralizing antibodies of the oral vaccine for SARS-CoV-2-based milk-derived exosomes <italic>in vivo</italic> was executed by ELISA analysis in serum.
